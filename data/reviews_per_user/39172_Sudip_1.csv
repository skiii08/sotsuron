E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," One of the finest films ever made.
","I think this is one of the finest films ever made. Its artistic, emotionally strong and very humane. I strongly feel that this movie did not receive the Oscar for the best film was a big mistake on the Academy's part and I feel the Academy has been particularly harsh on child actors & actresses in recognizing their talent and efforts. E.T. has not just been a children movie. It has been able to unearth some of the true feelings in our subconsciousness that we solemnly possess but hardly realize until we experience something like E.T. E.T. to me was a wonderful experience and a joy forever.",Null,0,0,9 April 2000
