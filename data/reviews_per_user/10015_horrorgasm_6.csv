Blade Runner 2049," Sucks to be you.
","I feel bad for all the older crowd that seems to have not actually watched the original since it came out, but are managing to fuel their rage entirely on the fumes of nostalgia. You people have conveniently forgotten what a slow, meandering pace the original moved at, and what a quiet, restrained performance the underdeveloped lead had in it, and etc etc. It's so disappointing to see so many people whining about things that that were the same in their beloved original, which Villeneuve seems to have taken such care to reproduce to make it feel like the same world. A wasted effort on people who are so stuck in the past, it seems. Not as bad as I feel for all the modern day ultra-short-attention- span crowd though. You bunch, who blindly, and ignorantly, went into this expecting some kind of action fest, or even worse, couldn't follow this simple story. I even see some kids trashing this while they're out there praising garbage like Suicide Squad. How depressing.",Null,97,214,8 October 2017
Knives Out," Why was this so hyped?
","I don't get all the love for this movie. I mean it certainly starts off well enough, introducing a big cast of great actors playing what look to be some pretty interesting characters, but unfortunately all these potential-filled characters fade into the background pretty quickly and the majority of the film is just the adventures of Ana De Armas and Chris Evans in what has to be one of the worst murder mysteries I've ever seen.That's huge mistake #1: Pushing the majority of the cast to the side, which not only deprives the audience of all those interesting characters, but also has the side effect of making it very obvious that all these sidelined characters are in fact not suspects at all.Huge mistake #2: The movie then shows us explicitly exactly how Christopher Plummer's character died. The mystery is ruined before it even really starts because we know already know almost everything there is to know very early on except for which member of the family somehow caused this incident, but then...Huge mistake #3: After De Armas is revealed to be the scapegoat protagonist, all of the suspects are quickly pushed aside like I said before...all except Chris Evans, the black sheep of the family who out of nowhere decides he's going to be nice and help her prove her innocence! GEE! I WONDER WHY HE WOULD DO THAT? WHO COULD THE KILLER BE I WONDER? Since these two are now almost the sole focus of the rest of the movie they are now the only two possibilities SO GEE WHICH ONE OF THEM COULD IT BE? HMMMHuge mistake #4: The finale. After we learn that the 'killer' is in fact the one painfully obvious suspect we're treated to a ridiculously contrived explanation for how the things we already know happened happened. It's so unnecessarily convoluted and changes almost nothing about what we already know happened to the victim. It's just a small, pointless piece of emotional manipulation to make us feel extra sympathy for someone who was already the sympathetic wrongly-accused-of-murder protagonist. It just feels like an empty non-twist.I give Johnson a little credit for the stylish setup and interesting cast of characters, both of which had a lot of potential, but not credit much since it's all completely wasted on a generic, predictable, bargain bin mystery with no real substance. This is a 5 or 6 out of 10 at best.",Null,5,9,21 April 2020
The Irishman," Latest entry in the Emperor's New Clothes Club
","You have to be absolutely out of your mind to legitimately think that this is Scorcese at his best and ignore all the flaws in this movie. Yes, I get it, he made a lot of great movies in his time, but this isn't one of them.A scene early on with Deniro beating someone up sums up the movie pretty well. The random no-name actor getting beat up is the only one exhibiting any emotion, as Deniro's character and his daughter sleepwalk their way through the scene like most of the cast does through most other scenes. It can be a bit hard to tell though since the camera zooms out so far that you can hardly see their faces, probably in an effort to avoid using the piss poor de-aging effects during an 'action' scene, but it doesn't much matter because it's still close enough that we can see Deniro noticeably physically struggling to get through the scene. It looks awful and its depressing to see Deniro like this and to realize that Scorcese thought this scene was ok like this (why would they not have just used a stand-in here?), and this is pretty much how the movie feels in general.This is a very noticeably weak effort from Scorcese. Most of the characters are wooden and just seem bored to be there. Pesci and Deniro are shockingly lifeless here. Pacino seems to be the only one giving any effort, but even his performance only comes off like a pale imitation of his old self.Again, the de-aging effects are very weak and it's pretty jarring to see the flashback version of Deniro's character be referred to as if he's a young man (Pesci even calls him KID), but still looks like he's about 50.There are a ton of side characters introduced, most of which disappear immediately after their introductions and serve no real purpose. Likewise there are many vestigial scenes that serve no purpose to advance either plot or character.The plot is of course your typical gangster fare that we've seen from Scorcese so many times already. Guy gets into a life of crime, rises in the ranks, gets rich and lives it up, and then everything comes crashing down because he and everyone else he knows are absolutely terrible people, blah blah blah, we've seen it all before, but you know, you take something more recent of his like The Wolf of Wall Street and even though it uses that same old formula it still manages to be interesting because the characters have such personality and style and they keep your eyes glued to the conflict even though you already know exactly where it's going.Here? Not so much. The Irishman is an absolutely unremarkable mobster story with completely forgettable characters that don't seem at all interested in their roles and some production values and cinematography that the so-called king of cinema should be embarrassed to be associated with, and let me tell you, you people defending this weak excuse for a film aren't doing Scorcese or 'cinema' any favors by blindly swallowing this crap and acting like it's the greatest thing you've ever seen. If you're so willing to suck down any product, no matter how bad, just because it has a big time famous name attached to it than you're really no better than the popcorn action movies and fans that you're so quick to condemn.As someone who's seen every Scorcese film before this, this is a 5/10 AT BEST and I will never pretend otherwise just because he did a lot of great films in the past.",Null,204,295,2 December 2019
Joker," Yikes. THIS is people's 'best movie ever'?
","The recurring themes of so many of the 10 star reviews here should tell you a lot about this movie and its audience. If you can't get through a movie review without tossing in one or more claims that 'THIS movie is so much better and smarter than YOUR superhero movie' (or even basing your entire review around this premise), then I hate to break it to you, but kid, you're nowhere near as intelligent and grown up as you think you are. This 'my comic publisher is better than yours' BS should have been left behind on your grade school playground, it has absolutely no relevance to the quality of this movie, and your opinion of this movie should be considered highly suspect if you're in this group.I gotta say, if this movie was also your idea of the most perfect film ever made, you really need to get out more. Look, I get it. If you live in a safe little box where all you watch are superhero movies and mainstream blockbusters then I understand how exposure to themes like this for the first time would seem new and exciting to you, and I think we can all agree that this is probably the best DC Comics related movie in the last decade or so (though that's not a high bar to meet) and of course Joaquin Phoenix is a very talented actor, but stop and take a step back and look at this thing.Joker does indeed present a theme that is of importance to our society, that of the neglect and demonizing of the mentally ill to a degree that sometimes creates monsters which everyone around them should have seen coming a mile away if they hadn't been too busy looking away to avoid feeling uncomfortable. Unfortunately, reminding us all of the fact that this situation still exists is all this movie really has to say. It dances around important subjects like 'HEY KIDS, CLASS INEQUALITY!', but then never offers any actual insight into them, usually because it's too busy making forced Batman references or dropping cringey little edgy moments like the 'Don't smile' sign scene which seem to have been designed solely to have something for Hot Topic to print a new t-shirt of. Between that and every single plot twist being telegraphed so very far in advance because a lot of us have seen all these exact same twists so very many times before, I just wasn't impressed.Perhaps if this had been an actual stand-alone movie of its own instead of being shackled by its completely unnecessary ties to the Batman universe it could have done something more interesting with its themes. Don't get me wrong, I don't have any problem with superhero movies, but it just feels so gratuitous here, as if someone came up with this idea, pitched it to an executive, and was told 'sounds great, but can you make it a Batman movie somehow?', and I'm sorry, but I'm just not into a movie trying to tell me a half-hearted, yet dead-serious speech about mental illness in modern society while simultaneously constantly reminding me that it's technically a superhero movie because $$$",Null,150,263,14 January 2020
Mother!," Don't listen to any of our stupid reviews, just watch it yourself.
","It's baffling to me that so many people seem to have completely missed the point of this movie. Stop. Before you start slapping me with your go-to label of 'pretentious', this is NOT a complicated movie. This isn't some David Lynch movie where every frame needs to be dissected for hidden psychological meaning. It couldn't be more simple. It's a retelling of the most commonly known Bible stories. The ones that are so common that they're comparable to knowing who Santa Claus is. You don't need to be a genius or a theology major or even to have read the Bible in full to have heard the most basic elements of the Christian creation myth such as Adam and Eve. If you feel that such an simple concept is trying to condescend to you or insult your intelligence somehow, that says a lot more about your level of intelligence and insecurity than it does about this movie. You know what intelligent people do when faced with something they don't understand? They ask questions. They seek answers. They even do something as simple as a Google search. What they don't do is lash out and mindlessly rage against something because they felt it threatened their intelligence. Let me tell you, the only thing threatening your intelligence in that situation is your behavior. If you spent half as much time just swallowing your foolish pride and looking up theories on a movie like this as you did writing a sad excuse for a review that does nothing but parade around your own willful ignorance, maybe you could have enjoyed this movie for what it was instead of making yourself miserable out of pointless stubbornness.I guess it could be worse though. You could be on the other end of the spectrum, throwing 'pretentious' at this for the opposite reason, because you think you're so far above this kind of thing, and somehow completely blind to the irony of you calling something pretentious while you preen about you're so much more clever than it. Hey, maybe throw 'self-indulgent' in there a few more times while you're at it, without ever stopping to think how ridiculous it is to use that as a derogatory term in reference to art. Only thing worse than a fool is a fool that's convinced themselves that they're clever...Anyway, watch this movie and decide for yourself. Don't let any of these misguided sourpusses with personal hang-ups lead you astray (myself included, make up your own mind). I almost listened to them and skipped this movie myself, and I would have missed out on one of the best movies of 2017.",Null,3,11,14 February 2018
Annihilation," Is someone giving all you kids crackers each time you chirp 'pretentious!'?
","You know what's adorable? If you look at the past reviews of all the people that are trashing this for being 'illogical', 'pretentious', 'nonsensical', and various petty picking apart at irrelevant technical details of this movie that they seem to be subjecting to documentary standards for some reason, some of their highest rated sci-f/fantasy movies are as follows: Guardians of the Galaxy, Mute, Star Wars, Bright, and so on (One of them has even reviewed THE EMOJI MOVIE twice as high). You kids can ignore the completely made up science in Star Wars because there's a bunch of shiny space battles distracting you, and even delude yourself into thinking that objectively poorly constructed messes like Mute and Bright are ok, but you take personal offense at silly garbage like the contents of the character's backpacks and the lack of plausibility and realistic physics in a completely fictional phenomenon here? Wow, the stench of cognitive dissonance is overpowering. Gee, but maybe if you fill your reviews up with overused smart-sounding buzzwords like 'pretentious' then we'll all think it's the movies fault and not that you just have short attention spans and a severe lack of imagination, and maybe no one will notice your histories of giving free passes to other movies that have much more serious issues because they had SPLOSIONS!",Null,3,8,18 March 2018
