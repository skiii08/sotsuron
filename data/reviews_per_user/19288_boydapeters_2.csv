Hereditary," Bit slow to get going but loved it. Great horror/ thriller
","It is definitely worth seeing. Well acted will directed will produced well-written just a good all round film.
Original with a satisfying ending (ie not ambiguous). I Can't recommend this highly enough. Hope it has good success, I expect word of mouth could be strong for this.",9,31,65,7 June 2018
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," Shows how a war film can be made
","You remember the first 5 minutes of Saving Private Ryan? Well this does that for 2 hours. Only better. And no Tom Hanks. Or Matt Damon
Great film. Must watch",9,1,1,18 March 2018
