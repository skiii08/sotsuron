The King's Speech," A Well Crafted Drama Without the Frills
","7 January 2011. A stunning movie that has no sex and little or no action or special effects? The KING'S SPEECH relies on performance and a well crafted, tightly focused script, and deliberate editing that directs the audience's attention both intimately as well as internationally on the personal drama that enveloped King George VI of Britain and his speech impediment. Unlike the psychological delusions found in the BLACK SWAN, THE KING'S SPEECH is able to capture both the intimately relational drama between two individuals while providing a tense filled context of the political and cultural environment and importance of the outcome of the King's efforts in addressing his fears. Unlike other historical pieces focused on famous leaders, YOUNG VICTORIA (2009) wasn't able to capture the cultural and political intrigue, FROST/NIXON (2008) didn't quite have the same personal demons and flawless pacing and editing, W (2008) that had a weak performance in one of its minor characters that intruded on the movie, ELIZABETH THE GOLDEN AGE (2007) that suffered from a convoluted, clumsy script and underdeveloped characters. Perhaps a good comparison would be THE QUEEN (2006) or THE LAST KING OF Scotland (2006) though the focus in more on another character than the King.",9,0,0,18 January 2019
Moneyball," A Baseball Movie That's Not About The Baseball
","26 September 2011. Surprisingly, this movie is less about the baseball game than the game of baseball. What is striking about this movie (and it's not about outs) is the raw audio sound technique used in this movie that is usually found in documentaries than feature films which helps make this movie come alive. There is a the ambiance of background sound and the echo that seems to resonate and bring the movie closer to the audience and present a much closer to realism experience. There isn't that much actual continuous footage of baseball in this movie, but rather the management of it. The heightened personal and emotional tension is carried throughout the movie and Director Bennett Miller has put together this compelling very intimate portrait of a man played by Brad Pitt and his statistician in an unusual angle of the game of baseball.Somehow the almost overly brief snippets of scenes and background of current events and story are blended together along with poignant flashbacks will edited into some meaningful, main storyline without ever creating the idea of that the additional footage has someone been shortchanged. Bennett Miller apparently in his wisdom was able to capture the primary message of the movie, developed an accompanying background, and maintained the singular story around the entire movie, the art of carefully scriptwriting and editing.Even without the formulaic all-American ending, Bennett Miller was able to wrap this movie into a complete feeling of wholeness for a feature film. Miller made excellent use of silence and editing choices in keeping the camera going just long enough for the more in-depth, substantive emotional impact of a scene to sink in. Miller seems to have brought a new found vision of a approach that brings a more connectiveness and meaningfulness to film-making, especially to interesting stories of reality that aren't even about the biggest and most momentous achievements of humanity and bringing them captivatingly to the big screen.",10,1,1,18 January 2019
The Avengers," A Disparate Collection of Super Heroes that Don't Quite Come Together
","6 May 2012. Few ensemble movies, especially superhero movies offer the balanced, cohesive narrative that make for a well edited, rich character developed, and strongly compelling storyline. Unfortunately for The Avengers, though record-breaking at the box office not withstanding, The Avengers, can at best, be considered entertaining, but is more aptly described as a rather forced piece of movie scriptwriting and directing that attempts to corral a rather disparate bunch of superheros with mixed results. Unlike the more acceptable and appealing television series ensemble of super people in Heroes (2006-2010) or even the more enjoyable animated feature film of super family members in The Incredibles (2004), and the funny team of disparate members including the straight man (female) Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis in Ghostbusters (1984), The Avengers awkwardly introduces its Superheroes almost in sequel form, some with even chaotic brief flashbacks, that results in an uneasy alliance that feels quite uncomfortable as if the Jess Whedon himself was having trouble with his dialogue between the superheroes. As an example, Gwyneth Paltrow, unlike Rick Moranis in Ghostbusters (1984) is never given the opportunity to really have a solid place in the movie. And even the highly praised performance of Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk, even this bi-polar identity is left in doubt as The Hulk is presented as two different personas, earlier in the movie as this Beast and then later somewhat more questionable as this conscientious animal (which as an animal is quite unlikely a transformation). There is an apparent imbalance in the presentation among Ironman and Captain America and Thor. X-Men (2000), Fantastic Four (2005), and Star Trek (2009) all have a much more polished set-ups between their disparate ensemble characters. Instead Joss Whedon has introduced dollops of solid stand-up comic one-liners and humor that seems pretentious clever cover-ups even as they hit home. Unlike his own previous ensemble work in the well received Buffy: The Vampire Slayer (1997-2003) and Angel (1999-2004) series, here Joss Whedon is seemingly unable to recapture the same smooth but edgy magic as those earlier television series. The storyline also seems to veer in several isolated superhero scenes that make the overall rhythm and flow of the story rocky in its depiction on the screen, there seems too many characters and too many simultaneous events going on at the same time, almost more the actor script contractual obligations of screen time rather than for the integrity of the story itself. Inception (2010) probably includes some of the best integrated separate story lines that are presented simultaneously in its unique movie within and movie within a movie technique or Pulp Fiction (1994), Traffic (2001) and The Air I Breathe (2007) interweave several plot strands in a nicely, enriched presented fashion. It is apparent that some efforts at making this movie stand out with a few enhancements in special effects (like the destruction scene shot from the perspective of one of the vehicles being hurdled in the maelstrom) and several minutes of dialogue of lofty sounding metaphysical and emotional depth, yet the overall impact is more superficial without the emotive and intellectual probing found in even more singularly focused superhero movies as Green Lantern (2011), Elektra (2005), Spiderman 2 (2004) or Spiderman 3 (2007). Of particularly, note it almost seems like the news media has been influenced by over-reporting the critical acclaim of this movie as Metacritic rates it only a 69 which while good isn't really outstanding by any means, contributing to a rather false marketing effort in itself suggesting that some movie critics are in league with the movie industry itself.",7,0,0,17 January 2019
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Fun and Entertaining
","27 December 2007. Safe fun entertainment where people don't get killed, just cars and so forth. The thrills and chills are little less potent, the jokes a bit too cute, and Ed Harris' character is a little ambiguous by the end as if Harris is getting a little tired of the stereotype he has played in movie after movie. There is some drama, though perhaps not enough and the funny comedy doesn't always seem to balance the adventure aspect. Overall, though the movie was enjoyable, fun, a thrill ride if not completely transporting into the Indiana Jones realm. Boring it was not, but a bit manipulative, not as edgy, not as dramatic as it could have been. A nice way to keep the Christmas winter blues away in the end.

Blade Runner 2049," A Captivating Extended Movie Torn between Mystery and Romance
","8 October 2017. This sequel to the original 1982 Ridley Scott's now classic Blade Runner offers the same mystery thriller sci fi theme that didn't really inspire a lot of initial interest in the original movie. Apparently director Denis Villenueve's Blade Runner version has also encountered some popular audience resistance and the slightly lower female rating as did Ridley Scott back in 1982. There is considerable less action involved in this release as compared to the more popular mainstream movies receiving much bigger box office receipts. Lost is the typical film noir voice-over narrative that was a problem for a number of people, including Harrison Ford, of the 1982 original theatrical release. However, there probably still exists a minority of people who prefer the film noir element of detective voice over of the 1940s, allowing the audience to get into the mental experiences going on with the lead character, including the imagined dialogue of an audio version of reading from a book or text.Many of the sci fi robotic concepts incorporated into this movie have had their presentation in a number of much earlier sci fi movies, particularly dealing with the human brain, emotions, memories. Russell Crowe's hologram turned real in Virtuosity (1995), Cherry 2000 (1987) the female robotic companion of David Andrew's character that he believes he wants to repair her damaged central processing unit to keep what close relationship he had, Kurt Russell's engineered and programmed human to become the perfect human weapon in Soldier (1998), and even Peter Weller in Robocop (1987) and Robert John Burke in Robocop 3 (1993) as well as D.A.R.Y.L. (1985) about a robotic boy and blurring between human and robot in Making Mr. Right (1987). Yet what seems to distinguish and sets this robotic or synthroid themed movie apart is the integration between a hologram and a robotic entity in both visual as well as acted portrayal. The dazzling and fascinating fusion of electronic interfacing in one of the movie's delicate sequences of awesomeness.While it is likely that many in the audience will find the outstanding visual effects on par or even more dazzling and powerful as the original and as found in Interstellar (2014) with its water and ice planets or scientifically accurate display of a black hole, the megacity features of the multitude of decrepit futuristic housing or bleak, haunting, hostile landscapes of Blade Runner 2049 appear like Sean Penn's beautiful but 'pretentious' landscape imagery found in Into the Wild (2007). What director Denis Villenueve has introduced into his Blade Runner movie is a tribute to both the Ridley Scott's visionary imagery as well as an over-emphasis on visual design by turning it into a primary character of the movie instead of a background palette upon which to tell and to complement the story.What is really fascinating about the script is how much Blade Runner 2049 is much like the original except that its perspective could be viewed more from a replicant's point of view instead of the hunter or detective point of view by the time the movie is over. Villenueve's movie is even more dark and somber than the original, more grittier with a similar context as Daniel Craig gets to portray James Bond in the more contemporary Casino Royale (2006) from his earlier incarnations. Ultimately, it is harder to connect deeply and consistently with the emotional turmoil underlying this movie as it is also focused on a mystery. Unlike The Machine (2013), Her (2013) or Transcendence (2014) the canvass on which Blade Runner 2049 is presented is so much larger that the opportunity for a consistent, extended intimate and evolving engagement on an interpersonal level is somewhat diminished.",9,3,16,9 January 2019
Angels & Demons," Exciting Action and Suspense
","15 May 2009. With time, a second reflection on this movie, reveals an ending series of sequences that is much more consistent with the spectacular and the nexus between science and religion and the motivation of the Conclave's Pontiff's decision-making steps that it takes towards the end of the movie. The balance of climatic fireworks and the rather more than usual mundane storyline of a symboligist makes for a much more dramatic and reasoned and authentic piece of work that is able to remain compelling nevertheless, making this movie all the more impressive than originally met the eye, perhaps reaching the boundaries of a classic.May 15, 2009 - Except for an ending twist that really feels unnecessary and manipulative, this sequel has suspense, action, thrills, and chills in a low-tech manner. It brings out both irritation and frustration that by the end is redeemed with satisfaction and mostly acceptance. For critics that find this movie empty-headed, without depth or substance, most action thrillers are similar, great or terrible. The Rock or Transformers. What sets this movie apart, and decently above average is its ability to leave Tom Hank's character as Robert Langton as no superhero with special abilities or powers but an intelligent man who is able to perceive symbols. Unlike most action adventure movies, Tom Hanks and his female sidekick do no more or less than they are able which is plenty. The movie contains scenes that drive one to infuriating frustration by the awfulness of what's occurring but it sure makes the ultimate climax all that more exhilarating. While not a classic, perhaps not even a great movie, this action adventure is decent, has great suspense and thrills and chills that rival such movies as Hannibal, Silence of the Lambs. The pseudo-climax is actually some of the best special effects, literally exploding on the screen. This intellectual movie with action is in the league of National Treasure and Nicholas Cage but with a more sophisticated and oddly enough a stronger emotionally faith-based, not fantasy-based basis for appreciation. 8/10.",8,0,0,20 January 2019
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Easily One of the Best Movies of 2004
","18 April 2004. Less violence, more character - Volume 2 goes where most movie dare not tread - character development and slow-moving dialogue with a superb David Carradine in a Best-Supporting Actor performance working with an amazing script and subtle complex series of acting and expressional, mysterious, ominous wit. Uma Thurman explodes onto the screen with full facial exposure in black and white as well as color. The plot-twists abound, the world is turned upside down in both silence and loud crashing drama, in pitch darkness and blazing heated fury.The old style Western movie music, the samurai Japanese style genre, the humor, the violence all are blended, folded and fused into a perfect piece of cinema that throws the whole direction of Volume One into another dimension. This powerfully emotional, sometimes funny drama, action, mystery, martial arts genre bursts through into a new creative, cinematic experience. Unleashed from the prior expectations and assumption of Volume 1, this movie both irritates, frustrates and re-directs its focus into another world of 'Kill Bill' with its refocused emphasis and toned down sword play and more cerebral manifestation of dialogue and careful, singular artistry of martial arts.Oscar nominations for Kill Bill Volume 2 (best picture) Quentin Tarantino (best director & writing) Uma Thurman (best actor & writing) David Carradine (bestsupporting male performance) Michael Madsen (best supporting male performance) Robert Richardson (best cinematography) and Oscar nominations for sound and film editing",9,1,2,25 January 2019
First Man," A big screen display of this epic historical event
","Ryan Gosling, a pretty sure bet for an Oscar nomination for director and his movie for cinematography, editing, and sound. Ryan has elevated the art of film-making with large close ups, a fusion of documentary style photography along with an authentic loud crisp sound design. He has borrowed some of the class elements of photography, sound, and music from Stanley Kubrick's sci fi classic 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). There are also some film techniques that lifted the sci fi space epic Interstellar (2014) directed by Christopher Nolan to another realm of true authentic realism. And more intriguing his Ryan's decision to use a naturalistic approach to his directing reminiscent of Lars von Trier's sci fi drama Melancholia (2011). The only weaknesses in this movie were perhaps the inevitable and unavoidable difficulty of providing sufficient background explanations and allowances for the sudden transitions occurring with gaps as years are necessarily skipped. The density and storyline was probably more than enough for a television event covering four or seven six hours worth of material, but the little screen would have been too dimunitive for the amazing impact of the big screen display of this epic historical event.",9,0,2,28 January 2019
The Legend of Bagger Vance," A Prelude to A Rivers Run Through It
","18 September 2006. In this nice run up to Redford's 'A River Runs Through It,' (1992) this movie has some brilliant flashes of cinematography and photography that would become Redford's classic environmental essence found in the fly fishing movie two years later. Unfortunately, this golf movie is burdened by an unnecessary character in the form of a small boy who apparently narrates the movie in a voice-over as a old man flashback (played by Jack Lemmon). The focus on the essential characters was deluded and even the focus on the essence of golf sent off course abit by the use of this technique. The movie might have been more effective had like in Titanic (1997), the narrative have come from one of the main characters such as Adele (played by Charlize Theron) in her old age. There is a fascinating, quiet scene on the golf course with only the sound of birds and the crisp air that brings the pleasure and nature of golf closer to the audience than any narrative or dialogue or even acting performance. Unfortunately, the movie was cut short by the inclusion of the additional character. Seven out of Ten Stars.",7,0,1,22 January 2019
Black Swan," Absorbing and Captivatingly Brilliant
","2 January 2011. Perhaps the best movie of 2010, this psychological drama set in the ballet milieu presents the audience with a brilliant, striking, haunting and intense personal drama of one female ballerina's attempt to be the lead in Swan Lake. Natalie Portman, as Nina, must contend with her own inhibitions and fears as the audience must confront their own prejudices and bias regarding movie character stereotypes. In many ways, Nina's journey parallels many of our own fears and imagined monsters. With only three apparent possible editing or directorial alternatives (the selection of the female lead and the biting of the mouth timing, the shot selection for the perceptual view of the rehearsing (unlike Chorus Line), and the murder scene that didn't seem to quite have the clarity of character persona transformation and credibility), this amazing personal almost mature David Lynch-like presentation makes Blawk Swan a voyage of discovery and layered emotional and psychological density the most absorbing, powerful movie of the year.",9,1,1,18 January 2019
Changeling," A Remarkably Frustrating and Brilliant Film
","19 February 2009. 'Changeling' is easily the most ambitious and dramatic movie of the year (2008) in which the subject matter, the plot all conspire to make this movie almost unwatchable but captivating at the same time. Watching the movie is almost like having to sit through two solid hours of the emotionally intense but upsetting television action-thriller '24.' The frustration of the disbelief that 'bad' guys get away with so much, that the primary female protagonist comes across, especially for the first two-thirds of the movie, a wimp, a weakling that the movie becomes almost unbearable to watch. 'Changeling' raises a fascinating conundrum of whether the unsettling feelings about a movie, particularly this movie are because of its inferior weak qualities or whether it is in fact the fascination of the authenticity of the plot and characters. There are a few problems with the movie, the first having to do with the two week jump between Angelina Jolie's character's son's disappearance and the next scene that skips over the initial behavior and reactions of Jolie as a mother and the police department, supposedly crucial moments in any kidnapping incident. The second is after the movie is over, Angelina Jolie's character is strangely still underdeveloped in that the audience never really is provided much in the way of who this person is, no background, no backstory, no real understanding of who and why this person does specifically what she does. This absence serves to somehow distance the audience from the primary character of the movie. Finally, one of the musical selections that keeps getting played over and over towards the end of the movie just doesn't seem to fit in the the emotionality of the scenes, almost a happy, reminiscent tonal quality instead of the more melancholy melody. Nevertheless, this movie presents several major and fantastic plot sequences each and any of which could have easily been devoted to a single movie themselves. The kidnapping, the police cover-up, the mental health institution - with flashbacks to another movie Jolie starred in 'Girl, Interrupted', 1999 where she won an Oscar for best supporting actress - the criminal search, the trial, the continued search. What was also amazing was Angelina Jolie's performance, that felt real (no superhero antics), the set design, and even several of the musical melodies were just set on period perfect. Clint Eastwood's moody direction was haunting, scary, thrilling in the right moments as well as uplifting (the last hour) without getting gaudy. Overall, this movie was an incredible, if not complicated experience - one of the most difficult emotionally and logically to judge as a movie because the line between the performances and story entered into one's own emotional beliefs and feelings and investiture.

Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Slow and Strained But Gets Stronger Along The Way
","20 May 2011. The dialogue and that plot in the beginning and throughout the movie seems to ooze with a scriptwriter under pressure to create a blockbuster movie and the dialogue and plot seemed strained to do so. The first half of the movie seemed to drag interspersed with the requisite action scenes which have particular merit in their captivating novelty. There are sparkled throughout a few one-liner gems that sometimes though seem to be thrown out to help carry the rest of the movie. By the last half, a fascinating dynamic and relational subplot occurs that at times seem to overshadow the main storyline. Nevertheless, the original discovery towards the end of the movie and the role of Spanish are tweaked in a way that makes for a more substantive movie. Overall, the movie is decent, but at times strained by the need to compete with its predecessor's success.",7,0,0,18 January 2019
Men in Black 3," A Strong Basic Plot With Benefits
","27 May 2012. The basic premise of this story with its unexpected dark but at the same time light twist at the end was a scene to be savored along with a new trans-temporal personality make for a great entertaining show. The third time out, the emotional heart of this movie is in even greater display, Josh Brolin following up with another strong performance from his earlier W. (2008) portraying former President George W. Bush along with a nice dramatic dual relationship between agent J. and K. There are the same nice one-liners, along with the dry humor. Somehow off putting was the striking portrayal of violence at the beginning of the movie and Tommy Lee Jone's appearance at the beginning of the movie that seemed strikingly older and weathered, and in some ways tired performance which after the first scene picked up greatly into his smooth Agent K. Emma Thompson, as Agent O for all of her star charisma seemed somewhat underdeveloped and under-scripted, an opportunity lost. Nevertheless this was a solid movie with the action, humor, and compelling storyline making for a fun, enjoyable movie, one worth the money. Certainly no disappointment at all.",8,0,1,17 January 2019
Frost_Nixon," A Compelling Fascinating Look Behind The Scenes
","15 January 2009. What's powerful about this movie is the story of how this momentous interview even came about and Nixon's purportedly insightful and extended response to Frost's question about President Nixon's involvement in a crime and the consequences of his actions on the public. Unlike the trailers, the movie is more about the immense difficulties that led up to the actual interview and the powerful and emotional look at the former President, the human face. Nevertheless, there were areas of the movie that appeared to detract from the full impact of this amazing journalist event. Earlier on, there were a number of humorous bits of funny scenes and then they suddenly disappeared from the rest of the movie, the pseudo-documentary format, particularly in the beginning was jarring and strangely appeared to lend less credibility to the movie (more like a docudrama than either a documentary or drama), the Frank Langella's gait, posture appeared at times to be sort of an aped, artificial caricature of the President than the real thing, and finally there were some confusing ambiguous timelines and editing selections that appeared to interfere the pacing and understanding of what was happening in the movie midway through the movie. Overall, this movie was a strikingly informative, revealing look at the precarious nature of this important news event and the human face behind it. Eight out of Ten Stars.",8,0,0,20 January 2019
Walk the Line," A Good Sanitized, Choppy Biopic
","27 November 2005. This movie could have been so much better. While containing some great scenes, overall this biopic had a rough, uneven, choppy beginning with editing, continuity, and pacing problems that raised more questions about the script/plot than answers, leaving a lot of interesting transition questions lingering. The important relationships between father and son weren't strong. The way June Carter's role was presented in the movie almost screamed for having more emphasis placed on her life story as well (which occurred somewhat and belatedly later in the film). We seen Johnny Cash go from going fishing, suddenly working with his brother. We see Johnny Cash looking at a guitar and then suddenly later with a guitar. We never see how Johnny Cash learned to play, how he developed his music. The first half of the movie is composed of just snap shots of supposedly important events that never really provide a smooth and continuous understanding of Mr. Cash's early life story. We never seen if his tour with June Carter continued or stopped when she threatened to quit. Mr. Carter's dalliances were softened into suggestive affairs.Several great scenes included his fight with his wife that was actually one of the few gritty, graphic cinematographic change ups with photographic camera technique. His scene in at the cafe counter with June Carter, his scene with breaking up the sink are classic dramatic performances.There was good material, the music and singing delightful, but overall, the movie never obtained the greatest that a better script and selective directorial approach could have inspired.

Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A Tasteless, Cruel Movie
","16 December 2006. This mediocre Jamie Kennedy Experiment movie version combined with a poor parody of a Blair Witch Project-like docu-mockery contains offensive, racist commentary. What could have been an effective, informative documentary made with a running time of only an hour was extended to questionable production values and demeaning cultural themes. Except for a nice African American and an escort female scene, the movie appears to be a manipulative attempt to cash into the reality television fad and the teenage propensity for tasteless sex and vulgar performance acting, treating many of its uninformed characters to humiliation with disgusting results.

Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," An Entertaining Cinematic Delight
","17 December 2011. Guy Richie's risky photographic approach to this movie really shines somehow and even the over the top comedy like with the butler seems to fit nicely into the overall tone of action, intelligent humor, and mental twists and turns that consistently underlie Sherlock Holme's character. Like a Bourne movie plot twist in the movie, this Sherlock script also puts the audience at a sudden emotional tailspin and successfully uses the off balance of life and death to creep into the movie late making for a surprising suspenseful and even at times scary compelling experience. Richie has successfully introduced a new level of slow motion action to good effect along with a color scheme and set design that seems off but captures the period feel of the movie well. Like 3-D and Avatar, Richies introduces a new fresh and exciting look to the period and action movie that would have easily become a stupid and cheap looking feature film.",8,1,2,18 January 2019
The Monuments Men," A competent but uneven movie
","Directed by George Clooney who also starred and included Matt Damon, John Goodman, and Cate Blanchett, this movie inspired by the World War II allied effort to save invaluable art treasures that the Nazi's had stolen, has trouble with its overall tone. It has very poignant moments especially over the dramatized risk of the soldiers took in saving their valued treasures as well as a sensitive subplot between one male soldier and a French woman. Unlike The Great Escape (1963), this World War II movie doesn't seem to find its balance between comedy and drama in either its direction and musical selection.

","27 December 2008. This attempts to replicate and dramatize the real life story of the miracle U.S. Hockey Team's win over the Soviets in the 1980 International Olympic Games at Lake Placid, New York. However, while captures some interesting highpoints, the movie strangely misses the personal stories, the emotionally compelling human interest that defines the unique, memorable personalities of this real human drama. In a paradox, the real life coach Herb Brook's story of unifying a young team of individual hockey players resulted in just that, a movie about a team, not about interesting personalities and stories that interest. The movie's potential to help capture the thrill of this historic moment was diminished somewhat by the more traditional photography with only glimpses of genuine interesting historic tidbits.",6,0,3,20 January 2019
Mission: Impossible III," Good but Unachieving

The sound and special effects were decent. Nevertheless, the magic of the original Mission Impossible television series continues to be neglected for the most part the the plot suffers as a result. The climax of the movie also seemed weakened by the lack of screen time and character development offered to Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Thus this supposed summer blockbuster while entertaining and thrilling misses the apex of its swinging mark. Seven out of Ten Stars.",7,1,1,22 January 2019
Captain Phillips," A Fine Presentation With Pacing Issues
","20 October 2013. There's seemingly a fine line between authentic portrayal and dramatic pacing and with Captain Phillips, the problem, and perhaps the only one, seems to be that authentic portrayal won out much more than the pacing so that the captivating elements of the movie were not always consistently presented. The beginning and especially the ending of the movie, one of the most penetratingly intriguing scenes in film, another Tom Hanks' Saving Private Ryan (1998) moment featured at the end of that movie, were compellingly presented in their almost vicarious, documentary style that brought the audience into a vividly convincing world, almost as if one were watching a real world quality homemade film capturing real living of particular interest on screen. Yet like a homemade movie, there were moments that seemed to stall and lose their energetic vitality so that the editing just didn't allow the audience to maintain that zestful interest throughout the movie. Even a movie based on a true events such as Fly Away Home (1996) or the fictional dramatic documentary style presentation of sci-fi horror Apollo 18 (2011) had a continuous flow to their presentations. Even as long ago as the 60s, Milton Krasner was nominated for best black and white cinematography for Fate Is The Hunter (1964) a pseudo-documentary style of an investigation into a major airline crash that presented its material in a well edited, serious, but well-paced fashion. Other well edited and audience-friendly paced movie of Captain Phillip's likeness might be United 93 (2006), the military drama Jarhead (2005), and Munich (2005), even Argo (2012). What does really shine about this movie is its focus on the primary characters and the psychological interaction and the natural ambiance about the entire movie making this authentic presentation much more meaningful and penetrating for the audience.",8,0,0,16 January 2019
Sucker Punch," Exciting and surprisingly dark and serious fusion genre movie
","This exciting and surprisingly dark and serious fusion genre contains sparkling and engaging elements of several popular movies. There is the set stark retro design and plot flavor of Sin City (2005), the elegant sadistic gender dominance of Point of No Return (1993), the fantasy images of Big Trouble In Little China (1986), the female warrior of Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), the dazzling effects of Inception (2010), and the moral taste of Cube Zero (2004). This is a feminine version of Brazil (1985) that captures the humanity and empathy of their female existence along with the imaginative interactive bonding of superheroes against a male crafted universe. The movie is both melancholy and hopeful at the same time but with several gyrating twists. Sucker Punch deserves its own place in filmy history for its female vision and self-empowerment and yet there is also an undercurrent of sacrifice and a sorority of sisters of sorts.",8,1,2,28 January 2019
The Finest Hours," A Slow Methodical Action Thriller
","14 September 2016. This slower paced action thriller doesn't quite have the intensity as its similar predecessor as The Perfect Storm (2000). This mostly by the numbers action thriller has it all though, the girl, the struggle against the elements and yet for all the histrionics the movie isn't has dramatic or epic as Titanic (1997). Perhaps, its the difficulty of transferring the real life story onto the screen in a way that maintains the authentic story of what happened and at the same time include the dramatic flourishes. Maybe its just the unbelievability of the plot points. Or maybe because of the imbalance between not a lot going on at times and the crush of too many things going on at other times. The movie however does proceed point to point, including all the requisite emotions, good guys, bad guys, romance even while there is for some reason distance between the characters. Unlike actually experiencing the involvement in the movie, the audience is more of a passive spectator unswept by the action-thrillers being presented.",7,0,0,12 January 2019
3:10 to Yuma," Nice But Not Great
","13 October 2007. 3:10 To Yuma tries but doesn't quite succeed in being great. The lines, the plot, and acting all seem to call out for increased applause and appreciation because of the nice flourishes and added touches that make this movie rise above many others. Russell Crowe's character Ben Wade has suggestive resemblances to the most famous of criminal heros - Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lector but never quite becomes that evil person we would like to take home with us, except by the end his character seems to decompensate and fracture into a somewhat confusing and perhaps too American movie studio caricature that loses a lot of its authentic appeal. The plot is strong, except with glaring flaws, such as when one counts the number of characters that Ben Wade is forced to kill later in the movie, two instead of three. Or when there is a stagecoach fire and no one appears to be screaming. There are number of overly convenient contrivances introduced in this movie in order to supposedly improve the movie but instead seem more artificially imposed on the story, particularly where and what happens when Ben Wade briefly escapes. There were even more opportunities for the script to have become even more edgy and emotionally compelling, like when Ben Wade's band of outlaws shoots some people in cold blood later in the movie that emotionally diminished one of the most important scenes in the movie where Dan Evans played by Christian Bale has to make a crucial decision regarding what he was going to do with Ben Wade. There is also a scene where Dan Evans's son, William Evans played by Logan Lerman, who comes to the rescue a number of times and one scene where he confronts Ben Wade and it is resolved in a fashion that appears too pedestrian without the sort of Ben Wade panache that would have been more likely to have been on display. Overall, this movie retains good pacing, nicely developed plot situations, consistency, and compelling emotional intensity while at the same time retaining a human sensitivity often lost among Westerns. This Western feels like a new and improved version of the genre, yet it failed to succeed in making it to the breakthrough that the producers, writers, and director sought.

The Equalizer," A More Deliberate Jason Bourne
","13 May 2017. Teddy, the cold and sinister character, in The Equalizer played by Marton Csokas had a similar role as a polished and sophisticated professional in The Bourne Supremacy (2004) facing Matt Damon's famous elite and dangerous Bourne character. The Equalizer has similar elements of the Bourne series with its carefully choreographed physical scenes and relational interactions. Yet Denzel Washington is offered secretive role playing an even more common place character who only become even more creative in his use of every day instruments.The is slow to build and the Denzel's character is allowed time to develop along with the simply, normal everyday series of regular business day job activities and a somewhat obsessive-compulsive night light routine of staying up late and reading books at an all night café. In the Asian movie fashion, Denzel's character is faced with a moral dilemma of becoming who he was and placing himself in danger and watching the innocent be abused and maimed for their desire to be what they want.By movie's end, there is a surge of violence in intense but singular doses unlike the continuing big explosions and multiple slaughter on screen. Instead there is a deliberate and calculated almost methodical approach to a sort of moral physical justice that offers up one origination story for the original 1985 television series. The focus of this movie is not so much on the spectacular special effects but a more cool sophisticated use of lethal behavior similar to Liam Neeson's earlier Taken (2008).",8,0,0,11 January 2019
Source Code," A Surprisingly Touching Human Sci Fi Movie
","3 April 2011. While a number of critics may refer back to the comedy fantasy classic GROUNDHOG DAY (1993) for comparison purposes for its spin on repeating the same event over and over again, an over-reliance to this movie for a comparison isn't as valuable as it might be as GROUNDHOG DAY in a number of ways excels in its detail and script in using the apparent paradox of having to relive the same moment over and over again to better effect. Probably a better sci fi comparison for this movie would be last year's INCEPTION and even CUBE ZERO (2004) as they have much more relevant and similar psychological elements both apparently sinister and underlying surface suspense as well as what really was captured well in both other movies and what is surprising in this movie - a surprising emotional, relational depth and resonance that was particularly difficult considering the limited room for relational development in the movie. There was a hope before the movie was experienced that some of the intelligent and crisp action from THE BOURNE IDENTITY might surface but it really didn't appear in this movie. Overall this movie provides a satisfying, thrilling, entertaining movie-going experience for the times.",8,1,1,18 January 2019
Skyfall," Tired and Worn Out
","9 November 2012. This latest Daniel Craig and M movie is long as expected but the attempt at Sean Connery's version of Never Say Never Again (1983) doesn't have the same level of panache, and the attempt to humanize Bond doesn't ring through with all the fireworks and explosions that attempt to dazzle and delight. There are too many plot flaws, such as when Bond is able to negotiate getting back on the train without any trouble, or when M is conveniently without any protection. The crisp, intellectual and rapt focus of Bourne Supremacy (2004) is lost her, especially with the emotive human tragedy subplot themes. Oddly enough this latest Bond movie is both coldly cerebral even though much effort is made to bring back the Roger Moore's Bond humor and the intimate emotional connection seems distant and the demise of one of the femme fatales is really almost an afterthought. There is the remake of Total Recall (2012) location in an decrepit run-down.In short this version has neither the sizzle nor the humanity that the director and scriptwriter attempted to bring to this movie. This somewhat predictable and pseudo-Predator (1987) low-tech vs. high tech seems to be stitched together scenes that are more warmed over from other movies as well as stretching into new action scenes that just don't resonate with intrigue nor excitement.",6,3,6,17 January 2019
50 First Dates," A Different, Enjoyable Movie
","6 July 2004. After a rather lame beginning that reflects the old Adam Sandler's more obnoxious character that he was well noted for, the movie eventually settles down to a rather innovative, creative, entertaining movie that captures the lovely and seasoned acting of Drew Barrymore and a maturing comedian Adam Sandler. While not much in the way of character depth nor real substance, this lightweight but clever movie plays on Groundhog Day and other Momento devices that contribute to a rather fun and enjoyable movie.Hopefully Drew will begin to expand on her future roles and Adam will begin to enter into a Tom Hanks, Robin Williams maturity phase that will really demonstrate what Adam is made of.",7,1,1,25 January 2019
The Young Victoria," A Strong Presentation but Lacking Depth
","19 June 2010. Perhaps it's not so much the script, director, or actors, it's more likely that Queen Victoria herself is to blame for the impossibility of any movie to truly depict the grand scope and breadth of her transition to and reign as the Queen of England. Somehow YOUNG VICTORIA seems diminished and small compared to the awe and Majesty of the real reign. While YOUNG VICTORIA provides a small glimpse into the fascinating political intrigue with fine, unspoken nuance and Emily Blunt dazzles with her innocence and solid performance, the movie fails an epic, too short on matters of consequence and the truly great events that unfolded during Queen Victoria's reign. Many of the noble and worthy events that provided the Queen with her greatest were given to ending footnotes in the backwash of history.",8,0,0,18 January 2019
Catch Me If You Can," One of the Best Dramas with Humor
","29 December 2002. This is one of the best dramas I have seen that incorporates humor. While audiences have been offered horror genres that have humor and comedies that have dramatic elements, Catch Me If You Can is one of the few dramas I have come across that includes a wry sense of humor that isn't tacky or add-ons. Christopher Walken delivers a great performance and a real award-winning performance. The editing and the placement of scenes in flashback fashion is timely. This really is a feel good movie with substance, with real drama. This is entertainment at its finest. DiCaprio is making the transition from Titanic in grand fashion and making a statement that his earlier performance wasn't a one time deal. He must have a fabulous agent. Now only if Tom Hanks had an accent that was...different in the movie.",8,2,4,26 January 2019
Iron Man 3," An Enhanced Super Hero Experience That Just Misses Being A Classic
","5 May 2013. Enhanced with a decent and by now mainstream 3-D experience that still doesn't quite bring in the complete visceral experience and a subliminal psychological incorporation of the Jaws (1975) audience identification storyline that pulls on the American public's patriotism echoing the recent Olympus Has Fallen (2013) espionage-terrorist genre along with a huge enjoyable Ben Kingsley twist, this superhero action-thriller explodes on the screen. Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark's character continues it deepening layered personality, exposing more humiliation and humanism that Jennifer Garner's character reflected so well in Elektra (2005).The movie is somewhat dependent on its technical photographic 3-D special effects for part of its presentation and it suffers somewhat in its lack of complete immersion into the clarity and focus on all its elements (either the technology is not quite there yet or more money and time needed to be expended), thus the rich density while enhanced doesn't quite match up with a movie such as Hugo (2011) for its qualitatively superior 3-D presentation.Iron Man 3 continues to improve with its further inclusion in its storyline stronger emotional relational elements to balance the movie's action sequences offering this movie a more human component than say the more consistently fast-paced suspense ridden Speed (1994) or the tech-intelligent and slick sci fi thriller Déjà Vu (2006) though not as substantively strong or conflicted as found in Spiderman 2 (2004), Spiderman 3 (2007) or even The Incredibles (2004), Bolt (2008), or The Dark Knight Rises (2012).The storyline is somewhat spoiled by its overly ambitious inclusion of cute lines and characters that reflect it attempt at audience identification with the everyman or everyboy characters in the movie from the over the top comedic television producer or the small town boy even though it might capture the enlarged audiences interest and appreciation of the movie. The Green Lantern (2011) excelled by incorporated instead an everyman as its principle character played by Ryan Reynold for the audience to identify as well as a much more subtle use of rich humor so as to avoid having to use secondary characters to obtain a similar effect or some more obvious and standard manipulation for laughter, The Green Lantern's entire movie was focused on the mass audience instead of the smaller elite population.",8,1,1,17 January 2019
Marie Antoinette," A Contemporary Vision of Marie
","9 April 2007. Unfortunately, this stunning 'Lost in Translation' version of Marie Antoinette suffers from a discordant musical soundtrack that while commendable, doesn't always sync with the feel of the visual components of the movie and the photography while appealing most of the time is sometimes distractively different to the point of feeling amateur. Overall though Sofia Coppola has successfully brought to the screen a visceral and delightful vision of contemporary update using music and an informal vibrant look behind the real personages of this era. There are brilliant scenes and performances that capture an authentic experience of real conversations, real feelings and the difficult transition between Austrian and French cultures.

The Ring," Not Scary But Really Intense
","18 October 2002. I can't really describe The Ring as a horror movie, it's more like a mystery thriller with a paranormal twist. Unlike the average horror movie, this movie takes a much more serious tone, using little violence and gore. The movie wasn't that scary, but instead it contained a continuous undertone of heavy-leadened dread, like a nightmare from which you can't wake up. There were a number of excellent moments of fright, well done, suspenseful. On the whole, the movie was consistent in its plot, made reasonable sense and had a good twist at the end. There were also some exotic, original images (reminiscent of good indpendent movies). While the movie would have been even better if it could have scared us as much as a creepy Blair Witch Project, it had an even better intelligent storyline and emotional undertone. Movie's ultimate resolution, however, was implicitedly unsettling for those of the audience that think the whole storyline through, perhap even repulsive. Eight out of ten.",8,0,0,27 January 2019
Stop-Loss," Nice Effort But Can't Quite Succeed
","11 April 2008. There are some good moments in this Anti-War movie but there are some technical problems and a less than superb script, plot. The MTV inserts at the beginning with musical video segments of the war seem more disruptive and unnecessary (at least to the older generation) and furthermore than fade out and aren't used in the last two-thirds of the movie. There are some editing problems, in at least two places (a brief shot of writing on a pad and the cut to father and then son later in the movie seems out of sync). The cinematography varies, especially at the beginning portion of the movie that don't seem to serve much purpose. There appears to be too much effort to dramatize and reduce the complexity of reality into various two-dimensional characters representative of several archetypes of the sick and wounded coming out of the Iraq conflict. And the ending is perhaps too pat or too conveniently American. Nevertheless through out the movie there are some strong scenes, some riveting experiences of the conflict in Iraq and at home. The relationships in the movie are decent, especially the female/male relationships handled much more realistic than most movies. Unfortunately, this movie never quit offers up enough character development, relational backstory, and for the ending enough of an understanding explanation that is instead sort of the cop-out twist ending that fails to really satisfy.

United 93," Realistic and Serious on Terror
","30 April 2006. The best 2006 movie yet, United 93 is gritty, raw, and real in the acting and particularly the sound effects. This powerful and emotionally enveloping movie provides a front row seat without the big budget, big studio performances. The acting feels authentic, the dialogue true to life (though of course much is fabricated in detail) based on the true outline of what is known. There isn't any sentimentality. But there are a few likely revelations regarding the United States aviation and military response that the general public wasn't aware that are likely true, particularly regards to other hijacked planes and the military and Federal Aviation Administration disconnect. The terrorists and the violence are handled respectfully. The apparent weaknesses in the movie come towards the end where the nice balance between the hostages on the plane, the FAA, and military scenes are exclusively taken over by the plane scene and the translation of the terrorists seems to stop at the end. The decision to focus on the third person observer position and hearing only one-sided dialogue over cell phones is a question that may never be answered. Overall, this is a powerful movie without answers, but allows the American people a greater appreciation of what likely happened at many levels of our country involved in United 93.

Deja Vu," A Well-Produced and Compelling Thriller
","10 December 2006. This richly dense action-thriller has Denzel Washington as his typical but well cast character in this well thought out script that uses the idea of time and space in a superb manner. In one of the best genre thriller of its type, this consistent execution, high-quality production provides an intellectual and mostly satisfying experience. the movie also contents musical strains reminiscent of the intense and action-focised Bourne Identity series (2002) that also offers a similar strength and sharpness the movie's appeal. Except for a 'Stargate' (from the movie and television series) like structure that unnecessarily detracts from the scene and the obvious impossibility or at least gigantic leap of science two-thirds way through the movie, such lapses are minor compared to the intensity and small deja vu clues that actually enhance the movie till the end.

Minority Report," Entertaining Movie with Holes
","28 June 2002. The fuel-celled, powered cars looked something like a scene from the animated Disney movie, 'Tron' and the special effects of the cars almost seemed to be the same, about 15, 20 years old. This movie while fun and engrossing doesn't really rise to the qualitative level of the visionary 'Blade Runner.' The overemphasis of style over substance in the beginning felt more like a director who wanted to try to show off the futuristic gadgetry except with less success than in '2001: A Space Odyssey.' There are irritating lapses in believeability, where Tom Cruise overlooks the simple fact that he can be located through electronic surveillance of his retinal patterns, as a top cop he can't even physically defend himself successfully from an amateur Justice Department sleuth, that stun guns aren't used when they would be most effective, and crime fighters can even set up a trap to 'surround' someone even when they know where their suspect is going to be.Overlooking these obvious glitches, the movie moves apace with a decent plot and some interesting futuristic set designs and gadgets that were created based on real ideas about the future. The personal emotions of the characters poured through at appropriate times, though the use and manner of humor in the movie tended to diminish the seriousness and realism that a director such as Ridley Scott would have brought to the screen - here Spielberg was trying to be too cute. This movie won't win any awards except for technical and special effects and design but it will bring in the bucks for action. This movie probably raises more questions in this time of heightened terrorist fear and civil rights sensitivity than it answers.In short, 'A Minority Report' is just about picking the right sandwich and milk bottle from a refrigerator when you're blind and groping through the darkened alleys of the imagination of Phillip K. Dick, the sci fi author who penned the short story upon which this movie was based.",7,1,1,27 January 2019
Finding Neverland," A Strong, Somewhat Magical Film
","12 December 2004. The beginning 20 or 30 minutes of the film seemed to move with slow, almost languid movements that threatened to put me to sleep. There were suggestive flights of fancy such as 'Big Fish' that never seemed to quite push the envelope of delight. Nevertheless and overlooking John Depp's accent, this movie build slowly and like a magic present, it kept unfolding its mysterious until the fantasy and the poignant reality met in the great bittersweet ending. The tender, unassuming relational angles and tensions, the backdrop of a Peter Pan Classic, the suggestive hints of humor of Dustin Hoffman, and the underlying premise of childhood and adulthood all packaged into a resonating exposure onto the big screen is a feast for the eyes and mind.

In Bruges," Real Gritty and Edgy Drama That Misses In Places
","28 January 2009. 'In Bruges' is an uncomfortable experience with Colin Farrell as a rather abrasive protagonist and not the most likable fellow who is both insensitive and a brute and its a wonder why a woman would actually like him. While there's an effort to portray him with some remnant of sympathy, his guilt seems to wear a bit thin. This a beautifully well shot movie, with much of the foreign flavor captured on film along with a lovely musical score. The script is strong, harsh, brutal along with some rather risky comical inserts that are in a few places appear forced for aesthetic sake. Overall, this is an intensely strong and moving film if one can except the characters, their circumstances. Perhaps, in some ways, Colin Farrell reflects a little bit of reality of all of us, the good and the dirty parts. In this way, the movie might be considered actually a black, dark comedy of some note. The ending is a bit convenient, maybe too much so for the audience's discretion to make it what they want.

Kung Fu Panda," A Captivating Animated Family Action Movie
","13 June 2008. The amazing blend of animation, sometimes unfamiliar voices from known actors, and the strong script make for a compelling and surprisingly well-told story-based animated movie. While the animation wasn't as always sharp or realistic as some recent movies, it some ways it made for a better movie as it was told periodically in fantastical, magical ways. Jack Black's character and his on-screen persona was softened with references to Mr. Black's sometimes obnoxious comedic antics while Dustin Hoffman's wise sage role also dampened Mr. Hoffman's sometimes redundant on-screen persona. Mr. Hoffman's character in some ways brought out a finely nuanced, new side of Mr. Hoffman's acting ability and character something that was well captured in one of his previous outstanding roles in Tootsie (1982). As for the rest of the cast, such as Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, they are for the most past unrecognizable as their on-screen personalities and this was well and good for it made the movie have to stand more on its own that depend on their past characters but on their acting abilities to bring to the screen new characters. Only James Hong, a well-known Asian character actor's role was strongly presented, the father of Jack Black's character. Overall, this animated feature blended strong moral lessons along with creative martial art scenes and comedic humor that all came together to make this movie an entertaining, but emotionally sensitive movie. The only important element missing was the edgy, biting realism that today's more contemporary mature audience requires. Eight out of Ten Stars.",8,0,0,20 January 2019

A Star Is Born," Doesn't Quite Capture The Ultimate Magic
","This third version of A Star Is Born, this time starring Lady Gaga Gaga and Bradley Cooper is a paradox that doesn't quite hit the highest notes. Bradley Cooper, as star and director, by making this more authentic movie however commendable, loses some its emotional and cerebral edge. The movie comes across somewhat disjointed, with several scenes seemingly just jumping out at the audience without any mental transition or understanding of the thoughts and thinking of the characters as to how the following scene came to be. The sudden AA meeting is one example. The lack of sufficient Bradley Coopers' character's explanation or motivation for his actions much later in the movie is another example. There is the harsh pivotal manager's scene that emotionally twists the audience in an expected but wrong way. Even the unnecessary very last shot of the movie brings a tonal dissonance that seems too traditionally commercial. Overall, this is a credible, great effort at direction and acting that unlike the class musicals of Moulin Rouge (2001), Chicago (2002), and Momma Mia! (2008) doesn't quite capture the dramatic operatic intensity nor the just as important mental connections to the audience. A nice contrast is Craig Ferguson's directorial effort in the more commercial but quite effective comedy drama I'll Be There (2003) and another more dramatic version of the ravages of alcoholism can be found in the classic Days of Wine and Roses (1952) with has similar overtones to A Star is Born but on a more real pedestrian level away from the glitzy glamour of Hollywood or Nashville.",8,0,1,3 March 2019
Gravity," A Visually Dazzling Emotional Survival Ride
","7 October 2013. Gravity begins in a way suggestive of cautionary film producers of movies that offer drastically new, unknown potential, hedging their bets on an unknown audience by incorporating brief written explanations of what actual outer space is like or perhaps that introduce some dazzle as a way to ensure captivating the audience at the start of a movie, like Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) that spent time offering fascinating tidbits of tantalizing visions of outer space and the Starship Enterprise or like even Event Horizon (1997) that offered up the almost by now obligatory space shots of weightless objects spinning in space for the audience's vicarious space experience. Additionally, George Clooney was provided with an almost by now clique dialog seemingly formulaic in the same manner as Space Cowboys (2000). And whether or not the Executive Decision (1996) plot element was added as a psychological twist ploy and was even technically accurately portrayed was necessary or not is debatable. Like with Avatar (2009), Wall*e (2008), Life of Pi (2012), or Titanic (1997), Gravity presents its audience with a sharply breaking visual cinematic experience which may in time soften its innovative impact with future generations. But it can't be argued that this huge spectacular survival story bombards its audience with new amazing visions of space travel and space debris that have not been seen on film that delight and awe.Interestingly this movie resembles the action version of an earlier lonely space station movie Love (2007) and uses the thrilling action visuals somewhat like Apollo 18 (2011) used its fresh and well edited space dialog and space behavior that captured the audience's attention. Gravity retains the same sense of eerie foreign exhilaration of the classic 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) by adhering to the stark ambiance and the potentially frightening personal isolation and dynamically different physical environmental effects of outer space or the monsters of the frozen tundra of The Thing (1982) or duplicating the psychological trying experience of attempting survive one night in a simple haunted hotel room of 1408 (2007), or the technical mysteries and dangers in science of Splice (2010). Overall, Gravity like The Andromeda Strain (1971) presents on screen an amazing compelling dramatic science fiction scenario that is also closely related to the personal survival theme from Touching The Void (2004) that brings its audience into personally experiencing a prolonged harrowing life struggle event. It can't be argued that this movie brings into full explosive and thrilling life the wondrous terrors of outer space into the darkened auditorium of the theater. It is Sandra Bullock's performance a little ways into the movie that really shines here (ignoring the early dialog like Clooney's that doesn't seem logically suited to the reality of the situation) that allows one to ignore the unlikely events that occur written for dramatic sake and make this movie into one of powerful presentation of human frailty and courage from a deeply personal place.",8,1,1,16 January 2019
Unbreakable," A Realistic Superhero Unveiled
","15 July 2006. Instead of Spider-Man (2002) or any of the superhero comicbook versions adapted to the screen, Unbreakable takes its premise from the very nature of the darker, more humanistic components of comic books. In a much more human relational and path of human psychology, Shyamalan puts to good use music, photographic technique that provides a compelling look at a more suprahuman exploration of good and evil. In retrospect, Shyamalan taps into a richer vein of thriller and a deeper quality of the nature of good and evil. He avoids the stereotypical action, in slowly unwraps in various levels the mysterious of sacrifice, father-son relationships, and an immense substance contained in this movie. What originally hampered this movie was Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense (1999) that skewed the expectations of this movie. Taken on its own merits, Unbreakable is different but resonant. While the many components could have been touched up a tiny bit' a few scenes edited for clarity, and perhaps focusing on fewer characters for a more in-depth experience, the number of powerful scenes especially with the son are memorable. The suggestive nature of Shyamalan's technique is a credit to his allowance for the audience to assume more the task of explanation and experience of the movie for themselves.

Star Trek," Exciting and Entertainment with Weaknesses
","10 May 2009. Not perfect, but a nice tribute to the original Star Trek series. One of the best features of this new version is its casting with one big exception and smaller exception. The new engineer Scotty seems perfectly suit, down to his famous one-liners and human, McCoy has his sense of light unease, while Spock and his mannerisms and behavior most often reflect on the original Spock. Uhura seems a bit less convincing in her role, while the biggest problem with this movie is Chris Pine in the role of James T. Kirk - he doesn't seem to really have that much in common with William Shatner, there is something different about him that just doesn't seem to transfer over. Some of the best scenes are associating the old and new cast and for the most part it really comes across well, as the younger versions have similar younger attributes and characteristics of their older counter parts and the script usually does well by them.While this new version has the action and the expected storyline plot, but this movie had various weaknesses that detracted somewhat from this decent and exciting sci fi movie. From the very beginning the set up was much more abrupt, even more so than the first Star Trek movie which had much more emotional punch with its build up. The special effects seemed weak with the beginning sequence, it didn't seem as vibrant nor sharp as contemporary action thriller movies are now being produced. The script while having an emotional bite, especially when it comes to Kirk's parents, there still remains a problem with the apparent manipulative and by the numbers choreography of the plot - it seems forced, like a television script. The alien ship didn't seem to have the advanced configuration nor weaponry expected of it, nor did it seem as electronically monitored as it should have been. There is even one place where the Federation weaponry seemed more like guns shooting pellets with the accompanying sound effects and at one point, Kirk even uses the word 'gun.' Uhura's relationships and feelings seem somewhat off considering what happens in the original series. The development of the characters in the beginning also seem to leave out important psychological points and so often even though this movie is supposed to afford an opportunity to reveal where many of these characters come from, a lot is missing and much of the beginning appears jumpy.Overall, this is a fun return to the Star Trek franchise and a credible job consistent with the Star Trek series. Unfortunately, there were enough small issues that took away the complete Star Trek experience. 7/10.Not since Mission Impossible (1996) came out have I had such a transformed impression of a movie, a movie which also was an adaptation of an earlier television series and like that movie, this new Star Trek movie has apparently survived through time to be able to allow me to re-experience a Star Trek experience without baggage. Even Chris Pine, as Kirk, experienced in the context of the beginning scenes does permit the belief of a truly equivalent contemporary character as the old William Shatner. There were few weaknesses that merited attention a second time around. Becoming aware that the futuristic Romulan ship wasn't an advanced warship, being aware of the more developed set up of the backstory than before, there is much to appreciate in terms of the rare use of silence of space acknowledgement, the special effects this time around seemed immersive and effective. Uhura's different character and subsequent role in the movie and relationship seemed to suffer a bit of inconsistency or confusion in contrast to the original television series and movies and appeared to the only significant imbalance in this movie.",8,0,5,20 January 2019
Fury," Solid
","9 February 2015. Fury has nice pacing, engaging, and a balanced action drama of the tank warfare of World War II. This movie excels in its presentation of war that is both shocking as it is penetrating in its intensity and different perspective of military shells. There is a surprising, almost a futuristic laser blasters visual in the action scenes.This what is an essentially coming of age movie for one young new recruit at the end of the war exposing him to the horrors and delicate negotiation between war's insanity and human propriety. Fury, though doesn't quite have the intricate touch of comedic subtlety and cultural imbalance of Tropic Thunder (2008), nor the epic presentation of Saving Private Ryan (1998), the intimacy and continuous singular battle event focus and intensity of Black Hawk Down (2001) or We Were Soldiers (2002), the comprehensive nature of a predominate war struggle of survival of The Great Escape (1963), the darkness and totality insanity of Apocalypse Now (1979), or the raw, authenticity of Jarhead (2005).",8,0,2,15 January 2019
The Maze Runner," Entertaining Sci Fi Thriller
","19 October 2014. The Maze Runner combines The Hunger Games (2012), Cube (1997), with Lord of the Flies (1990) into a rather fascinating mystery thriller for boys. For most of the movie, the consistency of theme and plot holds up well. The tension, the ever presence ominous sounds of the maze offers up a dread that is pervasively creepy. The stereotypical characters aren't usually overplayed and the over the top performances or plot points are mostly held back using instead more empathetic and humanistic portrayals.The ending seems like a cop out for a hoped for sequel unfortunately. And there a few moments that really do fall back into the stereotypical plot design. The humor however makes their appearances with to great effect though. This is more enjoyable movie than expected. It just misses out though being really innovative and can't quite break out of the mold of most of the other sci fi thrillers.",7,2,2,16 January 2019
Inglourious Basterds," Superb Performances
","23 August 2009. Curiously, this movie is repulsive, depressing, and despicable. Regardless of personal taste, this movie also contains some of the most amazing acting performances and brilliant scenes of psychological intensity this year (2009). Director Quenting Tarantino continues his propensity for violence and in this movie even more raw, graphic almost indulgent use. There are echos of KILL BILL editing and storyline presentation that is a bit derivative while there are captivating musical verses reminiscent from HANGING AND PICNIC ROCK (1979) and the energizing musical score from MANHUNTER (1976). Unfortunately, unlike Steven Spielberg's SCHINDLER'S LIST (1993), the German characters while presented with some authenticity, none of them have any redeeming value as human beings, perpetuating the stereotypical monster inherent in the Nazi race, perhaps allowing for the pervasive slaughter on screen. Instead of a more well-rounded, conflicted performances, Tarantino sticks with the more straight-forward action-thriller without moral conflicts which would have made for a more serious drama. The ultimate disposition of most of the characters are more easily disposed off though the final scene has its more redemptive outcome. 8/10.",8,0,2,20 January 2019
Underworld," A Decent if not Spectacular Horror Movie
","22 September 2003. I can't say that Underworld was spectacular. It did make use of the latest special effects, slow-mo action moves from other contemporary action films (notably Matrix). It did have a decent script and a reasonable, consistent storyline that was intelligent. Yet I didn't find the movie really breaking any new, innovative ground, except for the fusion of vampires and werewolves (an intriguing idea done well). The acting was decent, if not superlative. There seemed to be a lack of emotional depth to many of the lead characters.Interestingly, this horror movie didn't really spin the way most horror movies go and the Romeo and Juliet spin-off went a lot more American than the English version. I enjoyed the movie, but the action scenes seemed less than explosively dramatic and exciting than say for example Charlies' Angels. The horror wasn't as terrifying as for example 28 Days or The Ring.This blending or fusion of genres makes for a more modest accomplishment, a more cerebral effort towards horror that produces one small step for vampires and werewolves, a giant step for a future movie.

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Darker But More or Less of the Same
","26 December 2016. Without giving too much away, consider the dilemma of trying to tie in a prequel to the original Star Wars movie, and you'll get some of the darkness that this movie might entail. Missing are all the epic, royal court melodrama and trappings of the Empire. The audience only gets flashes of what is about too come, almost not enough. The beginning is a hodgepodge of flittering scenes that almost require a voice-over to explain what is going on along with a loud musical score to retain audience interest in these initial less than spectacular scenes.What this episode attempts to present is a substantive storyline about sacrifice, parent-child loyalty, betrayal, and most of all 'hope'. There is no Harrison Ford persona to capture theater replaced by an evolving one in the form of a young girl transforming into a young adult. Overall, this episode is more about terror and rebelling against it at small odds and a lot of shooting, explosions, and killing, and dying. The premise that the larger the better as is profoundly used in this movie, may not always be better than the quality of the story.",7,2,2,12 January 2019
Captain Marvel," Average until a Strong Solid Ending Sequence
","In a rather surprising turnaround, what seemed mostly a good, but not really that great superhero movie turned on its afterburners for the last twenty minutes of the movie to make quite a show of it. Most of this movie was pretty much simplified overkill, token humor, and a lot of show off special effects, action sequences that really felt like a pretty masculine derivative. The tone of the movie also uncharacteristically wavered some during the first half of the movie. A disoriented and disjointed first half of the movie which was supposedly part of the nature of the storyline of this movie, but it wasn't effectively presented. With a little bit of Ender's Game (2013) intrigue the movie twist was pretty effective, if not stunning along with a smidgen of reverse ethnic psychology. The observable 3-D technological enhancement continues to progress helping to offer an almost awesome display of immersive reality. Not quite there yet. Overall, this movie almost didn't come through and can't really be considered a complete success owing to its rather average beginning. But the storyline and the ending performances shine resulting in of the few movies to make it out of its crash dive with a stunning and heartful conclusion that just barely earns a nine out of ten.",9,9,29,13 March 2019
Coraline," 3-D Magic Sparkles This Dark Animated Family Drama
","20 February 2009. It's hard to separate out the visceral magic of 3-D from the amazing experience of stop-action animation in 'Coraline.' How much of a hyperjump in ratings, 3-D goes in upping the razzle-dazzle factor is difficult to judge. 'Coraline' is an intense, emotionally raw balancing mood piece that belies the happy-thriller-horror animated world that 'Coraline' as a young girl gets to experience as well as the audience. The animation is superb and the script and scenes are well suited to the 3-D experience without having to exaggerate and distort the special effects. The special visual experience seem to exude and evolve naturally out of the movie's plot and structure itself. The characters are weird and strange but at the same time personal and oddly familiar. 'Coraline' like 'Spirited Away' (2001) brings the world of rich fantasy into the movie theater in a captivating and compelling way. Yet, when all the special 'Chicago' Richard Gere razzle dazzle is torn away along with a wonderful musical score, what is left is a more basic, simple version of the ignored young girl who looks for her fantasy dream elsewhere and lurking underneath is a more mundane, almost plodding movie experience. It would have been interesting to see more of a conflicted 'other' mother in the climatic scene to really provide an intense interactive, memorable scene as well as parents who seem a little more sympathetic and real to offer a bit of authenticity. It is only with the fusion of the 3-D and the natural fit that the story is brought into an amazing living experience that delights. 8/10.",8,0,0,20 January 2019
Iron Man 2," Action-Packed with A Heart
","9 May 2010. This is ROBOCOP (1987) on steroids. This movie is action packed with the requisite theater-vibrating sound effects along with a high-thrills and a SPIDERMAN (2002) personal backstory that lends a nice balance to this summer blockbuster. A few weaknesses persist that take this movie down a notch - a rather sedate opening sequence that also leads to a underdeveloped, stereotypical antagonist, and an Ironman lead-in that somehow ends up on stage without revealing any remarkable landing sequence. There's the amazing, but over-the-top sedan scene on the Monaco raceway. The movie has a superb martial arts sequence in the league of BOURNE IDENTITY (2002) much more enthralling than THE DARK KNIGHT'S (2008) fight sequences. This sequel, like SPIDERMAN 2 (2004) extends the personal drama and confronts the lingering father-son relational bitterness (though not even its resolution was perhaps underdeveloped as well). IRON MAN 2 (2010) presents a rather fascinating dynamic of two villains, both well played by Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell (who had an amazing starring role in the relatively obscure movie MOON, 2009). The narcissistic charisma of Ironman and the intimate focus on terminal death issues were well played out in the movie. The climax while explosive, failed to reach the heights of THE DARK KNIGHT (2008) nor the personal intimate and emotional intensity of BOURNE IDENTITY (2002), THE BOURNE SUPREMACY (2004). Interestingly, IRONMAN 2 is able to avoid the crass, overt sexual titillating excuse, though there is plenty of insinuations. Overall, IRONMAN 2 is blockbuster, summer lead-in entertainment that has both the riveting emotional dilemma of a hero and feel-good entertainment.",8,0,1,18 January 2019
Alien: Resurrection," Weaver as Riply Saves the Movie
","18 April 2017. Sigourney Weaver saves this movie. It is valuable to note the she was given a co-producer credit for this movie and her sublime individual performance in it testifies to her influence in transforming this movie from a poor parody of Alien into a singularly powerful character driven movie. Yes the rest of the movie is pretty much a mishmash of typical science fiction outer space horror fare. Yes the script and dialogue is pretty lame by comparison, especially the General Perez who comes across as a crazed, weirdo military leader.Nevertheless, the plot outline is decent and the one-liner humor is amazingly spread well throughout the movie and deliciously pungent with irony in reference to the original 1979 classic. There are a number of parallel scenes, particularly towards the end with a shot resembling Ripley and her cat and later in Aliens (1986) and Newt. Ripley's character is likely to have been overlooked by many. The complex hybrid synthesis is quite amazing with Weaver's performance. Her sensual mother-child emotive and psychic relationship is something to really experience. Weaver manages to lay the ironic humor, dialogue, and a otherworldly, almost alien shimmer to her performance, one that is simply worth experiencing for watching this movie for itself.",8,0,1,11 January 2019
Passengers," A Typical Sci Fi Movie With Emphasis
","18 March 2017. Visually on the spaceship, one could be reminded of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) including a phone call, Alien (1979) and hibernation chambers, and even a robot from The First Spaceship on Venus (1960). Unfortunately there are no real interesting twists one might expect and the sci fi script plays more like a toned down Gravity (2013) with a relationship angle. What makes this sci fi movie a bit better than the average outer space adventure is the personal character development and moral dilemma that was given good screen time. Even so the American nature of romantic drama abounds in this movie. Entertaining, though slow at times, and could have been better. The ending scene, however, was a nice touch and almost redeemed the movie.",7,2,3,11 January 2019
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Mmovie has a charm, lightness, but doesn't avoid some darker elements
","Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008). There is something different about Forgetting Sarah Marshall as this romance comedy but in a good way. Jason Segel's Peter Bretter's character is more refined and credible in his comedic performance than Matthew Perry's Oz Oseransky character in The Whole Nine Yards (2000) even as both their character share similar personas. Kristen Bell's inevitably second to Mila Kunis's character (later Best Actress Oscar winner in Black Swan) surprisingly retains a powerful and in ways sympathetic presence almost to the end, which is only saved by the unusual insert sequence with the ending credits. There is something honest and gripping in the script as it presence relational turmoil and regretful mistakes on the part of its characters. The overall movie has a charm, lightness, but doesn't avoid some darker elements as well as a genuinely sensitive and humorous and touching musical rendition of a Dracula character.",8,2,3,28 January 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Major Disappointment
","9 July 2006. Long, boring, and uninteresting. This sequel tried mightedly using all the past comedic, action techniques of past movies. There was the cannibal scene from King Kong (2005), there was Romancing The Stone (1984) action-comedy, there was even the now tiring and worn out Johnny Depp replaying his comic one-liners using a weak script. There was only warmed over character development, a scattered smattering of connections. The movie by attempting to be everything ended up being too thin on most everything. The violence level was raised far beyond a family movie. The comedy was forced and lame. The only new movement was the rather new action scenes for action scene sake without really contributing to the plot. Most of this movie has been seen before in one form or another. And like Star Wars trilogy there is the romantic triangle at play here leaving for the third installment a much darker psychological conflict. Missing from this movie was the light hearted fun (that was seriously attempted) that didn't seem to balance the more darker, sinister forces at work here. Five out of Ten Stars.",5,3,3,22 January 2019
Argo," A Compelling Fictional Re-Telling of A Unique Real World Event
","14 October 2012. The striking association between dramatization and reality comes at the beginning of the ending credits when side by side photographs of the real people and their actor counter-parts are shown along with a special message from one of the most important people of the time. What's fascinating about this ensemble effort is its lack of a standout character performance and instead the movie folds in the events and characters into one of the strongest dramatic scripts in recent memory. The editing, timing and recreation of the heightened dramatic elements (likely to have been exaggerated for theatrical audience impact) are tight and emotional riveting even as the real outcome is factually known.What sets this movie apart from most is its careful and deliberate coverage of the aftermath of the events that helps to provide in totality a beginning and a ending of this Iran hostage saga. Another element of this movie is the individual heroics, the raw and graphic language which seem to be unforced and in under Affleck's direction pertinent and incisively appropriate. Comparisons to this movie are hard to come by, The Good Shepard (2006) with Matt Damon that is more drama than action, W (2008) about Oliver Stone's President Bush's dramatization or The King of Scotland (2006) a singular focus on Uganda's Ida Amin, The Queen (2006) again a contemporary focus on central characters surround the Queen of Britain, Fail Safe (1964) about a fictionalized drama about a B-52 bomber and a nuclear weapon's accident, Black Hawk Down (2001) and The Great Escape (1963) that focus on the physical events of war, The King's Speech (2010) which is primarily personality and relationship focused, United 93 (2006) a much more narrow and compressed time-limited event, Breach (2007) more of an intimate personal character performance involving espionage.Perhaps the movies that come closest in style and portrayal might be event movies of Traffic (2001) or Bobby (2006) but their multiple story lines, Jar Head (2005) with its more expansive, visceral view of pre-Desert Storm, Munich (2005) about the murder of Olympic athletes and even so comes across more like an raw action dramatic thriller, Body of Lies (2008) a fictionalized hunt of a Middle Eastern terrorist, or perhaps the closest resemblance with All The President's Men (1976). But even so it is the very nature of the real unusual unfolding plot benchmarks that makes this movie so difficult to compare, the personal emotive human connections and conflicts and their observed stories make this production a unique creation in and of itself. A well dramatized script and direction and real life event are what made this movie resonate with its gripping power that allows the cliques and stereotypical resemblances to vanish into the background, leaving only the storytelling elements for the audience to enjoy in rapture.",10,0,0,17 January 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," An All-Around Action-Thriller Summer Movie
","13 July 2003. Though a bit violent for small children and a bit long in some places, Pirates has tidbits for all movie goers, old and young, male and female. There is the romance, there are the fight scenes, there are the ghost/horror elements, there are the cute comedy bits that all make up for a rather fun, entertaining film for everyone. Johnny Depp almost steals the show with his anti-hero antics. The movie ultimately stands up to honest scrutiny for all characters for the most part by the end, though perhaps Barbossa could have been even a more complex character making the movie even more dramatic and riveting. The climax avoids the usual melt-down to action and blustery fury, using instead a more moderate and superior ending device. Overall, Pirates rates eight stars out of ten.",8,0,1,25 January 2019
Star Trek Into Darkness," Durivative, Predictable, and Somewhat Boring
","18 May 2013. Whereas this movie version of the 'iconic' Star Trek has received mostly positive reviews and insistence that its twists are not to be revealed, perhaps for that reason that this movie depends on such 'surprises' to make this movie watchable, at least to survive through a first showing. The movie is derivative with little originality in its contents or storyline, and interestingly it is the very nature of the 'secretive' plot that only reveals how repetitive, predictable, that his movie is essentially a rehash of old plot lines and cliques in its attempt to forge through on its special effects and what eventually becomes nauseating sound bites.The movie begins with the now to be expected old traditional, James Bond movie sequence with its loads of action thrills that are intended to spellbind. The rest of the movie uses the audience psychological sales marketing plot points that began primarily with Jaws (1975) that inserted the requisite emotional and ethical conflict scene, the relational confrontation scene, the rebellion scene and the take pity scene, regret scene, and of course loads of action scenes that are needed to supposedly enhance the 3-D experience which only added mildly to the visceral experience and actually begins to feel like paint by the numbers movie with some of the major technical and logical aspects of both technology and human nature being conveniently ignore for the sake of coming up with a plot line that's already premade in advance.With the requisite spoiler alert warning in place here, the supposedly reintroduction of an old new nemesis from one of the original Star Trek movies seems rather lame and even that movie while deemed one of the best of the Star Trek movies, neither of them captured the richly substantive social, political, and sometimes deeply relational emotive depth that many of the original television series episodes captured back in the nineteen sixties. This supposedly sci-fi movie continues the trends toward small snippets of supposedly lofty important cerebral experiences that are only included for show and symbolic tokenism, leaving the hard-core sci-fi elements behind that made science fiction so forward and innovative in its raw daring fashion in the nineteen fifties, sixties, and seventies. Instead Star Trek Into Darkness in a way as its name suggests is a continuing move into the darkness of blind conformist, mindless popular action thrillers incorporating science fiction elements replacing quality scriptwriting that had a depth of heart, soul, and the former richness of science fiction that went where no man has gone before.",5,1,2,17 January 2019
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Superb, Majestic, and Fabulous Children's Fantasy Film
","11 December 2005. One of the best, if not the best children' fantasy film I've experienced. This lavish fantasy begins and ends with realism in a fantasy world. Each of the children are real, their interactions with each other are real. The performances and the relationships are not softened by major studio glossy acting, but engender a heart-felt, emotional gut feeling. There aren't any kiddy scenes, but good juvenile experiences awash from the movie screen. The White Witch is a superbly cold figure in the movie providing it with a great backdrop for children to experience a sincere picture of evil, iciness. This movie even though enveloped in white snow is no whitewash. It treats the rapidly maturing children of our age with a valuable dose of ethical insight, with hope, and inspiration as role-models.The cinematic approach reminiscent of 'The Secret Garden' (1993), and 'In America' (2002), The Chronicles of Naria (2005) plays it straight even though its set mostly in a fantasy land, much to its credit. This is a fabulous, personal epic, that is both majestic and intimate. With the exception with how death is ultimately played out in this movie, this movie feels like a classic.

Public Enemies," Compelling and Gripping But With Weaknesses
","12 July 2009. Until the very end, this movie had enough technical weaknesses to become a disappointment in terms of how great this movie could have been. Yet, it delivered enough to make this a quality period police drama. Michael Mann who directed MANHUNTER (1986) starring William Petersen in a CSI movie predecessor delivered the sharp, colorful, and even more grit. But the series of technical oversights had the potential to drag this movie down. (1) African music near the beginning of the movie seemed at odds with the American time period. (2) The shaky photography at times during the first third of the movie where the characters are seem bouncing up and down, out of focus was distracting and distancing. (3) The were a number of shots during the first third of the movie where the characters are heard but not seen talking which almost felt like they could have been dubbed. (4) There relational development between Dillinger and Billie didn't quite seem to have sufficient screen time to really cement the relationship. (5) The introduction of a new FBI agent from another office later in the movie was underdeveloped (who seemed like an early form of FBI profiler). (6) The high tech FBI gadgetry didn't seem to provide a direct connection with the sudden second arrest of the Dillinger. (7) The interplay between Christian Bale and Johnny Depp was never really given a strong emphasis like HEAT (1995). (8) The night time raid was also awfully artificial with an impossibly bright lighting set scheme which might have been much for successfully darkened (as in a horror genre) to heighten the fear element. (9) The interrogation of the severely injured cohort and his subsequent disposition (whether he lived or died) was left too unclear. (10) Billie's interrogation scene left out the physical humiliation shot that would have provided an even more outrageous emotional reaction. (11) The actual demise of Dillinger in the movie was surprisingly confusing and awkwardly shot.Nevertheless, the whole tone of the movie, the strong underplayed performance of Johnny Depp kept a strong, underlying sense of heightened tension throughout the movie. The shot fights were actually even more compelling that the blockbuster, extravaganza, special effects driven TRANSFORMERS: THE REVENGE OF THE FALLEN (2009) in which the sound effects and the you are there realism was potent and riveting. Emotional and intimately intense with excellent physical action, this movie is one of the strongest of the year. 8/10.",8,0,1,20 January 2019

","29 May 2006. Another fun time at the animation, summer-going experience this time facing the antics of a crazed squirrel, mammoths (one who has a problem with identity), possums, and other assorted creatures. The animation is great, the action tantalizing, the storyline straight forward along with humorous lines. While not breaking much ground, this movie stands on its own for its entertainment value. The squirrel personally was too much over the top and in some ways a distraction. The use of musical interludes was quite interesting and different from other animated features that either focus on music or leave it out. The blended use of the music in this animated feature was smooth and discrete. Seven out of Ten Stars.",7,1,1,22 January 2019

There was effort that was evident and there were attempts at comedy that were slam shots, some were winners and others were out of bounds, sometimes way out of bounds. Balls of Fury is a mixed bag...at times it did justice to table tennis, other times it really made a mockery of it. Some of the physical gags were funny, some of the lines were creative...yet the editing, the consistency really suffered. It was hard to feel that one was watching quality and instead it was more like watching comedy circuit with special effects and sitting through a practice dry run experiencing both the fun but also the duds.

This movie uses advanced technological animation techniques to enhance a fine, entertaining script that contains solidly comic and dramatic dramatics to produce an excellent and vibrant motion picture experience. The standard for both animated movies and children's films has been raised significantly. Emotionally and aesthetically pleasing, this movie contains a combination of separate motion picture elements that are interwoven into a brilliant exciting almost mini-epic voyage of discovering in a waterworld that breaths of life. The cast of characters are imaginative, the emotional ties some temporary other permanent all have their counterpart in the real world.

X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Solid but Not Spectacular
","2 May 2009. Perhaps its the medium of film, but oddly enough, X-Men Origins: Wolverine just can't compete with the newer medium of television. Take the television series 'Heros' which can extend any plot or character by multiple times over a number of years and a single movie even if its a prequel, it can't compete except supposedly for the special effects and big budget expenditures. The action is decent, the plot commendable if not perhaps falling trap to its own devices. Wolverine leaves some questions unanswered, uses plot twists to manipulate the audience's emotions from laughter to anger and back to sympathy. The problem with this movie is that in its effort to surprise the audience, keep it off-balanced, the plot itself becomes part of the problem as the twists and turns become themselves unlikely and unreasonable, if not emotional surprising and gyrating. This action-adventure feels derivative, with a lot of the action just a rehash of the same, some of special effects even seeming to be over to top and not comfortably believable even in the realm of big blockbuster movies. The effort in inject emotional intimacy, connections is also commendable, but not always successful. The brother relationship always felt awkward. Those innocent bystanders who get killed also seem more or less token plot devices. Overall, this is an enjoyable blockbuster, if not superbly accomplished or establishing any sort of classic status. 7/10.",7,0,1,20 January 2019
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," An Enjoyable as well as Decent, if Not Fabulous Ending
","9 February 2003. There are scenes in this movie that defy quality, professional honesty that work like gems.

It is there the audience experiences an honest, genuine quality time the coming off the screen between Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey. This movie was has a smart send up, funny lines and comical scenes about the dating behavior and quirky incidents that have befallen man and woman over time. While the ending wasn't quite as dazzling as it could have been, it ties itself up nicely. I was hoping for something more traditional, classy but as it was the ending was more personal and straight forward.

Alexander," An Epic Historical Classic
","25 November 2004. It was with great reluctance that I proceeded to go to Alexander. But this Oliver Stone masterpiece is controversial (in content for many) but unlike Troy, it does not avoid the raw, complex, and rich personal historical, mythic tale of an important historic figure. This fascinating, convoluted movie is rich in both its depth of each character each full of conflict, inconsistency, and powerful vision. Like real life, this full scale, epic picture has a battle scene that is much more vast than any of Troy scenes. Angelina Jolie has a great role and Colin Farrell performs in a role that has raw and intriguing complexity. The gay component of Greek life is not hidden, the illicit relationships, the inside bickering are all on display here as in a Greek tragedy that befits such an operatic classic. Easily the best historical drama this year, Alexander is a movie that can compare with the best of them - even Ben Hur for its bravery, its majesty, itsthe movie Troy may be forgotten, Alexander as in the movie itself, his myth and legend will live on - just as if Alexander himself and his life enabled this movie to be a great testament to his life and to raise the movie itself to the great heights of cinematographic, directorial, and performance excellence easily accorded to this movie. Well deserving of many film awards, if not for its political incorrectness on many fronts both ethnic (Greek and otherwise, gayness, and violent brutality).

This much more evil Ghostbuster production that avoids the Matrix elements and sticks to the roots of good and evil and the ambivalence of great forces at work. Constantive adds literally a different flesh to occult movies, making sure that the constant tension and fear remain drippingly creepy throughout the movie.

The Natural," It's A Natural Drama About Baseball
","1 December 2012. There is a compelling and appealing naturalness in the presentation of baseball in this movie directed by Barry Levinson. Its restrained features and backdrop support the story and the feel of actual baseball especially during the games are pervasive and emote a sense of realness that is likely to exist with those devoted fans who watch real baseball games, particularly those of importance, on television. Though a few scenes seem to mildly confuse rather than move the storyline with clarity, especially as it comes to various characters and initially who they might be, there is always a confident directorial hand in the background to ensure that the drama and the excitement of baseball and their impact on relationships remains. In a way there is a classical element of It's A Wonderful Life (1946) inserted into the plot of this movie.Two more contemporary movies likely owe some of their power to this movie - For The Love of the Game (1999), The Rookie (2002) with Dennis Quaid and Moneyball (2011) with Brad Pitt. Unlike the more ethereal fantasy of Field of Dreams (1989) or the lighter docu-history comedy of A League of Their Own (1992), The Natural is a human drama as well as a subtle thriller in the likeness of Chinatown (1974). The Natural brings to the big screen a serious, luscious look at baseball, the human element, along with a dramatic story.",8,0,2,17 January 2019
The Hustler," Overblown by Today's Standards
","Paul Newman plays a pool hustler facing Jackie Gleason a pool champion and Piper Laurie (who later makes an acting comeback in the award-winning television series Twin Peaks (1990)) and George C. Scott that echoes themes from The Day of Wine and Roses (1962) starring Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick. Perhaps at the time, this film would have appeared to be somewhat more sophisticated than its contemporary movies, yet the plot hasn't aged well with its unnecessary over-dramatization that seems to detract from the more vital action mystery as to the billiard competition while blasting out the message of relationships as more important. There are even some residual lingering themes that were echoed in The Cutting Edge (1992) with D.B. Sweeny and Moira Kelly about figure ice skating competition in a much softer presentation. The dialogue used in The Hustler seems more staged as a theatrical production than a film and while powerful, it comes across more harsh and bitter than poetically beautiful as a movie. Compare this movie to Paul Newman's more nuanced performance in Cincinnati Kid (1965).",7,0,3,17 November 2019
500 Days of Summer," A Different Cinematic Romantic Drama That Scattered and Chaotic
","17 March 2010. This is a movie that attempts to be cute using a variety of animation, voice-over, split-screen, slow-mo, semi-documentary techniques along with an unusual jumping back and forth from future and past inserts that only results in a series of short-attention span, sound bite contemporary American skinny dipping into relational romance that almost destroys the essence of the deep and subtle, riveting emotional roller coaster of love as it is actually felt and experienced. The end scenes of this movie almost make up for the chaotic, choppy, jerky editing that really detracts from the potential for a more traditional romantic drama that could have been even more powerful because the edgy script in linear form was likely great to begin with. The unnecessary disjointed cinematic technique did not really serve to enhance the fundamental storyline. Many more romantic dramas exist that truly allow the audience a deeper and prolonged journey into this universal and powerful emotion and experience of love. I too know personally of a Summer and Autumn and I too have experienced the casual relational and the make up and break up and rejection and this movie while offering up glimpses of such lofty life experiences is no way reflects the deep rapture and darkness that it attempts to portray in the way it was directed and shot.",6,0,0,18 January 2019

Almost too cute for its own good, this contemporary lingo movie that appears to be in sync with the younger generation, offers up a captivating look at young people, the ones who appear to be wise beyond their age, the ones that seem to follow a different path. This is a movie about being honest and sometimes naive. The movie tries so hard to be hip that it almost becomes a strained, are parody of itself (but eases back into dramatic/humorous reality). The ending of the movie has a nice, unexpected twist that saves this movie from flecking out, copping out though not as dynamically solid as Nanny Dairies which seems more edgy and powerful. One of the brightest and educational dramas of the year. Eight out of Ten Stars.",8,1,1,21 January 2019
The Day After Tomorrow," Despite Science, Disaster Movie Has A Lot of Heart
","30 May 2004. Spectacular effects along with good characters and smart script regardless of the science. Finally, a movie comes along that has the excitement and thrills of disaster of disasters along with a strong characters and a good relational development that is usually lacking in most disaster movies. Usually the stereotypical Airport or Earthquake movie is mostly bypassed in this movie except for the poor and downtrodden and a dog. But people die...sometimes unexpectedly...but realistically and poignantly.The fusion of a good story along with a fantastic backdrop makes for a definitely superior kind of movie. Dennis Quaid comes through as does Ian Holm. There is a spattering of humor in the right places to ease the tension, but unlike most movies it is done with tact and is never over the top - mostly real, informal humor. While there are a few unbelievable sequences and the specific science controversial, the entertainment value and the fundamental premise are intact.11/11/07 - post-script: The special effects fail to hold up on the small screen, allowing the more pedestrian script weaknesses to make more of a presence. While the over commentary remains the same, some of the glamour and big splashy physical experience and impact have become dull. Likely Seven out of Ten Stars.",7,1,1,25 January 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," An Exhilarating Adventure Ride
","30 May 2007. It feels as if one is at a fantastical end of the end, a surrealistic fantasyland of gargantuan proportions with eye-popping special effects and an almost continuous thrill ride of action and mystery. The eerie and atmospheric cinematic vision feast is accompanied by both increasingly violent scenes (almost too excessive and graphic) along with a good dose of one-liners and balanced humor. There are emotional tender scenes of humanity and serious drama. While the substance still hasn't reached maturity in action films, the plot outline a little confusion in places, and the 2 hour and 57 minute length almost at the limits of American tolerance, the major thrust of action entertainment is met with satisfaction in this third installment.

Spider-Man 3," Classic Entertainment for the Masses
","4 May 2007. Once in a while, a movie comes out that taps directly into the mainstream audience with such power that it resonates its own level of quality. Such is this third installment of Spiderman. Two such contemporary movies have come before - Jaws (1975) and Titanic (1997). Spiderman 3 sets a new standard of excellence for the mass audience movie taking humor, relatively complex plot outline, and incorporating breathtaking action sequences, and a heavy dose of spirituality, betrayal, revenge motif, forgiveness, love and relationships into an amazing package for this era of time. Besides a surprisingly somewhat weak special effects and one weak scene with the Franco and his servant, the overall movie is superb. The depth of emotions and the ethical message is so riveting is so ripe for today's complicated and crumbling societal direction. Nine out of Ten Stars.",9,0,2,21 January 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," A Fun, Light-Minded Superhero Summer Movie
","Chris Hemsworth gets to play a rather nicely cynical superhero God that in some ways reflects the humanistic Gods of Greek and Roman literature. This mostly entertaining at and times funny action-adventure is roughly hewn in its screenplay's comedic and dramatic elements. A pleasant, if not truly substantive and deeply engrossing experience. But as a fun summer get away, Thor seems to fit the bill.",8,3,7,4 May 2019
Midnight in Paris," An Awful Stuck In The Head Movie
","11 March 2012. I found Midnight in Paris unbelievable, unappealing, and unapproachable. Woody Allen's imprint is all over this movie, but his fantasy theme failed to carry over onto the movie screen. The dialogue and scenes were dissociated from any emotional connection and became more of visual and auditory reading of Woody Allen's own mental musings. He failed to capture the intense flavor and rhythm of Paris, insisting on his scripted words. He had Gil (performed by Owen Wilson) becoming a one-dimensional, monotone character who remains in an oblivious state throughout the movie. Add to Gil's unappealing character, an even more obnoxious fiancé who can't even be made to appear sexually seductive even needed. How can these two characters be together in the first place? This relationship is a mere a plot device, adding to the absurdity of the movie. Later Gil meets Adrianna played by Marion Cotillard's (the most important relationship) whose wonderful and delightful character watches helplessly with fewer script lines as Owen Wilson's character remains blank to the different surroundings that he takes in so nonchalantly at odds with the circumstances. If only Wooden Allen had made Marion Cotillard the primary character, then perhaps her performance or character itself might have been able to carry the movie sufficiently to make it bearable to watch. As it is, Gil unintentionally becomes a parody of the comedic Jerry Lewis or Don Knott's idiot character appearing as witless lout who cannot possibly be this amazing, creative writer.By a small stretch of the imagination, it seems like the characters in Midnight in Paris are, at times, just following Woody Allen's direction in a stylistic, deliberate way that don't reflect any authentic performance, many appearing as robotic on the screen. If only Gil had been inebriated or Woody Allen had incorporated Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone (1959-1964, television series), the movie might have been more approachable as a fantasy. The needed suspension of belief required in a fantasy is made even more difficult with Kathy Bate's character being like Kathy Bates. Even in her beginning scene seems as if she was reading her lines off a cue card or teleprompter. Midnight in Paris is scattered throughout with dialogue with so much lofty intellectual mumbo-jumbo as if being spoken from a script - or lifted from the old live radio theater which doesn't really transfer well onto film. There are the sudden shifts from modern-day Paris to the past and back against without any of mysterious, mesmerizing blending of eeriness. Over a quarter century earlier, director Fred Haines successfully created a more haunting, subtle, mystically surrealistic movie adaptation of Herman Hesse's Steppenwolf (1974).Woody Allen introduces extras like the zombie walking man pushing a hand-cart that only heightens the wooden feeling of and detachment of the movie. There's an irrelevant dog extra scene, an unnecessary stealing from the wife's jewelry case scene. There's the inclusion of the underdeveloped private investigator scenes that only serve Woody Allen's need to arrive at a more surprisingly common place American ending. Such devices are more the stuff of Peter Seller's slapstick comedy The Pink Panther (1963) instead of Woody Allen's more sophisticated romantic comedy New York-style. He then misses such opportunities of tapping into the magical appearance of a horse carriage. When it only takes an extra with brief scenes as a shop girl to carry the aliveness of the entire scene, her brief realness and easy flowing portrayal only serves to emphasize how lost and empty most of the main characters have become, especially Gil. Woody Allen's script only offers tantalizing glimpses of a multitude of famous people from the past, but they only seem to be inserted as cute cameos. The whole movie ends up to be drops of tid-bit fragments - of what psychologists would define as 'loosening of associations' often associated with manic patients (Trzepacz and Baker, 1993). In a way, this movie is reminiscent of the award winning California Suite (1978) written by Neil Simon that didn't connect well with the audience or of the adapted screenplay movies Noises Off (1992) or Chorus Line (1985) neither of which transferred well to the movie screen.In some ways, Woody Allen's script is stuck in the past that is both predictable and not as spontaneously charming as it should be. Woody Allen continues passing up opportunity after opportunity to create a more gripping, raw, and compelling relational, morally intriguing movie. Instead he offers up only an odd and confusing choice between Gil's fiancé and Andrianna where there is really no suspense nor build up. Much more compelling and engaging movies are the more thought provoking Anthony Hopkins' Slipstream (2007), the more daring stark play-as-a-movie Dogville (2004), or more recent complex sci fi action romance Inception (2010). A better time travel movie that retains its charm is Kate & Leopold (2001) or the less well known Time After Time (1979) or The Lake House (2006) each of these movies having more appeal possessing captivating adventure and energy. Midnight in Paris instead is distance, jumping through haphazard scenes, underdeveloped plots, and character much like an unfinished jig saw puzzle that still leaves hundreds of individual or grouped pieces scattered about making the movie a disaster. Instead I would check out Time Bandits (1981), Pleasantville (1998), The Time Traveler's Wife (2009), Somewhere in Time (1980), Back to the Future (1985) or Peggy Sue Got Married (1986). Even the animated Caroline (2009) or Spirited Away (2001) offers similar but more involved, enchanting fantasies or a movie with the same foreign flavor and love essence, A Man and A Woman (1966) quietly dazzles and enriches with an intimately involving relationship.",3,3,5,17 January 2019
The Last Song," A Meaningful and Worthwhile Family Drama
","16 June 2013. This teen pop star Miley Cyrus and Greg Kinnear movie vehicle presents a series of consistently connected family and community life issues that while predictable are intertwined in such a fashion as to make them entertaining, believable, and emotional, and meaningfully relevant. While one could stereotype or be turned off by Miley's character, there is something that seems more significant going here and while the many plot tragedies that continue to build up in this movie, there is oddly enough a rather authentic possibility of such events occurring in with such compelling convergence. This movie deals with the aftermath of divorce and its impact on children, about family, about coming of age, impulsive decision-making, blame and gossip making, jealously, love, hate, making mistakes, and death and forgiveness. There's a whole bunch of stuff going on in this movie in it all something makes sense and never becomes overly juvenile nor nauseatingly repetitive or crisis just for crisis sakes.What is particularly fascinating is that this popular teen format shot in the traditional classic mass audience cinematic photographic and directorial style found in much movie such as Uptown Girls (2003) or Fly Away Home (1996) Whale Rider (2002) that have at their core a animal preservation themes unlike the more raw and gritty independent video approach such Margot at the Wedding (2007) or The Tree of Life (2011), it nevertheless captures the emotive and intellectual interest by its subject matter and what appears to be a close to reality outcomes of each scene as well as the connections between them. The biggest weakness if one can could it that is that this movie doesn't have the focused emotive intensity as one finds in such movies as Where the Lilies Bloom (1974) or the innovative and dazzling cinematic imagination as found in Moonrise Kingdom (2012) or the scintillating and chilling factor as in The Lovely Bones (2009) or the big screen epic nature as the historical Chinese themed The Joy Luck Club (1993), the more layered emotional diverse comedy drama of Little Miss Sunshine (2006) or even perhaps the singular anguishing search of meaning as Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (2011). This movie might be more associated with the family dramas as Georgia Rule (2007) or Nanny Diaries (2007).",8,0,0,16 January 2019
Zodiac," Commendable Effort
","5 March 2007. This lengthy crime mystery murder movie in a way reflects a more realistic scenario that crime investigations actually take, but unfortunately the expected dramatic path is strewn with such a slow pace unlike classic 'All The President's Men' (1976) released only two years after Watergate occurred (of which that movie was about). The acting while revealing, particularly that of Jake Gyllenhaal, his character didn't translate into a substantive understanding about himself - his portrayal was more superficial than substantive, raised more questions than answers. Robert Downey Jr. and his performance was entertaining and more interesting wasn't a far stretch nor unique as a personality than his other on-screen personas. Perhaps the most memorable role was that played by Mark Ruffallo, as a dogged detective who must face the realism of his pursuit of this case in the end. Overall, this long movie itself represents the more gritty and routine side of crime, but without the needed cinematic magic that the best movies can offer.

The Prestige," A Tight, Compelling Drama
","22 October 2006. The script is tight, covering almost all of its bases along with a tense and character-driven drama surrounding loss and revenge, prestige and sacrifice. While the relational dramas unfolding appeared somewhat chaotic, part is explained by the plot itself. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale provide was wonderful performances as well as the mysterious David Bowie as Mr. Tesla as an added bonus. There are a few harsh magical moments. The flashbacks are handled nicely without obvious ostentation except where appropriate for the character and context. The ambiguity of Jackman's and Bale's characters is also commendable. Overall, this is a fine movie, but there are a few editing jumps and a bit of underdevelopment of characters that could have provided full-rounded enjoyment. However, such trifles could come down to deliberate necessity because of the plot twists. A surprisingly eerie, compelling delight. Eight out of Ten Stars.",8,1,1,22 January 2019
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Long, Predictable, Boring
","13 July 2008. The best thing about this movie is the trailers. The worst thing about this movie is the movie itself. Unfortunately, from the very beginning, there is the small, child Hellboy who doesn't have much striking resemblance to the adult Hellboy, an initial dissonance that doesn't stop. There's the initial monster attack at the auction establishment on our superheros who miraculously aren't eaten alive for some reason and seem to be given some free pass from getting covered by the nasties. The character's are so stereotypical and one-dimensional with a superficial veneer of supposed humanity and relational caring. There are many scenes that are just special effects-driven that attempt to attract the audience by razzle-dazzle that don't have much that hasn't been done before and seem to be just thrown in. There are a few cute lines, but the one-liners get old. It's actually Prince Nuada who seems to have the most interesting and compelling role in his attempt to redeem the world from the disposable and resource consuming race of humans.

Cloverfield," Boring, Manipulative, Unconvincing, and Dull
","20 January 2008. Warning: Spoilers. Except for the very last shot, Cloverfield is a rip off of The Blair Witch Project (1999) of the worst kind. It attempts to take a hand-held video cam and add a more complex plot along with special effects and expect to actually re-create the magic of the original attempt. Unfortunately, from a personal perspective, this was one of the worst movies I've experienced in a while. There is something to be said about the appropriate media format for the theatrical experience. It was the very idea of this was a video tape that distanced me from the action, I didn't feel that I was part of it, I was watching a filtered version, buffered by time and distance. Most of the movie was boring, like watching a home film movie without any editing. The interesting part is that the attempt to imply property of the U.S. Government, as a document, it would have been more believable and effective if the movie had been based on a collection of edited videotapes of the same event. The beginning segment, pre-monster scenes are too manipulative, the exaggerated attempt to make amateur mistakes in filming the scenes became too clique and made the movie feel unreal and fake. The first obvious technical flaw in the movie occurred with the relative quickness of the live televised news report that was recorded by the apparent video cam. The news report came so suddenly right after the strange pounding, vibration that it added to the manipulative unreality. There was a underground scene where the light from the video cam is used to light a path, except what we mostly see are the lighted backs of people that deflect the light so the people shouldn't be able to see where they are going. There is also a scene where an injured woman is haphazardly taken care of, unlike what would occur in real life and then another women is pealed off a metal rod that would most likely of killed her (as the rod itself was likely sealing broken arteries). We have a helicopter that of course gets too close to the monster, we have only the main character's surviving the crash and not the crew. A more effective movie was Brainstorm (1983) that took virtual reality to a new level more almost a quarter of a century ago when it was released, bringing the audience into the movie not pushing them away. The restrictive nature of the single hand-held camera perspective omits so much more film scenes such as the man who falls to his death off a bridge. There is so much that is missed, so much continuity lost, so much choppy editing that there flow of the movie is overly disturbed. Hopefully, film makers will make movies not this return to live reality movie making unless their prepared to really work to make it more authentic, audience involving, and emotionally interesting.

Sleepy Hollow," Great Looking, But Out of Balance Tone
","22 August 2016. This gorgeous looking and designed period setting for the movie seems to capture the dirty, chaotic, but simple and supposedly less frantic urban life of contemporary society. The movie begins with a finely honed balanced between terrible horror and the amazing subtle Johnny Depp performance of charmingly odd and eccentricity. For the first half of the movie Depp is able to deftly insert an entertaining light, weird sense of humor among the more dark and definite nasty evil invading this quaint town. While the story teeters between science and magical horror, the second half of the movie seems to descend into a runaway riot of the fantastic that even Depp's character can't charm himself back into balance like the first half of the movie.This is a dark comedy, horror thriller that for the most part offers up sinister villains though there is something uneven and not completely convincing by the end of the movie.",7,0,0,12 January 2019
Silent Hill," Gets Way Better Over Time
","27 August 2006. This could have been a better horror-thriller. It wasn't even necessarily scary - this is a movie that tried to much special effects and gore, the same old stuff in a different way. Most of it didn't seem to make a lot of sense, except to being different. But overall plot is decent and by the end the movie actually has the mild twist, while not classic, sufficient to accept as something nicely done. Unfortunately, too much was done to try to make this movie different, but mostly in the stylish, creepy way that just didn't seem to work all the time. At other times though, the movie had an emotional connection, a lingering sense of horror. It just didn't seem to all mesh together perfectly. Six out of Ten Stars.**Broadcast version - 11/5/11**. An amazing transformation and a rare occurrence except for Mission Impossible (1996) has a movie had a reawakening impact in its emotional and cinematic improvement. With selective use of in sync music of a diversity of tones and rhythms that echo the eerie and haunting and solemn horror movie, Silent Hill has suggestion of Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970) along with fascinating and compelling set designs and engrossing themes in resemblance of quality fantasy horror movies such Coraline (2009) with the mysterious eyes and creepy nether world, Dark Water (2005) with the emotional bonding of mother-daughter and the immersion into the set design of mood and captivating environment and The Cell (2000) with its amazing depiction of the inner world along with the same older woman and young child theme. Even such movies as La Planete sauvage (1973) and Spirited Away (2001). The most significant weakness appears to be a somewhat edited, forced opening sequences that didn't quick portray the typical lush photographic and smooth flow of quality mainstream, high production value movies. What is quite impressive is the acting and the character presence without well not stars and instead the consistent storyline once revealed allows this movie to become well-rounded and proceeds like The Blair Witch Project (1999) to rivet the audience by the substance of the movie itself. This is one of the few horror movies and movies in general that appeared to become stronger and more densely rich as the movie went on until the haunting twist at the end suggestive of such highly impactful movies such as Solaris (2002), The Sixth Sense (1999), and 1408 (2007).",8,1,1,22 January 2019
Ready Player One," A mixed bag, but nevertheless offers up a world of exciting possibilities
","Ready Player One (2018). Ready Player One is a mixed bag, but nevertheless offers up a world of exciting possibilities. This high tech, futuristic action adventure relies less on psychological crime thrills such as The Thirteenth Floor (1999) and less on the super blockbuster sci fi action adventure of The Matrix (1999) more of a computerized, virtual reality quest version of magical fantasy of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), including the incorporation of one of the first use of a text-based computer game Colossal Cave Adventure (1976) or the adolescent version of virtual reality of Surrogates (2009) or Inception (2010).This movie attempts to introduce the audience to the visual spectacular and special effects design of the future that Avatar (2009) introduced and boldly surpassed of the original efforts of virtual reality classic Tron (1982). Yet at the same time, the heavy artificial look of much of the movie really diminished the likely futuristic impact of what the real experience is likely to be which still falls behind what was accomplished in Brainstorm (1983), which remains one of the classic standards of virtual reality movie-making.Steven Spielberg offers plenty of references to classic movies such as The Iron Giant (1999), The Shining (1980) and the more obscure but highly rated movies fantasy movie Excalibur (1981) and one of the most bizarre sci fi classics The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension (1984) and even the Back to the Future (1985) DeLorean time machine. Overall, Ready One Player is a compelling, entertaining yet strangely not completely satisfying futuristic look at our computer, internet, technological future.",8,0,2,28 January 2019
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Dense and Unnecessarily Convoluted
","7 January 2012. There's sophisticated and there's overly dense movies...When audience members have to think real, real hard, when they aren't sure what's going on due not to the plot, but due to the editing and omission of important plotpoints, then a movie becomes more a hardship than an enjoyable mystery experience. With this version of La Carre's novel, the beginning even provides an exaggerated parody of sophistication as the movie pans carefully on each character and supporting cast, forcing the audience to suspect every person of possible collusion in some nefarious espionage plot when in reality by the very nature of espionage such behavior would actually be much more subtle and covert. The movie than turns suddenly into a much more confusing and sometimes almost unnecessarily artful movie with shots that seemingly have little relevance except to attempt to portray underdeveloped human characters.Perhaps much more direct but yet indirect by deliberate disinformation which maintains a sharper and much more heightened sense of artistic, dramatic confusion can be found in such movies as The Three Days of Condor (1975) and the well richly underplayed but riveting espionage film The Russia House (1990) that captures the slow, non-action but emotive spy drama. Spy Games (2001) also had the high intensity, misdirection and graphic espionage drama that offered the audience a mentally riveting and challenging plot line that balanced both the action and mental substantive machinations of espionage. Other espionage movies that retain both the more underplayed but effective dramatic presentation include The Good Shepard (2006), Spartan (2004), Breach (2007).Tinker, Tailor almost needs unnecessarily a decoder ring to really enjoy and understand the movie, the movie itself become captured in its own cipher.",6,0,1,18 January 2019
We Were Soldiers," A Somber, Walloping War Drama
","1 November 2014. Some people might refer to Saving Private Ryan (1998) as one the great classic war films, especially its extended opening scene of the landing on Normandy Beach on D-Day. Others might refer to Black Hawk Down (2001) for its extended failed military mission in Somalia as one of the most gripping battle action films. Still others would cite Apocalypse Now (1979) as the most intense, personal, surrealistic war movie. Other films that people would laud loudly about would include The Hurt Locker (2008)or Dr. Strangelove (1964) for their cynical look at war, Jarhead (2005) for its immersive, ambient experience of long moments of war.We Were Soldiers, however, is an unabashed look at the terror and fearsome pain and emotional ripping apart of familial bonds and the heat and sorrow and fear and honor and courage of the individual and team effort of battle. Regardless of how might believe, feel of President Obama's reluctance to continue American commitment to Iraq or Afghanistan, even Syria, this movie is a must see before one should reflect on the realities of war and its impact. Perhaps the closest this movie might come or a movie to compare We Were Soldiers to might be the epic Civil War movie Gettysberg (1993). We Were Soldiers is presented in a non-glorified way with an inclusionary experience of the wives of many of the soldiers as well. We see glimpses of the Vietnamese soldier themselves.The only small weaknesses of this movie might be its imbalance of primarily focusing on the American military experience with a significant but still token view of the emotive backdrop of the Vietnamese and one scene where there is an attempt to local lost American soldiers on the field of battle that doesn't seem quite realistic and perhaps even fool-hearty as well as omission of some of the more graphic hand to hand combat images while at the same time including the bloody bullets ripping through bodies themselves. But none of these weaknesses detract from the overall greatest of this movie.In sum We Were Soldiers seems to reflect some of the best, if not the best directorial, scripted, and filmed movie about the awfulness of war in a human and compassionate but somber way.",9,1,1,15 January 2019
The Adventures of Tintin," A Special and Perhaps Magical Animated Comic Story
","1 January 2012. One of the best animated adaptations to the full theatrical screen of a comic strip character and storyline. The technology has arrived at a point along with the strong script that resonates with its original cartoon material. Perhaps almost overly long with an almost forced condensing of an immense amount of material of three of the series stories, the film nevertheless manages to create a magical experience that neither live action films based on human characters in a real world nor the fantasy animation of animated characters can reproduce. In the best of both worlds, Tin Tin can feature amazing physical action that audience are willing to suspect their disbelief and experience almost Disneyland spectacular ride for themselves. At the same time the film effectively captures both the spirit and the personality of the original cartoon strips themselves. The transformation to film is somewhat more dark, at times, and physically intense than the more passive colored flat 2-D images on the page. Whether or not the animated technology will subsume the live actor performances within a decade is another matter.",8,0,0,18 January 2019
Ocean's Twelve," Funny but Uneven
","17 December 2004. This robbery caper is dazzlingly funny and entertaining. But the characters in this movie get uneven movie time and one of the great switches at the end of the movie is flat. Yet, it appears that the star-studded cast is having a good time, the Julia Robert's acting role at the end is delightful, the surprise cameo is fun. Overall the script, plot is decent, the required tension and conflict present. This is fun but perhaps unmemorable movie that is a nice holiday treat that is easy to swallow but required some help along with way. Matt Damon is particularly fascinating because of his other movie, 'The Bourne Supremacy' that offers an amazing contrast in characters, illustrating his acting depth. Oceans 12 is like a cast of super stars having an opportunity to get together, allowing us a glimpse of an ensemble performance with some of the actors being given a bit more screen time, and an invitation for us to join in the romp and display of informal holiday spirits and jollies.

Crash," A Mesmerizing, Hard-Hitting, Drama About Racial Relations
","7 May 2005. Easily and by the far the best movie in the first third of 2005, this likely to be awarded nominated racial drama scores high in the emotional punch in the soul department. The high tension and the heightened anger, frustration, and heated racial hatred are on fast forward throughout this movie. This is a no-holds barred movie with the language fast and loose, the women hot and heavy with their screaming and yelling and the men barely able to hold in their rage at the cruelty of the human condition. At the same time there is tenderness and humanity, the twists and curvatures turn back on themselves as the characters begin to relate to one another in unexpected ways not always with the best of results. Crash in probably on the best movies of the year, along with an unassuming but complementary score form Mark Isham (The Cooler). Sandra Bullock, Brandan Fraser, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Ryan Phillippe as well as the rest of the cast all gave outstanding performances. The only over-reaching, extreme moments are at the beginning as the feminine overdrive seems to be stuck on high as two of the female leads seem to represent the worse in women that we've all come to stereotype. There is also one subplot that seems to be underdeveloped that distractingly leaves lingering questions slowing the movie just a tad in several spots. But, nevertheless, first time director, Paul Haggis, of a full-feature film has a independent film hit on his hands. Nine out of Ten Stars.",9,0,0,23 January 2019
The Expendables," A Good Try But It Implodes On Itself
","27 August 2010. This above decent action thriller begins with substance but eventually collapses on itself into chaos. This is no Jason Bourne from Bourne Identity multiplied by three or four. The beginning scene was too dark and confusing to really have the sharp, dazzling impact it could have had, the car chase also was confusing, the near escape of the antagonist twice as a bit too staged, especially the second time as things start blowing up. The big explosion scene was also mis-managed as instead of the having many more police force inside the building they were outside which in same ways resulted in a really messy climactic explosive battle with so many scenes that were just edited bits of bullets flying, heads exploding...Another let down was Jet Li's big martial arts scene which seemed only to result in the smaller being battered and that only in the end bullets count more.Mickey Rouke, continued to play his new more rough and tumbled role from his Oscar nominated performance of The Wrestler (2008) though it would have been nice to see a different side of his persona and extend his acting range. Nevertheless, there was a decent effort in incorporate an emotional connection into this movie, including Charisma Carpenter's (from Angel and Buffy the Vampire Slayer) girlfriend role which still didn't have enough screen time and an attempt at a more balanced presentation of bad guys. Unfortunately, the end result was more blood and guts, grinding meat of mercenary fame instead of the more stylish martial arts and mental and physical prowess.",7,0,0,18 January 2019

The spacing between fantasy and reality is rather fascinating, though the ultimate issue of reality while blurred somewhat, isn't deliberately pronounced enough to create a true resonance of doubt and wonder. There is one pinnacle scene that appears more manipulative without explanation during the banquet scene. Both overly simple and complex, the special effects are good, the set design engulfing. Unlike Chronicles of Naria (2005), Harry Potter, Jumanji (1995), Lord of the Rings, The Neverending Story, Spirited Away (2002), Time Bandits (1981), Pan has a more wrenching fantastical atmosphere that almost tears the genre apart.

Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," An Intense, Mature Musical
","25 December 2007. Less than either Moulin Rouge (2001) and Chicago (2002) but more than Evita (1996), Sweeny Todd incorporated dialogue in much less quantity than most musicals except for Evita which was exclusively sung. This dark musical fused dark humor in the beginning and was photographed in dank and black colors. Sweeney Todd based on the musical of the same name, did not take as much advantage of the theatrical film format as did Mouline Rouge or Chicago and many sequences seemed more like a Broadway production. Except for the subject matter and its R-Rating presentation of blood and gore, this musical while entertaining, compelling didn't forge new ground. The beginning of Sweeny Todd was reminiscent of Mouline Rouge in many ways...the look, the presentation, the setting. The songs themselves while eerily appealing had by the end much of the same tone, same flavor, same blend of sound unlike other musicals. Johnny Depp was exciting and compelling to watch, his expressions, his performance delivery. Perhaps, this musical is one for our times, reflective in an age of death, war, and torture. It is also a reflects on the demise and moral ambiguity of revenge and its descent into the furnace of hell. It is the the naiveté of the youth and the unfortunate abuse of youth that has made some of the have to grow up and take up responsibility far too early. Whether or not this strong social message is sufficient to survive time to maintain this musicals status as a great musical remains to be seen. Otherwise, it will descend itself into a period piece as a good but not classic movie. Seven out of Ten Stars.",7,0,1,21 January 2019
The Polar Express," Style Over Substance
","13 November 2004. A tribute to technology, sort of like what the 1968 New York World's Fair was like. There is a lot of dazzle and Disneyland like effects in this special effects/state of the art animation feature film. Most of the movie feels like a retro-animation harking back to the 1960s and the positive memories of childhood, the mom and pie images of our youth. The animation is again gorgeous (though threatening at the same time as to whether it will eventually replace live actors ten years from now). The dizzying spectacle, just like Disneyland rides, the audience is given an opportunity to go on a 3-D version of a two-dimension animation scene along with a one or two musical pieces right out of a Mary Poppins movie. Unlike 'The Incredibles,' 'The Polar Express' is more style than content, more flash than serious movie making - it is more an experience than entertainment. Tom Hank's voice is overextended and his familiar drawl creeps up in too many of his characters to feel comfortable and becomes distracting. As a conductor and hero boy are two of the best animated characters around - but as father and hobo, it's too obvious that he's the same character. An incredible Christmas treat, eye-popping candy experience, but just one more of a number of super animated feature films that are setting a new standard in animation for years to come. For one a singular moment, this is the must see family movie of Christmas, of years gone by, of magic and hope using the most up to date computer technology available.

Nacho Libre," Jack Black Saves Movie
","2 September 2006. Jack Black's talented satire of this great wrestling genre saves what otherwise would have been a boring and mundane movie. This predictable comedy has Jack Black's ability to achieve comic humor in the many forms, from great body language mimic the Mexican brand of movie making to the one-liners. His timing and energy push this movie forward with interest. However, even with this comic talent, the movie plods along in places and is unable to rise above the script's typical elements, except for Black's new and refreshing presence on the screen. The relationship between Black and the nun is quite entertaining and tasteful while several violent shots appears to be excessive and distract from the movie.

The Town," A 'Heat' -like Crime Thriller
","26 September 2010. With strong parallels to HEAT (1995), THE TOWN however focuses more on the singular perspective of the criminals and an extended focus on the relational significance of the movie. THE TOWN also has scenes suggestive from Matt Damon's BOURNE IDENTITY series and has some suggestive associations with Affleck's and Damon's GOOD WILL HUNTING, with Affleck getting his turn to shine in more ways the one by the end. What makes this movie seem to work is both its weakness and strength having to sensationalize and dramatize what is unlikely to be real police shootouts or bank robberies, yet the detailed stylish manner in which this movie is shot, particularly the action scenes are powerful and resonate with more authenticity because of the apparent and well done quick edits. The chases scenes while avoiding the typical cheap choreographed traffic set up, also is both better in terms of the in your face experience, yet also lazy in terms of the lack of continuity (much like how Olympic down hill or slalom television coverage is obtained with periodic cut away shots with some of the continuous experience cut out. One irritating weak point is the unclear specifics in how (not by who) the FBI is apprised of one of the specific crimes is going down. The emotional connections between crime partners, the risky over the top use of a hardened criminal with a murder mentality is also too much while the delicate balance of Ben Affleck's character is both good and bad, especially in how he ends up dealing with 'women.' Are there really good and bad criminals in this movie or more a shade of gray here? In one pretty impressive climax sequences, the ending series of scenes almost turns into a BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID, nevertheless, the movie is able to pull of one better. This movie understands how to push the audience buttons, making members feel involved in being upset, anxious, fearful, and anticipatory for the outcome. Overall, a superior, decent crime thriller that ranks along side HEAT.",8,2,5,18 January 2019
Closer," A Fascinating Look At Relationships
","30 December 2004. This relational drama offers up a continuing evolution of movies revealing a more cynical but valuable look into relationships. Julia Roberts, Natalie Portman, Jude Law, and Clive Owen all provide different personalities on screen and give the audience a rich experience into the levels of love and torment. This movie operates on a number of different levels and gives its audience both cynical omens for dispair as well as hopeful signs for optimism - a little for everyone. This movie avoids the typical, stereotypical ending and leaves the audience all the more educated and developed as a result. The universal male striving for love and sexual validation along with a female's desire for support and commitment are all on display in this version of intimate triangles and rectangles. Of deceit and honesty, of open communication and avoidance and secrecy, of impulse and spontaneity, of salvation and betrayal. All the emotions are on display in this movie and the audience is the better for it. Nine of out Ten Stars.",9,1,2,24 January 2019
Elf," Enjoyable but Unremarkable Movie
","14 November 2003. This feel-good, funny, and entertaining family Christmas comedy didn't break much new ground nor did it really have the quality performances and scripts needed to make this a classic Christmas movie. It was enjoyable and the laughs and the interest, the storyline were all good but not great. James Cann's character could have been even more compelling (though his acting was great) with more attention to the script writing. It's difficult to balance fantasy fairytales with serious, comedy/drama and that's how come such classics are so rare.

Shutter Island," A Unique Psychological Thriller That Slowly Surpasses its Predecessors
","11 June 2010. Sometimes a movie can fool one once, but rarely can it do it twice and by the end of this movie, it's anybody's guess (though probably not). There's a number of technical, logical flaws that appear in this movie, yet by flipping it, it can also become a superb example of psychologically performed movie right to the end. It's also almost impossible to discuss this perhaps predictable, perhaps not predictable movie without offering spoilers as this movie really to be fairly experienced can't really be described in any detail. The movie must proceed on its own in a linear fashion. What will be of more finely nuanced interest is whether there is any real longer term, lasting cinematic brilliance on a second viewing. Regardless, this one time experience like its predecessors which will become evident by movies end seems to have raised the bar even further and become a tribute to this psychological thriller genre, one of the best to come along in years. Perhaps, the only real difficulties with this movie is the seemingly overt, perhaps over-use of special effects during the first third of the movie and the perhaps too finely imbalance in how the second third of the movie plays on the imagination of the viewer.",9,1,2,18 January 2019
Life of Pi," A Involving Imaginative Story
","15 December 2012. Flaws aside, by the end of the movie there is a fundamental epistemological and for some a spiritual conundrum that underlies even the superficial but powerful experience of the movie itself. Even though the movie trailers are misleading and fail to capture the essence of the movie, even though the 3-D version technically falls short, where a stick use to prod instead becomes unfocused and fuzzy, the use of the extensive flashback is more distracting and lazy-minded, and the two intense physically animalistic deaths are censored unnecessarily, this movie contains a rich narrative, and a struggle for survival between man and beast, nature and rational, logical thought. Even though the movie didn't fully capture the embracing religion diversity of themes, perhaps the movie wasn't really supposed to be so all-encompassing.There are suggestive themes and visions from the sci fi vision of Solaris (1972 and 2002), of the historical, haunting period film Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975), and the animal movies of Dances with Wolves (1990) and Never Cry Wolf (1983). The movie would have likely been more powerful presented in its own chronologically evolving way, yet the story and the mystery is so powerful that can transcend the medium and create an intense, emotionally and intellectually compelling movie experience.",9,0,0,17 January 2019
Ocean's Thirteen," Tame and Tired
","9 June 2007. This third and hopefully final version of Ocean takes a almost tired look at a prolonged criminal caper in Vegas that isn't as exciting nor captivating as its predecessors. The beginning plot outline seems almost desperate and forced together. Too characters, difficult editing and transitions, no time to really get caught up into most of the scenes. There are a few nice comedy pieces sprinkled throughout but absent the strength of female character starlets leaves this movie more about trying to be impressive without much power nor punch. While semi-literate, actively involving and managing to make it to the end credits, this movie moves more on inertia than interesting characters and tense plot situations.

Lost in Translation," Like Real Slumming in Japan
","14 October 2003 (revised January 25, 2019). This movie reminds me of Bridges of Madison County. While the setting is Japan in this movie, the relationship seems similar. What the audience is exposed to is a slice of informal life of the real Japan and this movie comes across more of a documentary without narrative about two people who find themselves in Japan. Without much of a script in appearance, this slow moving, more evocative feeling sensual movie is more about sensations than about drama or storyline. The movie becomes more of an experience and instead evokes the more inscrutable depths of a drama. The mesmerizing backdrop of Japan and the realistic sensation of actually living an ordinary life of two people's experiences and friendship are compelling.

Interstellar," The Breakthrough Sci Fi Movie of the Decade
","8 November 2014. Interstellar (2014). What stands out in this movie is the role of emotion and how the script introduces a fascinating 'long-distance' relational component of parent-child interaction unlike those movies with a similar powerful, intense, and emotive impact found in the horror movies of Jennifer Connelly's performance in Dark Water (2005), Radha Mitchell's performance in Silent Hill (2006) or John Cusack's performance in 1408 (2007). Interstellar is today's version of the 1950s sci fi classic Forbidden Planet (1956) in storytelling, big scale, and special effects, perhaps rivaling 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) of the sixties, or the sci fi monster thriller hit of the1970s Alien (1979) in its scale and authenticity or the inspirational, newly presented idea film of the last decade of the super hit Avatar (2009). The interweaving of two story lines in this movie was also a huge editing and script challenge that was well handled and presented on screen. Interstellar is solid story telling with its dramatic but not overly stylish Hollywood gloss and glamour as of say Avatar or Forbidden Planet. Even Ann Hathaway's under-stated surprisingly diminutive performance stands out as a directorial and acting highlight considering Hathaway's bigger than life screen presence and public popularity of the past that enhancing the impact of the movie.The overall direction and performances in this movie are introspective and authentic in their approach much like that found in the sci fi drama Stranded (2001) or Apollo 18 (2011) that don't rely on big screen stereotypical theatrics to wow its audiences. Somehow this supposedly epic sci fi adventure is as intimate as Cloud Atlas (2012) was as large spanning literally hundreds of years. Unlike a number of other review references comparing Interstellar to the visual style of sci fi action thriller Inception (2010) or some brief resemblance to Gravity (2013), Interstellar seems to take more from the sci fi relational drama Upside Down (2013) and the sci fi space drama Elysium (2013). As for plot outline, one can argue that Interstellar has more in common with the sci fi mystery of Oblivion (2013) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968 ) especially with noted theoretical leading astrophysicist Kip Thorne as scientific consultant and executive producer. And in contrast, the minimalist music score is in departure to A Space Odyssey's dominating and sometimes haunting musical score. This mind twisting experience includes pieces of the emotion and twisting, off balance characteristics of Déjà vu (2006).Some might complain about the extended dialogue, there really is a more satisfying exchange of relevant thoughtful ideas during this movie that are interspersed among amazing special effects that are leading edge for our literal time and space. When it comes to cerebral and emotive impact, Interstellar does so in a more narrative, mystery drama fashion as Ender's Game (2013) hit the similar points using a war action, adventure motif. The sci fi television mini-series The Triangle (2005) brought many of the intriguing and suspense aspects in a lower budgeted, popular mass audience approach, but also indicating how Interstellar was presented in a quality, big budget, high definition big screen format with a corresponding mesmerizing impact. What makes Interstellar so markedly ground breaking is director's Christopher Nolan's leap with this movie in its freshness and significantly different visual presentation, its tight editing and retention of the human relational importance while also presenting to dual track story outline in seamless and meaningful power way. Interstellar recalls the similar breathing mind-bending experiences in Brainstorm (1983) with Natalie Wood and Christopher Walken. Contact (1997) with Jodie Foster and also co-starring Matthew McConaughey, the children's version of A Wrinkle In Time (2002), the otherworldly time altering classic of Slaughter-House Five (1972), the haunting alien ambiance of Solaris (2002).",10,0,0,15 January 2019
Full Metal Jacket," A Raw and Stark Look At War
","5 June 2016. Before Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan (1998) and its vicarious and explosive war during World War II opening, there was Full Metal Jacket that revealed a glaring look into boot camp and the prolonged isolating and deadly experience of patrol in Vietnam. Stanley Kubrick brings his classic stark look to the war film genre not with action but with storyline and the use of real time to expose the audience to a vicarious experience of war through the eyes of Marines. At times documentary in feel and at other times an artistic expose into the harsh realities of basic training and the frailty of life in real field of battle. As opposed to Saving Private Ryan's big canvass, Kubrick focuses on the more narrow but intimate smaller scope of the personal experience of small battles that are likely to have been more prominent in every soldier's experience.Full Metal Jacket ranks among the war classics of Platoon (1986), more authentic than Apocalypse Now (1979), less use of exciting action and less personalized presentation of Black Hawk Down (2001), less political satire of that Kubrick directed in his own Dr. Strangelove (1964), Full Metal Jacket introduces a more raw and realistic look at war that an earlier film Sidney Lumet's Fail-Safe (1964) or the later films such as We Were Soldiers (2002) or Jarhead (2005).",9,0,0,13 January 2019
American Sniper," Decent But Missing The Crispness
","18 January 2015. This movie is about Chris Kyle, a real Navy SEAL, who made several tours in the Iraq War and considered the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history. What this movie attempts to accomplish apparently is both an action movie and a biographical movie about Chris's wartime experiences and his transformation as a human being as a result on his relationships. While the movie does a decent job with both, it somehow misses the mark.Both Enemy At The Gates (2001) and Spy Game (2001) offer more richness and depth of the sniper experience. In Spy Game, Brad Pitt is trained in the nuances of espionage while in American Sniper, Bradley Cooper, is seen being trained in intense but more basic training. But one would expect to see more specialized training which of SEALs are well known and which supposedly is put into some use later in the movie. There are some questionable decisions or lack of both in strategy and on the ground on the part of the United States military that are explained or complained about in the movie. While there is some rationale for the one-sided portrayal of Americans as the good guys and Iraqi insurgents as the bad guys, Enemy At The Gates seemed more intimate because both Jude Law as a Russian sniper and Ed Harris as a German sniper are presented as human beings with a sort of dignity and code of ethics, who respected each other (of course, in reality it's likely impossible to know how Chris and his arch-enemy felt about each other). Nevertheless, Chris's brother's character seems underdeveloped and possibly of some important value to the story of Chris Kyle which was apparently not incorporated into the movie.As for the cinematography, there is something lacking in the crispness and intimacy of the photography that seems to distance the audience from the action. Such sharp resolution, especially with a biography, is made more potent in such movies as Saving Private Ryan (1998), Black Hawk Down (2001), Hurt Locker (2008), Jar Head (2005), We Were Soldiers (2002), and even Anglina Jolie's Unbroken (2014). Perhaps, an excellent portrayal of war might to found in the docudrama television mini-series about World War I, The Great War Diary (2014) As for character development, there seems to be something missing here too. Perhaps this is unavoidable, as a military man who experienced several tours of war and Chris's upbringing may have shut off his inner self from the rest of the world, but nevertheless, the intensity found in such characters as Angelina Jolie's performance in Changeling (2008) or Christian Slater's performance in He Was A Quiet Man (2007) is missing.It is understandable why this movie is being nominated for awards, especially due to its relevant subject matter, the impact of war time experience on soldiers, yet even at the end, there seems to be a lack of full awareness and understanding on the part of the audience as to Chris's experience towards life and death.",7,0,17,15 January 2019
The Devil Wears Prada," A Solid Comedy-Drama Where Streep Shines
","2 July 2006. It's very difficult nowadays to produce a comedy without the usual stereotypes and The Devil Wears Prada must negotiate a very delicate balance between comedy and drama and popular audience attention and critical serious film-making. This movie does well in managing this dangerous terrain of high fashion and the usual cliques. The soundtrack was among the most amazing musical selectons and worked effectively with a highly powerful energizing musical score with the script and action. Meryl Streep as well as Ann Hathaway are great in their interplay while Director David Frankel manages to maintain the fine line of avoiding exaggerated melodrama while allowing the actors to carry the more subtle humorous undertone. Yet Meryl Streep and the script carries the movie with its biting, edgy character and the typical outcome is much more a question of tone and feeling than obvious, overt, and crassness (to which she was nominated for Oscar's Best Actress). Just as the world of high fashion, ironically, the hyper-energy, the highly powerful personalities, the rapid pace is brought successfully to the screen. Streep creates a richly, colorful character while Ann Hathaway manages to provide a more subdued but as strong and quiet a character in transformation but not overthetop. The only weakness of this movie is more one of having to address popular audiences and profits wherein the movie may have had to avoid a more hard-hitting even sharper dramatic edge. Even so, The Devil Wears Prada is a classic comedy drama that is compelling, entertaining, and rich in its characters. It is an almost perfect blend of music, set design, intelligent script, and acting that together combine to create a movie that worth seeing again and again for the sheer creative, fluid emotional outburst of comedy and drama.

Gone Baby Gone," A Brilliant Piece of Screen Writing
","11 November 2007. In perhaps the best script of the year, Ben Affleck has reprised his writing talent since demonstrating his talent with his collaboration with Matt Damon in GOOD WILL HUNTING (1997). This amazingly psychological mystery thriller is blunt, hard-edged, raw, and authentic in its depiction of small, inner city-neighborhood life. There are twists and turns here that all eventually lead to a logical but emotionally unsettling resolution that has no right or wrong answers to it. The photography and direction are spot on. Unlike Sean Penn's more cinematically, densely, and overly technically complex INTO THE WILD (2007), Ben Affleck has kept it forward, direct and tell the story along with the hidden blank spaces that will inevitably filled in later that even the protagonist, played by Casey Affleck isn't fully aware of. Except for one brief scene with a crazed woman coming up that starts behind a close door, this movie was technical perfect and perhaps the stereotypical drunken police scene reduced the power of the dialogues, inner turmoil. One of the richest, deeply involving, and compelling movie in years. Nine out of Ten Stars.",9,1,2,21 January 2019
Captain America: The First Avenger," An All American Movie
","2 August 2012. It's rare to find a superhero movie that literally and effusively represents the American spirit, harking back to the 40s, the classical war time stereotypes and perhaps in the Civil War spirit of sacrifice. The ending of this movie is particularly, if not somewhat predictable both American in its relief and yet haunting in its loss. A movie for the downtrodden and the overcoming of evil by innocence of goodness. It's hard to say whether or not this movie is an outdated, old-fashioned, naive young adult fairy-tale of comic book fantasy or a renewed sense of retro-inspiration and a refreshing rebirth of the American spirit has seemingly has been lost in today's selfish, egoistic society. Overall, this is an American action-superhero thriller that encompasses all the elements of both traditional movie classics and contemporary special effects.",8,0,0,17 January 2019
The Bourne Ultimatum," Great Action But Less Satisfying Than Supremacy
","3 August 2007. Warning: Spoilers. The beginning of the third installment of Jason Bourne begins more chaotically, more like television's 'Alias's' opening scenes. There isn't much plot development or understanding regarding what is happening with Bourne that at this point seems an important piece of information. There are also several weak plot scenarios, including how manipulative The Guardian reporter's way of getting killed, Bourne's lame set up of Landy's meeting place, and weak and somewhat confusing re-introduction of the CIA asset chasing after Bourne in a car later in the movie, and the very ending scene that leaves the movie conclusion without any doubts about Jason Bourne. There are however some great action scenes and one of the most riveting close hand to hand combat scenes to date. Bourne and Parson's role in the movie together is rather unique in espionage films and the ultimate Bourne revelation about who he his is rather telling and powerful. Overall, the movie with its action packed thrills, strong plot background, and techno-gadgetry, still loses its punch with its flaws. Seven Out of Ten Stars.Edited addition: After reviewing this movie twice more, the chaos of the beginning sequence becomes more intelligible whe one becomes aware of this scene as a continuing sequence from the ending of the Bourne Supremacy (a nice tie-in actually). The Guardian's reporter killing no longer seems manipulative but a nice bit of intelligence work on the part of the CIA and the interplay between a civilian and Bourne and the reality of the situation is much more understandable now. Bourne's setting up Landy's meeting again seems much more in line with the rest of the movie and instead of being lame, just another of Bourne/Landy's cat and mouse play with a new player, Vosen in play. A few weak pointss do remain in this movie - the way Jason Bourne gets a police car out of the parking garage since most parking garages have spikes to prevent a car from exiting an entrance way, how Bourne manages to drive a car off backwards off a parking terrace since the wall was vertical and there wasn't anything obvious to actually lift the car up into the air the way Jason was able to get a scooter up over a wall embankment earlier in the movie. Finally, the most unnecessary, last film sequence of Bourne was truly a waste and not intregal to the movie's approach and style - it was too obvious and amateur. The way Bourne killed the first asset by choking was unusually creative and the ending sequences oof the movie avoiding a lot of action was a much more sophisticated way to end. Bourne and Parson's relationship is again one of the most delicately portrayed of any in espionage history. Eight out of Ten Stars. [12/30/07].",8,0,0,21 January 2019
Notting Hill," A Smart and Entertaining, Stylish Romantic Comedy
","11 January 2010. Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant have a chemistry on screen that is layered with a smart script and for the most part underplayed plot outline (except for the rushing car scene in the movie). There are numerous tender moments that have a timelessness element, allowing the audience to immerse itself in the emotions and feelings while at the same time the script captures the dry humor Hugh Grant very well. Julia Robert's character gets to play a role within a role with authentic overtones without exploiting the whole tabloid scene. This romantic comedy focuses more on the common, inner truth of super stardom and avoids the more simplistic approach to slapstick and overly dramatic comedic acting. The ending of this movie is a soft-landing approach that is atypical for most movies of this genre but offers more of a richer heart-felt honesty in its delivery that seems to permeate most of this movie. 8/10.",8,0,0,20 January 2019

Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn stands out as one of the best performances of all time - her acting and capture of the one of the greatest actresses is a tribute to both Hepburn and Blanchett - a strong contender for best actress. The Aviator also captures one of the most frightening and dramatic crash scenes (the literally bursts even further from the trailers). This intense and psychological and physically revealing movie is raw and hard-hitting. Leonardo offers up a spectacular breakthrough performance, maturing as an actor and taking on the more difficult job of method acting (having to become another person) and shed his own persona and his past historical performance from Titanic. Interestly, this movie isn't perfect in that unfortunately, this movie is only half a movie and is unable to offer its audience with the Godfather I and II effect that would make the movie experience complete.",9,1,2,24 January 2019
Oblivion," An Almost Perfection Fusion Sci Movie
","18 April 2013. A great movie even with the unnecessarily and perhaps outdated use of switches and manual instrumentation for Tom Cruise's bubble cruiser, an almost nauseating voice-over narrative at the beginning unlike the acceptable to some voice over of Blade Runner (1982), a patently fake looking lunar moon, and the disappearance of a major female character occurring off camera. This is one of those movies where such flaws are easily overcome by the rest of the visual spectacle, artistic landscape and set design, and of course the storyline. What is fascinating about this tent-pole sci fi psychological action thriller extravaganza is that it isn't all that original, but nevertheless with its tight fusion of previous incarnations that are so well weaved into the storyline, producing a substantive film with two compelling twists offering an American theme ending that it becomes more than its parts and becoming a very well made movie.There are strong elements taken from Total Recall (1990) and improved on, devoid of the stereotypical arch enemy and false persona and replaced both by an underlying emotional humanity as well as a detached alien presence. There are elements of The Matrix (1999) but not as eerily and epic-like presentation retaining more of simplicity and uncluttered landscape of Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1982) but incorporating elements of awesomeness as found in Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) and psychological unbalancing as found in Source Code (2011). The twists in this movie is similar to that found in Moon (2009) which focused more on the singular psychological and ethical aspect of a man confronted with loneliness and in which Oblivion finds a way to expand of the more tortured and dichotomous incongruity of the multiplicity of human life or that of a man having to face up to what had been an entire illusion one's existence as in Planet of the Apes (1968).Even so, Oblivion manages to retain a persistent theme of love and intimacy Fahrenheit 451 (1966) and as convoluted as Solaris (2002). The musical sound track resonates in places as symphonic as those found in Electric Dreams (1984) or Wavelength (1983). Other familiar themes may have been taken from Tom Cruise's own Minority Report (2002) and Surrogates (2009) as well as one of the sci fi classics of all time Blade Runner (1982) that dwelt with human identity and emotional connections in a dystrophic future.As an afterthought, the voice-over at the beginning of the movie actually is quite clever and relevant if one ties it to the ending of the movie.",9,2,2,17 January 2019
Burn After Reading," A Tragic Comedy About Middle-Age Dumb People
","10 April 2009. This movie is a quirky black comedy about the craziness of relationships, self-obsessions, and mistaken-who-done-its starring George Clooney, Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, Brad Pitt, and Tilda Swinton. The delicate balance of drama and black comedy precariously teeters and barely survives a credible ending. The characters are fascinating, particularly Brad Pitt's pretty out there in his wankiness. George Clooney also offers a rather compelling and out of character performance. Overall, the movie seems to over-reach its target and the script isn't quite as tight nor as satisfying as the characters themselves. By the end, one feels that while the movie was fun, entertaining, and yes tragic, there just seems to be something missing to be completely satisfied with the movie. 7/10.",7,1,2,20 January 2019
The Bourne Identity," Compelling With a Flawed Plot
","16 June 2002. Taking into account three or four weak points in this spy thriller, The Bourne Identity boasted a wonderful car chase scene that didn't necessarily go over the top, which included much more realistic images of passing cars, a Matt Damon that hit the ground (sometimes literally) running with his deft moves and struggling to find his identity. There's even a female who knows when to stay and when to run. I can't imagine, though, how another CIA assassin can expose himself so easily in the movie, unlike Enemy at the Gates, the cat and mouse game was too easy which takes place in an open field, how a meeting place could be so lax in CIA surveillance, and how one character (a supporting role) could ever be left a live at the end of the movie. But even so, the movie is compelling, always entertaining, and pretty easy to follow. Today's current events, however, cast a deep shadow over this movie now that CIA assassinations appear to have received the stamp of approval by the President, the U.S. government, and even the American public. I guess the collateral damage and corresponding retaliation is worth the risk.",7,0,0,27 January 2019

What really stands out during the first half of this movie was how unnecessarily disjointed the editing became with the non-chronological scenes using flashbacks and forward jumps in order to tell superman's origins. Man of Steel initially incorporates visual similarities to the alien ambiance of Avatar (2009) and later visual elements of the more raw and gritty District 9 (2009), The Matrix (1999) and Inception (2010). As with these special effects extravaganzas, there will always be more and better movies to come and like Avatar and Inception, Man of Steel has lifted the bar moderately for now to present an enhanced 3-D experience. Such advances in appearance, however, can't overcome the disjointed quality of how this story unfolded until later in the movie when the action takes over to the end of the movie.Unlike the horror movie Constantine (2005) that uses primarily a linear chronological unfolding, where its director included judicious use of flashbacks, but only to enhance the story, not to dominate it. Man of Steel's unfolding story seems to have been based on avoiding extended scenes lengths to reduce cost or compress the time to supposedly pick up the pace. Even From Up on Poppy Hill, a Japanese animated movie that came out this year understood the selective and deliberate use of flashbacks that didn't necessarily confuse and jolt the audience suddenly ahead in time or back in time like some audience member to be manipulated for the sake of the director's interest. What made Ryan Lantern's character in Green Lantern (2011) so enjoyable was its depiction of the character development and human connections and discovery. Omitted in this version of Superman is the even the initial fascinating discovery of Superman by his adopted parents or even an extended evolving childhood development in which psychological attachment is so important a period in any character's life. Kill Bill No. 1 (2002) and No. 2 (2003) were a few of the action movies in which the use of non-linear flashbacks was well executed and didn't confuse or break the rhythm of the movie, even Elektra (2005) was able to accomplish this same feat.Unlike The Matrix (1999) where the antagonist is primarily an unemotional machine, where there is logically a black and white element to the antagonist's character, the human resemblance and actually the literal adoption of the human form as Superman's biological parents makes for the use of the black and white stereotypical antagonist as two-dimensional qualities quite inconsistent with a three-dimensional visual movie format. Spiderman (2002) perhaps reflects the best of allowing a movie to unfold in its storytelling narrative, that includes the same life experiences as occurred in Man of Steel albeit which was more condensed that included a moment of discovery (unlike that omitted in Man of Steel), the attachment to one's parents and the parent-son conflicts. But in Spiderman series, even a more multi-dimensional antagonists that made for a more compelling, balanced emotional tension as in Spiderman (2002) and more recently Spiderman 3 (2007) where the Sandman character is a compelling example of a more complex character that allows for a more reflective and substantive satisfying emotional experience.Even as Christopher Nolan who helped with the movie's story, whose Dark Knight (2008) visual design and lighting were the problem but not in Man of Steel, nevertheless unlike Dark Knight the attempt to compress many individual scenes and history into this movie didn't come off well. The Dark Knight succeeded in its depiction of extended deliciously wicked moral dilemma's while Man of Steel that seemed more by the numbers. While it is commendable that Russell Crowe as Jor-El in place of the Marlon Brando of Superman (1978) has an even more compassionate and emotive portrayal, the script still didn't allow Russell Crowe the breadth of character development, interaction that could cement the beginning scenes. Then at some point more wasn't sufficiently better and as the awesome Inception (2010) like visual effects and other superhero banging and crashing into buildings continue they becomes very overdone by the ending of the movie.Overall, Man of Steel is an impressive presentation of this superhero, yet it just seemed overly chaotic, a bit over done in places, a bit by the numbers, and overly ambitious in its use of special effects.",8,1,1,16 January 2019
Armageddon," Big Budget Action, Adventure Blockbuster
","24 May 2016. Weathering the release of Deep Impact two months earlier, Armageddon relies on its bigger budget, bigger explosions, and bigger intense build-up of non-stop crises, and larger than life predictable entertainment to overcome a slow start to outperform Deep Impact. This big action adventure relies on a scripted pattern of hanging by your seat mini-episodes loaded with exaggerated humor, superhero outcomes, and light-hearted banter, especially from wacked out Steve Buscemi. This action fantasy is almost pure entertainment with the requisite love interest, the human sacrifices, and the frantic mission controller. This movie pushes all the audience buttons, moves at a whithering fast pace, and glorifies the Russian stereotypes to an almost embarrassing degree.",7,1,3,13 January 2019
The Village," A Sensitive, Unique Look At Occult-Like Events
","The Village (2004)7/10A Sensitive, Unique Look At Occult-Like Events29 January 2005. Warning: Spoilers. Mr. Shyamalan has attempted a very difficult task of creating a horror-like movie with a major twist. In an effort to use audience's past impression of his prior works, Mr. Shyamalan taps into this impression in a major way to create an illusion - the major premise of this film. In an effective, though not entirely satisfactory way, Mr. Shyamalan is able to pull off a very human, sensitive, and thoughtful thriller that reflects more of humanity than on the occult or horror. It is impossible to know if any other director/writer could have improved on Mr. Shyamalan's attempt in this movie since he is operating on a singular premise of fear, horror, and monster-mythology in a way that is perhaps unattainable. He is to be commended for his efforts at an entirely different way to perceive reality and reflects both the confusion in today's world to another alternative way to seeing it that in the end may have not ultimate resolution.

It is also confusing for the non-initiated and is unbalanced in its presentation of the duel between the good and bad guys. While this movie is entertaining and keeps up the interest, partly depending on the pounding musical track, it still loses in disguises and believability in several places.

The Revenant," Gorgeous with good performances
","A gorgeous and well-acted movie with weaknesses. Leonardo deCaprio like his role as Howard Hughes in The Aviator (2004) shows that he understands suffering well as a mountain man in Revenant. Director Alejandro Inarritu incorporates a visceral cinematography style as found in Saving Private Ryan (1998) into his own visual aspect of men battling each other and seems to take advantage of the use of sharp artistic images along with crisp sound effects that made Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) so powerful and realistic. Using haunting and powerful strains of music that at times echo Christopher Nolan's Interstellar, Inarritu enhances the movie's lengthy edits without dialogue.

","19 January 2016. Leonardo deCaprio like his role as Howard Hughes in The Aviator (2004) shows that he understands suffering well as a mountain man in Revenant.

Revenant has many similarities to another stunning survival movie, Mel Gibson's Apocalypto (2006) and the epic western, Kevin Costner's Dances with Wolves that won best movie Oscars twenty-five years ago.Yet unlike more personally and sustain intensity of the true to life survival film, Kevin Macdonald's Touching the Void (2003, there are plot weaknesses throughout the movie that mildly detract from the movie's rhythm and authenticity. There is a scene beautifully shot from high above a river and yet realistically the actual path to the river seems impossibly difficult to navigate as that point in the movie. There isn't any actual shot of the use of flint in making an actual fire. And likely another in an extremely cold river would have died within minutes of hypothermia. The death scene of a single Indian seems unlikely when the white man survives nearby. And any person trying to avoid being tracked is also a fool to walk in a visually stunning scene in the middle of an open and barren now field. Finally it is unlikely a manhunt as choreographed in The Revenant would have unfolded so blatantly easily as it did.A major problem with this movie is how the director pushes the limits of artistic presentation over the storyline. Sean Penn's survival movie, Into The Wild (2007) is a good example where the director's fantastic camera eye for beauty begins to transform into the foreground of the movie's plot, and here in The Revenant falling into a tree scene is one glaring example of overkill towards unbelievability. The last problem with this movie is its ending which is overly extended and the Indian women's character development and role in the movie is severely minimized to the point that a most poignant redemption ending is lost and overlooked.The Revenant deserves best acting, cinematographic awards, but it can't quite offer the completeness for best movie.",9,0,1,13 January 2019
Bridge of Spies," An Intense, Powerful, Captivating Spy Thriller
","24 October 2015. Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance star in this amazing, intense, and compelling movie about the behind the scenes negotiations between James Donovan, a United States lawyer, and the U.S.S.R. and East Germany for the exchange of Rudolph Abel, a convicted Russian spy and Gary Powers, whose American U-2 spy plane was shot down over Russia in 1961. This mainstream movie directed by Steven Spielberg brings great cinematography, setting, and performances to build the tension, suspense through acting and script especially without action and fireworks. This is truly a big screen, big tent-pole event movie based on historic events as well as the poignant fear and importance of the human spirit in the face of a frightening, uncertain foreign world.There is a pungent feeling of both dread and hope in this dark mysterious world of espionage. Bridge of Spies carries its weight of deeper psychological warfare reminiscent of John LeCarre's classic Tinker, Tailer, Soldier, Spy (1979) or Breach (1997) and with setting a similar tone and flavor of The American (2010) or Sum of All Fears (2002) as well as a same period spy movie The Spy Who Came In From the Cold (1965) or The Russia House (1990) presenting a smaller scale, or the more broader sweep found in The Good Shepard (2006), all possessing a powerful espionage theme. This movie is riveting, capturing the visceral emotive uncertainty and fear, sometimes powerlessness, and sometimes faithful confidence that arises from an understanding the serious game being played. In addition there are some nicely timed and edited subtle humor to balance the drama occurring on screen. Overall, this is one of the best movies of the year.",9,0,0,13 January 2019
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," A Disappointing Disjointed Movie
","11 December 2010. This beginning of the end for the Harry Potter series is a disappointment and apparently without the book the movie is unable to stand alone as a movie and instead becomes a disjointed, disconnected series of movie scenes that initially begins with fusion between a TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY (1991) action thriller and a junior version of BRAZIL (1985) and a retro-stylistic, parody version of the cold war, totalitarianism. The rest of the movies eventually almost becomes more like an expensive video game as Harry and company get to survive to the next level in a series of disconnected, random levels. Throughout there are logic gaps, omitted scenes that avoided much needed character, plot development. The purported transformation from magical children entertainment into a darker fantastic juvenile action thriller merges too close the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy which in many ways remains a fantasy classic and by comparison pales in J.R.R.

Minghella brings to the screen the harsh, human brutality of war and its consequences in a mini-epic version as well as primarily offering the audience a haunting and powerful love story through looks, voice-overs, behavior, pregnant pauses with tidbits of humor. Nicole offers another outstanding performance along with Jude Law and Renée Zellweger in capturing the idealistic love of passion and commitment. Implicit in this movie is the insanity of war and its demeaning and cruel outcomes, particularly on women. A directly relevant and much needed reminder of reality in our times of today - the human cost of war must be kept in mind and the toll it takes in terms of love lost and families torn apart.

The sequel out of necessity was unable to capture the freshness and the character development of the first movie and had to rely more on the action thrills and more of the me vs. them plot of good and evil. There were so slow parts but by the end the emotive climax was solid. The movie was helped along with some substantive and well balanced tidbits of one-liners of humor and the involving action sequences (some reminiscent of Croaching Tiger, Flying Dragon (2000) animated style maintained the momentum and interest in the movie. The actors' voices were less pronounced and distracting as it appeared that the sources of the real actors didn't seem to be so identifiable, except Jack Black, and enabled the audience to focus more on the animated characters than the actual actors as actors themselves.",7,0,1,18 January 2019

","30 August 2006. This dynamite of an R-Rated family movie with plenty of swearing (like real life) has a powerful bang of both drama and comedy in such a short space of time, it's a fun balance between laughter and crying. Surprisingly, the stereotypical characters are well-suited to each other and never really overused. The storyline is solid, the acting entertaining and meaningful. The characters are symbolic of many of us. The only weaknesses would be the height of riotness of the action sometimes takes one aback, the lack of consequences at times, and the perhaps unrealistic final sequence (even though it had a nice consistent and involving twist). Silence is golden is well portrayed in one scene. Death is handled well in another. This is a delicious little bit of sunshine even in the worst of times.

Knowing," A Decent But Not Spectacular Movie
","22 March 2009. This movie is above average because it appears to deliberately avoid the most obvious movie clichés but just can't completely ignore the screaming, emotionally wrought female scenes nor the male drinking phenomenon of stereotypical movies. The movie also panders to the audience's sensibilities of movie disaster special effects which are designed to make the audience go ooh and awe and almost succeed, though 'The Aviator' (2004) has a much more potent, in your seat and pants accident scene. For some people, this movie is likely to be somewhat predictable like later Director Shyamalan movies such as 'The Village' (2004). This movie is also supposedly a 'bittersweet' family drama with a twist (that supposedly must not be revealed) that is supposed to make this movie more European, breaking the American style, for which it can be given a few bonus points. The connection between the eerie prediction sequences and the ending are alas not really tied up and seem more manipulative. Overall, this is a decent, but not really original nor qualitatively expressive movie of deep meaning, even though the script would have you believe otherwise. 7/10.",7,0,0,20 January 2019
Hugo," A Fascinating and Captivating Family Mystery Movie
","27 November 2011. The 3-D effects of this period movie while not perfect are superior in quality and add to the brilliance and visual impact of the solid, personal and intimate and focused storyline. Whether or not its a technological problem, the most noticeable weakness of the film is the failure to capture the enhanced ambiance of the 3-D potential of the vapor and mist that seemed to be found in many of the scenes in Hugo. Nevertheless the fusion of actual historical characters, the use of 3-D to recall the earliest days of cinema combined with mystery drama of this movie results in a remarkable captivating movie plot that involves the audience on the number of levels - visually, auditory (with notable sound differentials between speakers), clear and singular plot without distracting subplots. The implicit fantasy genre elements of this movie actually are more realized in reality and magic than in sci-fi or fantasy as part of the storyline itself which in some ways makes this movie even more remarkable and involving because of its actual possibilities as an authentic event. The weakness part of the movie occurred toward the end of the movie with the train station's guard who at the last minute makes a decision which appeared to be more based on another character's presence then his own which significantly reduces the emotive and ethical impact of the scene. The two 3-D scenes of the faces of at different times of the station guard and Kingsley are perhaps some of the finest uses of 3-D yet in its achievement of visual clarity and enhancement to cinema since 3-D came into its own. The additional fascinating element of the craftsmanship, the building and fixing and repairing of objects that has seemed to have gone of out fashion in today's contemporary throw away society of printers and consumables makes for both a traditional but enlightening and uplifting moral tale. This is a story of our time using the past, the good parts of it unlike perhaps Charles Dickens. With elements from A.I. (2001), Polar Express (2004) the fairy tale that becomes real makes for a truly memorable movie.",8,0,0,18 January 2019
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Bubble Gum Movie
","What makes for a great film? Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines (T3) presents a good example for discussion. Take a relatively decent plot with a subtle twist at the end, base the movie on an old but classic (meaning a 30 year old sci fi concept - see 'Colossus: The Forbin Project') and though in some dramatic elements and special effect chase and hunt scenes and you have an American film formula that is hard to beat, at least in America. T3 represents all that is American. The good American individual hero versus the bad, evil enemy (in this case Machines), at plenty of action, a female counterpart (in both good and evil roles), use some emotional scenes for depth, a bit of humor, use a simple and straightforward plot for the America mental attention span and you have a good entertaining movie production that also makes people feel both good and bad at the same time. Like Jaws, this particular American formula its American consumption diets like candy. And with as guilty of pleasure as may be described, T3 seems to work well in its almost seamless, consistently riveting scenes. With only a number of doubtless unrealistic scenes (pauses for dramatic effect where the characters are really supposed to continue running for their very lives and the unbelievable law enforcement chase scenes and rather extraordinary demolition of property visuals), T3 seems to pull off enough of the summer bubblegum fantasy theme as to make everything acceptable. Eight stars out of ten for decent, if not really original, action and drama.",8,1,1,29 August 2019
"I, Robot"," Better Than Expected

Isaac Asimov might have turned over in his grave at the trailers for this movie, but after watching the whole movie, I gather he might have settle for a mild approval though the primary core values of his Robot series were not strictly followed. This movie was better than expected and it wasn't so stereotypical that the movie wasn't just another them vs. us movie. A little more complex, a little more deep, this sci fi version of I, Robot presents Wil Smith with his usual wit (though perhaps too much of the same action figure) with a more and more deeper substance as his performances in movies continue. Not as finely nuanced and complicated as Isaac Asimov would have hoped, but perhaps his Robot series and Foundation series like Dune and Lord of the Rings before them, may become a serious mini-movie series in reality if the evolution of the movie industry can somehow capture the genius of this sci fi author's work.

The storyline of alternative Spiderman possibilities while definitely not new in the sci fi movie industry, it finally brought out the quantum possibilities described in superhero comic books that have been around for decades with a pizzazz and an excitement. The humor incorporated into movie's dialogue is like a live comedic act that brings continuous smiles throughout the movie while its emotional drama and bittersweet edginess offers up a refined balance to the entire film. There is a human genuineness and emotional connection to the audience with a surprising focus on father-son relationships.

It's distracting to have some many improbables that spoil the action at times, but it does keep one glued to the screen regardless of what happens. The build up at the beginning isn't bad, but the foul language seems out of place periodically. The ending isn't bad either, it has a self-reflective, hard edged quality about it that leaves one thinking. Way to go Angelina Jolie. Finally, there are weak plot points as far as greatest assassins go. Taken together, the storyline is very good, the action is very good, the humanity is also very good, it's just that putting all together didn't quite result in a great movie.

","24 July 2010. There are some unbelievable and prolong action scenes that still retain a compelling possibility along with a striking and increasing adventure, thriller power that depending on the level of authenticity and balance between over the top adventure action vs. the more technically smart and intelligent cerebral espionage movie, SALT can either be a great action movie or an over the top, overly dramatic copy of Jason Bourne. A closer view of the first escape scene helps to reveal the second security door's dispostion for continuity sake. There are number of nice twists along with one of the most consistent nonlethal action movie scripted. Angelina Jolie performs well overall. The first third of the movie also has chase scenes that border on too extraordinary.The TERMINATOR sound track beats in the background of a number of dramatic impending action scenes. In comparison to Matt Damon and THE BOURNE IDENTITY, Angelina Jolie's character doesn't seem to really have the poise and espionage talent during the first half of the movie, but then her persona and script, directing begins to really shine along with some nice action moves.

Silver Linings Playbook," Finally An Emotionally Gripping Mental Health Drama
","2 December 2012. Certainly not a Hemingway movie. Finally a full feature film with mental health as its central core that captures the visceral and authentic impact of mental illness without the cliques, stereotypes. At it is for the fact that director/writer David O. Russell avoids these pitfalls that allows the real captivating and emotive vibrancy of the this family and relational drama come alive. Such movies don't need the extra baggage of sweeping epic dramatization as The Sound of Music (1965) and occult horror special effects Constantine (2005) or unusual circumstances as Fly Away Home (1996) or The Wrestler (2008) to create fascinating characters and situations from fantasy and instead can follow a well-written script to make its emotive impact as Where the Lilies Bloom (1974) or even the more unlikely intensity surrounding Elizabethtown (2005) or A History of Violence (2005) or the exotic foreign look into Slumdog Millionaire (2008). Helen (2009) opened the door to mental illness as a decent movie drama sub-genre by itself following up with the authentic human drama found in Margot at the Wedding (2007). Silver Lining Playbook is a penetrating look at the behind the close doors and sometimes not so closed doors of real life disputes, family conflict without resort to hyper-drama disconnected with most lives in America or around the world as A Beautiful Mind (2001), The Fisher King (1991), or He Was a Quiet Man (2007). Even a relatively common as unemployment and poverty might be as depicted in Seven Pounds (2008) or even more closely aligned in topical matter to The Soloist (2008) dealing with schizophrenia, Silver Lining Playbook focuses on our family or a family that we likely know.Silver Lining Playbook stands out from even Girl, Interrupted (1999) for its more accessible look into a family that that most in America can relate to in the family room, bedroom, in public streets, a cafe instead of hidden away residential facilities. Unlike Lars and the Real Girl (2007), the humor in this movie is in part based on our own uncomfortable feelings that are touched so much closer to home, a laughter based on the intensity of mental illness and the embarrassment that we might feel if we actually acknowledged the tragedy that periodically occurs in this movie, like slapstick comedy of the silent movie era. Much like John Carpenter's The Thing (1982) made everyday things such a dog into a horror creature, Silver Lining Playbook allows its audience to take everyday life and begin to understand how any of our lives or those around us can be so easily touched by mental illness or the polite facades and idiosyncrasies we all surround ourselves with.Silver Lining Playbook might be more closely compared to a more upbeat Little Miss Sunshine (2006)or the more artistic and polished American Beauty (2000) or the contemporary plight of economic recession on family man in Up In The Air (2009) or the more straight forward dance movie of Shall We Dance (1996 and 2004) or a raw dramatic look at family life of the 1950s of The Tree of Life (2011), the darker A Day of Wine and Rose (1962) which presented a stark and tragic look at alcoholism.Except for the ending, Silver Lining Playbook represents a significant and daring family drama presentation of mental illness, though perhaps in the tone of Pat from the movie, this definitely isn't Hemingway and thus makes it the perfect movie, if wants to throw Hemingway out the window.",10,1,1,17 January 2019
Ender's Game," A Surprisingly Deeply Emotive and Substantive Sci Fi Action Thriller
","31 October 2013. Curiously enough Starship Troopers (1997) and Star Trek (2009) have similar parallels in plot outline and action sequences, yet with a huge difference. The dichotomy between even younger cadet students, the focus on younger, more pliable, but creative, out of the box minds and the older, aging generation of warriors offers a fascinating psychological and moralistic interplay. The emotive and deeper substantive emotive and philosophical, humanistic issues at play here provide a much more solid and meaningful foundation making this movie pertinent and relevant to a mass audience.Three minor weaknesses appear in this movie that don't really diminish the overall impact of the quality of this movie: Below average set designs and special effects especially at the beginning of the movie, the less than convincing training of the Dragon Team, and less than emotionally compelling and appealing huge change of Ender's mind in the movie. However, there is a wonderfully interesting and strangely emotionally riveting shot of a world in transformation at the end of the movie that speaks powerfully, much more than a transformative planet scene from an earlier Star Trek movie.Ender's persona is one of the most fascinating to be presented on screen and depending one's perspective this maudlin and politically correct movie or perceptively astute middle way movie that contains an especially sharp edge to both its violence and compassion, usually lacking in most action, adventure movies and reserved for theatrical dramas for the screen. When Orson Scott Card wrote the original novel upon which this movie was based in 1985, it was among the leading edge of sci fi and the fusion of creative ideas of space warfare and alien communication (or perhaps the 'apparent' lack of it) taken from this book and incorporated into this movie remain fresh and excitingly potent.There is a unique sci fi bench mark set in this movie in terms of sci fi psychology and the human psyche as The Matrix (1999) set in terms of virtual reality and Avatar (2009) and Inception (2010) in terms of visual effects or even Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) in terms of a revealing hard core sci fi alien plot element. Ender's Game might be compared to the youthful version of Gerard Butler's Gamers (2009), a hard-edged futuristic, high-tech, new wave sci fi movie, some resemblance to a less hard-hitting 2002 sci fi movie adapted from the classic juvenile book A Wrinkle In Time or a sci fi version of the parallel fantasy movies The Chronicles of Naria: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe (2005) and The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian (2008) which is also based on C.S.

The 2-D version was crisp and attractively compelling - an animated spectacular that lent a specialness of its own that even live action likely could not have provided any better visual interest. Unfortunately, this movie while having the intelligent humor, the action, and even the emotional drama somehow didn't jell (pun not intended). The chemistry just didn't seem to be there. Not all the various monsters seemed to impart their potential and some even seemed to been weak, if that could be possible. There were a number of animated action sequences that there superb especially with Reese Witherspoon's character. Overall, this movie was entertaining, but its plot seemed not be have been developed for that brilliant presentation that it was capable of. 7/10.",7,0,0,20 January 2019

","18 May 2016. There isn't anything really new in this dance movie; nevertheless, it's definitely not boring nor a knockoff nor a clique. Julia Stiles does her stylistic performance as is her innate talent carries her throughout this movie. More like Oliansky's The Competition (1980) in somber tones regarding a piano competition than Glaser's The Cutting Edge (1992) with its more lighter, syrupy romance drama regarding an ice skating competition. The emotional knot with Stile's character's mother's dream is a humbling and strong theme that resonates throughout the movie.There is plenty of creative and artful moves more so than in The Cutting Edge. Add the fascinating yet more subdued culture clashes reminiscent of The Princess Diaries (2001), Save The Last Dance offers a satisfying and entertaining experience worth the time and money.",7,1,3,13 January 2019
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A Supposedly Unusual Mystery that Doesn't Succeed
","30 April 2012. What makes perhaps for a great fictional crime thriller mystery novel doesn't make for a greatest film adaptation except maybe for a politically correct feel good statement in the guise of artistic creativity. Who for instance would even cooperate with such a young punkish female with no social grace none whatsoever? Though amazing and somewhat suspicious transformation occurs by the end of the movie. The movie would have been much more compelling if the repulsive reactive behavior of those associating with this girl would have been on display and her ability or her surrogate more likely were able to negotiate their way around this antisocial demeanor and obtain the necessary investigative facts upon which this amazing mental talent of a girl could then synthesize such facts into an incredible criminal deductive conclusion, much like Sherlock Holmes and his cocaine habit - What a genuinely valuable script and performance that would have been. What one does get is the almost predictable techno-blackmail scenario in the movie as perhaps the only fascinating and somewhat credible social interactive scene in the movie with the girl in another political statement. What one has however is this anti-heroine nominated for best actress Oscar who supposedly gets our critical sympathy and yet authentically and realistically speaking her amazing investigative ability notwithstanding, it's implausible she would really be able to accomplish what is supposed to occur prior to the occurrences in the movie and thereafter until suddenly the audience is confronted with another persona late in the movie. Somehow freakish and unusual characters capture our imagination and fascination, nevertheless, it is the more subtle and performance of everyday characters that are the most difficult because they require a superior performance to capture and maintain an audiences interest.The movie, in part, depends on an Addams Family assortment of characters from a Hitler era which somehow become a lost after-image as the movie develops as well as on the supposedly convoluted investigation of an assortment of clues, especially photographic compilation in fine chronological detail, sort of an extended Criminal Minds television series episode much better exploited in Manhunter (1986). This fusion of Point of No Return (1993) and Antitrust (2001), Hanna (2011), and Silence of the Lambs (1991) becomes some less of a mystery with its predictable murderer, loses a lot of its suspense and in this case less isn't more. The character development is weak even though it would in this movie have improved the substance of this movie especially as the movie wasn't supported by major special effects or action sequences. Lisbeth's character also wasn't consistent in her early setup particularly to the extent that her actions at the end of the movie weren't as expected as that might have been. Developed as more of a mystery thriller, even The Spy Game (2001) or The Three Days of Condor (1975) had more of the compelling and attention absorbing suspense than Dragon Tattoo whose post-climatic scenes whose outcomes seemed without surprise or doubt, and even in those instances where the doubt isn't really expected, there is still the 'rapt' possibility that can grab one's attention as in The Thomas Crown Affair (1999). After a time, even the storyline line wasn't that emotional compelling or interesting to sustain any strong motivation to watch the movie, unlike the investigative reporting of All the President's Men (1976) or even Winter's Bone (2010) which gritty and riveting cultural milieu sustain a fascinating presence in the movie.Perhaps one of the best unusual characters, even though mainstream, but directed and emotionally absorbing was found in Terence Young's Wait Until Dark (1967) where Audrey Hepburn plays a blind woman who is stalked by some unsavory characters with the possibility of sadistic death on their minds. The ultimate crime thriller that sustains its action, has techno, and intimate relational balance remains Manhunter (1986) which captures unlike Dragon Tattoo some humanness of its horrendous criminal while at the times time provides that background character that seems missing in Dragon Tattoo.",7,1,2,17 January 2019
Dreamgirls," Great Music Compromised
","28 December 2006. The best musical since Chicago won its Oscar, Dreamgirls fails to capture its full potential due to its cinematic approach to its excellent material. The direction of this movie was confusing and this resulted in a question as to whether this movie was a drama with music or really a musical. An overly ambitious project, there were too many characters to focus on adequately and many of the needed dramatic, continuity was lost among the many subplots going on. Many stand alone musical numbers really hit the charts and Jennifer Hudson shown well as a soloist actress/singer. Courageously, both Eddie Murphy and Jamie Foxx took parts of less than musical heroes while the female roles seemed to be underdeveloped. Seven out of Ten Stars.",7,0,0,22 January 2019
Being John Malkovich," A Fascinatingly Odd Fantasy Drama
","John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener, and of course John Malkovich as himself are directed by Spike Jonze in this fantasy drama with some comedic overtones. In a rather bold move, John Malkovich plays himself whose mind is invaded through a mysterious portal by other people especially the characters played by Keener and Cusack. Cameron Diaz offers up one of the strongest against type performances practically unrecognizable from her typical persona on the movie screen. One of the most odd but compellingly fascinating scripts composed for a movie with elements later used in the Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) also written by Charlie Kaufman even to a better outcome and effect. This strange but ultimately tenderly poignant convoluted relational drama is both amazingly unique and penetrating.",9,0,0,29 June 2020
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Quirky and Entertaining
","9 January 2010. This quirky movie is a blast with elements of GOOD MORNING, Vietnam (1987) and both intelligent, off-beat humor and suggestive moralizing that isn't overly obnoxious, but as in the movie subliminally supplied with ample doses. George Clooney initially presents his character as he has recently been tending towards in his straight-faced comedy, but then emerges especially with flashbacks with a entirely enticing and new persona rarely seen on screen. Ewan McGregor gets to stretch his acting with a different character breaking out from his on-screen persona (Moulin Rouge, 2001). Oddly, Kevin Spacey seems to be miscast in his beginning scenes and feels uncomfortable not only as his scene calls for but even in his undeveloped intrusion into the film, though later for better or worse, his innate comedic talent and more public character comes to the fore later in the movie. There is much to like in this off-beat, off-balanced movie, though the beginning introduction of McGregor also seems abit awkward and either unnecessary or not smoothly engaging. Overall, this movie is out of the box and retains a great light entertainment even as the more sobering experiences of war are exposed in this movie. This movie is the more lighter side counterpart to INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS (2009) that same out the same year. 8/10.",8,1,2,20 January 2019
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Almost Became a Parody of Itself
","4 August 2015. The disastrous opening almost verged into a poor, imitation, parody of Mission Impossible with dumbed down comic dialogue and less than interesting action set up that lacked the James Bond punch. The movie then settles somewhat uneasily into a comical version of itself and eventually focuses on the more serious action thriller that the franchise is known for. Nevertheless, Rogue Nation never quite achieves the sophisticated, consistent thrill plot outline that eerie, creepy Sherlock Holmes (2009) was able to create and enrapture and ensnare its audience with. Rogue Nation does hit some high notes in its vicarious chase scenes on motorcycles and uses nice psychological twists of betrayal. Alec Baldwin is severely underused as the CIA head as compared with The Bourne Identity franchise series. The plot seems choppy and the script is blatantly manipulative in is In some ways the television scripts of Leverage is able to be smartly portrayed in one hour episodes that that rival the fun cerebral elements that Rogue Nation attempted but was unable to accomplish.",7,0,0,13 January 2019
Jarhead," Brilliant and Stunning
","19 November 2005. Lost in Translation meets Iraq - this mesmerizing beautiful war movie is a big version of a serious M.A.S.H. television series mini-event, an 'Apocalypse Now' (1979) without the eerily weird stuff. This is a war movie that cuts away the action and guts for a much richer, inner sense of war, the humanity or inhumanity of war, the underbelly of war that appears away from the typical blood and guts of war. No other war movie has presented war in this fashion - the inner turmoil and craziness of war without the overt political overtones. This is major series of slices of war life - from the discipline, the foul language, to the apparent inane, insanity of some of it. 'Jarhead' avoids the stereotypes. Jamie Foxx portrays a platoon leader that is so devoid of show casing, that it's easily one of the best supporting roles in years, unless he is presented with a best actor nomination. Jarhead is an epic experience of the scenes not usually focused on in war movies. With surprisingly little blood and guts, it still has haunting, tension filled scenes that recall 'The Blair Witch Project' (1999) shot making. This is a brilliant piece of movie-making.",9,0,0,23 January 2019
Collateral," 'Lost In Translation' Meets 'Manhunter'
","8 August 2004. Michael Mann has followed up with his 1986 'Manhunter' with a more substantive, cinematographic exploration in the similar fashion of Sophia Coppola's 'Lost In Translation.' Mr. Mann has combined his grainy, realistic photography techniques with layered images and great sound effects with a deliciously various sound track that keeps the audience absorbed. Mr. Mann has been able to avoid the overly graphic violence, the high tech flavor of Manhunter, and the stream of life experience of 'Lost In Translation.' Both Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx give memorable performances that are deep, emotionally satisfying. There is humor and emptiness, pathos and comedy. This movie is a mainstream, art film that blends the best of drama and thriller in Mann's stylistic genius. Except for a waitress shot that distracts the end of the jazz scene, this movie is nearly perfect. Nine out of Ten Stars.",9,1,2,25 January 2019
Dunkirk," Disjointedly Disappointing
","21 July 2017. Yes war is chaos, yet Dunkirk was disjointedly and chaotic for the wrong cinematic reasons. Perhaps in times of war, under stress, people do stupid and even idiotic things, but the script entailed focusing on some not so smart, unintelligent behavior that can leave particular audience members shaking their heads in bafflement instead of wondrous awe.Sometimes its daylight, then nighttime, then daylight, then nighttime all in the seemingly same time frame. There's a scene when instead of posting a lookout, a small contingent of soldiers find themselves trapped in a darkened, confined space. The audience is offered up a less than sympathetic leading character, one soldier in particular who seems to escape death again and again whose actions appear less than honorable and whose connection with the audience seems distant and unattached. The aerial scenes are constantly interrupted with edits back to the other two story lines almost like a hyperactive attention deficit disorder so that the audience isn't able to vicariously experience the full impact of the emotional and mental turmoil of the pilot.The audience gets to experience the lead character at the beginning of the movie wadding up flyers for a bowel movement behavior which are a little later strangely unused or at least unseen. There is a scene towards the end of the movie where an officer volunteers to remain behind seemingly safe for the moment while another is seemingly in jeopardy of being capture nearby. In between, there are random scenes of destruction and mayhem that almost appear to be inserted not for historical accuracy but to maintain some sort of pace fore the moving along with a musical track that hauntingly is oddly reminiscent of an occult horror movie Under the Skin (2013) with its eerie string tonal sounds. There are the typical almost dying and miracle being saved at the last moment taken straight out of mainstream action adventure movies when instead an armed soldier might have a least used a pistol to try to escape from the surging water. Additionally, there is a confrontation at sea between a rescued soldier and some civilian boatman which comes across awkward.The movie is so fragmented that the emotional connection with the characters is lost and the storyline jumps so much that there isn't time or extended scenes to allow the audience to fully appreciate or understand the entirety of a scene before they are ripped away to experience some other part of the action. A disappointing movie by a great director. Dr. Zhivago (1965) is able to capture both the human connection and both the appeal and tragedy of war or Black Hawk Down (2001) another military rescue mission offers an more captivating and intimate as well as dirty and rawness of war.",6,0,1,10 January 2019
Ratatouille," A Sumptuous Animated Feature
","14 July 2007. Except for a jarring transitional scene later in the movie, this animated feature comes close to animation heaven in its detail as an animation film without crossing the boundary into live action realism. As the technology continues to move forth, this stylistic production decision will one day become a real problem. However, as of today, the real treat is in the script, the rich colors and detailed features of the movie, the consistent, compelling action in the movie. While not rising to The Incredibles in terms of deeper substantive, emotional concerns, this feature film provides a tastefully rich satisfaction with its focus on the main characters allowing us to intimately connect with them without any distractions.

Bad Teacher," Unredeeming
","17 April 2015. If one can stand an un-redeeming, mostly unlikeable character than perhaps this movie may be tolerable. Unfortunately, Cameron Diaz's character is so selfish, egoistic, conniving that unless you are either a narcissist or antisocial psychopath it's unlikely that you will like this movie. Most people would be better off watching Jack Black in The School of Rock (2003). Almost the whole movie shows Cameron as a lazy, disinterested teacher who only cares about getting in the pants of anyone who can help her find a sugar daddy. Only rarely do we see her care about someone else and its pretty juvenile. So unless one has a temperament of an immature teenage adolescent, this movie isn't for you.",5,1,4,14 January 2019
The Amazing Spider-Man," Too Many Plot Weaknesses, Can't Make Up For A Sincere Effort
","7 July 2012. Try as one might, this movie had the same impact as No Country for Old Men (2007), the plot weaknesses couldn't make up for some exciting and emotive scenes that attempted to put some substantive quality into the superhero movie genre, like The Dark Knight (2008) using a darker plot and characters. But The Amazing Spider-Man (2012), the script and director appear to want everything bot the light, mainstream populist entertainment and humor along with the more serious undercurrent of supposedly three-dimensional characters. The mix doesn't work as well in this movie as in Spiderman-3 (2007).The plot suffers from too many script weaknesses and devices: (1) the overly-fancy secure lock that Peter Parker is can so easily access into an apparently bio-level 4 hazardous facility, (2) the infecting spider scene didn't seem as plausible, with so many spiders, (3) the immediacy of the change and the rapid adaptation of Peter Parker seemed overly rushed (perhaps for the script-writer's important scenes to come) which unlike Spiderman (2002) didn't offer the elegant acoustical and even first-person sense perception, (4) Gwen Stacy's boyfriend implied seems to drop out of the picture too easily in regards to trying to keep Gwen, no typical jealousy scene, (5) Peter Parker's transformation into an obnoxious teenager seems also too abrupt as well as Dr. Curt Conner's behavior and attitude which was much more well-developed by Willem Defoe as Norman Osborne in Spiderman (2002), (6) a somewhat confusing Batman like unnecessary in this movie dependence on technology for the Spiderman's webbing better revealed as part of the natural transformation of Peter Parker himself, and (7) Gwen's father's intransigent attitude towards Peter Parker and denial of the more important monster on the loose belief was also over the top.There was a sincere effort to transform this movie into more than the typical superhero, blockbuster movie - the later scene with Dr. Curt Conner and Peter Parker which was suggestive, but not as effective as Blade Runner (1982) and Rutger Hauer's performance and dialogue as Roy Batty. Even the typical nerd scenes in the beginning had a more serious and dramatic presentation and yet Peter Parker's personality and sarcastic behavior later in the movie seemed to be overplayed. The movie even included some creative and exciting but only suggestive first-person perspectives of Spiderman's thrilling execution of moving around skyscrapers and buildings (but failed to take advantage of it - perhaps for some future theme part ride). Overall, the movie tried to remake Spiderman, but it couldn't incorporate the sincere attempt into a well balanced and believable movie.",7,0,1,17 January 2019
The Exorcist," Not Scary But Shocking
","24 January 2010. Thirty-seven years later, the sharp, vivid, fine resolution of the initial Iraqi scenes brings this aging but classic movie into the contemporary age with shots so visceral of great film-making that rivals the quality of even today's advances in film work. As time passes and the scary horror films keep piling up, most of the once classic shots from turning of heads and spitting of goo have transformed this horror movie into predictability, yet the shock value remains mostly because of how utterly graphic and degrading the dialogue and the devilish behavioral occurs in this movie, particularly in the middle portions of the movie. The judicial use of horror and strange where only about five brief odd occurrences are revealed in the first half-hour reveals how focused this movie is on the careful editing and balance of horror and drama and relational interactions that pervade this film. Perhaps only the color and texture of the goo is one of the few weaknesses of this movie. THE EXORCIST retains is strong elements of acting and drama. The first third of this movie is remarkable for its almost independent and prescient approach to photography and directing almost presaging the future of quality film-making - JARHEAD (2005) comes to mind. As memory recalls only the fine, captivating technical medical scenes of the novel were moderately transferred to the film (but for adaptation purposes only perhaps). Overall, this movie minus the clanking old aging medical equipment and strange looking police cars, still keeps its amazing quality of one of the signature horror films of all time.",9,1,1,19 January 2019
Now You See Me," An Exciting Rare Use of a Magic Theme in a Movie
","3 June 2013. Magicians don't seem to have played much of a major role in the history of movies, outside the world of fantasy such as The Wizard of Oz (1939) or the Anthony Hopkin's occult Magic (1978) that earned him a best actor Golden Globes nomination. This rare resurgence this year of magic with the beautiful 3-D fantasy film Oz The Great and Powerful (2013) or the less than well received hokey comedy movie The Incredible Burt Wonderstone (2013) along with perhaps never to be released comedy Desperate Acts of Magic (2013) brings along with it this rare crime-thriller movie where magic forms the basis of the storyline of Now You See Me.The screenwriter's seem to have taken a lot from the television series Leverage (2008-2013) which itself won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Cable TV Drama (2013) and oddly enough that show doesn't use magic as its theme but uses creative deception and misdirection like a grifter in all its episodes for rebalancing the scales of justice. The most comparative magic-themed movies would include the more personally involved competition between two rival musicians in this psychological thriller between Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale in The Prestige (2006) and the period crime psychological, mystery thriller without the action The Illusionist (2006) which included its own powerfully surprising twist both which focused more on the human drama rather than on the spectacular crime mystery action thriller or even the more poignant and perhaps even more emotionally, more intimately personal and bitingly delightful performance of John Malkovich in The Great Buck Howard (2008).Now You Can See Me suffers somewhat with its omission of a flashback at the beginning of the movie that sets the basis for this story and instead uses a present time narrative to eventually flesh out the back story which is a crucial element of the emotive humanity of the entire movie. Overall this movie is fast paced, with at least three major plot twists along with others and seemingly magical sequences that sometimes are rather predictable and at other times unexpected, but none that exceed that of the television episodes from Leverage or perhaps even the old Mission Impossible television series (1966-1973). This fusion of magic, crime, and psychological gaming becomes a who and how done it audience game on the big screen, even the opening sequence of the guessing the playing card number and suit by the theater-going audience gets them ooh and awe. It's hard to disassemble this movie from many other clever action thrillers because the use of the magic theme is new and exciting like a new Disneyland ride and rarely used, if any on this level, as the actual part of a movie as opposed to actually making the movie. Nevertheless, the movie is refreshing and entertaining, keeping the audience interested and guessing throughout.",8,1,2,17 January 2019
Captain America: Civil War," Explosive
","31 December 2016. Most of the time, more and more and bigger and louder doesn't often result in better. This Captain America somehow manages to assemble a lot of superhero action into one movie and make it into one totality of an experience in diversity and style and cinematography that explodes on the screen. At the same time, somehow the director is able to retain a sense of individuality and focus on a few superhero characters so that a major theme of a morality play between individuality and centralized, governmental public interest is retained. This movie may be the ultimate limit to how far a superhero ensemble can go before it becomes a helpless confused mess. Even the ultimate explanation and motivation of this convoluted manufactured conflict reveals a deeply tortured emotional underpinning, unlike most other super epics recently shown. In sum, Civil War is rather unique in standing out of the crowd with its ability to balance its many characters while retaining an intimate and personal storyline.",8,0,1,12 January 2019
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," An Adolesecent Fantasy Tale
","20 November 2016. Take a younger Matt Smith from Dr. Who, the British sci fi television series, place him in early 20th Century New York along with an Inception-like (2010) special effects and new visual fantasy world like Avatar (2009) along with a strong ecological theme and you get something like Fantastic Beasts. Fantastic Beasts continues the darker evolution of the Harry Potter world while inserting a comedic older muggle male character to help balance the tone of the movie. Whether or not the expanding beauty of this visual universe will retain its magic or not remains to be scene as Avatar set a new standard of imagination. And whether or not due to budget or technological limitations, the effects were not quite as great as to be expected with all the new visuals that Fantastic Beasts brought to the screen.The target audience of the movie script might be aptly described as the continuing audience who grew up from the original Harry Potter movies who were in elementary school and grew up through junior, middle school and high school. Fantastic Beasts includes the familiar ominous darkness and stark loss, evil abuse, as well as happiness, joy, and a pitch of accidental stupidity found in most of us.Overall, Fantastic Beasts is fresh, new, dark, and enjoyable with some meaningful messages endangered species, about child abuse, pain, and compassion and tolerance, something that America needs more than ever now.",9,0,0,12 January 2019

Tropic Thunder," A Raunchy Mature Film Comedy with Flashes of the Real Stuff
","21 August 2008. It's hard to really capture the essence of this 'terribly,' good movie. It's hardcore, adult comedy like on the comedy circuit except it's in the form of a full length feature film with special effects. The dialogue is raw and rough like straight out of the R-Rated Las Vegas comedy strip. This is a daring, risky, and no holds bar comedy acts that drip, gush, explode off the screen, offensive, satiric, and dangerously cruel. Yet there are scenes that are effusive with true emotional, heart-rending and though-provoking drama. This film is a daring mixture of raw comedy with drama, shocking, and brilliantly funny at times. Not every scene connects with all audience members and at times it borders of embarrassingly sick. But the comedy and the sincerity is amazingly fresh from a feature film. This is comedy at the fringe edges, qualifying this film for cult status. Eight out of Ten Stars.",8,5,7,20 January 2019

Michael Cera from 2007 Juno headlines this innovative blast of a movie with a sonic emotional punch. The dialogue, script, the punk and the connection with contemporary young adults rocks. Except for the bit underwhelming, perhaps not the smartest triumphs on the part of Cera's character and perhaps the rather wimpish ending, this movie could have easily reached classic, cult status.",8,0,0,3 September 2019
Enchanted," Great But With Some Weak Points
","2 December 2007. Unfortunately, this fun, entertaining, and delightful romantic, animated/live action movie has a problems that just can't be ignored and besmirches an otherwise solid film. The music, the plot, and fusion of live animated characters, the idealistic fantasy world values and the blending of the real world values are emotionally satisfying. Giselles first experience of the real world is a dizzying and brilliant sequence full of hurt, bewilderment, and the whole range of just what one would expect from fantasy meets New York. It is intriguing how the flat, old animated beginning sequence was necessary at this junction in such a film as this in order to heighten the contrast between the old fashioned animation film characters and live human characters. The animation technology has advanced sufficient to actually make this movie effectively successfully, something that wouldn't have been as rich and believable even a decade ago. The first problem occurs with the casting of Nancy, the protagonist's girlfriend, with actress Idina Menzel. Her physical appearance just doesn't lend itself to the overall movie's theme and character by the end of the movie. There wasn't sufficient character development if she was to be used, which wasn't really necessary, but she was cast almost too animated-like as a black and white idealistic character instead of the more complicated human character of New York City. A second problem with this movie was the over-exaggerated musical reality that occurred midway through the movie turning this movie for a brief time into a fantasy musical when in fact most of the movie is charming just for its more realistic bent meeting idealistic fantasy characters. This sequence while charming, didn't fit in this movie and took away some of the flow of the movie. Finally, reminiscent of THE GOLDEN CHILD (1986) starring Eddie Murphy, he gets to battle an evil character who seems to transform into a large, horrific character played Charles Dance. The major conflict sequence seems somewhat confused, less effective, particularly as to what happens to the Queen. Overall, this is a fun, family movie that is rich with family themes, the importance of romance but also the importance of achieving one's balance with reality. It's not one or the other.

Inside Out," A Fabulous Animated Exploration of Human Emotions
","23 June 2015. This innovating, educational, appealing, and emotion-laden animated movie dazzles with a spectrum of delightful and meaningful portrayals throughout its 94 minute running time. Not since Wall*e (2008), Robin William's What Dreams May Come (1998), La Planete sauvage (1973), The Incredibles (2004), or Spirited Away (2001) has there been an animated movie that brings out a fresh, vibrant experience involving deep universal emotions between family members. The movies incorporates of a creative, simplified but reliable look at the brain and emotions and how each one of them, especially those that might surprise many audience members are essential for human authenticity and mental health.What's even more impressive is Inside Out avoids reliance on super special effects to compel the audience to awe and wonder, but rather a playful assortment of imaginative visions that oftentimes Japanese animated movies have been famous for and uses a substantive, meaningful, spirited script to keep the audience entranced with its universal themes of the ties that bind joy and sadness. This is well balanced movie that elicits laughter, sadness, anger, and happiness and all the emotions reflected in the movie without crass marketing manipulation.",9,4,6,14 January 2019
Yesterday," Not the Beatles
","It's hard to classify Yesterday. It prominently uses Beatle's lyrics and song. It's funny but with a twinge of melancholy. And mostly it's a fantasy of what ifs. It's also predictable with a sad whimsical elemental surprise towards the end. For Beatle purists, this movie would be hard to accept and enjoy. Somehow the interplay between Beatle songs and the movie plot doesn't quite run smoothly and easily play out like Across the Universe (2007). Nor does Yesterday incorporate the creative movie magic that Across the Universe used with a compelling lavish way. This alternative reality fantasy appears to be a somewhat new take on the more oftentimes comedic or dramatized versions of reality such as John Candy's Delirious (1991) or Amazon's The Man in the High Castle series (2015) which make more of their own focused intensity in their delivery. This fusion of so many genres coming together in Yesterday ultimately changes the movie into more of an experimental film genre in progress. As a musical Yesterday doesn't sustain the intimacy of lengthy sweeping musical pieces as experienced in Rocketman (2019), La La Land (2016), Les Miserable, or Chicago (2002). Overall, the movie stands on its own, in its own way, but as a tribute to the Beatles, only the Beatles themselves can really authentically hit the original notes of emotional integrity with their own tributes",7,0,1,15 July 2019
Resident Evil," Intense and Strangely Compelling
","8 August 2002. 'Resident Evil' was more intelligent than 'Aliens,' and the twist and turn in the movie was good. I'm not a fan of slasher/horror, and living dead movies, but I eventually settled into the movie with its scientific sounding rationale gunk. I was terrified (although not scared, as if there's a difference). I particularly liked how compassionate some of the scenes were, while the beginning indiscriminate killing was quite effective in setting the tone for the rest of the movie.It's really difficult to describe what it was about 'Resident Evil' that made it stand out above the usual blood and gore movies. The touch of humanity, the computer logic, the seriousness of the military discipline? Somehow, all the parts seemed to work together. Milla as an actress did a great job with a number of different portraits of human behaviors and emotions. The script was a notch above the usual cut and slash. Somehow the ending even seemed apt and complete creating both the typical uneasy shucks reaction but at the same time yeah ok, I understand, a decent ending - serves you right.",8,3,4,27 January 2019
Avengers: Endgame," The Marvel Universe is Much Too Big for Two Movies
","More is not always better and a lot more is definitely mind-bogglingly hard to wrap one's senses around. After a slow build that effuses with emotional and relational devastation the movie thae turns towards a building resolution with multiple scenes of bravery and sometimes sacrifice. With so many super characters and subplots, its pretty difficult to really absorb the more intimate prolonged exposure that most dramatic movies offer. There are numerous attempts of pushing the audience's emotional buttons that abound in this superhero finale and in that effort there are a number of typical and well-execute ploys by scriptwriters to milk the scenes for all their worth. This grab bag of personas and dramatic and comedic turmoil all come together in a pretty full package that at times bulges at the seams. This is a movie that tries really hard to encompass the full panoply of the Marvel Universe which is likely too big for just one or perhaps two full length films to capture comprehensively or adequately. But nice, if impossible try.",8,2,5,1 May 2019
The Butterfly Effect," A Decent, Above Average Multi-Universe Movie
","24 January 2004. In the footsteps of the Lath of Heaven, the multi-universe (time travel), chaos theory movie of The Butterfly Effect is an effective fantasy, sci-fi, drama containing a hard-edge of violence. This movie contains depictions of juvenile sadistic behavior and pedophilia. Ashton Kutcher does a commendable job with an intelligent, though somewhat forced script. Evan as a boy of 13 is given at times a much more harsh demeanor as well as Evan as a young man who personality seems to vary as much as his world does. There are effective psychological scenes as well as emotional tender moments. However, there are those artificial plot devices that seem to be inserted for audience impact rather than a natural flow of chaos. Eventually, the story and plot line get more convoluted to the point of confusion as to the cause and effect of changes being made. The movie had a decent ending with a message, though Evan's experiences as the move progressed seem more the product of a writer's mind than a real person's. Evan's reaction to his friend's violence seemed unnatural. Evan's relationship with his mother is never fully developed. There is also the confusion between Evan's memories and how he presents himself and also how his attempts to portray himself as somehow godlike was convincing if the new universe changed as it was supposed to have. This serious effort deserves recognition for its attempt to push the envelope along with a provocative conclusion and the meaning of sacrifice and of love.

Nothing much is spectacular that hasn't been seen before. Mostly by the numbers here. It wasn't boring or dumb like Alien 3, but it really doesn't add anything to the franchise or should I say franchises. The script was consistent, but 'Cube' movie-like in its intensity. No suspense. No scary scenes. This really is more of an action movie with monsters filling in for humans. I couldn't really get to liking any of the characters, mostly mushy stereotypes, even the aliens.

Unfortunately underneath its dazzling presentation lurks predictability, unbelievable coincidences, outstanding idiotic behavior from characters who should know better. This movie really is like the emperor without any clothes on. The movie appears to be good, but really it more flash than substance. Even the very first scene was predictable and rather dumb where a supposedly ignorant law enforcement officer ends up on the wrong end of the handcuffs. We have a antisocial personality disorder killer who we don't get to see really what he eventually does half the time (it's left up to the imagination of the audience). Does he or doesn't he? He escapes incredulously without killing in one scene just like incredulously this box of money seemingly escapes without a sound. There's supposedly this professional who can protect people who can't protect himself. There's even a out-of-date tracking device that looks like something from the forties (wrong movie, I guess). There's too much taken from granted in this movie. There isn't enough real character development, tense face-offs, resolutions. Very disappointing movie from beginning to end based on the expectations going in. Six out of Ten Stars.",6,2,4,21 January 2019
District 9," Disappointing
","8 January 2010. Take TRANSFORMERS (2007), THE FLY (1958), THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (1999), CLOVERFIELD (2008), 'The Chameleon' episode 31 of THE OUTER LIMITS (1963) together with the former South African Apartheid and you have something patched together that somewhat resembles a movie that attempts to appear more than it really is. Unfortunately the great photography and camera work is wasted on an inconsistent pseudo-documentary style technique used in CLOVERFIELD along with some camera work similar to THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, however, it then transforms primarily to a traditional linear movie cinematographic technique with intersertions of the documentary style that only serves to become more a distraction and gimmick than anything else, there is an almost TV COPS feel to this movie that only serves to focus on the perverted action instead of the genuine moral message that this movie superficial portrays. The main character doesn't seem cast right because he's more a parody of the boss's wife's son who actually doesn't seem to have much in the way of a redeeming character, an unpleasant, almost pitiful man really. There are weak flaws in the movie - one alien almost humanlike characteristically slams a door in anger, the superphysiology of the aliens at one moment seem superordinary and then by the end almost pedestrian and humanly fragile, the alien cannister is hidden unnecessarily where instead it could have been secreted and taken and used to power the ship without all the action and melodrama. There are many predictable, overly dramatic, exploitative, and manipulated scenes in this movie - the vicious evil human's demise at the end who survives for the climax, the overly wrought wife and the wife's deception. Overall, this movie while visually interesting, would have been far superior if shot in the JARHEAD (2005) Desert Storm motiff and the script carefully incorporated a more intelligent, more insect alien mentality, and a more credible main character. The pseudo-documentary in a way really was unnecessary, instrusive for this mystery, alien, thriller...and taking away some of the mystery of the ending. 5/10.",5,2,7,20 January 2019
Mamma Mia!," A Near Classic Musical For Baby Boomer Generation
","24 July 2008. A brilliant, contemporary musical for baby-boomer generation. More down to earth, more populist, more intimate connection to the general public than Moulin Rouge (2001) and Chicago (2002). A near perfect musical rendition for this century with great choreography, great singing with an uncharacteristic cast members, a delightful sight gags. This is a warm, entertainment that immerses music, comedy, along with a great acting, particularly by Meryl Streep, easily an award winning performance. The only two weaknesses appear to be Colin Firth's role whose character was fully depicted until much later in the movie and Dominic Cooper's scene where he gets upset and then somehow the subsequently his upset somehow dissipates without explanation. Pierce Brosnan's role is fascinating, especially with his less than stellar singing vocals which could be considered a weakness but can also be considered more authentic and emotionally compelling. There is a lot of free flowing depictions of fun gyrating, dancing moves that sparkle and shine on the screen. This a genuine smash musical extravaganza. Nine out of Ten Stars.",9,1,2,20 January 2019
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," A New Western Classic
","21 October 2007. What LOST IN TRANSLATION did for Japanese culture, THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY COWARD ROBERT FORD does for the Western. In one of the best visceral presentations of the West, its feel, its depiction of bare, spartan rooms, the ambiance sounds of rustling wind and creaky floors, this movie reels with authenticity, a rawness, grittiness even to how shooting scenes are played out. People die harshly. Men talk trash, like real men talk about women sometimes. There are amazing scenes of silent acting that communicate brilliant the mood, the feelings, the senses of the scene. Both Brad Pitt and Casey Afflect easily award nominations bring to the screen a real subtle and intimate, disquieting, and complex characters, . This perhaps overly long, sometimes difficult to follow where even eventually even Sam Sheppard's character just seems to disappear, remains nevertheless an intimate epic movie brings both a fantastic cinematography to the audience with the color, lighting, the shots of both bright sunshine and complete darkness of the nights of the old West. The narrative-voice over is riveting in its also documentary style presentation that adds authenticity to the acting on the screen, a richness and depth of really experiencing each scene. One of the most mesmerizing, layered, and rich film of the year.",9,4,6,21 January 2019
Toy Story 4," A Story About Toys That Tells Alot About Humans Too.
","There is something of the same entertaining and emotional connectivity as Incredibles 2 (2018). There's a point in Toy Story 4 that made it appear that this sequel would be decent if not great movie, but then later on as the movie literally worn on, it became stronger and stronger until by the end the compelling and heart-felt storyline blossomed fully by the end of the movie. There is an important conceptual insight about the perceptions and assumptions about human nature that oddly enough results from an animated feature about toys themselves. This is a solid, funny, sad, and humanly amazing experience about both toys, human beings, and relationships.",9,28,52,23 June 2019
Batman Begins," Good but Not Great
","18 June 2005. I didn't go rushing into this movie, my wife made me. Thus, as soon as I could I was looking for things I didn't like about Batman Begins and naturally I found plenty of problems with the movie.First off, let me say, I think that the whole switch to quality production and the look of the movie was great (though I still prefer comic adaptations to be more comic-like such as Sin City). The basic storyline and the substantive backbone of this movie is superior in terms of past Batman versions. This was a good movie but it had its major problems.The first thing that made me uneasy was the very first image of bats (that were not realistic). The second thing that made me uneasy was the use of the flashback technique. Personally for a movie like this, it would have flowed much better in linear, chronological order so I didn't have to bounce back and forth, I wanted to see the beginnings of Batman along with Bruce Wayne as he experienced it. There was so much development, that unfortunately, the length of the movie made it prohibitive to really fill out the details of Bruce's personal growth. I found the editing jumpy and uneven, disorienting, I felt there were too many gaps in Bruce's experiences..Mr. Wayne found this rare flower so easily, climbed the mountain was easily. His martial arts training was a pale version of Elecktra's or for that matter Zorro with Anthony Hopkins and Antonio Banderas or even Karate Kid.Mr. Waynes transformation into billionaire playboy didn't seem natural and just happened suddenly from one scene to the next.The martial arts, there really wasn't any scene with anything that could be considered quality fighting - it was all a blur. My hats off to Jennifer Garner and Angelina Jolie both of whom really took their fighting practice to heart. The car chase scene again was pure copy, especially the two shots where the cars are lined up in a formation pattern, aligned for the chasing cars that really appears artificial.Gary Oldman didn't have the script lines that would allow him to really breakout in this movie - as the comic relief, there was the possibility to really shine.Cillian Murphy was the most intriguing character in this movie, one par with Sin City's Elijah Wood's performance.Some of the dialogue, some of the scenes just didn't work for me...the kingpin being so easily ensnared by Cillian Murphy's doctor role. The fight in the beginning of the film with the League of Shadows just seemed too little and too much at the time. I would have settled for the whole building to blow up and Bruce Wayne simply escape, but instead we get this not to believable beam falling to end matters and the fight scene just didn't seem to merit the supposed ability of the master.The first time we get to see the Batmobile jumping roofs (but the first instance the audience doesn't actually get to see the first jump).The strength of this movie like Spiderman is that we get to experience superheros but vulnerable in a real, genuine way.I enjoyed this movie but not as much as others. It was substantive and reflected the essence of Batman. But in its actual presentation, there were too many holes for me to enjoy it completely. Seven out of Ten Stars.",7,1,1,23 January 2019
The Favourite," Definitely Not The Comedy It Was Marketed To Be
","Olivia Coleman performs superbly as Queen Anne in this period drama that was somewhat deceptively and misleadingly marketed more as a comedy which it definitely strains at accomplishing such a designation. Instead this strongly more somber and serious drama with mild interludes of humor should be expected as such when viewing this movie. The photography is striking in its bold and sharply projected visual impact, reminiscent of amazing camera work from This is Cinerama (1952) and Brainstorm (1983) both very still relevant in today's photographic approaches to visual artistic endeavors. The background music and sound effects are eerily similar to the more creepy and sinister motif of the Under the Skin (1983) and cast an odd off-balance mood during the movie, definitely off-setting the supposed comedic tone of the film. But it is in the presentation and scripted story that the more graphic and decadent, sometimes even raw and gross behavior of the Royal Court that oozes out of the movie that can captivate the audience with its voyeuristic behind the scenes purveyor of sordid delights. The movie jumps around a bit with its editing and its characters eventually are not that endearing making this movie somewhat less appealing then the typical and much more traditional movies that attempt to capture the vicarious mood of Victorian England.",8,3,6,10 February 2019
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Almost at Great Action Thriller
","25 December 2011. The high octane, tension-wire, electrified action bursts into an almost great action thriller this fourth time out. The use of two predictable twists, one in the very beginning action sequence with the lady and then with the male assistant were more lazy than well written, executed sequences, then humor especially in the beginning portion of the movie bordered on inappropriate overly done mood distracting tonality of the movie, and at least one sequence was overly complicated and difficult to understand narrative that threatened to slow the pace of the movie. Nevertheless, the riveting action sets were among the hottest this year and may have set a new level of finesse when editing and pacing hot action scenes. With not as crisp Bourne elements, the shocking surprise reminiscent to the Bourne Supremacy (2004) or Harrison Ford's scene in Clear and Present Danger (1994) really hit the action thrills button perfectly. The female vs. female scene missed an opportunity for some nice emotive conflict slo mo action. Very entertaining, overall well executed especially in keeping a dizzying web of James Bond storyline plot points together, except for one scene noted above.",8,1,2,18 January 2019
Revolutionary Road," A Mixed Bag of Brilliance and Flaws
","25 January 2009. 'Revolutionary Road' is easily one of the more complex and inconsistently brilliant movies flecked with flaws this year. It is both stunning and irritatingly frustrating in its delivery. From the beginning 'Revolutionary Road' recklessly and immediately jumps into an overly quick and much too brief a dive into a passionate relationship between Leo DeCarpio and Kate Winslet and then cuts to Kate Winslet's somewhat questionable but deliberate performance on stage as her character's ambition as an actress. Suddenly we are then transported into the future where we see our 'perfect couple' with the requisite two children who seem to be conveniently missing for most of this movie. There are snatches of what seem to be flashbacks in order to provide some meaningful continuity and emotional connections which may have been better suited to a linear chronological presentation (as the flashbacks seem to disappear a third of the way into the movie). Kathy Bates is wonderful in the first half of this movie with her nuanced performance.The plot, screenplay attempts to be strong and edgy and at times it appears to succeed, yet some of the dialogue, especially the heated arguments between Leo and Kate seem awkward and artificial at times. Nevertheless, the substantive plot points are solid and meaningfully presented as difficult dramatic elements that are successfully performed on screen. Yet for all the dazzle and flash, it is difficult to believe that the values and implicit directorial outcome of this movie might not be stained with a dislocated overlay of contemporary 21st Century morality over the actual 50s mentality and value system.In order to make his big point and climax in the movie somewhat like 'American Beauty' (1999), 'Revolutionary Road' has its big scene that is not quite as satisfying because the movie continues on trying to make a statement and tie up some loose connections that even begins to resemble a horror film ending where the whole experience could repeated over again and again. While the basic statement of this movie might be legitimate, it doesn't necessarily seem consistent with the reality of the 50s and the outcome and some of the script appear to be more dramatized and made up and imposed on the societal norms of the 50s.Who is 'crazy' in this movie is an interesting question. Whether childish, rash notions of finding oneself here or elsewhere is the point and whether one can actually find one's self by relocating somewhere else without first examining one's inner demon's first is questionable. Overall, this movie is powerful, compelling, but appears tainted by some questionable editing decisions (one brief scene where Kate Winslet is looking away from her house instead of at it after a flashback regarding how wonderful the house seemed to reduce the emotional flow of the scene), some questionable dialogue choices and arguments that feel somewhat flat, and the imposition of basic premises regarding the culture of the 50s our assuming we can impose our beliefs of today onto it.",8,1,2,20 January 2019
28 Days Later...," An Intense Sci-Fi/Horror Thriller
","20 July 2003. I resisted and refused to see this seemingly obnoxious rip-off of past horror/slasher movies, particularly The Omega Man. But after seeing the movie out of curiosity because a friend really recommended it, I came away impressed with the quality and focus on a hauntingly, intelligent horror/thriller. Though not without its obvious logical lapses, this beautfully made and directed movie presents the zombie horror movie in a fresh, cerebral light using excellent fear elements to make a well-rounded, exciting, compelling horror movie. Recommended for those fans who are more interested in the silence of fear than the actual exhiliration of contiuous action sequences and rapid-fire lust for blood and gore. Eight out of ten stars (could have been one of the best movies of the year, if it weren't for its mental lapses).",8,0,1,25 January 2019
Cars," Good But Not Super Unleaded
","23 June 2006. Cars sputters its engines out of the starting block, overly long, and not as funny as previously animated blockbusters, provides a continuing look at the progress of animation technique that threatens to become indistinguishable from live action. While the trend of this form of animation towards realism will likely pose serious dilemmas for future movie makers, currently as provided in Cars, the animation is at times superb and at other times flat and artificial. The inconsistency of presentation is a major distraction. Car does possess good substance, a decent storyline, with some cute one-liners for car racing fans. Yet the flow of the movie is oddly flat for the first third of the movie. The rapid fire funny scenes are missing that the audience has come to expect with no constant sidekick. Seven out of Ten Stars.",7,0,1,22 January 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," As a standalone movie was a disappointment
","As a likely minority in the over-rated super-hero extravaganza, Infinity War as a standalone movie was a disappointment. It pandered to the audience with simple script devices where the superheroes were made to look pretty stupid, uncertainly un-Jason Bourne like in mentality and behavior. The evil ones were able to convenient arrive just in time to continue the storyline that could have easily ended multiple number of times at any number of points if these multitude of conglomerate, almost innumerable superheroes could actually learn to work together and obtain the oneness that comes of Buddhist, Eastern cultural wisdom of the importance of society over the individual. The backstory of Thanos and his daughter was too brief and insufficient to provide a more complex and bonded emotional connection is one problem. And another problem is simply too many superheroes that almost makes the movie more about heroes becoming the norm instead of super. It's almost now about many people who appear to be super but the movie is populated with so many of them that really it seems that they are normal people with extraordinary differences that the audience has seen so often that they almost appear normal now, nothing really special anymore, something the audience just comes to expect. Overall, the movie substantively is pretty superficial and the plot while challenging includes too many cliques and uneven tone from a chaotic fusion of trying to be so cute and funny, to serious and emotional riveting so much so that it becomes neither.",7,1,2,28 January 2019
Gone Girl," Over-rated
","14 November 2014. I suspect why this movie is getting rave reviews and good box office turnout is due to its sustained measured suspense as a dramatic thriller where the who done it element becomes convoluted and layered with great emotional intensity as the audience is seemingly and subtly manipulated throughout the movie as to Ben Affleck's character and the apparent absence and presumed demise of his wife. Things become extraordinarily complicated that gives the audience a continuous shot of neurological brain transmitters of titillating endorphins.
One other pertinent fact that impacts my own personal experience watching this movie is that living in Utah where Susan Powell disappeared who lived in West Valley City, Utah and whose body was never been found and Josh Powell, her husband, was suspected in her disappearance and who later killed himself along with their two children. There were many parallels between this real event and Gone Girl.
But perhaps I am getting old; and watching this movie I'm reminded of Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner in The War of the Roses (1989). If the movie had stopped two-thirds of the way through the movie with the first major twist, I might have really enjoyed this movie in its totality, but it continued with this odd twist that seemed like a guise for greatest as a film. Needlessly the audience is forced to watch a rather predictable sequence of events that seem creatively amazing but somehow it just seems tacked on with the appearance of genius. I can understand why this movie would seem innovative and offer up some new revelation of the human psyche not see before on the big screen.
Perhaps its just I was unfortunately lucky to begin to put the pieces of this mystery thriller together too soon, but this overly long, in places overly slow paced movie became too predictable, foreshadowing its scenes and the ending. For awhile the plot and characters were fascinating, the plot intriguing but eventually, the movie just seemed very good. Others might conclude this movie portrays a rather unique, albeit rarely seen complex characters who diverge from the ordinary two dimensional personas. While this might be true, there is something off-balance but not in aesthetic way, but detracting way. What David Fincher is striving for is one of the most difficult achievements in film directing. His effort is commendable, if somewhat unsatisfying for me. If the movie had been shot in the style and tone of say cerebral spy thriller The Russia House (1990) or Ben Affleck's The Sum of All Fears (2002), Gone Girl would have come across more in keeping with the icy, frigid psychologically tension and dramatic tone of the theme of the movie. One of the best examples of this conflicted tone might be Brad Pitt's character and performance as scripted in Interview with A Vampire (1995) or his scripted performance in the dramatic crime thriller Killing Them Softly (2012) or even Nicholas Cages scripted portrayal in The Weatherman (2005) or Daniel Day-Lewis in the drama filled There Will Be Blood (2007). Even the classic bitter sweet relational drama and alcohol-riddled theme of The Days of Wine and Roses (1962) has the oil and water imbalance that however is deliciously sweet and sour tone that this movie might have been well to have captured. Or take Nicole Kidman's harsh but memorable role in Margot at the Wedding (2007) or her role in Dogville (2004) or what happened to Brad Pitt in the superb mystery crime thriller Se7en (1995). Other edgy movie themed and uneasy but dramatic riveting movies that capture the paradoxical tone of beautiful ugliness include William H. Macy in Edmond (2006), Sam Rockwell's fascinating character in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002), the dysfunctional family of American Beauty (2000), or Tom Cruise in Collateral (2004) even whose title is reflective of the dissonance of a battle where innocence is destroyed. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in director Stanley Kubrick seemed to capture both the cinematic beauty and the uneasy alliance between the unusual, fantastic in an artful and sinfully beautiful way with characters that sometimes lack in moral turpitude in his Eyes Wide Shut (1999) or take the sociological business war with its incumbent cold calculating businessmen of The Social Network (2010). Even Leo DeCaprio seemed to capture the decadent attractive sleaze character in The Great Gatsby (2013) or his performance as Howard Hughes in The Aviator (2004). What seems to be missing is the more balanced background of the development of the relationship, a better visceral sense of the characters as they evolve which is conveniently missing during the movie, except with deliberate shocking sometimes unflattering flashbacks which was seemingly achieved with one character played by Christian Slater in He Was A Quiet Man (2007). The real fault in this very difficult film is that absence of the depiction of the behind the scenes of the false facades and the real persona essences of which even the characters themselves are unaware so as to reveal the hidden pane in Johari Window.",7,1,2,15 January 2019
Aladdin," A Wil Smith Movie That Propels It
","With musical elements oddly reminiscent of the most recent and compelling James Bond's melodies along with the television hyped musical series such as Glee, Aladdin presents a sort of glorified musical version of those 50s movies attempts at ethnic diversity, but with mixed results. There are several points in the movie where the editing and transition between a some of the later scenes seem rough and uneven. Wil Smith as the genie along with his accompanying dazzling special effects really maintains the energy for this movie and offers up his own Robin Williams antics that has Smith's imprint solidly established in his own right. Jasmin's strong woman's character is undeniable and the musical and singing performances are decent from the original animated version, if not all memorable as could be said of the contemporaneous and memorable music from movie Rocketman (2019), the biopic of Elton John.",7,1,3,7 June 2019
Bolt," Dazzling and Brilliantly Animated For The Entire Family
","13 November 2009. The rich soft texture of the animation makes this film one of the most entrancing and comfortable animated features ever. The balance between reality and fantasy of the animated medium itself provokes one of the strongest storytelling experiences made for just this technique. It is a perfect almost seamless version of an oral history, wrapped in a classic moving canvass. The storyline from THE TRUMAN SHOW (1998) together with THE INCREDIBLE JOURNEY (1963) threads this movie into an emotional and surprisingly humane movie about the essence of human and animal relationships, about fame and fiction and meaning. Except for the moderate irritation of the stretched plot points that detract from the rest of the emphasis on reality in an animated medium such as how does a hamster roll so fast as to catch up to a moving truck and such, this movie delivers strongly. 8/10.",8,0,0,20 January 2019
Frozen," A Strong Female Animated Storyline
","24 December 2013. Like Brave (2012) before it, the female characters as well as the emotional undertones of this animated adventure musical, brings back the song and dance of the traditional animated extravaganza. With musical elements from such Broadway hits as Chorus Line and Aida, this fusion of vibrant animation along with subsequent Shrek (2001) humor, this big screen version of love and the power of love with a twist (with only one glaring logical flaw with the return to the Castle timing( makes for a entertaining and wonderfully captivating animation feature film of the year. Certainly worthy of an animation and Best Picture Oscar nominations.",9,1,4,16 January 2019
2012," A Burst of Screaming Special Effects
","15 January 2010. 2012 stretches believability to the limit with a multitude of barely survival scenes, especially in the middle of this long disaster action thriller movie. The specials effects rival those of THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW (2004) which was to be expected at some point and the multitude of explosive disaster sequences and new disaster visuals and perspectives is impressive. The storyline seems credible if not convincing, except perhaps how the movie actual ends which seems to be over the top. For the most part the story is predictable though at times takes some care for attempts at substantive intellectual stabs, more than some disaster movies though not quite as convincing as THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW. Overall, the movie was long, almost too long, almost became boring in places, but it was entertaining and provided thrills and action. An above average disaster movie that continues to use special effects pushing the envelope, though not quite there yet, but getting closer and closer. Some really, truly fascinating visuals in this movie. 7/10.",7,2,3,19 January 2019
Ghost Rider," Enjoyable But Not Notable
","25 February 2007. If only Nicholas Cage could have used his talents throughout the movie. Unfortunately, Cage only provides a series of his fun character in this movie while at other times, it's pretty monotone. The special effects are also somewhat on the weak side. However, the storyline and the delivery are mostly interesting, entertaining enough to capture notice. Nicholas Cage does add much needed charisma to the movie and the emotional romance while fairly traditional is maintained with the expected level of twists and turns. Some of the superhero battles are not all that sophisticated nor fantastic, barely making the grade. Overall, it was a pleasant movie-going interest, if not a great one.

X-Men: The Last Stand," Enjoyable But Lacking Depth
","29 May 2006. This third installment while enjoyable as summer action-thriller entertainment lacks the emotional, dramatic, and empathic, psychological compelling storyline. The characters are not given much opportunity to develop the critical possibilities that this storyline could have tapped into. Magneto had the best emotional conflict on display while the rest of the characters were only given lines that scratched the surface. The special effects, the pacing, the action were riveting. Unlike the earlier two X-Men movies, the inner haunting conflicts were submerged while the action took on a more prominent role. The demise of several major characters follows the script that the television series 24 took this past year substituting dramatic personal disaster in lieu of the more subtle, difficult personal turmoil of more qualitatively satisfying movies that even Spiderman movie scripts contained. Nevertheless, this most recent X-Men provide the typical clash between good and evil with man in the middle with reasonably satisfying results. Seven out of Ten Stars.",7,2,2,22 January 2019
P.S. I Love You," A Cute Romantic Movie
","1 July 2008. An interesting premise though not quite as smooth and flowing as possible. The humor and serious drama seem to flow unevenly in this romance drama of a widow receiving periodic letters or messages from her dead husband. There is a feeling of forced as well as time lags in the plot that make the movie ebb and flow. Somewhat different in its plot script device, the movie moves forward with its entertainment, different cultures, and sometimes blunt character intentions. Overall, this movie doesn't quite have the gem star quality of Ghost (1990) or even the striking intensity of Heaven Can Wait (1978). Seven out of Ten Stars.",7,0,0,20 January 2019
Room," How Did Abrahamson Do It?
","22 November 2015. What is remarkable about this movie is that the audience members didn't fall asleep for the first half of the movie and that's a great thing. Unlike The Diary of Ann Franke (1959), the underlying and ominous tone of Room doesn't have the constant and imminent death threat from Nazi occupation that helps to sustain the visceral tension that Ann Frank was subjected to. Instead the director was confronted with the challenge of somehow making the mundane and likely boring life in a small room something of modicum of interest. In a way, the audience experiences the same efforts of the mother to keep her child preoccupied as much as possible with the few resources possible. Overall this movie has a deliciously balanced and sustained plot development often times left out of the confined and happily released plot outlines of most mystery thrillers.The performances are superb and so consistent with the storyline, there isn't any pretense that any of this was stage or acted. The relationships are well developed within the timeframe of the movie and are delightfully varied to reveal the breadth of human responses to such a tragedy. The presentation mostly from the child's perspective made the directorship's job tremendously more difficult but at the same time more captivating and absorbing for the audience. Instead of the usual death lurking around every corner horror genre or the sensationalism of publicity drama, the movie narrowly and richly captures the amazing and arduous behavior of the mother's attempts at some form of normalcy and the doubts surrounding her own competence in having done so.Like The Miracle Worker (1962), the depiction of a world beyond our own universe, our senses, Room offers up a new way of examining our own environment. Unlike Helen Keller, though the child in Room wasn't limited by his senses, but by his limited surroundings. Nevertheless, the audience is exposed to a refreshing and innovative way to re-examine our own limited senses.",8,1,3,13 January 2019
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," A Surrealistic Coming of Age Adventure Comedy Drama
","27 December 2013. Ben Stiller coming of age as an adult comedian actor. This movie directed and starring himself as Walter Mitty brings to the screen a rather imaginative fantasy in a way that Danny Kaye's 1947 version didn't not. There is surprisingly a strong undertone of drama along with the rather sad comedy. This fusion of surreal from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), the recession employment drama from Up In the Air (2009), and the exotic geographic adventure of the rather lame but gorgeous The Loneliest Planet (2011) offers a riveting musical score that enhances the entire movie. Ben Stiller just manages to restrain the over the top fantasmagorical craziness before it rips the balance of the movie apart. Both serious and yet comically, Ben Stiller has incorporated a rich everyman story of fear, courage, romance, and liberation of the spirit in this playful movie. Much like Adam Sandler break out performance in Punch Drunk Love (2002), Ben Stiller has offered the audience with a superlative movie.",9,0,0,16 January 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Gorgeous To Look At, But Not Quite Perfect
","22 December 2002. I'd say 8 stars out of 10 for this movie. The scenery was spectacular and the overall appearance is of epic proportions. The were a few distractions however and perhaps the DVD (and I'm assuming even longer version will help fill in the gaps). Frodo's internal conflict as the ring-bearer doesn't come across the screen as personal to the audience, we get to see more from an observer standpoint without getting the feelings and the emotions and the actual pull to the dark side was one might get from Star Wars. The Rohan King's son is a person we never really get to know and to feel the bond between the King and his son and again we're left to see the King's emotions from outside, never getting to emote with him. Gollum is perhaps the most amazing character of all in this movie and I'd say should earn an Oscar nomination for something. Except for the ending scenes which seem to suddenly turn the Gollum in another direction from the prior scene which doesn't seem smooth and consistent in character, the Gollum and Frodo's and Sam's interaction was the highlight, brilliant, and intimate creative genius of the whole series to date. Another strange figure is the 10,000 warriors that march to defeat Helm's Deep and King Rohan. But even the Vietnam War, the American Civil War, the Russian Revolution, the numbers offered as to the size of the massed army in this epic fantasy don't seem to conform to the gigantic clash between good and evil of the massive size of Tolkien's novel - I'd think that 100,000 soldier army would be the minimum size to defeat any fortified fortress in the Lord of the Rings. The battle seemed to be awful fast and the feeling of lingering doom, the seige over days (more in line with most fantasy battle scenes) is missing in this movie. However, overall, Lord of the Rings brings to the screen images that have been waiting a long time for Fantasy fans and almost (not quite) capture the essence of Middle Earth. A great attempt, a near perfect success, but there is even better movies to come if this significant benchmark is any indication of the future of fantasy movies.",8,0,0,26 January 2019
Across the Universe," A Great Romance Enhanced by Great Music
","13 October 2007. A brilliant, exhilarating fusion of Beatles music and lyrics that is enhanced by the romance and political statement of the sixties and cross-cultural perspectives. An exciting musical, art, and solid script that allows the Beatles to resurrect themselves to a new generation. Each word of the Beatles' music comes reverberates with intensity as the characters sing their musical numbers acting out their lives on screen. The seamless, almost timeless universal phrases ring so true, creating a multi-media, multi-dimensional musical sensation. The hallucinatory, music video echoes to the early Beatles movies, 'It's A Hard Days Night' and a 'Yellow Submarine' but now the music has been transformed into a much more personal and intimate manner. 5/21/12: The biggest problem or weakness of the movie is that the movie can't be described as a masterpiece, perhaps because of the impossibility of integrating every individual Beatles' song into a universally connected movie script on every level. While Across The Universe does interconnect the love story well, there are filaments of the movie that seem to drift off and become tangent to the movie and the overall impact by the end seems to collapse somewhat on upon itself. The fault, of this movie, if any, was it attempted to be a complex classic, putting more effort and ambition then necessary. The producers and scriptwriters, ironically tried too hard, unlike Chicago (2002) or Moulin Rouge (2001), keep it simple or attempt the near impossible by fusing The Beatles with epic romance drama of Dr. Zhivago (1965).",8,1,1,21 January 2019
The Incredibles," AWESOME!!!
","5 November 2004. This is one of the best animated feature films of all-time breaking through to the family, comedy, action-thriller movie genre that can compete with live-action movies. The animation, the intelligent script, plot, and humor are all blended into a super format that made the Iron Giant so popular and an instant animated classic. The Incredibles will be one of those movies that will set a new benchmark in animation and perhaps in family movies for years to come. Certainly this movie argues for the elimination of the new Academy Award animation category and allow animated feature films to compete along with the other movie genres on a level playing field. A certainty for a Golden Globe nomination, this movie was awesome, if a bit long and slow in a few places (editing could have tightened it up), but overall, a marvelous effort, exciting, compelling, and funny with a great dose of human values and family values all wrapped up in a retro-contemporary cartoon package just right from the current day.

","10 August 2007. Except for an awkward scene, this refreshing fairy tale fantasy has a fun and delightful undercurrent of adult cynical wit that charms its way into the audience as well as a soundtrack that powerfully moves this fairy epic along. Except for one of the Robert DeNiro scenes that doesn't come across smooth and appears out of sync with the tone of the rest of the movie, this luscious romantic fairy tail has a great storytelling feel and the strong magic and the fine balance between serious adventure scenes and the lighter spiritual humor is well done.

Driven," Great Rush Of Insight and Thrills
","28 April 2001. Except for an impossible ending, Stallone's movie is a great one. This movie held true to substance while using its style to enhance the relational aspects of the movie between people. Even Burt Reynold's holds his own as a mean, but understandable race team owner. Most of the characters are portrayed with sensitivity and without black and white, stark stereotypes. Each person is treated with respect. The movie stayed the track on race car driving, instead of cheap shots, cheap sex. I loved the shots of driving, the racing milieu, the human side as well as the commercial side. Stallone did a good job.",8,3,5,27 January 2019
I Am Legend," Nice Effort But Mediocre Script
","15 January 2008. Warning: Spoilers. An interesting look at an overgrown, forested, dehumanized, unpopulated New York, but the infected people looked artificial, the script was pretty much cliché, predictable, and a lot of the plot points were obviously more for overly dramatic shock value than any real sense of reality. This was more of a glorified horror teen action-thriller ride at an amusement park. It wasn't so much God that put together all the coincidences as the survivor girl says but the screenwriter who just appeared to become lazy and created shock value scenes. The unnecessary flashback technique made the movie more choppy and instead of THE TERMINATOR'S effective use of flashback as a natural part of the storyline, here in I AM LEGEND it's also a lazy way of saving movie costs and explaining the movie through edited scenes. Wil Smith never had an opportunity to really develop a character along a real timeline, the development of his relationship with his dog from a puppy. There isn't any development of his psychological progression over time, except sudden personality changes that seem out of context and don't appear to really make sense. There are the infected strange behavior that almost imply that they have retain some intellectual or emotional faculties but then it's ignored by the end of the movie. There is one scene where Wil Smith is in a bathtub for the night and then seen in bed in the morning as if nothing happened. There is a lot of layman shooting at deer for no real apparent reason, even for sport or food, it's not ever clear. There was too much manipulation, Wil Smith's wife at first being shown positive than negative for the virus, then the implication that their escape helicopter is destroyed by an out of control helicopter. There were just too many possibilities to make this a really good remake. Wil Smith isn't at fault, it was the material. While the story is understandable, the action and thrills decent, all together there just isn't any qualitative superlatives here that really move this movie into the very good category. The producers probably hoped that the supposedly fascinating look of New York would carry the movie, but unfortunately, it also became just a wild dream that crashed and burned.

The Bourne Legacy," A Really Big Missed Opportunity
","20 August 2012. Aaron Cross as played by Jeremy Renner is apparently no Jason Bourne as played by Matt Damon. With this amazing script that had some of the best dialogue of any espionage movie, the emotional conflict and tension on a real human level, the director let Renner down and maybe Jeremy Renner himself as well as Rachel Weisz's character just don't seem to fit the script's overall characterization. Aaron Cross's portrayal belies the cool and required strong demeanor of the best special ops person - he wears his emotion on his sleeve and doesn't seem to really have any observable enhanced physical or intellectual abilities that were supposedly described in the movie. The ending is a great disappointment as if a balloon were to pop but instead of a loud explosion, there is only a leaky, deflation, not typical of any of the preceding Bourne movies.There are small problems, such as in the beginning when Cross is shooting at something but the audience doesn't get to see what immediately or why. Later there the encounter with the opposition which is some of the most sloppy work by Renner's character of any of the Bourne movies (though perhaps there was an underlying intent, but it was made evident), and then there's the convenient opposition that seem to be able to somehow track Renner and company somehow even after a nice getaway. The chase scene with the Asian being so lucky in his dumb decision to use a car instead of a motorcycle only adds to the problems with this movie.What was intriguing and unique in this movie was the real-time parallel between the Bourne Ultimatum and Bourne Legacy though it wasn't quit seamless and Joan Allen's role was very underdeveloped here. There were the creepy parallel's to the real life Aurora, Colorado movie shootings and the pilot attempting to steal a jet in St. George, Utah.Overall, the movie starts way slow, with some glimpses of some great mental espionage going on, and an excess of repetitive physical action, and a weak ending.",7,0,1,17 January 2019
Hero," Beautifully Distracting
","27 August 2004. The gorgeous production was full of the mythic tale of heroism and sacrifice, of surface stories and behind the scene betrayal. This stirring story using luscious color and sweeping scenes creates an almost fairytale for grownups. While the American public may be find this movie novel, however, according to my wife, this Asian plot line has been used over and over many times to the point of tedium.

The look is cutting edge and approaching the threshold of amazing. The attempt at substantive and meaningful animated movies for children is commendable and usually works, except the stereotypes and the broken lines of continuity are sometimes hard to take as well as the implied and almost visual violence that borders on PG-13.

The Hurt Locker," One of the most disconnected, unbelievable war movies
","28 January 2010. This hugely disjointed, unbelievable, and sometimes manipulative movie is one of the biggest disappointments of the year. There are so many plot points that don't really portray the consistent character or relational dynamics that are likely to be found in the circumstances this movie presents - the movie comes across more like a script writer's fantasy than an authentic, compelling, and engaging movie. There are so many predictable, stereotypical subplots as well as loosely thought out script points that the movie betrays a sense of incredibility. The obvious emotive plot points designed to illicit audience sympathy only served to distance not involve the audience.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Good Adventure, But No Peter Sellers
","28 May 2017. For some reason I'm reminded of Peter Sellers' Insp. Jacques Clouseau in The Pink Panther (1963) which watching Johnny Depp's performance in this Caribbean sequel. But in the end Sellers' performance still rang more true. As another reviewer commented, the rhythm of this newest movie just isn't as smooth as earlier versions. Admittedly, the special effects are amazing as will other blockbusters will be coming out this summer. The storyline is indeed impressive helping to tie up some lose ends. There are the various requisite emotive, sensitive scenes. Overall, this blockbuster adventure holds one's interest for the most part, offers the audience something that is both understandable and entertaining. It is perhaps the overdone jokes, so many of them, like a live stage comic act, whereby some jokes are winners and others are so-so. I really wanted more, but since I really didn't want to go see this movie in the first place but was forced to, the movie was actually good and I'm glad I did.",8,0,1,11 January 2019
K-19: The Widowmaker," Decent, if Flawed Movie
","21 July 2002. I was at first encouraged by the first half of this movie when it seemed that America would get a rather diverse perspective of a high stakes military thriller of a movie. But by the end of the movie I was disappointed that the movie turned into the usual typical American pumping support of individualism and bravado along with the evil Russian empire. There were plenty of plot confusions, moral reversals. It's sad that the movie didn't play more on the personal plight, human relationships (husband/wife) possibilities. The actual ending of the movie was different and in keeping with the more high level of substantive movie making than an action film. The special effects and acting were good. The movie kept my interest throughout if not simmering in my seat because of the apparent flaws in movie logic (not human logic). I also have many doubts about what 'inspire' by true events meant. The actual events might have been much more entertaining I suspect. This is a good summer movie with plenty of intensity and action and political intrigue, but it could have been so much better. 3 out of 5 stars.",6,0,0,27 January 2019

Ex Machina," Too Lofty for Its Own Good
","3 May 2015. Ex Machina tries very hard to be the great cerebral sci fi version of the artificial intelligence genre. It appears that many critics and audience members may experience such a movie in Ex Machina, but when compared to other AI movies, it falls short of expectations. There are number of likely predictable twists in this movie if one pays close attention and the ending is just a script device that offers one of several possible AI scenarios that AI experts have hypothesized might occur.In some respects AVA, Alicia Vikander performing as the primary AI character did too good a human job in portraying an AI. When comparing her to, by coincidence, AVA of the same name in the more superior The Machine (2013), it becomes apparent that Alicia's performance is more human like as a performance than as an AI becoming a human-like character. Cathy Lotz as AVA in The Machine offers up an AI presentation which an AI evolves into becoming more human-like without ever losing the artificial nature of its existence in a more realistic fashion. As such, Ex Machina doesn't quite ring true. It is the Asian character's oddly underdeveloped persona as a human being that offers up the most intriguing relational complexity. Unfortunately her character isn't presented with her full potential towards the end of the movie unlike a more action version of this same AI motif of AVA and other AIs as found in the more compelling and appealing AI movie The Machine (2013).The mysterious creator of AVA, Jay comes across as a narcissistic Steve Job's character who seems to have both his genius and mental flaws, though how the movie ultimately ends is also suspect by how and which characters ultimately survive. Ex Machina may succeed in its raising important existential questions, but the lengthy dialogue seems more fitted to the more sedate written novel format (where the mind can rapidly absorb the dialogue) rather than the more quick-paced nature of film that strangely enough lengthens the temporal nature of dialogue so the movie becomes rather boringly extended and the energy of the pace of the movie lost.Well paced, appealing AI-related movies that possess cerebral existentialistic touches include Lucy (2014), Spielberg's A.I. (2001). Other entertaining AI movies include D.A.R.Y.L. (1985), Kurt Russell's Soldier (1998), John Malkovich's Making Mr. Right (1987). In many ways, Ex Machina follows in the AI motif of Hal 2000, Cherry 2000, and even Ash.",7,0,0,14 January 2019

The storyline and the ending are solid, but somewhat becomes its weakness as The Sixth Sense has probably spoiled many twists for good movies. Paul Giamatti is great taking on a role, that expands on his previous roles, with great flair and character. The role of magic and fantasy seemed to be underdeveloped while the atmospherics and music (except towards the end when Phillip Glass' technique overrode the scene) were superb.

Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Not Very Compelling Entertainment
","16 June 2007. Unlike other superhero sequels this year, this one spluttered and fell short. It was obvious that efforts were made at humor to move the movie along and at times it was hilarious but most of the time, the pacing was slow and boring. There wasn't a lot original - just a lot of moving around and action sequences. The dialogue seemed pretty lame and dumb - perhaps it's more the comic book story itself than the movie. Efforts were made to give the movie more substance, drama which flickered into interesting possibilities, but never sustained. While the movie was fairly clear, the plot reasonably outlined and played out, the compelling component of the movie didn't emerge, particularly for an adult audience. Somewhat predictable, this sequel moved more of stereotypical characters without much depth, more along the line of Star Troopers (1997).",6,0,1,21 January 2019
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Overall Brilliant
","9 January 2009. Besides a few minor issues, Benjamin is gorgeously photographed and deliciously epic and moving story about life and death over the entire life span. A timely movie, Benjamin presents a behavioral peek at our contemporary aging issues of our society today from the perspective of the life of two senior citizens in flashback. There is an amazing use of light and dark in this movie, much more so than most movies, especially silhouettes. Even at the beginning the replication of the simulated colorized old movie scenes heightened the effect of flashbacks within flashbacks. One noticeable oversight included tea without milk scene and the other noticeable weakness is Benjamin as an old youth, whose behavior didn't seem to exude the usual characteristics of being young in an old body. However, the overall movie flowed with powerful subplots with poignant short stories of Benjamin's life and the people who come in and out his life. This lengthy, extended movie was able to encompass a lifetime with interesting and compelling stories, a Lost in Translation (2003) format expanded into a lifetime of experiences. Never overly dramatic - but resonating with real life experience-like events, Benjamin as a youngster falling looking out the front door to a fart from an old man.

Transformers," The Can't Quite Transform Into A Solid Movie
","7 July 2007. Overall, this movie is a bit of puzzle, and the lack of clear consistent directing is evident from what appears to be a script that seems to have been written by several different writers with different ideas as to what this movie should have been about. While most of the production values and cinematic photographic and sound effects are powerful and compelling, they can't make up for the apparent collapse of the movie midway in where what appeared to a be a fairly serious Carpenter's remake of 'The Thing' (instead of living beings turning into monsters we have here things turning into monsters - almost as scary), the movie transforms partway into a more dumbed down version of juvenile lightness and then back to seriousness. There are the obvious emotional buttons pushed where a little girl is faced with a big bad monster, we have a little monster that is both cute and wicked like a 'Gremlin.' There are several logical gaps and unbelievable lapses in reasonable belief that distract from the movie. In total, this movie could have been a lot better, one of the best of the year (quite notable for this genre), but instead we are held to a collage of different subplots and sometimes add up to confusion and a dizzying array of special effects that take away from the solid underlying theme of the movie.

Men in Black II," Better and Worse Than the First
","3 July 2002. Men In Black II is one of the truly unique films in that it is both better and worse than the original. I admire the risks taken to make this movie more interesting but at the same time it bombs in some of its overly cute lines and plot-ploys. I laughed heartedly in spots, more than I have in a while, but that other times, I could only shake my head at how dumb and flat some of the one-line moments were. One fascinating directing, script technique that is rarely seen in a comedy is the use of silence, the prolonged pause and the use of facial expressions, and the moment to carry the scene. This approach usually worked in this movie, which I think is saying a lot because it is extremely difficult to pull off successfully most of the time and it takes good acting and directing to do it. There was more tender moments in this movie than the original - better serious, moments. Both actors were great in their acting, acting in the difficult parts where body and facial expression counted more than dialogue. There were times that Wil Smith never completed his lines, but with great success. I would have to say overall, Men In Black II wasn't a great movie, but it was entertaining, interesting, took risks, and broke new comedic ground in bringing back real comedy and one-liners that sometimes died, but just as well, were brilliant. A great worthwhile attempt. A must for home video or should I say DVD now.",7,0,0,27 January 2019
Wimbledon," Entertaining Sports Romance Comedy
","31 October 2004. This fun, sporting romance of a movie would been better received by the larger movie-going audience if the sport's emphasis had been on America - but nevertheless, for any anti-Brit - that just too bad. I enjoyed the movie and even as a former high school tennis player, I even found the tennis scenes believable and exciting - this movie had a good balance between its romance and sport (something most sport-romance films often fail to be able to do). While the romance and action were typical, the basic flavor of movies nowadays have advanced a bit, including Wimbledon. It's not fun and games. There are even losses. But getting in the tennis player's mind, namely Paul Bettany, was a nice touch along with the decent tennis action. A must see for female tennis players who like a bit of romance along with anyone who likes tennis and behind the scenes comedy and entertainment.An excellent date movie, with a sport-bent.

Hidden Figures," A Gender Bender Period Drama
","6 January 2017. If initial statistics bear out, Hidden Figures will be quite a gender polarizing movie with females have a definitely greater appreciation of the movie than men. Whether or not there is any racial differences remain to be scene. This generally popular and some might say political correct black and white discriminatory period film reveals how black females in particular were minimized and isolated from the main society. The black man and white race, except the lead Kevin Costner relegated most of the other characters to minor or fumbling roles. However, unlike the more edgy and searing contemporary, anti-discrimination film Crash (2004) or intimate portrait of black labor of the 60s in The Help (2011), Hidden Figures is able to capture a connection with a wider public audience.Hidden Figures for some reflects supposedly a different era of American history that a majority of Americans might not really relate to, something that might only be suggested today, though with the Black Lives movement and the increasing racial divide in our country today, Hidden Figures may be more relevant now than might have been otherwise. Hidden Figures may stand out from even The Paperboy (2014) for its ability to directly connect the common part in which race did not factor into the Patriotic, nationalistic pride and focus of this Country's unity with its important space program. Except perhaps a too brief and even unnecessary prelude of the childhood of one of the main characters, Hidden Figures has great editing, tender and insightful moments that reveal the darker places of America's relatively recent past.",9,0,4,12 January 2019
1917," An Impressive Visual Cinematographic Experience
","Sam Mendes has put together a compelling immersive film experience by a seemingly continuous moving camera record of two soldiers assigned the job of saving a battalion of 1,600 soldiers from a German entrapment and potential bloodbath. This is the second major film to provide its audience with a one streaming shot experience, the first being Alejandro G. Iñárritu's Birdman ( 2014). There is a lot to commend here in terms of cinematography reminiscent of some of the best war and survival movies from the best directors in the business, including: Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan (1998), a rescue mission set in World War II Germany and War Horse (2011), an animal story set in cruel trench warfare of World War I; Alejandro G. Iñárritu's The Revenant (2015) a period survival, revenge piece the wilderness; Ron Howard's The Missing (2003) a rugged and stark Western rescue story; Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down (2001) a contemporary military rescue effort in war-torn Somalia; Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now (1979) a horrifying, intense Vietnam War story; John Ford's, Henry Hathaway's, George Marshall's How The West Was Won (1962), an epic Western classic; John Sturges's The Great Escape (1963) an escape attempt from a notorious World War II prison camp; and even Mel Gibson's Apocalypto (2006), a story of survival in the perilous jungles of the declining Mayan empire. What is fascinating is the parallel to the breathtaking, pulsating science fiction thriller of Alfonso Cuarón's Gravity (2013) a survival story in outer space. The camera work, the music, the storyline of survival and loss are intense in both these movies. What minor flaws or manipulative script devices that occur in 1917, can be somewhat forgiven: the coincidences of the terrible circumstances and friendly soldiers that may be nearby, a mouse and tripwire, an obvious overlooked advantage the protagonist had in regards to a potential duel with a silhouette who becomes an enemy soldier. Mendes comes close to transforming this movie into but somehow avoids turning it into an extended virtual amusement thrill ride experience. Whether or not this war movie will join the ranks of Black Hawk Down or Kevin Costner's Dances with Wolves or Sam Mendes' own war movie Jar Head (2005), only time with time as the technology and cinematography continues to innovate to bring fresh and exciting visual and audio experiences to the audience.",8,0,1,21 January 2020
Children of Men," Falls a Bit Short of Amazing
","10 February 2007. While a pretty good movie with compelling, thrilling cinematography, some of the best of the year, the screenplay falls a bit short with its over the top, somewhat manipulative and unnecessary exploitative death scenes. More subtlety and independent movie thinking would have made this movie a clear nominee for best picture. This movie follows in the footstep Fahrenheit 451 (1966), A.I.

The whole look of the movie is clearly a notch above almost any movie of the future, the atmospherics are terrific. The weak parts of the movie are the circumstances the scriptwriter needed to say the obvious with how many of the characters die.

Garden State," Manipulative, Meandering, Missing Meaningful Content
","30 October 2005. Unlike most viewers, I found this movie manipulative in the beginning, overly cute, the slice of life experiences disconnected, disjointed, and the actual substance of the movie light and never really joined together sufficiently, only glanced at. The movie was unusual, but the main character really didn't feel continuous in his transformation. There was never any serious attempt to focus on and take the time to really experience important points (particularly father/son) in the movie and the ending became another in a series of typical movie endings. Unlike Lost in Translation (2003) that spent time in a more connected milieu even while in a disconnected place or even Prime (2005) that spend a good amount of time on the relational issues involved, Garden State seems to take events and experiences wanting to have some impact at times, but it seems too much and too superficially handled. I found myself wandering, wanting more, and getting uneasy about how oddity came about for oddity sake. Six out of Ten Stars.",5,0,1,23 January 2019
Event Horizon," A Solid But Not Completely Successful Fusion of Sci Fi and Horror
","5 September 2010. Sphere (1998) with Samuel L. Jackson came out a year later using the same underlying premise in an underwater environment scenario who has a presence in ways resembling Lawrence Fishburne in Event Horizon though more grounded in this movie as well as a subsequent version in Supernova (2000). But perhaps the closest psychological connection to this movie comes in the form of Galaxy of Terror (1981).For 2047, the technology (notebooks and computerization) appears to be more 2020, even though it has a futuristic but contemporary feel 13 years later after its release as well as the incorporation oddly enough of weirdly archaic looking mechanical devices with steam and grinding metal from the Iron Age.Incorporated into this movie are bits of Alien (1979) doors and door sounds and smatterings of Alien (1979) chasing and running down corridors, and even an Alien (1979) mysterious signal or message parallel and is even suggestive of the older First Spaceship on Venus (1960) or Planet of the Vampires (1965). Vague visual color similarities to The Cell (2000) and some design inside the core's mechanism to 2001: A Space Odyssey as well as later scene depicting being trapped outside in the vacuum of space. The visuals in this movie particularly the first third are fascinating as well as beginning to show signs of aging with the not quit lucid and authentic integration of floating objects in a vacuum, however, the effort and the overall impact are impressive and likely strikingly new when the movie came out 13 years ago and really broke new ground since 2010 came out seven years earlier (1984). Some of the scenes have not been replicated even to this day, even with the availability of the technology - like the interior of a deep frozen weightless vessel.The explosion airlock scene is a particularly crucial scene where the screenplay and director is able to retain a believable, comprehensible consistency, a scene is actually seems to barely steer away from stereotypical overly dramatic standard of sensational horrific gore like like that observed in Outland (1981), though the final climatic scenes do have a compelling sense of suspense and drama.Additionally, Sam Neill's crucial importance in the movie can't quite bring up either by the script or perhaps his acting to truly provide the depth necessary to truly display the credibility of the horrific transformation from the science fiction genre and their a few editing issues especially when Laurence Fishburne suddenly finds himself alone in a corridor with a haunting voice reverberating around him, and even the sudden discovery of the disposition of Lt. Stark played by Joely Richardson occurs without much explanation. One of the later destruction scenes also seems to be so overly destructive, to the point of portraying itself as a lazy, convenient script device. By the end of the movie, even the bio-detector devices used earlier in the movie seem to have been forgotten as the descent into an exclusively horror movie genre takes over unlike their use in the more intense sci fi emotive scenes from both Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986).While the descent from science fiction into horror might be considered a twisted corruption of science fiction, it might also be a fascinating fusion of the two in terms of how the interaction between the alien unknown of science fiction is manifested in the human mind and perception and behavior. And where good and evil is observed, it may be the human moral underpinnings of our anthropomorphic attempts to explain what we do not understand or conceive, but what is and it is our darkest fears of what we do not fathom that result in panic and paranoia and what might be delusional creations of our own inner psychic but are just as real in an alternative presentation. Yet even with this explanation in the end, even though its seems to skirt successfully for prolong time, Event Horizon (1997) doesn't quite seem to avoid the overly simplified blood and gore horror fixation during the latter third of the movie which takes some of the action-thrills from Alien (1979) but in a psychological monster as opposed to physical monster way as depicted in The Omen (1976), The Man with the X-Ray Eyes (1963) and particularly The Hellraiser (1987) come to mind. Sphere (1998) even with its much more tame and for some 'boring' scenario seems to able to more effectively capture the alien-horror-sci-fi fusion or Sam Neill's struggles that were more sedately and cerebrally captured in the remake of Solaris (1972) by George Clooney.On the whole, this movie experience is interesting, sometimes scary, with a twist or two, and presents the American satisfaction of a sci fi action thriller, incorporating a strong horror element, and retains the American sci fi ending scene. Nevertheless, Event Horizon can't kind manage to present a superb fusion of these genres in a new classic form, but it can be commended for its attempt. 7/10.",7,0,0,18 January 2019
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," A Powerful, Penetrating Look At Power
","25 November 2005. This black and white political drama echoes back to acting performances found in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Eerily, Good Night with its retro-look and 2001 with its futuristic look both combined performances that had a subdued, hard, realistic presentation. While the pacing and the flow of the movie were slow, the musical score and at times the dramatic close shots and close ups that establish the mood help to minimize the absence of action and activity in a large portion of this movie. The content of this movie slowly crawls into understanding and the understating consequences are made without shrill, hyperactive tones - like an action movie or dramatic flair like All the President's Men (1976). The movie is a like a crack of a whip that is buffered with sound-absorbing shields that by the end of the movie, one understands the immensity of what happened but more in terms of the strong, powerful, cerebral, intellectual whiplashing of the character's verbal assault, but not emotional beating.

Resident Evil: Apocalypse," A Decent Horror-Action-Thriller
","11 September 2004. The sound effects, the fast paced action, the blur of violence, the plot are provided good exposure in this sequel, sequel. This entertaining horror-plenty of action thriller flick was an above average horror genre with a little for everyone one who likes these movies. There is the tender, emotional rescue, the comedic relief, the unanticipated deaths (so to speak), and twist at the end. This movie captures the titillating show of reveal leg, and kickass martial art moves, the evil scientists, and strong female leads. While the movie suffers from a few plot weaknesses, the fantasy, video nature of this movie allows for some flexibility. The zombie-like creatures seem to fade some in an odd illogical way (for the script's sake)...people seem to survive by luck in some cases or die in other cases (as guess just as in real life). Some of the movie is contrived, some some characters obvious set up for oblivion with recourse to rational sanity. All in all, this movie did its horror and thrills more and bigger and whizzier. Seven out of Ten Stars.On second viewing in 2017, movie now seems overly chaotic and the contrived storyline is much more bothersome.",6,0,1,25 January 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Didn't seem to be much new
","The title sort of says it all in a fashion. There didn't seem to be much new about this episode, except that the audience is introduced briefly to some cute cuddly alien creatures, though even in trailer scene in the upcoming Annihilation (2018) has some even more startling creatures. The theme of self-sacrifice is seen over and over again and the same scenario is repeated like three times throughout the movie. The inclusion of the light charm and witty dialogue from the original Star Wars franchise (1977) is sort of like attempting to bring together the raw grit of Daniel Craig's James Bond's character from Casino Royale (2006) and Roger Moore's light-hearted James Bond from Live and Let Die (1973). There are also logical lapses in the storyline in order to maintain the pace and action, such a necessary delay in reacting to a lethal obliteration of the rebel cause or the cavalier ability of a single rebel fighter to take down a monstrous weapon. The movie sort of has cross between Karate Kid (1984), Gettysburg (1993), and the more formidable fantasy epic Excalibur (1981). The storyline is deliberately somewhat convoluted but for the most part predictable and Princess Leia (?)...well that's whole other quandary. David Lynch's Dune (1984) still retains a manner of sacrifice, convoluted mega-multi-planetary, galactic intrigue, evil power, and the relational bonding and betrayal all wrapped up into one movie while the Chronicles of Naria: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe (2005) retain the epic charm of a total immersion into a magical world along with betrayal. Coming of age, and relational bond on a global scale.",7,3,21,27 January 2019
Brave," Mesmerizing
","24 June 2012. Both visually even in 2-D and substance, Brave depicts a mesmerizing eyeful of dazzling and clear animation along with focused mother-daughter relational storyline and surprisingly intense action that offer not one but two climatic scenes. Brave has the intensity and emotional connectivity of The Lion King (1994) and exquisite texture and animated detail as well as the storyline perfectly suited to animation of Bolt (2008).Brave offers a rare mother-daughter storyline in a format and a magical way that is both a treat and creative and bold presentation. Found in other genres such as horror in Dark Water (2005), family drama in Georgia Rules (2007) the relational element of Brave makes this movie a stand out. With good editing, good script that includes plenty of humor and the American penchant for individualism, all of it comes together is an entertaining and captivating summer animated action movie for children (with elements of violence).",9,1,1,17 January 2019
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Overly Violent, Overly Simplified Martial Arts Takeoff
","12 October 2003 (revised January 25, 2019). This sometimes innovative, sometimes, daring, sometimes amazing martial arts-revenge thriller comes off as a stylistic choreography of fighting complexity. Uma Thurman, though, seems to escape death more by accident than by skill or talent. The retro-violence is so much over the top that it becomes a reflection of the comic-book and graphic novel version Japanese samurai movies. The flashbacks and animations, the emotional and cute comedic scenes are great. How does Uma Thurman survive her first encounter and how does she accidentally find a weapon in the second encounter and then how does she really fend for herself in a somewhat less than brilliant sword fight in the third. Overall, this was an amazing movie with great blending of some excellent flourishes for old movies with a consistently prominent soundtrack to heighten the whole independent cult film feel, but it misses the perfection mark by a few notches.

Clash of the Titans," Clash in 3-D
","11 April 2010. The technical visual effect of 3-D of this movie still hasn't reached that qualitative level of authenticity...the overall look is like a souped up fancy Disneyland ride that has a fancy, special look but interestingly enough detracts from the intensity of the movie, especially a few early scenes when the entire screen isn't fully focused, that completely destroys the 3-D experience. This updated JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS (1963) nicely infuses the plot with a rich assortment of Greek classical legendary myths. However, the script fails to fully capture the Zeus legendary emotional God paradox and successfully execute the special effects action/chase scenes like the last three STAR WARS or even HARRY POTTER movies were able to formulate. There are some very good thrills in this movie and overall the script does relate the story well.",7,1,2,18 January 2019
Jurassic World," Derivative But OK
","16 June 2015. This movie seems to be a fusion of a monster disaster movie, typical of King Kong (2005) that has the beautiful, helpless lady sprawled on the ground with her skirt hiked up. The creation of the new dinosaur and the questions it raises might the singular most intellectually intriguing for this mostly predictable, mind-numbing and questionable logically flawed movie. There are so many scenes that just seem to be connected with so many coincidences as simply a lazy script device to keep the pacing and excitement going regardless. The visuals are decent for now and will eventually be improved upon in the future. The sound effects effective. There are number of relational and character moments of merit but mostly underdeveloped or never fully developed. Irrfan Khan's character had the most stimulating and interesting character (the new tycoon owner) that was never truly met the exciting character that he would have been developed into. I was waiting for the older boy's interest in attractive girls to be developed into more balance gender movie.I was more impressed by the subtle but stimulating mental themes of the Disney-like contrast of a thrilling futurist community of Tomorrowland (2015) or the gene splicing creation of Splice (2009) or the action thrills of Aliens (1986) or Predator (1987). In a number of ways the animated sci fi movie Wall*e (2008) possessed more mental and artistic impact than Jurassic World using silence for much of the instead of exciting, explosive action, a much more difficult directorial feat. Even classic sci fi movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) had a much more captivating and magically engrossing visual and mysterious them without all the overly graphic bombardment for the testosterone deprived audience. Without the dry wit of Jeff Goldblum's contributions in the original movies, the overall Jurassic World looses a lot of its charm in the face of so much violence and perhaps unnecessary devastation.",7,0,1,14 January 2019
Paranormal Activity," Boring But Authentic
","1 March 2010. Reality television meet horror acting. Reality is boring and the difficulty with making a film about boring reality is to keep in interesting enough that people actually watch it. What is likely even more difficult is to recreate boring reality and horror at the same time as an authentic performance. Never truly scary, uncomfortably boring but fascinating at the same time, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY seems to present one of the most authentic performances of horror on film. Unlike CLOVERFIELD (2008) that appeared to have been released in 2008 after PARANORMAL ACTIVITY but before ACTIVITY'S widescreen debut in 2009, PARANORMAL activity is genuinely almost completely more consistent in its approach to authenticity with strong elements from THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (1999) which remains more completely and eerily scary. Whether or not PARANORMAL ACTIVITY is an excellent horror film depends on the beholder and the riveting reality of it is where it presents its strongest case. Unfortunately, as a full feature film it remains boring, unscary, and mostly interesting in how it really seems to reflect what actually goes on behind the scenes in a relationship - a great pseudo-documentary reporting.",7,0,0,19 January 2019
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," A Serious Comedy
","15 July 2005. Tim Burton's version of Willy Wonka is more serious and at times more funny than the original. There are some rather disturbing scenes with squirrels for younger children and some other somewhat nasty, curt remarks while Johnny Depp attempts to provide a background character that has more depth than Gene Wilder. Here the audience gets to experience a historical storyline for Willy Wonka that has a much stronger connection to the ending of the updated version that while risky brings the story full circle in terms of Mr. Wonka's character throughout the movie. The grandparents are wonderful, as if they were lifted straight from the book. The humor is mostly reserved for Johnny Depp with his great use of expression and facial features, his quirky personality. The movie is a difficult balance between a quality, mainstream children's movie and the more odd and strange world of Tim Burton. The balance is sometimes precarious in the movie and not always perfect. The lyrics apparently from the book, using the high energy music that attempt to both keep one's attention and at the same time provide a morality story about bad children is somewhat submerged in the not so easy to understand loud music and hyper-octane of the dancing of the Oompa Loompas. This version is a much different, strong sharp colored rendition with off-putting Wonka dialogue that Johnny Depp or Tim Burton deliberately incorporated into the movie to offer up a much more serious and substantive Wonka and more qualitative ending than the original. For the most part it works, but at times it becomes just more noise and more of the same. Eight of Ten Stars.",8,2,3,23 January 2019
The Adjustment Bureau," Taking a Former Sci Fi Idea and Making It Better
","6 March 2011. Sometimes an idea and a sequel that's not a sequel gets better with time and THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU does just that. With strong elements from 'A Matter of Time,' an episode of the contemporary THE TWILIGHT ZONE (January 26, 1986), MEN IN BLACK (1997), THE TRUMAN SHOW (1998,)THE MATRIX (1999), BEING JOHN MALKOVICH (1999), and ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND (2004), the movie script adapted from the amazing mind of the late Philip K. Dick's short story (whose written work inspired - A Scanner Darkly, 2006; Paycheck, 2003; Minority Report, 2002; Total Recall, 1990; Bladerunner, 1982) brings together the often times human element that is only experienced as a supporting role but in this movie is made the central element in this movie.The beginning scenes, especially with the John Slattery's character having an uneven tone between dramatic and wry humor, seem to almost take its manipulative premise almost too well and comes across just a scripted and manipulative for the audience as the characters in the movie itself. The Wil Smith character-look-a-like also is a bit distracting and his role in the movie seems a bit too obviously interfering and distracting somehow taking a little away from the totality of the movie's suspended authenticity.Overall though, this movie quickly merges into a finely honed character-driven, emotive and compelling dramatic thriller and allows its principal characters to show the audience (us) in a fantasy in a fantasy of how we ourselves would like to see ourselves. A genuinely solid and qualitatively superior film follows in the footsteps of THE SOLOIST (2009); THE TRUMAN SHOW (1998); CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND (1977); Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004); Twelve Monkeys (1996); The Bourne Identity (2002); The Cooler (2003); Brazil (1985); Blade Runner (1982), Inception (2010), and Nomads (1986).",8,1,2,18 January 2019
World Trade Center," Flawed, Very Good, But Gets Better and Better
","10 August 2006. World Trade Center ultimately redeems itself almost in full by the end of the movie. It is respectful and insightful in its powerful way the last third of the movie is directed and acted. The problem with this movie is the way it gets there. Immediately even with the beginning shot, the focus from Nicholas Cage to general shots of the City is somewhat off balance. The editing especially in the beginning is choppy as several times one scene suddenly stops and another begins without much transition or explanation like the scene of going into the World Trade Center and then the Port Authority cops becoming suddenly suited up. There is also too much explanatory narrative, having to explain to the audience what is happening. Finally the backstory, there isn't any and the primary characters and their relationships to their families are only discovered as the movie unfolds. And the rescue is also somewhat cut short with the first efforts of getting to the trapped cops. But these flaws eventually become secondary by one of the strongest finishes of the movie in recent years.Maggie Gyllenhaal performance stands out as one of the best supporting acting awards of the year. The concept and the opportunity to put on screen this actual event surrounding the trapping of these men and their ordeal was well presented and ultimately compelling on screen as well.

Logan," An Ugly Violence, Emotionaless Superhero Movie
","7 March 2017. Unlike Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector, Hugh Jackman as Logan isn't very likable in this movie. He's stubborn to the point of being almost dumb about his decisions, allowing bad things to happen to him Even a wolf would probably be even more intelligent, resilient, and resourceful than this version of Wolverine. The relationships between characters are stilted and not very meaningful. The plot lurches from one engagement to the next more like a video game than a thoughtful and emotive storyline. Even the predictable ending seems strained by the inability of the team of characters to really offer up a sensible and more likely scenario for a climatic ending. Too many people are slaughtered in this movie that needlessly went to their deaths because of superhero ignorance or drunkenness. By the end of the movie the redeeming value that somehow was patched together at the end, isn't that convincing or memorable.",7,1,5,11 January 2019
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Special Effects Action
","9 May 2015. Heavy on special effects and action and light on thoughtful, intelligence. There are the requisite twists and deaths and relational pairings. Ironman's dry humor continues to balance the onslaught of violence that echoes of Kill Bill Vol. No 1 (2003) and The Matrix Revolutions (2003). What's new and interesting is the slight advancement of 3-D imagery and the introduction of the creative ways of destroying things. There are few new characters that add a dash of freshness.Overall, though there are a few dead zones, Ultron's actor's familiar voice can be a bit distracting and other then the action there doesn't seem to be much new or hugely interesting about this movie.

Big Fish," Fascinating Attempt
","12 January 2004. A touching 'Forest Gump' on LSD/acid trip. This movie has all those surrealistic elements as well as the emotional buttons that make for a sentimental and fantastic voyage of discovery. The Forest Gump voice-over and the tall tales as if taken from a twilight zone episode series takes the audience on a flashback and present, father/son adventure of almost magical but bumpy story (it's almost as if there were several directors changing the style and appearance of the movie).The fascinating ending destination, the tie-ins, turn arounds are cute and heart-felt, but it seems that the whole story was destined to conclude this way (but the last tale told is from the heart and burns into memory an important relational message). The movie never quite reaches the pinnacle of surrealistic, Twilight Zone, Rod Serling brilliance, never quite completely satisfies with its erratic editing and slightly off-beat cinematography.However, this movie does deserve an honorary mention for its almost Independent film imagery and its innovative and creative weaving tapestry with a few missed strands and threads of the needle.",7,0,1,25 January 2019
The Dark Knight," An Overly Depressive and Deceptively Contrived Superhero
","23 July 2008. The Dark Night (2008). Heath Ledger saves Batman. It is the singular performance of Heath Ledger that saves Batman from descending into a overly dense and overly hypocritical fusion of dark action shots, twists and turns, predictable scenes (surviving bullets), confusion and smoke and mirrors that many might consider quality art. But underneath there lies obfuscation hiding the fundamental weaknesses of this movie. The chase scenes using the artificial placement of innocent bystander vehicles placed in the most unlikely locations. The Joker's escape from the holding cell without detailing how that is so unrealistic (as think Hannibal Lector holding cell). The raw nastiness of the human spirit lowers this movie into a vision so dark and awful that it becomes a condemnation of human society in general with only brief beacons of light that appear more for scriptwriter, acceptability sake than for cinematic integrity. The beginning unnecessary voice narrative of the burglars. The dizzying and apparently unremarkable fight scenes. The uncertainty of who is good and evil, the blurring of the lines of role models - that turn the comic book image into a direct mirror of reality instead of idealism. The attempts at moralist messages and emotional deaths, the guilt trips, the violation of basic human rights in the cause of anti-terrorism and the upholding of lies and deceit and obliteration of the truth. The one outstanding feature is the mentally unbalanced purity of pure Joker craziness is so compelling as to keep the movie centered around this singular performance, holding all the loose, chaotic pieces together.

The Greatest Game Ever Played," An Intensely Personal, Beautifully Photographed, and Musically Score Movie
","26 June 2013. There aren't very many golf movies and this one is THE golf movie that seemingly explodes on the screen with an amazing opening series of animated, antiqued colored titles and then with an brilliant display of cinematography and one of the most emotively, provocative musical scores, this almost epic feeling movie about 20-year-old Francis Ouimet ultimately leads to the climatic last third of the movie of the real life 18 U.S. Open Championship that pit young American amateur against the British Open Champion Harry Vardon. Perhaps the only mild weakness was the balance between the portrayal of Ouimet and interestingly a decent effort at simultaneously incorporating some of Vardon's background and personal presentation. This movie avoids the typical stereotypical, over dramatized love affair, and enhances the personal conflict between father and son. Unlike the more mainstream fictional romantic dram Tin Cup (1996) starring Kevin Costner, that decently performs using golf as its major theme, it nevertheless doesn't stand out among its genre whereas The Great Game reverberates with a strong echo of Costner's own epic Dances with Wolves (1990) with its the original music of Brian Tyler and the rich and truly inspirational personal story being told using compelling photography and a script that richly involves the audience. Perhaps the closest in terms of excellence is the somewhat more ethereal The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000) whose focus is both on Matt Damon and Wil Smith as the mysterious caddy and diminished somewhat by the inclusion of an extra character who uses a flashback technique and doesn't quite have that consistent cinematographic or as emotionally gripping a storyline. Other movies that might be comparable include Robert Redford's baseball movie The Natural (1984) and even that movie doesn't capture the focus and intensity and richness of its sport at The Greatest Game, or another baseball movie Brad Pitt's excellent Money Ball (2011) or the horse movie Seabiscuit (2003), the personal redemption tale of Mickey Rourke in The Wrestler (2008). In some interesting respects The Great Game is a more naturalized vision of reality in juxtaposition to the more glorified but just as compelling and appealing as Leonardo di Caprio's The Great Gatsby (2013) or stylized version of The Artist (2011).",9,0,0,16 January 2019
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Some New, Some Old

There seems to be gaps in the story and a few places that have been cut short, especially between Professor Snape and Harry Potter. Overall, there is some interesting special effects, though the first storm scene doesn't really seem all that impressive. The humor is intermingled throughout, with good effect, particularly one owl in the beginning. The idea of the the role between children and adults comes out very starkly in this movie, a fascinating examination of their respective responsibilities and abilities that is revealed by the end of the movie, a somewhat unusual turn of events.

Into the Wild," Strong Movie With Major Flaws
","10 November 2007. Until the overly, emotionally wrought-movie's ending, INTO THE WILD held little in the way of redeeming value. Though gorgeous and visually stunning, Sean Penn is pretentious and overly excessive in his use of photographic and cinematic techniques. He unnecessarily tries to impress the audience with his apparent ability and knowledge of all the variety of camera work available to him. Unfortunately, the diversity and various uses of his art become a distraction in themselves and sometimes become story instead of the background. This jarring distraction becomes particularly apparent during the scene where Christopher McCandless visits a love tourist stop. In this scene Penn uses an almost documentary-style visual approach to the scene that is completely different from other styles he used in the other portions of the movie. It's use appears to more for showing off than really contributing to the story of the movie. The frequent scattering and non-linear, flashbacks, flashforwards isn't always a pleasant trip, making the audience having to twist and turn in ways that really detract from the main themes of the movie. Instead of allowing the audience just to immerse themselves into the story, they are forced into a roller-coaster ride of almost dream-like snatches of experience that never truly gel into a satisfying experience. Never is the audience allowed to truly grasp the depth of the McCandless' parent's transformation, from their beginning to their ending. Vince Vaughn, probably, has the most authentic, and delightful role in the movie, where his acting is on full display that eschews any of Vaughn's typical character stereotype. The fascinating threads that Sean does present are interesting with their continual focus on relationships throughout the movie that McCandless is exposed to. But unfortunately, these threads never truly succeed in revealing McCandless' depth of relational experience. For example, there are lukewarm inferences of emotional tragedy or regard with respect to McCandless but in another scene from another movie demonstrates how much is lacking in Penn's presentation of McCandless as a character's own emotional trial and self-absorption. In Dr. Zhivago (a book that McCandless actually reads in the movie) the audience is allowed to linger in a haunting scene of Dr. Zhivago's love leaving his life forever in a sleigh that becomes smaller and smaller until it's just a dot on the horizon before fading completely away as Dr. Zhivago desperately tries to climb up into the house's top window and look out at the last glimmer of his love life. The jet airplumes in INTO THE WILD, are much more effectively used in 24 Days After, a movie where a biological contaminated Britain is wiped out and it is only the airplumes overhead that suggest (not as in INTO THE WILD of civilization to runaway from) but civilization that saves. There is the moose killing that is so disrespectful of nature and the land. There is the reckless disregard for taking responsibility of freedom, taking advantage to not conform to the rules of society. Most of the movie appears to be an over-glorification of the wild, rugged, individual man seeking his own identity and freedom, yet, it avoids the more harsh realities that McCandless also likely experienced along the way, except for the very ending.

Unlike the mini-series version a decade earlier, this recent theatrical film version fails to present the more fun, gay, informality of the Bennett sister's and loses a lot of the authentic family interactions as well as the subtle non-verbal expression of proper etiquette that appeared so rigidly during this English era of the times.

Elysium," A Memerizing Sci Fi Socio-Political Commentary
","19 August 2013. It appears that director Neill Blomkamp has found a much more even and polished sci fi thriller in Elysium than his last disappointing turn as director in District 9 (2009). In Elysium there is a believable tragic hero portrayed by Matt Damon and a consistently cold, underplayed Secretary of Defense played by a now older looking Jodie Foster (interestingly with some overtones to former Secretary of Defense Hillary Clinton's own physical transformation over time). Like Crash (2004), the audience is immersed into a politically charged topics of health care and immigration which strike deep chords of discontent for those who can appreciate the current political state of the United States. What's rather ominous at the same time breathtaking is the possibility that some of the slum footage in Elysium may be just at outgrowth of real actual location shots around this planet that would only heighten the deepening visual reality blurring both our present sociological tragedy wrought by the frightening magnifying class divisions facing world today and what it is likely to become in the near future.Neill Blomkamp has avoided the wasted pseudo-docu style of District 9 and The Blair Witch Project (1999) and Cloverleaf (2008), incorporated a judicious use of rich flashbacks, and created a emotionally resonating straight forward storyline, almost potentially mythical in its origins for future generations of this mythical future scenario. Unlike the logical flaws found in District 9, Elysium only once glosses over its technically intact storyline for laypeople. The one glaring problem is the ease by which one the Elysium-bound ships conveniently slips into Elysium airspace. Blomkamp retains justifiably the rich and sweeping visual design of the movie while including a politically and personally potent story. The only slight dissonance is the script outline that involves the coup plot that interestingly has some overtones to the current plight in Egypt. Even more interestingly is the resemblance of this movie to the core outline to Demolition Man (1993), except without the mesmerizing future talk or even the more recent Upside Down (2013) and has the similar emotive power of human perseverance and hardship as Mel Gibson's Apocalypto (2006) or a less than epic version of Kevin Costner's Dances with Wolves (1990). Other class movies would include Gattaca (1997), Fahrenheit 451 (1966). As starkly rich as THX-1138 (1971) was Elysium is as messy and chaotically amazing, echoing the horrors of today's slums and governmental insensitivity around the world and here at home.Overall, this movie is an engaging and personally riveting movie, a great reminder for those of the mass audience to reflect on the current state of affairs in the United States and resonates with the anger and frustration that the masses are experiencing at the hands of those who have the power and control. It holds out both moral outrage and a tenuous glimmer of hope for the rest of us or perhaps its just a salve to keep us in our places.",8,1,1,16 January 2019
Taken," A Combination of Action Done Before
","31 January 2009. Been there, done that...'Taken' doesn't really offer much new in the way of action, combining elements of 'Ransom,' 'Bourne Identity,' even 'Die Hard.' However, the action fighting scene and car chases aren't quite as crisp as 'Bourne,' nor the stakes quite as high as in 'Die Hard.' The storyline and the idea of what happens to Liam Neeson's character's daughter has some potent impact, his character has some creative mental stunts, and the chain of events mostly articulate and reasonable. Even Liam Neeson's escape from the bad guys wasn't quite believable, losing the climatic impact. The beginning relational issues seemed fairly generic and stereotypical and an overly expansive explanation was provided by the boys night in. This above average action-thriller, however, just can't reach the power and intensity of its predecessors. It's mostly derivative. 7/10.",7,1,1,20 January 2019
Alice in Wonderland," Visually and Captivatingly Smart
","5 March 2010. When two A-Stars - Johnny Depp and Ann Hathaway, as well as noted actress Helena Bonham Carter with help from Alan Rickman can weave a supportive role to propel Alice played by Mia Wasikowska into a starkly rich focus, the brilliance of their acting shines with maturity. The rich and fascinating set design rivals and perhaps exceeds that of AVATAR (2009) though perhaps not reaching the imaginative level of The Lovely Bones (2009) and the storyline from start to finish maintains an intimate and substantive personal development character. Both Depp and Hathaway bring a finely honed performance and facial execution that speak thousands of words in silence. While the pacing is a bit slow in the first fourth of the movie, the unique fantasy world, Depp's embellished but finely submerged persona bring forth an effective fusion of special effects, animation, and real actors that meshes in this fantasy world - avoiding the necessity of 3-D or finely detailed animated authenticity in all manners much to better affect. There is humor, edgy drama that never crosses over into mature rating overload. In sum, this is a sparklingly fantasy has captivating action and features that brings imagination to the big screen.

","7 May 2001. While I enjoyed this sequel, I began watching the first Mummy and found myself more captivated. Perhaps, it was the actual action without the special effects and the use of more mystery and substance that made the first film more intriguing. The ending was a bit of a let down because the biggest weakness about the characterization of the evil Mummy's woman was that she was a weak flake, which really bums me out, because she really would have sacrificed her life to save her man too.

A solid, though not earth shattering drama, but record-setting bio-drama about a middle-aged, New Zealand man who sought to break a landspeed record on the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, USA. The movie was effective in building the drama, pacing, and exciting climax of the movie. The movie seemed to a bit short on character development and the brief subplots seemed a little devoid of depth, yet the storyline was simple, emotionally sensitive, and humorously dramatic in places. For locales, the few recognizable scenes on State Street and 1300 East and North Temple and 900 West in Salt Lake City were added bonuses.

Avatar," Gorgeous But Not Quite the Classic
","20 December 2009. The technology is almost here and Avatar and director Cameron has 'almost' created the perfect vehicle for the future of film (minus the real actors). This American-focused, popularized and simplified version of the block-buster sci-fi movie appears to the fusion of various popular movies plus super CGI. This movie is essentially 'Dances with Wolves' (1990) with an American ending put into space along with a 'Aliens' (1986) military background/corporate scenario, 'Robocop' (1987), 'Star Troopers (1997), Jurrasic Park III (2001) along with fantasy series 'Dragonriders of Pern' written by Anne McCaffery (1988) with musical strains from 'Enemy at the Gates' (2001). What this spectacularly looking movie misses is the consistency of cultural immersion found in 'Dances with Wolves' especially the native language and the inconsistent adoption by lead character Jake Sully of its language and its holistic mind-set, Cameron allows the Americanization and over-simplification of the politically correct presentation of American evilness. There is one scene midway where Jake is able to meld with one of the local inhabitants and then says incorrectly 'You're mine' as opposed to 'we're together now' which would have been much more in line with the native perspective of living things. There were also a few technical weaknesses consisting of 2154 machine guns which one would have assumed would have advanced in over a hundred years and the climatic action scene were supposedly bullet (still using them) proof glass conveniently breaks when it comes to the enemy's troop carriers. Overall, however, this is a break-through movie that immerses the audience into another world almost seamlessly. The level of technology and special effects almost, almost is imperceptible to live action. Yet, it is the small details that seem to deflect this movie from becoming truly a classic movie. 8/10.",8,0,2,20 January 2019
The Artist," A Powerful Visual and Auditory Romantic Drama
","8 April 2012. As the intellectually and visually gritty drama of Another Earth (2011), The Artist is as emotionally and musically riveting resonating on the more universal and familiar themes of human existence. Whereas Another Earth tells of a traumatic and unusual intense unfolding of the intimate human drama of tragedy, The Artist displays more of a silent and artistic version of the popular bigger than life love romance and adventure of The Titanic (1997). Whether or not The Artist will hold up in time is another matter because there is the 'different wow' factor in play here. Being an unusual contemporary silent, black and white film with a huge reliance of music melodies, The Artist brings forth a substantial different movie experience based on rhythmic tones and gorgeously timed tempos of musical auditory emotions (like radio) allowing for less of the mental machinations than the emotive inner vibrations of sight and sound. The Artistic is able to take advantage the rarely used medium of music and silent dialogue which forces the audience to tap into a much more reflective and emotionally visceral level. Nevertheless, some of the film's creative and emotionally compelling drama and renewal comes from that sudden burst of the audience having to use rarely used sense over the duration of the whole movie. However, The Artist may have the fortune of retaining its brilliance and flair for the unique in its genre, much like Brazil (1985) has been able to retain is imaginative power and classic claim or Lost In Translation (2003) for its minimalist plot and immersive authenticity.However, The Artist doesn't have the exclusive patent on the effective use of music or silent dialogue or emphasis on pure behavioral performances to make its resonating connection to the audience come across. Evita (2005) was produced with only singing throughout the movie. The Monkey's had their surrealistic LSD tripping movie, Head (1968) more than 40 years ago. Wall*e (2008) the animated non-dialogue version had that even more difficult time of creating emotive impact without the fine details of a live human actor's presentation. There's even Wait Until Dark (1967) with one of the best thrilling literally black climatic scenes in movie history with minimal dialogue or the horror film 1408 (2007) finds John Cusack alone by himself trapped in a hotel room for most of the movie. Solaris (1972) is also notable for its long passages without dialogue. Even Buffy: The Vampire Slayer (1999) in its fourth season in 'Hush' had no audible dialogue for most of the episode or Apocalypto (2006) with Mel Gibson had little use for dialogue has his character fought for survival or Jarhead (2005) that relied more on the ambiance and setting for its emotional impact than dialogue, or Touching the Void (2004) where most of the vivid power of the movie comes from the solo survival drama on a mountain slope. As for music, The Devil Wears Prada (2006) and even The Cooler (2003) with Mark Isham's score have already accomplished a great synthesis of music to film. Of course 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) likely can claim the musical backdrop and minimalist use of dialogue in capturing its audience in a vision beyond this earth and human understanding.Both Another Earth and The Artist use share the strong element of the use of irony, where characters in the movie do not know of the whole events taking place, where the character George Valentin is in the dark much of times as to what Peppy Miller is doing whereas in Another Earth, John Burroughs is unaware of the identity of the Rhoda Williams in connection to his tragedy. Another Earth operates on a different level, focusing on the mental level and the internal emotions of thought and feelings while The Artist takes its power using the behaviorist, externalize primal visual and auditory feelings that propel this movie with its intense resonating emotions.",9,2,7,17 January 2019
La La Land," A New Refreshing Approach to Musical Dance
","18 December 2016. La La Land (2016). In a way, La La Land is its own movie genre, a fusion of musical and drama that in just a few places doesn't seem to completely fuse well together as a smooth jazz duet. The few discordant notes arise from its lack of a full range of musical variety as in Moulin Rouge (2001), Chicago (2002), Mama Mia!!! (2008), or even West Side Story (1961). In one place, the music almost becomes repetitively dull and monotonous. In most other places, however, the music is amazingly Broadway of the highest sparkly quality, dazzling in its choreographic display, captivating sound and creative photography in Birdman (2014) style. At a few other places in the movie, the serious prolonged drama comes forth that threatens to crack the musical fantasy mood but holds together. This bold and risky venture manages to reveal the refreshing potential of a newly minted theatrical approach to filmmaking. Even the ending scenes, even though unsettling, offer up a much more mature realistic and surprisingly satisfying musical wrap-up.The dramatic romantic storyline is suggestive of the trials and tribulations from My Girlfriend's Boyfriend (2010), My Best Friend's Wedding (1997), If Only (2004), Days of Wine and Roses (1962), Roman Holiday (1952), Sliding Doors (1998), Bridges of Madison County (1995), A Man and A Woman (1966), and even Nanny Diaries (2007).",8,0,1,12 January 2019
Super 8," ET All Grown Up
","12 June 2011. The biggest problem with this movie is that ET may have grown up too much and the target audience of this movie is well...confusing. There are kids in this movie and in some ways ET forms a basis for it and there are the Goonies (1985) resemblances as well as the Stand By Me (1986) suggestions, yet there are also more juvenile and adult themes going on as well, including suggestive horror mutilations more commonly found in older teen films. There is a great special effects sequence reminiscent of The Fugitive (1993) and the close up shot making especially in the beginning sequences that confirm that a picture is worth a thousand words as the, brief non-verbal headshots used by J.J. Abrams, the director really captures the quality physical acting of the son, girl, and father in this movie. The storyline is so simple, yet the construction and development of the plot is presented in such a way as to geometrically expand the simplicity of the story in an amazing and compelling way. The relational conflicts in this movie are solid, disturbing, and yet well suited in the final product. The best comparison to Super 8 is that it is a bigger budget, more mainstream version of the hard to find Wavelength (1983) which is itself an overlooked sci fi classic. Super 8 is one of the best movies of the year and takes a lot from Jaws (1975) in its direction and style of presenting drama and thrills to the audience.",9,1,2,18 January 2019
The Last Samurai," The Epic Adventure Movie of the Year
","6 December 2003. With the similar trappings of 'Dances with Wolves,' and 'Braveheart,' 'The Last Samurai' holds to the same level of richness, intensity, complexity, and grandeur as its predecessors. Every few years, a movie comes out that captures a national experience with a foreign flavor that both examines the epic as well as the intimate personal scale of experience. The Last Samurai presents the audience a solid and carefully crafted epic of a nation undergoing dramatic and revolutionary change as well as the complex, subtle trappings of cultural differences (particularly difficult when it comes to a culture such as Japan). With emotional sincerity and respect to Japanese culture and tradition, the high class Japanese language used in the movie captures the level of seriousness upon which those involved cultivated their craft and produced this movie. Unlike its predecessors, it takes a somewhat harder line and perhaps simplified portrait of the evils of society and the trappings of political intrigue as well as a loosening of script towards the end. As with 'Dances with Wolves' but with an even less effective ending the movies unnecessarily overextends the ending ending by about thirty seconds too long (that is suggestive of American producer and mass audience testing might require or dictate for better word of mouth ratings and profits). While perhaps not exactly reaching the same league of its former film epic giants with its slight blemishes, this movie is definitely the epic adventure movie of the year and maybe the last several years.

Up," A Fabulous But Uneasy Adult/Family Animated Movie
","5 July 2009. 'Up' attempts the difficult fusion of both children and adult elements in the same movie and usually succeeds marvelously at both. This sharp, 3-D animated movie handles both roarously funny scenes along with dramatic emotional scenes dealing with love, growing old, and the issue of what's important in life. However, as a serious movie, it attempts to incorporate childlike fantasy elements and sometimes the rigors of logical and reasonable cause and effect go out the window which would be no problem in a traditional animated movie directed towards young people. But 'Up' in attempting to have it both, both serious grown-up issues and thoughtful scenes, it brings with it an expectation of a tighter reign on more realistic scenes regarding chases and escapes while thrilling go beyond plausibility, breaking the suspension of animated realism, which when 3-D is used actually increases the need for virtual practical sequences. Overall however, this movie is captivated with fabulous colors, the action is riveting, the plot outline decently strong and in some instances even more intimate than Coraline (2009). 8/10.",8,0,0,20 January 2019

Invincible," A Revealing Look At Football
","15 July 2013. This biographical portrayal of Vince Papale, a 30-year-old bartender (played by Mark Wahlberg) from South Philadelphia who tried out for NFL's Philadelphia Eagles in 1976 is perhaps remarkable not for the ironically 'good' under-spirited acting, but for the scriptwriting, directing and editing. While Wahlberg performed decently, what made this movie special wasn't the dramatic performances so much as the more difficult underplaying of the usual stereotypical and hyped up action and melodrama in typical sports movies or for that matter most dramatic features. This movie never went over the top, Wahlberg's sports actions didn't excessively eclipse that of the rest of the Eagle's plays. And even the script brought out the more elusive underlying sociological underpinnings of the game of football often missed in most team sports movies. The potential romantic subplot was restrained and more authentic and supportive, not intrusive, the father-son relationship was made into an antagonistic sideshow, nor the coach-player relationship wasn't made into some warm and fuzzy mentor character sideline. Instead, Invincible focused on the personal and intimate struggle of overcoming a socially derived fatalistic and damning self-image as well as the social connections in a tightly knitted community.Robert Redford's The Natural (1984) was as much about his romantic relationship and the political gamesmanship as it was about baseball, Micky Rourke's The Wrestler (2008) was more about the singular individual focus on redemption and coming back, Brad Pitt's Money Ball (2011) with its rich and more raw look at the big picture of baseball perhaps Invincible is more connected to Meg Ryan's Against the Ropes (2004) was more about overcoming the sexual discrimination of couching in a male dominated sport while Papale faced age discrimination and elitist snobbery of NFL draft requirements, or Shia LaBeouf's The Greatest Game Ever Played (2005) with an individualistic look at an amateur playing in the elite big league of golf at the turn of the century.",9,2,3,16 January 2019
National Treasure," The American Movie For Just The Right Audience
","20 November 2004. National Treasure is the all-American movie about good vs. evil which is just what the American audience needs at this time in the face of America's war in Iraq. With a great dose of Lara Croft's lofty beginning theme along with Raiders of the Lost Ark sort of comedy and action adventure, throw in some nice high-tech, Enemy of the State themes and this movie is a gang-buster of a movie for the American public. It starts out with such action that it has difficulty keeping up the pace and the editing become a problem through its length and slower pace that it seems too long until the exciting climax that avoids the unbelievable ending of most movies. The romance and the nice contrast of bad guy-blow'em approach vs. the more subtle good guy approach makes this movie enjoyable. This is a great movie of the moment, for its time and audience, though not a classic by any means, it's great entertainment of the moment. Eight out of Ten Stars.",8,8,8,24 January 2019
How to Train Your Dragon," An Enthralling Animated Fantasy
","28 March 2010. Take DANCES WITH WOLVES (1990) and make it into an captivating 3-D fantasy and retain the haunting but melodic sound track and you have HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON. The special effects are sharp and vivid without overuse and do not get in the way of the visceral storyline, but make for a great backdrop. The story, itself is handled with care with a nice set-up and a more careful cultivation of boy and dragon and the fascinating learning curve obtained by this experience and how it is demonstrated in real practice is smartly addressed by the middle of the movie. Even the ending has a slightly educational and emotive element not usually scene in most action adventure movies. There is humanity and there are the requisite JURASSIC PARK (1993, 1997) moments with man confronting/anthropomorphic animal in the wild experience. In same ways, this movie resembles the basic human, emotional, you versus them conflict premise from THE INCREDIBLES (2004) that made that movie so powerful and compelling.",8,1,1,18 January 2019
Limitless," Interesting But Falls Short
","7 April 2017. While there is a nicely, innovative, sweeping photographic technique used in the beginning credits and later in the movie, there potential sophisticated intelligence expected from a movie with this theme seems to be missing. Consider how Robert Redford performs his seemingly intriguing ploy without medicinal enhancement at decade earlier in Spy Game (2001). Or consider what Scarlett Johansson accomplished in Lucy (2014) three years later. The plot just seems to be missing the intelligence and the De Niro aspect might have been better just as its own stand alone little drama.",7,0,0,11 January 2019

Yet by the end of the movie, the fantasy and reality fuse together in a way that can leave the viewer intrigued and reflective. In some ways the daring boldness of this movie when it come out has diminished with time. Yet the raw, starkness of some of the images linger in their power and vitality. This movie while standing the test of time, appears now to have only begun the cinematic process of greatest not defined it.

Beauty and the Beast," A Slightly Askewed Live Action Version
","26 March 2017. Adapting the animated classical musical into a live action musical brought forth some memorable emotional moments but at the same time lost the fun exaggerated, lightness captured in the cartoonish display of several of the characters. The most prominent problem with the updated live action movie is the casting of the real human character Gaston whose physical presence just doesn't capture the animated comical snootiness of the anti-hero. The animated version had charm whereas the live action version had to make due with a pseudo-Broadway stage musical production and in some ways didn't capture the dazzling set designs along with the musical renditions found in such productions as Sound of Music or even Mary Poppins or My Fair Lady.The live action was most wonderful when it came to the humanity of human suffering and pain but as the same time became too edgy in its raw, violent scenes. Oddly enough Kevin Kline while perfectly cast as the father, wasn't Kevin Kline enough to capture the softer and lightly comical animated version. As for the use of song as live actions and the voice over, which is almost second nature in animated movies, since Les Miserable (2012) use of live singing on set, this live action musical seemed less authentic and more acted.",7,0,1,11 January 2019
Sicario," Eventually A Penetrating Look At The Dark Side
","13 May 2016. With strong elements from Traffic (2000) in which Benecio Del Toro won a best support actor Oscar and again gets to star in Sicario in a somewhat different role, Emily Blunt becomes our eyes and ears in this dark criminal drama. There are some great intense scenes that the audience participants in as observers to the efforts to make a difference in the war on drugs. Sicario has taken some hard-hitting actions scenes from Phillip Noyce's Clear and Present Danger (1994), Tony Scott's Spy Game (2001), and even Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker (2008).There are some weaknesses that appear in this movie. Emily Blunt's character without any character development seems to lack the depth of character to establish her persona and role that she presents on the screen. By the end of the movie, though, it becomes quite clear that even without Blunt's depth of character and backstory how the painful moral dilemma arose and becomes a sharp dagger against some's throat. There is a lack of balance between the American and Mexican characters, especially the important role of the Mexican police officer that is highlighted in the movie. There is also some fine landscape photography, especially of a jet taking off, but missing a similar opportunity to experience the wondrous sensation of its landing too. Finally, the mainstream photography of a high quality production seems to actually diminish the raw, jagged hard edge of the undertone of the movie.Even so, this movie as a whole is reflects a good attempt at pushing the envelope in quality, innovative ways of transporting the audience into the war zone of America's drug war.",8,2,3,13 January 2019
The Descent," Female Action Descents Into Malehood
","5 August 2006. Warning: Spoilers. A nice idea, but one that descends into something indistinguishable from other horror/action/thrillers. What begins uneven with a oddly, unnatural hospital scene where bystanders seemingly ignore this poor woman in agony, continues with a new idea of having sex somewhat strong female personalities with some abilities at typical male sports - rafting and cave exploration, and introduce a somewhat different dark, cavernous action thriller, with somewhat monster-type things thrown in. We have the typical stereotypical characters - the young brash funky kid, the macho-adventure seeker, the more humble hurt female, and the rest of the women bound for possible slaughter. There is an eerie resemblance with Silence of the Lambs with one of our strong woman running through the woods towards the beginning of the film. There is the Alien scene of water dripping and the face pointed upwards. There is a fascinating contrast to classic The Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959) with the underground, claustrophobic shots done with excellent effect in both movies. There is even the Alien scene in the director's cut with Dallas wanting to die at the end of the movie. Finally there are similarities to The Blair Witch Project (1999) with camera, photographic technique in places.Unfortunately for this movie, the intelligent, qualitatively superior female potential of this movie descending to the typical (unfortnately perhaps realistic) scene reminiscent from Aliens when the soldiers get trapped underground and almost seemingly go from crack soldier to blind idiots. Unlike the classic Alien and Ripley, the heroine, who is able to project both strength but presence of mind and humanity, this movie entertains the typical descent into hell and The Predator - the kill or be killed mentality - no questions asked. The movie tries, with good intention, but ends up somewhat manipulative, somewhat artificial.This is a watchable, but not more scary movie than any other. What is has going for it is its new, fresh, taking an old idea and making it better. Except, for example, the worn out ending shot. Six out of Ten Stars.",6,0,2,22 January 2019
Inside Man," A Counter Twisting Movie
","9 April 2006. Like The Village, The Inside Man uses the 180 degree twist and to pretty good effect. This mystery thriller built up slowly, perhaps too slowly for some, in its convoluted plot about a bank heist. Strangely this good-feeling movie manages to reveal all in one of the 'longest explanations' of any movie and short changes the screen time of Jodie Foster creating some imbalance in the overall presentation of the movie. Yet this is a tight, more cerebral mystery movie, that doesn't quit have the same intense bite of The Crying Game or the Usual Suspects.

Jack Reacher," Decent But Flawed
","28 December 2012. Jack Reacher is one of the few movies which upon reflection was worse then when it was experienced. The plot flaws abound in the movie which detract from the movie and some of the scenes were over the top in a bad way. Nevertheless the movie sustained its consistent suspense and reached levels of intense emotional outrage in a good way. Finally, the ending of the movie was admittedly slick and emotional appealing.SPOILERS. However, (1) the idea of the deliberate assassination of one person cloaked in the apparent random deaths of three other innocent people doesn't ring true because it was much more reasonable to believe other less drastic means would have been likely available to achieve the outcome sought. (2) the idea of a second shooter positioned so far away from the first shooter would have been technically impossible to cover up through ballistic testing and it would have been at least more reasonable to have had a second shooter positioned sufficiently close to the first shooter to take ballistic testing into account. (3) the bumbling second lay attack in the bathroom with Reacher in the bathroom scene was over the top dumb and not really believable, even to the point where Reacher is caught off guard so easily and then as fate would have it, avoid further injury with so many accidental misses. (4) the Reacher and assassinate hand to hand combat scene was also pretty lame not just for its fight scene, but for Reacher to just not shoot the man. (5) Robert Duvall was just too lucky because the better assassin was mysteriously out of the picture too long and never himself attempted to take out Robert Duvall, (6) Reacher's ability to shoot the investigator hiding behind the defense lawyer was just a script device, at least Reacher would have been better off just taking his time and shooting through the hole his eye had looked through.Other movies more technically pure and also as action appealing are The Shooter (2007), The Specialist (1994), Enemy of the State (1998). The Pelican Brief (1993) has the same intensity and consistency in action and conspiracy.",7,0,0,17 January 2019
The Da Vinci Code," A Nice Balance of Dramatic Thriller and Intellectual Mystery
","21 May 2006. Ron Howard has created an amazing intellectually stimulating religious mystery-thriller without distracting and unnecessary special effects and action thrills. Most of the important action sequences are tame by current standards and straightforward but are more compelling for their simplicity than their implausibility, especially considering the premise of the movie. The twists and turns are nice and the lengthy ending is more Fahrenheit 451 (1966). The pacing of this verbose and convoluted symbolic deciphering is intriguing and consistently entertaining. Tom Hanks offers a sympathetic character who articulates the story well. The tension oozes out in strategically timed sequences. The weakest part of the movie is the opening sequence which seems more forced and awkward in its presentation and photographic technique. Most of the characters are presented with more than stereotypical two-dimensional depth. While this movie could have been more powerful in The Passion of The Christ (2004) in terms of start realism, this more summer blockbuster provides its audience with religious exploration and controversy as acceptable entertainment This movie breaks new religious ground for mental exploration with an important message for the sexual division in our society. It's approach is positive and mysteriously sad at the same time. The criticism of Ron Howard holding back isn't in evidence here, except for those people eager for division and conflict for its own sake. But such a dramatic heightening of controversy would belie the true intent of the movie. The movie offers hope of an uplifting outcome as a result of the production of The Da Vinci Code.

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Overweighed Movie
","19 November 2005. There is too much for one movie to do justice to this new edition of Rowling's book. While there is plenty of action and humor, the substance, the character development is missing oftentimes. I couldn't really get into any of the characters from the other invited schools. These new characters are so stereotypical and bland as to be poor dressing for the movie and their exploits are practically ignored. Even Harry doesn't seem to be all there either - with so much that he has been through, he doesn't seem to have grown up or matured all that much as would be expected. Hermoine's character doesn't seem to have a lot to do, except date and show that she's growing up. Even at the end, when something terrible happens to an important character, it's difficult to really have much sympathy. This convoluted and sometimes confusing new edition is difficult to follow at times and not all the dots seem to connect up. Overall, the movie was interesting, the effects nice, yet the fun intensity seems missing. And literally most of the magic seems to have been left out, Harry seems to operate as if he has forgotten much of what he has learned from previous books. This dazzling, gorgeously gigantic display sputters some when the dense content of the movie is presented to a much more highly anticipating audience. Seven out of Ten Stars.",7,0,0,23 January 2019
Thor," A Straight Forward Superhero Movie
","21 June 2012. Besides from visually dazzling innovative set designs that evoke a beautifully other-world delight, these supposed Gods seems very retro unlike even those depicted in the original Superman (1978) and the potential brilliance antagonist where there are glimpses is never truly realized and simply becomes another stereotypical two-dimensional character. Thor's fall from grace while initially an 'extended' piece of work does work in a fashion. Ironically the visuals during the ending credits are some of the most intriguing, under-utilized as part of the credits instead of being better incorporated into the movie itself. Somehow, even The Bourne Identity (2002) action scenes are more exciting and compelling than those found in this movie which relies on spectacular special effects even considering the God-like powers supposedly at the director's disposal for this movie.Green Lantern (2011) had a better balance and more story authenticity than the larger than life dramatization of this superhero having more depth of character and and story. Even Elektra had a stylish quality in both the action scenes (without resorting to power) and a poignant emotional pull that Thor didn't have. Lord of of the Rings (2002) had the epic fantasy battles. Spiderman 2 (2004) had the convoluted romantic dimension and the Chronicles of Narnia (2005) and Spiderman 3 (2007) had the innocent corruption that Thor incorporated only a suggestion of but pulled back.

The Happening," Disappointing, Disjointed, and Pretty Much Incomprehensible
","10 October 2008. An intriguing idea one that I have thought about years ago, but the effort falls far short of compelling and engrossing entertainment. This effort was disjointed, shock-valued horror that betrays the more subtle possibilities that the premise of this movie could have played on. The characters were too strange, almost as strange as the horror-filled scenes themselves. The dialogue was artificial or forced. Only glimpses of true film-making flare were on display. Unfortunately they were far and few between. This movie was a frustrating experience because it felt so unreal, unrealistic which was devastating for a movie with the plot outline that required a stretch to begin with. This is an unfortunate moment in movie-making for a director who had so much potential and took an idea that could have really gone far but fell so short.",2,0,0,20 January 2019
The Shape of Water," A romanticized fairytale of the darker aspects of American society
","Having to overcome the more dated sleazy image of Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954), Shape of Water makes its own more artful humanistic debut. Using a glamourized period artistic style of the 1940s and 1950s director Guillermo del Toro of Chronos (1993) and Hellboy (2004), has built upon the retro silent movie cinema of The Artist (2011) with the delightful period elements of the romantic comedy Down with Love (2003). This is a whimsical but also penetratingly stark reflection of the social divides that resonated and still persist in America today such as depicted in Hidden Figures (2016) and The Help (2011) which both also starred Octavia Spencer that is in this movie. Towards the end of the movie, like the delightful romantic comedy, Shape of Water also includes an elegant surrealistic period sequence. The only glaring discord arises with a most difficult to portray verbal thoughts of the mute star of the movie when director del Toro resorts to having Richard Jenkin's character having to literally repeat Sally Hawkins's character's important speech scene. At times much darker than typical expected, this sci fi/monster movie offers up a revealing and perhaps profound statement about prejudice and humanity as also depicted in two other small, independent movie pieces Wavelength (1983), an engaging early sci fi movie about children's attempt to save captured space aliens and Artic Heart (2016) which just happens to be a contemporary synthesized creature version of Shape of Water.

The Matrix Reloaded," An Eclectic Hodgepodge of Sci Fi/Martial Arts Themes
","18 May 2003. Matrix Reloaded has become an uneasy collage of sci fi, virtual reality, and martial arts spectaculars interlaced with attempts at emotional human connections and intellectual philosophy. The beginning sequences unfortunately come across as imitations of Final Fantasy computer generated animations (that supposed to represent actual reality) along with the original HR Giger images of Alien creations of an inner earth and Minority Report computer mechanizations. And somewhere along with way, the audience is strangely passed over and dropped into the sequel to Matrix having been left out of about an hour a missing introduction to a whole nether world that we've never seen.Plenty of movies have used virtual reality to good effect - even Virtual Nightmare(2000) which played on the Sci Fi Channel was able to include a triple twist in its two hour playing time duplicating the twists in the Matrix and its sequel minus the martial arts action sequences. Brazil (1985), The Cell (2000), Dark City (1998), The Truman Show (1998), eXistenZ (1999), Freejack (1992), Total Recall (1998); Virtuosity (1995) have all used the virtual idea, some to better impact than Matrix. Matrix: Reloaded, overdoes the action, overplays the martial art action and becomes a rather unsettling series of confusing, exploding, repeatings scenes.While the intent, the energy to make an intelligent, above average sci fi - action -thriller, this Matrix sequel only succeeds in revealing how truly difficult to combine so many elements into an even, compelling memorable movie.",6,0,0,25 January 2019
The Fountain," A Serious Slaughterhouse-Five Update
","Unfortunately, whether due to lack of sleep or the movie, I fell asleep during part of the movie. Personally, I think I was tired. The closest movie that can be contrasted with this movie is Slaughterhouse-Five (1972) but without the lighter and more action-oriented thrills. This experimental looking, somewhat uneven movie is one of the few widely released fresh and innovative attempts at film-making in years. The ending is consistent with the more esoteric, but quality films. The possible interpretations and the whole look and approach to the theme of life and death is refreshing and bold. Confusing and slow in places, this movie doesn't shy away from its attempt to conceptually and visually fuse the concept of universal holy grail. Possibly an excellent movie, but one that requires a second look, like Solaris. 8/10. After almost 12 years and thanks to VUDU, I was able to see The Fountain for a second time (with ads of course) on my laptop (but with noise-cancelling high-quality Sony headphones) while fully awake. In the interim though, I've come to really enjoy Rachel Weisz as an actress so that I've also developed a personal, emotional bias into liking many movies in which she is in. I would place this movie into the esoteric, imaginatively photographically gorgeous film experience incorporating the universal immortality, morality tale along with infusing the movie with love and life and death themes that can impact the audience on the a deeply emotional level. Oddly enough, this movie doesn't really add much in the way of new material, and yet Darren Aronofsky created a film that is better than its separate movie elements parts and plot points. As to whether, this movie can be considered a major breakthrough movie like a classic, still remains to be seen (as a timeless period of this art media may tell).

While I really liked Enemy, I couldn't but wonder why for so much concentration on the main characters we never really found out much about their past and what made them do what they do. Overall the movie wasn't a 'Saving Private Ryan' which in itself wasn't a bad thing. I particularly liked the interplay between Law and Harris and the low tech but high minded duel between the two. What would have been even better was a Russian produced film with a Russian script and Russian directed film. I came away from the film wondering if the portrayal in the movie was severely bias against today's America's so called 'enemy'. The movie was richly lavish, the context, texture, the patience all made the movie a delightful thriller and emotional package. Ed Harris came across real well both as a person and cold-bloodedness. The real debate here is who really was the better sniper? [3/30/08]: This movie really holds up well with repeating viewing and whether or not the past of these characters are revealed seems to be irrelevant to the real here and now, present concern about love, male competition. The fascinating interplay of two plot lines - the eventual sniper duel and the love triangle make for a balanced and intellectually, emotionally satisfying connection. The double-agent spy in the form of a little boy is even intriguing along with the eventual outcome of the boy's mother. There is epic mythology, media propaganda, the infamous Krushchev, inevitable Premier of Russia. This movie remains a strong 8/10 and even improves with age.",8,1,1,27 January 2019
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," The Intelligent Romantic Comedy of the Year
","11 June 2005. Mr. and Mrs. Smith is an intelligent romantic comedy that ups the bar for using action-adventure as a way to highlight marital discord and resolution. Unlike the trailers, this comedy isn't really about tapping into the adolescent male need for speed and violence, in fact one of the primary scenes that includes action feels off balance in the movie. The movie begins as a romantic comedy with Mr. and Mrs. Smith in a marital counseling session (while the movie credits are being shown!) and the first third of the movie is actually way slow for an action-adventure movie, thus expectations are challenged as to the pacing of this movie if one was expecting one type of movie and ended up with another.The delicious interplay between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie is backed up by good cinematography, a sensitivity to acting and expression (not only dialogue), and so good relational, emotional punch lines that become available under this ridiculous scenario of two assassins being married to each other. The underlying theme of marital relationships within such a conflicted profession allows the screenplay to delve into the nature of marriage further than is possible in reality. It allows the audience to be exposed to an alternative reality, that tests certain truths about men and women in relationships where one has to decide between life and death of the self and the life and death of the relationship that are not ordinarily available in normal circumstances. Thus film can take us places we cannot go in reality, and explore certain concepts in an entertaining manner.While not perfect, this movie goes into comedy romance in an area that is tapped for its gems. The plot has some holes in regards to plausibility (much like Lara Croft movies), but it is the comic approach to revealing more about marriage than about feasibility and realism that counts here (see Indiana Jones, Star Wars), that is a stake. The pacing and the tone of the film undergo stresses by this bold attempt to manage a script that jumps into murky waters of romantic comedy and deciding to go for the feels good, instead of the dark, black comedy approach of 'The War of the Roses' (1989) with Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner that could be better described as a comedy-drama. Mr. and Mrs. Smith is an example of the continual evolution, exploration of the romantic comedy genre that highlights the nature of the industry is progressing, not deteriorating.

The Departed," Gets Much, Much Better As A Crime Drama Over The Years
","With an all-star cast, director Martin Scorsese has directed a tight, emotionally tense, stark crime drama. Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, Vera Farmiga, and Alec Baldwin produce powerful performances in this drama that depicts the psychological life and death interplay of two dueling characters each playing deep undercover on opposing sides of the dark streets of Boston. Thirteen years after my first review which resulted in a mediocre seven out of ten, this is a rare movie that has grown tremendously with a renewed sense of dramatic excitement as the riveting script and performances grip the audience. It is likely the difficult but terrifying ending was experienced many years ago as so unsettling that to negatively color the entire movie. But Boston is to be expected to be a tough town and along with it a tough movie to depict some hardened and strongly harsh performances. The only slight weakness is how Matt Damon's backstory develops while Leonardo DiCaprio seems to get a much more slighted development. Nevertheless from beginning to end, this hard-edged, gripping crime thriller hits the mark as one of the smartest crime movies as opposed to typical action packed, over the top thrillers.31 October 2006. While I understand why many moviegoers may get a bang out of this movie and can convince themselves that this is a great movie with all these great actors, the execution of the movie still leaves something wanting. The beginning of this movie is awkward as the backstory of up and coming Colin Sullivan get special attention while the more down and out, perhaps even more integrity-based Billy Costigan gets secondary attention. The understanding of these characters are not convincing played out in the beginning but the eventual plot development into the tight corners is tense, intriguing and very well done. However by the end of the movie which is its major downfall is that the execution becomes murder, literally manipulative and too easy a way out for the scriptwriter and director. There isn't any of the more intellectually cool lingering on story that a more sophisticated and higher quality movie could have taken. The love romance also seems weakly developed in both instances and the real potential of a starker, more conflicted role is overlooked.The director uses surprise shock value to attempt to impress its audience and push onto us a much more mechanical ending than a more deliberate, convoluted and psychologically satisfying resolution of the movie. The acting was great, the interplay and thrills were spectacular. Unfortunately, the final product ultimately unwound itself outside Oscar quality, except perhaps for several of the performances. Matt Damon, Leonado Dicaprio, Mark Walberg do really shine, nevertheless while Alec Baldwin is underperformed in the script. Seven out of Ten Stars.",9,0,2,22 January 2019
The Witch," A Good, Unscary But Flawed Horror Movie
","22 May 2017. It's odd to hear a variation of musical strains from 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) used in this horror movie instead of a ship floating along the surface of the moon or surrounding a dark, black monolith, but it's there. This movie has the raw and grittiness of The Name of the Rose (1986) and The Revenant (2015). This movie rather being so much as a scary, horror movie is more of a serious religious family drama with periodic insertions of the occult. It doesn't quite have the intensity nor creepiness of erotic horror film Under the Skin (2013) or Siren (2016) nor the more compelling story of Black Death (2010). The ending is also odd in that it doesn't really seem to flow naturally from what went on earlier in the movie, almost as if it was tacked on at the last minute to include some sort of dramatic ending.",7,1,2,11 January 2019
The Holiday," Quality Romantic Drama Entertainment
","5 January 2007. Except for two moderate miscues, this romantic drama entertainment is a dazzling display of natural portrayals of banter between romancing couples. The emotional relationships on screen are refreshing, lively, and revealing for their depth of realism and delight. Except for Jack Black's usual character performance that is beginning to become almost stale (missing a great opportunity to play against type) and a rather typical ending, this movie is a solid credit to romance pictures in lifting the level of performance and true dialogue in this genre. A great movie for the holiday season. Cameron Diaz continues to perform well as an under-rated and overlooked actress along with her co-stars (Kate Winslet and Jude Law) all doing well (if only Jack Black could expand his range). The scene with children is a truly wonderful, quality family performance with tender dialogue and acting from the young ones. Eight out of Ten Stars.",8,2,3,22 January 2019
Zero Dark Thirty," A Brilliant Ending But Uneven Beginning
","23 February 2013. The very beginning black screen of the movie with only the audio 911 calls seemed to be, understandably chaotic, but in the directorial use of such audio chaos, it also provoked unnecessary confusion and detachment from the more reflective emotional aftershock of the event. Oddly enough the physical violence of the interrogation scenes were tame compared to the fictional violence of most action, adventure thrillers such as Daniel Craig's brutal beating in Skyfall (2012) and even such actions as urinating on the detainees which was widely reported by the news media at the time were omitted. Jessica Chastain's character was also uncharacteristically stereotypical during the early torture scenes with the requisite facial expressions of supposedly suppressed disgust. Her character throughout the movie was underdeveloped with no backstory, not significant revelation of her attitude, motivation except implicit hatred and revenge. There is the bus explosion which is also oddly inconsistently muted and only indirectly shot. All these minor flaws only contribute to any uneven flow and tempo of most the movie until the final insurgent sequences. By the end, there are two shots, one an editing flow problem where one moment the American insurgent team or on the ground and then suddenly in the air and finally Chastain's character is asked where she'd like to go with no response and no shot of the airman who asked the question before the fade out.Comparatively speaking, the ending and climax of the movie is technically similar to the amazing, ground breaking beginning sequence of Saving Private Ryan (1998) and has some of the visceral compelling intensity of Black Hawk Down (2001). Yet in some ways, most of the the cinematography isn't quite as densely raw and rich as United 93 (2006), Body of Lies (2008), or Munich (2005). As discussed, the movie is also missing the rich depth of the humanity of the characters as portrayed in Breach (2007), Jarhead (2005), Manhunter (1986), and even Apocalypse Now (1979) or the balanced depiction of the characters on both sides of this military conflicts as better presented in Green Zone (2010) which also had several strong military action scenes. As for Argo (2012), Zero Dark Thirty's contemporary movie, Argo was more consistent, more emotionally riveting, and had more connective depth. If only Kathryn Bigelow as a director has been able to learn from director Sidney Lumet's fine black and white gripping and tense focus in Fail-Safe (1964) what could have this movie become.",8,1,2,17 January 2019
War of the Worlds," Unbelievable Storyline
","29 June 2005. Warning: Spoilers. This remake just doesn't make a lot of sense. There's too many holes in the storyline and the manipulative formula of the scenes are forced. From the beginning of the invasion the semi-mechanical tripods (an attempt to honor the H.G. Wells image of our invaders seems awkward). The original movie actually seems more modern in some cases this movie's attempt to work backwards. The aliens seem almost retro at some points without knowledge of infrared scanners like those used in the television series 24 by the counter terrorist unit, cages for people without force fields.The manipulative storyline begins to drag where coincidence builds upon unlikely coincidence as Tom Cruise tries to for some fantastic reason reunite his children with their mother (who has divorced him) and lives in Boston. He finds a van that runs after an electromagnetic pulse wipes out any electronic device. He is able to negotiate around the freeways at ease while all the other vehicles are conveniently mostly out of his path. There's the required mob scene. There's the how do one's get to be the last family on the ferry which of course is later capsized. We have a young daughter who needs to go and relieve herself but even after her experience with dead people, suddenly these no time to actually go...(I probably would have to go in my pants right there and then). Then there's the son who seems for no real good explanation has this death wish who actually survives at the end (a tribute to the good, happy American ending).The absence of any focus on the military effort to counter-attack the invasion (quite the opposite of the original movie version) is an interesting decision, making the whole military counter-offensive look uncoordinated and confusing...nobody seems to no what their are doing and where they are going throughout the movie - more like zombies without intelligence.The creepiness was there, but unfortunately, this movie came across not as a horror/thriller but more like a science fiction action movie. The eerie red color was effective. The overall texture of the movie, the disaster sequences powerful, yet all this is let down by the actual unfolding of the substance of the movie itself.",6,1,2,23 January 2019
Love Actually," Best Light-Weight Romantic Comedy-Drama
","7 November 2003. This is one of the best light-weight romantic comedy dramas movies. Without being a heavy-weight classic full of drama or screwball humor, this movie puts romance and comedy-drama to a new level of balanced, perfectly executed entertainment. Like 'Pretty Woman,' 'Love Actually' has raised the bar for romance movies with a great cast of well acted love scenes, loosely connected together. Hugh Grant is fantastic as well as Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, and Liam Neeson. The supporting cast is solid, particularly Rowan Atkinson one of my most disgusting comics, who underplays will success the best of his talents. The seamless movement between comedy and drama is wonderful to experience and the message about love and the movies time release makes for a must see experience this winter season.

Wedding Crashers," Disgusting Movie That Tries To Be Good
","16 July 2005. Unlike 'There's Something About Mary' (1998), 'The Wedding Crashers' went over the line with its suggestive scenes, perhaps it's a generation gap, but the movie was a turn off in a number of respect. Owen Wilson's character was an insensitive jerk that provided no sympathy except for perhaps egotistical young adult males in the audience looking for some ideal rationalization why what they lust after is OK after all. This predicable, stereotypical comedy had great potential for a comedy-drama that ended up as male, summer entertainment for the exploitation of women. To its credit, 'The Wedding Crashers' tries to be good with a morality tale that unfortunately got lost in the good feel movie entertainment. While a couple takes their vows the movie has a our main love interest being insultingly oblivious, just one example of how crass and insensitive this movie is. This uneven comedy promotes the most obvious offensive behavior instead of making this movie a witty, intelligent, comedy drama that it could have been. The script, the director took the easy way out scrambling for gag laughs that sometimes actually hurt (but not in a good way). Since the movie didn't degenerate into complete silliness and grossness five out of ten stars.",5,1,3,23 January 2019
There Will Be Blood," Flawed But Great Nevertheless
","21 January 2008. Warning: Spoilers. It's rare that a technically flawed movie can survive to be an excellent movie. Because of a great story and strong acting, this movie even with its problems it is able to overcome them. The very beginning the problems with this movie are apparent with the music that is more associated with horror and science fiction. There is a point in the movie where strains of 2001: A Space Odyssey seem to flow over the musical tones. There is another section of the movie where industrial, early nineteenth century mechanical sounds become apparent and last too long into the scene drowning out the natural landscape sounds. The music was intrusive and inconsistent. Also at the beginning, there is a fascinating look at isolated, primitive prospecting. Yet, when the accidents keep coming, they seem more for script convenience then anything else. How many times would a prospector understand how heavy his tools are and be unable to use a single pulley to lift them out of his small shaft? How careful would a prospector learn to be of his makeshift ladder? A more convincing injured person's crawl can be found in the wonderful Touching the Void (2004) about an injured mountain climber. It is confusing about who the characters are in the beginning and if they are the same person and the transition from mining ore to oil occurs. There's not enough spent on the ore transaction as likely the entrance into the oil business. Does Daniel Plainview really have all these other oil rigs or is he lying about them? He doesn't seem to be directly involved with any of the other rigs at all, ever as he seems to imply in his speeches. His first attempt at a speech is focused almost entirely on him even though as important is the interaction between Mr. Plainview as his rather hostile audience that we can only catch glimpses of. The relationship between Mr. Plainview and his boy becomes more and more ambiguous as well as the boy's own antisocial behavior midway into the movie. There is a inordinate lapse between the boy's accident and his rehabilitation. There is the use of a flashback regarding the accidental death of a worker that seemed to serve no purpose. As a character study, Mr. Plainview isn't of course plain at all and unfortunately the audience is left with many unanswered questions and for all the focus and great acting by Daniel Day-Lewis, Mr. Plainview's character still remains a mysterious, so much so that the audience is left wondering whether to pity him or hate him. Mr. Plainview's outbursts as with what happens to Eli Sunday through out the movie, seems to have a possible source, but again such outbursts appear sometimes more apt to come from a crazed individual. His Daniel Day-Lewis's character actually crazed. For all these problems, the movie is compelling and captivating for its various themes and emotional performances. The man of God versus the businessman (a businessman who seems to be a serious version of The Music Man (1962) about a con man as a traveling salesman. We never understand what makes Mr. Plainview tick, but his behavior on screen is so gripping and intense that we can forget the reasons and experience the tragedy itself. A likely candidate for best actor and best supporting actor nominations are in order. An even though, There Will Be Blood deserves a Best Picture nomination, its imperfections should deny it the Best Picture Award, at least technically speaking.

Burlesque," A Great Use of Musical Production and Movie Development
","26 November 2010. There are some amazing musical productions in this small, compact movie that captures some of the dazzle of best Oscar Picture CHICAGO (2002), particularly one of the earlier numbers using a similar flashy Richard Gere court revue. This is a more soft touch THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA (2006) as Christina Aquilera appears to get to escape the wrath of a devil and contend more with a softer version of Meryl Streep. The music itself doesn't quite have the poignancy and magic of MOULIN ROUGE (2001), the universal mass popularity of MAMMA MIA! (2008), and the haunting, ethereal sounds from THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA. This overly predictable musical, however extends itself in some great editing interspersing musical production numbers with movie scenes moving the storyline along and spends time on character plot development in a more convoluted path. The biggest weakness and one that makes its distractive presence noticeable is a technical one - the lip sinking. Even the first musical number is so disconnected between the acting and the singing that continues throughout much of the movie undercuts one of the crucial points of how BURLESQUE becomes more popular. There is also a weak scene in acting between Cher and Chirstina when the owner offers advice to her up and coming employee. The ending doesn't quite have the nice edgy feel of THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA and has a much more mass audience feels go ending and excludes that movies the dramatic collision with good and narcissism.

Man on Fire," Decent Fusion of Action and Drama
","2 May 2004. It's not easy to blend the movie genres of action and drama into a composite whole successfully along with bits of independent film editing and photographic techniques. Tony Scott has presented the audience with a toned-down action film with a heightened sense of drama between Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning (from SciFi Channel's 'Taken') and included 'Proof of Life,' and 'Traffic' concepts to make a rather marketable product with a new look. While the ending is a bit Americanized and there are some rather ludicrous plot devices involved with Denzel Washington's skill and almost superhuman stamina (compare Sylvester Stallone in 'The Specialist') the overall movie is a solid presentation with a much stronger emotional content, meaningful dialogue.

Edge of Tomorrow," Ground Hog Day Sci Military Action Thriller
","10 March 2017. To describe this movie as a military action thriller as a version of the Ground Hog Day comedy is to underestimate the number of days this movie involves. In a way, it's also a coming of age movie, especially for Tom Cruise's character who must really suffer through the movie in a good movie way, almost to the point of humorous tedium. Mostly this is an action thriller as most military movie are along with the typical sci fi monster alien twist. After a slow build up, the pacing quickens and never let's go. The audience gets to observe the physical pain, the mental anguish of loss and sacrifice, even blind faith. Using the time twist, this movie takes its action in an exciting, different way even though it doesn't really break through as a totally different, brilliant creative innovation, it nevertheless brings forth the great use of existing movie formulas in an exciting, entertaining way.",8,0,0,11 January 2019
The Last King of Scotland," A Fascinating Deconstruction of a Man
","4 February 2007. Oddly enough, The Last King of Scotland is more about a young doctor's growing up than it is about Ugandan President Ida Amin. This intimate, fascinating, though somewhat frustrating portrayal of a young doctor who gets caught up in the fascinating, sometimes humorous, sometimes sinister and cruel backdrop performed to perfection by Forest Whitaker as Amin. Gillian Anderson is almost unrecognizable in her supporting role. Overall, this movie is a great observation of a young, naive, and impulsive man in a strange and sometimes dangerous country that is merciless in its traditions and customs. An intriguing editing job of the isolation of the powerful from the masses amid the ominous echos of conscience. Perhaps, even more focused and more ambiguous performance of these characters may have perhaps offered up a classic movie. Nine of out Ten Stars.",9,1,2,22 January 2019

Besides an over the top ending, this movie has a straightforward storyline, double-crosses, and nice redemption scenes. The plot is consistently played out here and the good and guy guys seem to get their relative due.

August Rush," The Sounds of Love
","25 November 2007. MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS (1995) provided the music for a older man. AUGUST RUSH provides the music for a family, a prodigy son lost, an unknowing mother, and a father torn between his family and his love. The themes of music, of love and its loss, of family, of relationships, and betrayal are all on big screen display. Robin Williams plays against type, allowing his presence not to distract from the main story. A lot of the credit must surely go to Freddie Highmore and Keri Russell as well as the director Kirsten Sheridan for delivering a compelling, sweeping, musically sensitive movie. The timing, the pregnant pauses of silence are wonderfully discovered in this movie where the actor and the music are allowed to tell the story. There are no trite over-over excesses. The delivery is direct and sometimes harsh, sometimes wonderfully lyrical. While there is some confusion and clutter towards the end of the movie, overall this movie hits the right notes, a fantasyland of real possibilities, the ideals of motherhood, the ideals of romanticizing the potential of music, of connectivity, of fate, luck, but sheer belief in one's self. Eight out of Ten Stars.12/7/2017: Freddie Highmore stars in this family drama involving Freddie playing a young boy living in an orphanage who is in love with music and search for his parents who by unfortunate events get separated even before he is born. And it is hopefully through mystery and magic of music that love will somehow find its way among all three of these characters. This amazing and in some ways wishful, fanciful, but entirely romantic and artful movie brings together in one chord various themes from Charles Dicken's Oliver Twist, the music drama of Mr. Holland's Opus (1995), and later the more recent and youthful drama of Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (2011). Robin Williams having attained an established stardom and likely ability of selecting his own roles, boldly offers up a devilish and not so nice character reminiscent of Dicken's Fagin's persona. For those romantics and idealists, this movie is a specular representation of the power of music, imagination, perseverance, and love above all. This is an immensely moving film for those that allow music and family to be those elements that bind humanity together in happiness.",8,0,0,21 January 2019

"Hail, Caesar!"," Stands Out For Its Detailed Period Setting and Almost Too Many Moving Parts Made Whole
","Definitely an Ethan Coen and Joel Coen production, who both directed and wrote the movie. This sparkling period-in-detail movie captures the retro-film pizzazz of the song and dance era as the backdrop to this mild in tone but sharply choreographed thriller comedy drama. The movie introduces a disparate number of song and dance routines that richly envelopes those film scenes along with the stage setting and handlers in which they were shot. At the same time, the narrator proceeds to move the main storyline of the insidious Cold War behind the scenes along with a setting up but never coming directly into blacklisting of movie industry employees. Yet all this is achieved with a serious but light-handed approach, never smartly becoming a parody, one of the most difficult of balancing acts in directing. Josh Brolin's character as a movie mogul in a well-acted performance almost breaks the flowing, entertaining tone of the movie at one point and having to literally repent at another point. There are almost too many moving parts to compress into one movie and perhaps some of the individual storylines and characters get short-shrifted or short-changed for the emotional and substantive depth they individually deserved unlike Pulp Fiction (1994) or Sin City (2005). Nevertheless, the Coen Brothers apparently pulled off a delightful and rather unique theatrical experience that allows this movie to stand out among many.",8,1,1,17 April 2020
American Gangster," Solid But Not Great
","5 November 2007. Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe along with this time Denzel Washington put together a story that has a beginning, middle, and ending. This movie is no Godfather, and interestingly enough there are some casting decisions to include some aging actors recognizable from other crime thrillers that in my mind detracts from the hard-hitting, serious side of this story. The personal relationship between Washington and his bride is underdeveloped, in fact, their meeting is something of a mystery. Even Washington's character and his father is also underdeveloped which later plays a rather important part later in the movie. The Ridley Scott had both Russell and Denzel play more complicated characters each with both good and bad elements. The movie, however, seemed to overreach and incorporate some much by having to sacrifice some detail. Russell's character chasing after the bad guy in a drugbust seemed unnecessarily showy, more for the action crowd than for cinematic clarity. Denzel's confrontation with another dealer who wants him to pay 20% isn't particularly resolved. Overall,there are good performances, a complex plot that is handled well.

This intellectually delightful comedy has the innovative mark of qualitatively different for 2006 - much as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) or Being John Malkovich (2000). With a dry sense of humor, this lofty comedy begins with a Douglas Adam's 'Hitchhiker Guide to the Galaxy like voice over. This less fantasy like Neverending Story for adults provides a nice more level headed, more nuanced performance from Will Ferrell in one of his best roles yet.

The Reader," Power and Intense, Riveting and Emotionally Sharp and Haunting
","5 February 2009. Easily one of the best movies of the year, 'The Reader' brings new life and spirit to 'The Summer of 42' (1971) and brings a heavy substantive heavy weight to 'A Love Story' (1970). Kate Winslet is magnificent in a performance that defies reality and drama, portraying a complex character that radiates with both loathing and compassion. Except for two and maybe three irritating wrinkles, 'The Reader' is on perfect display using effective flashbacks and editing to bring the life of two people interweaving back and forth in drama that plumbs of the depth of legal philosophy, first love and romantic love, of war and moral responsibility, of being proud, and taking risks, suffering consequences, redemption, and regret.'The Reader' in an early scene raises a bit of a confusion as to the tram compartments and taking of tickets when first we meet Michael Berg as a boy and Hanna Schmitz apparently doesn't interact with him even though she punches tickets. However, to more confounding points that are never clearly articulated consist of Mr. Berg's decision on whether to help Hanna or not at her trial and Hanna's own decision not to reveal her disability - such omissions provoke incredulity and require some assumptions and beliefs that may or may not be realistic, dragging movie, however, slowly and briefly.Nevertheless, this epic period piece that covers almost an entire lifetime, brings to light the idea of storytelling, oral tradition, suggesting ideas to the meaning of life.

Too many mayors who ignore warnings because of economics, too many mysterious deaths, too many gruff, war-weary veterans and too many sharp, whiz kids, and too many normal everyman has seemed to have made one immune to the scares and thrills, the upsets, and the boiling over stupidity of various what have become stock characters now. JAWS brought to the big screen the fear of the ordinary, the graphic depiction of both hidden horror and the in your face horror ending sequences, from the authentic crowd panic and trampling of people that would be later seen in THE WAR OF THE WORLDS (2005) remake.

The Wrestler," Visually Stunning and Authentic Human Story
","7 February 2009. What is acting and performing? 'The Wrestler' raises some interesting questions as to what constitutes a best actor award and how one differentiates a good actor from a great actor. With Mickey Rourkes' performance it's difficult to tell. Is Mr. Rourke so good in this movie because he is just being himself? Or is it that he is able to bring something extra to the role? Is it the script? Directing? Or does it even matter? Nevertheless, Mr. Rourke's presentation on the big screen feels genuine, authentic, real. There is depth to his character from funny, to subdued, to frustrated, along with a wide ranging diversity of moods and emotions coming off the screen.What is a good movie, is it realism, is it dramatics, is it catharsis, is it cinematography? Director Darren Aronofsky uses a real hand held camera style and visually raw video style similar to Cloverfield (2008) without all the flashing lights and fancy out of your way to promote how real it all feels. What is good drama? Is it over dramatization, high-lighting? Where is the distinction between reality, a documentary, and a fictional story. In 'The Wrestler' the boundaries between a documentary and a fictional drama become blurred because the cinematography captures an almost you are there experience and what feels real, like shooting just what is naturally occurring and what might come from the imagination of someone's mind and this script sometimes obliterates this distinction by its immersion into a depth of a truly provocative, almost voyeuristic look into these people's lives.The weak portions of this movie come from the superficial handling of the relational depth of the characters. Marisa Tomei's relationship with Mr. Rourke sometimes doesn't seem fleshed out to withstand scrutiny. The emotional connection, underpinning seems only surface deep. Evan Rachel Wood's character is also limited and there are some assumptions and omitted background details that not being in the movie make for her behavior somewhat suspicious and manipulative for the sake of the script and drama. Finally the ending allows the director to leave too much of the burden on the audience without committing himself, preventing the audience from experiencing a truly emotional stingingly powerful conclusion.Overall, this movie is a solid, penetrating look at a person whose life raises questions about our own. It promotes and challenges the audience to question themselves. But its outlook seems fatalistic and perhaps that is appropriate, but it would have been something truly inspirationl if Marisa Tomei's character (with further development in the movie) and her relationship with Mr. Rourke's Randy had been solidified to the point where she could have become much more of a presence at the end and perhaps even influenced more significantly the outcome of the movie.

Dark Shadows," A Difficult But Successful Mix of Comedy, Drama, Thriller, Horror
","13 May 2012. It's never easy and usually impossible to direct a good fusion of comedy, drama, horror, but Tim Burton successfully handles the task with this edgy but delightful black comedy that keeps the integrity of the vampire myth while acknowledging the current cultural influence of contemporary novels and television series' role of horror characters in society. There are elements from Practical Magic (1998) and Death Becomes Her (1992) along with same uneasy mix of oil and water as the comedy is interspersed with darker, suggestive bloody horror, and even Mr. and Mrs. Smith (2005) in their physical interplay together. In a way, Tim Burton has been able to transform these darker elements placing them into the light of day, transform the more acceptable animated horror that is soften by its more unreal forms of cartoon images such as Coraline (2009) into a idealistic live action romance drama, that heightens the good and evil elements that underlie our own realities in everyday living.Tim Burton has deliciously and perhaps deliberately created a set design and directorial, script presentation that slightly hyper-exaggerates the original Dark Shadows television melodrama (1966-71) and pays tribute to its more low-budget elements all the while keeping the quality of a full feature film experience. There were some consistently funny out of time ironic scenes, there were some emotionally penetrating scenes, and there was pushing the limits of edgy horror, yet with all the entertainment power at Mr. Burton's disposal.The everyday ethical dilemma of sexual relationships are on brilliant display in this morning, love spurned, love lost, love found and even the major characters are never stereotyped and have sufficient depth to elevate this movie into a more multi-dimensional experience those those willing to accept the penetrating look at our own foibles. The core theme of eternal love and eternal hatred are strongly integrated into this movie making it a solid foundation on which Burton is able to extend Johnny Depp's reach creating an inspiring and haunting, love story around one of the most famous mythical character's of our times and in a major way is more true to the power of love as powerfully shown in Dracula (1992) at the beginning of the movie but unlike Dracula (1992) which transforms this love into something corrupted by the end of the movie (a masculine form of jealousy), Dark Shadows (2012) stays true to the more resonate message of the vampire myth (a feminine form of idealistic romance).In many ways, this movie represents the continuing advancement of the craft of film-making and follows in the recent footsteps of other benchmark films such as the comedy-drama All Above Steve (2009), darker animated fantasy of Coraline (2009), screwball comedy of Ghost Town (2008), the underplayed but more subtle humor of Get Smart (2008), and more adult contemporary child adventure of Super 8(2011) and another darker comedy with Adam Sandler in Funny People(2009).",9,1,1,17 January 2019
Hancock," A New Brand of Superhero
","8 July 2008. This daring attempt at a new perspective of superhero directed by Peter Berg results in a dramatic, fantasy, comedy that has mixed results. With good performances by Wil Smith and Charlize Theron, they find themselves in a different, harder edged superhero movie that reveals the human character of being superhuman but at the same time reflecting the a closer connection to the audience than may be comfortable. We get to see alcoholism, anger and its attempted management, we get to see human sacrifice. The first half of the movie reveals a more raw aspect of the frailty of the human spirit regardless of one's power. The second half of the movie reveals the nature of a curse similar to Ladyhawke (1985). Unfortunately, the risk of extending beyond the traditional tried and true superhero scenario sometimes requires experiments and different approaches that require the audience to move along and accept such changes. Sometimes the experience is bumpy, like a new developing film media form getting used to its feet. The result is jarring, jagged, almost forced to make logical sense, but never fatally nor offensively repelling. There are good connections, good interplays between Wil Smith and Charlize Theron.

Kong: Skull Island," A Flashy Reimagined Kong With Flaw
","21 March 2017. With shades of the classic war movies Good Morning Vietnam (1987) and Apocalypse Now (1979) and perhaps even the monster epic Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959) and perhaps Jurassic Park 1993), this reimagined Kong movie begins with both a measured surprise and a quite different Kong movie that shows a lot of promise. Nevertheless, the script eventually falls flat in places as the plot points become more important than the realistic strategic or authentic flow from scene to scene. A huge example of the manipulation of a screen stretched to the breaking point in order to maintain the director's or producer's intended rational for a scene later in the movie is the first gigantic encounter between man and beast and it's pretty much an overkill and unbelievable disaster for man. And at almost regular intervals thereafter there are humans that seem to fall prey in order to show off some special effect cuteness that really doesn't do much for the movie and with little rationale except attempt to justify the cost of the movie. This sort of demise is repeated over and over again just in order to perhaps reduce the number of characters to manageable proportions and extend the time of the movie. A lot of editing and cutting would probably have made the pacing of this adventure action movie much more palpable. Nevertheless, the plot outline of this Kong version is very distinctive and admirable in concept and there are some great individual scenes and photographic images that boggle the mind. The ending credits film images also is a plus along with the outstanding presence of John C. Reilly almost carries the show.",7,1,2,11 January 2019
Hitch," One of the Best Romantic Comedies in Years
","20 February 2005. Warning: Spoilers. Hitch is one of the funniest movies since There's Something About Mary (1998). While I wasn't eager to see this Wil Smith movie, fifteen minutes into the movie I was convinced otherwise. This Mel Gibson's 'What Women Want' 2000 and the more recent Jude Law's Alfie (2004) combo-like movie, Hitch presents a more comic narrative than the more darker Jude Law's Alfie, with the more family, date-crowd atmospherics of Mel Gibson's 'What Women Want.' The slap stick humor, the stereotypical dumpy looking guy getting the hots for the gorgeous girl and the more suave man falling for the less than model, stellar woman has elements both men and women will be able to appreciate. The laughs in the theater will loud and repeating throughout the movie. This is a great date movie with plenty of smiles and the requisite temporary dramatic roller coaster ending. Mostly predictable as most romantic comedies are required to be, this movie is no rehashing of old material, but a delightful, refreshing examination of what makes men and women different and the foibles of meeting people of the opposite sex.

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A Strong if Not Perfect Beginning
","28 May 2005. What goes around, comes around. Getting to the start of the Star Wars in the last movie (episode III) almost didn't make it. The first half of the movie was too cloying cute, with almost forced jokes, side humor that seemed out of place and not too original. The entire first half was uneventful, a typical shoot'em up movie with as predictability as any television episode. The cityscapes, however, were awesome and lent a sci-fi background that never overwhelmed the scenes. The second half of the movie redeems itself in most regards and becomes the dramatic space opera that it represents as good and evil bitterly fight almost to the death. Yet, the setting, the plot is so unbelievable for the classic that it is, the special effects and the fighting sometimes become more for sheer show and titillation that the opportunity to substantive drama, acting is almost overlooked. Yet this movie is a sober conclusion to the beginning of Star Wars and wraps around to a satisfying conclusion, if not spectacularly. Seven out of Ten Stars.",7,0,0,23 January 2019
Shooter," A Good Action-Thriller
","23 March 2007. Warning: Spoilers. I can't say I was impressed with the ending, but most of the movie was involving and interesting. This solid action thriller is held together by Mark Walberg and contains the classic 'Three Days of Condor' suspense and chase as well as the 'The Bourne Identity' sophistication to make an overall nice thriller. Of course Walberg's near escape from death has already been pointed out as being a bit suspicious but the aftermath is handled about as well as any movie I've seen. There is a good interweaving of two characters trying on different tracks to solve this mystery, though its final explanation isn't as nefarious as some movies, more like 'The Interpreter.' While not in the top flight class of thrillers like 'Bourne Supremacy,' this movie definitely adds to the quality of this genre. Seven out of Ten Stars.",7,0,0,21 January 2019
Inception," A Brilliant Fusion and Break Through in Dream Sci Fi Genre
","23 July 2010. 'Take Keanu Reeves in Johnny Mnemonic (1995), The Matrix (1999), and The Scanner Darkly (2006) with some dream elements of Constantine (2005), and Jennifer Lopez in The Cell (2000), and Dennis Quaid in Dreamscape (1984), Emilio Estevez in Freejack (1992) and take the emotional intensity of a timebomb and the ripping nature of a marital knife and the action thrills and musical cords of Matt Damon in The Bourne Identity (2002) and one might get some hint of this finely complex and taut sci fi action thriller. Inception (2010) is to dream sci fi fantasy as to what Brain Storm (1983) is to dream sci fi reality, Natalie Wood's last movie and her tragic death during the movie. What's real and what's not real, what's desired and regretting, themes of guilt and acceptance are all wrapped up in this dream within a dream that is taken to the power cubed. While there are a few logical incongruities and editing weaknesses, one of the most prolonged are they going to survive experiences in movie history on this roller coaster ride more than washes over any perceived problems with this movie. How many times did Director Christopher Nolan have to shoot the final scene would be one of the more intriguing questions of the movie. It's not so much that the visual effects are spectacular, but that they are used in a way that enhances the movie and visually are different enough to make an indelible impression. Ellen Page stands out as a distinctly difference character from her role in Juno (2007) and Marion Cotillard demonstrates where Oscar winning talents from La vie in rose (2007), especially her facial emotional expression at the beginning of the movie that stings with its power.

Lord of War," A Muddle or Fusion of Genre Movie
","29 January 2006. Depending on one's reaction, Lord of War is either a muddled attempt at addressing an important social issue using a barrage of different movie genres to create a politically safe movie or a fusion of delicately balanced movie approaches (genre) to create a sensitive look at arms dealing. It's difficult to classify this movie - a wry, dark comedy action thriller drama? What holds this movie together instead of falling apart among a multitude of movie genres that almost amount to an overload of movie approaches that almost don't deliver is Nicholas Cage and his voice over and his character that like Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector, is this dirtbag that you can for some mysterious reason still like.Throughout this movie there are glimpses of various movie genres that if had been specifically used by themselves could have made this movie a much more focused powerful comedy or drama or political drama or relational drama, an action, or political thriller, or crime drama, or an adventure movie any of which might have been even better than what was ultimately presented on screen.

","27 December 2009. Downey and Jude Law bring an uneasy but fascinating chemistry to this crime-solving duo along with some finely crafted musical background and some powerful and compelling action scenes. The haunting and mysterious supernatural events hang ominously through out this movie bringing even more suspense and tension. The only apparent weaknesses are some of the fighting scenes which unlike BOURNE IDENTITY seem to be distractive and confusing rather than compellingly inviting and some difficulty in understanding some of the dialogue, SHERLOCK HOLMES is nicely editing with good pacing and some attractive and densely layered set designs. Overall, this movie is nicely balanced with a solid script with good explanations where necessary, little or no lose ends (except for the sequel) and is weighted with good emotional weight making this movie much more intellectually and qualitatively satisfying.",8,1,1,20 January 2019
WALL·E," Breaks New Animation Ground in Its Script
","27 June 2008. We are seeing the birth of a new form of life brought to the screen of animation. It is sometimes quiet without much dialogue, there is plenty of periodic humorous physical comedy, there is a message, a 'big' one that is being broadcast to all of mankind here. While there are rough edges in this movie that is literally cluttered with the remains of humanity, this bold and creative adventure dazzles, makes us laugh and keeps young children's interest. There is something both childish (in this new beginning of animation) and innovative potential (there is more to come). There are fantastic physical, non-verbal communication movements in this nicely nuanced movie - there is eventually much heroism, and action-adventure surprisingly as this movie builds from its lonely, isolated beginnings. While it doesn't quite achieve the sustained underlying complexity, depth, and consistency of Spirited Away (2001) as a mature art form, the sustained action and emotional connection and powerful themes of The Incredibles (2004), WALL*E is amazing and definitely breaks a creative threshold on its own.

The Good Shepherd," An Intellectual and Somber Spy Movie
","6 January 2007. This underplayed movie is a strong spy drama that captures the ethical, relational, and mental dilemmas facing the dark secrets of espionage over decades. It is commendable that this all-star cast performed with serious and uncharacteristic underperformance that requires the best acting. The somber, slow pacing focused on the twists and turns, the uncertainties, and the pitfalls of the high stakes game. Great acting and solid plot configuration. With the exception of the lack of a completely satisfying character development and fulfilling character interaction within Matt Damon's character's family and the somewhat loose ends of the movie, The Good Shepard is among the best of the year. Eight out of Ten Stars.Updated review. Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie star in this dark dramatic portrayal of one man's transformation as an agent during the formative years of the Central Intelligence Agency up through to the invasion of Cuba in the Bay of Pigs. This is character-driven, cerebral movie is thought-provoking with its underlying reflective nature of the inhumanity of employment, particularly in the field of espionage. This movie also delves into the elitist society of the upper-crust of America, the obligations and conflicts and sacrifices of duty, of marriage, and even love. By the end of The Good Shepard, questions of what is 'good' and the metaphysical meaning of living one's life have been laid bare.Of the various subgenres, blockbuster action as such Casino Royale (2006) Mission: Impossible (1996) True Lies (1994) or comedy Red (2010) Get Smart (2008) Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997) Spy Kids (2001) Casino Royale (1967) Agent Cody Banks (2003) Spies Like Us (1985) Our Man Flint (1966) Undercover Blues (1993) or sophisticated action State of Play (2009) The Kingdom (2007) Ronin (1998) La Femme Nikita (1990) Billion Dollar Brain (1967) or The Three Days of Condor (1975), The Good Shepard falls into the dramatic category along the likes of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011) Topaz (1969) The Tailor of Panama (2001) Eye of the Needle (1981) The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1965) The Ipcress File (1965) The Fourth Protocol (1987) The Russia House (1990). The movie also presents a fascinating use of and difficult but well executed editing of the movie with a lot of flashbacks revealing two parallel time streams as they both chronological unfold showing Matt Damon's growth as a young child who experiences his father's mysterious revelation and a letter that he keeps for himself into an intelligence agent and the sequence of events surrounding the Bay of Pigs and its aftermath in the intelligence community. What makes this movie stand out is its extensive focus on the psychological profile and character development of a single individual, the impact of his job on his relationships that are solidly depicted as much so as in A Man and A Woman (French, 1966), American Beauty (2000) and family dynamic found in The Tree of Life (2011) and his morals as found in Breach (2007) or The Falcon and the Snowman (1985). The Good Shepard presents an even greater existential angst than the personality focused The Wrestler (2008) with an echo of Chinatown (1974) but with even more somber seriousness, though not as emotional shocking or wrenching as William H. Macy's descent in Edmond (2006 - released in 2005) and accompanying Christian Slater in He Was a Quiet Man (2007), or as surrealistic, or fantastic as Anthony Hopkin's Slip Stream (2007). Instead, Matt Damon's character might be more likened to the doctor in The King of Scotland (2006) or the unbalanced, tilted life of Robin William's character in One Hour Photo (2002) or the associated emotive ending of Angela Jolie's character in Changeling (2008) or surprisingly the closest resemblance coming in Gillian Anderson's dramatic and emotionally riveting performance in House of Mirth (2000). At the same time, there is an engaging and somewhat surprising extended investigative, analysis component that rivals or exceeds its more contemporary movies like Spy Game (2001). Matt Damon would get to unwind later in the rather wry comedic intelligence movie The Informant! (2009) playing a employee having to contend with the FBI.",9,0,1,22 January 2019
Finding Dory," Great Animated Film Concering a Difficult Character Study
","30 June 2016. 'Find Dory' stands out because of the of difficulty of developing a script that focuses primarily on a character who has short-term and long term memory loss. In some ways, like the challenging script of '50 First Dates' (2004) where Drew Barrymore plays Lucy Whitmore, a human who also suffers from memory loss, in a live action comedy, the ability to maintain interest and a delicate balance of respect for such characters is definitely not easy to accomplish. Nevertheless in both instances, both comedies accomplish a continuing series of fumbles and ironic come backs that offer both humor and sympathy for their female characters. 'Finding Dory' offers up some great comic lines, a fast and involving pace with captivating and emotive interest. More involving with its extensive character portrayal more so than the classic 'The Incredibles' (2004) as a close collection of family members, the audience gets to experience a more personal, intimate voyage much like those found in the animated dog move 'Bolt' (2008), the lonely sci fi robotic waste collector 'Wall*e (2008), even the live musical drama 'Moulin Rouge' (2001), the lonely adventure of a woman in 'Wild' (2014) or the personal blacker demons of 'Black Swan' (2010).Except for a rather abrupt and not fully developed scene regarding Dory's parents later in the movie which doesn't come across as smoothly, this animated film stands out for its compelling interesting pacing and engaging comedy revolving around a rather peculiar but very likable lead character.",9,1,2,12 January 2019
Arrival," A More Leisurely Scary Communication with Aliens
","11 November 2016. Amy Adams stars in this psychological, space-time mystery. While not as compelling or engrossing as Interstellar (2014), Arrival has the same thrill of the new, unusual, and the unknown. Perhaps on the same level as the more claustrophobic Barry Levinson's Sphere (1998), Arrival brings with it a more personal, intimate backstory similar to what Manhunter (1986) accomplished with its parent-child interaction crime-thriller starring William Petersen of CSI. What makes this movie special is its expansion on the alien theme and how we communicate. There is the visual from Wavelength (1983), a sci-fi movie about alien beings and a couple's attempt to help them escape from a secret government station. There is the variation on a communication angle somewhat related to Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). Whether or not the recent election of Donald Trump as President of the United States might fundamentally alter the impact of the likely storyline of this movie in terms of this country's response to such an alien situation is hard to figure. Unlike the singular hardcore response found in Phantoms (1998), Arrival offers up a more convoluted response. Arrival presents experiences similar to the sci fi classic The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Epoch (2001) of which Arrival has many similarities. In some ways, Arrival has the same tone and unworldly presentation as the remake version with George Clooney in Solaris (2002) but with an even a more soft touch. In a fashion, Arrival is the reverse of Stanley Kubrick's classic 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) that instead of the aliens having come and gone and humanity going to them, in Arrival the Aliens appear and remained.",9,0,0,12 January 2019

","6 July 2004. In order to appreciate this movie fully, one must put aside the usual American romance expectations and just enjoy the movie, the acting, the fine nuance of humor and the ordinary life experiences that occur in a major airport terminal. This rather eccentric slice of life view of a man trapped by circumstance offers Tom Hanks one of his finest expanding roles to date and Catherine Zeta-Jones with a delightful character that we can identify with as well as the bittersweet message of the movie. The humanity capture in this microcosm of an airport and the promise to one's father further presents a optimistic view of man.

Parasite," Unlikeable Characters is a Mostly Well-Crafted Movie
","This supposedly best film of 2019 South Korean venture into mystery, comedic thrills is for some hard to digest with not so likeable characters. There are grifters and then there are likeable grifters like Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (1988), The Grifters (1990), and Heartbreakers (2001). This movie in a fascinating way has similarities to a 'evil' version of The Pink Panther (1963) or a more frightening chilly version of The Ice Storm (1997). Over time, the movie does seem to increase in its compelling mystery including a number of well-done tense scenes and twists. It's problematic though that such talented grifters would be living in such a disheveled, shoddy accommodations almost as if the director scripted it that way for dramatic effect and the father's outrageous behavior at the end seems a little overall the top without real sense of consistency with the storyline, except again to adhere to some dramatic script design to impress critics or audience members. Admittedly this movie succeeds in its intensity and captivating ambiance while building a sense of off-balanced comedy psychological drama.

Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," A Smoothly Divine Shot
","2 January 2015. Michael Keaton plays Riggan, a former superhero on the big screen who made millions and still recognized by aging fans, seeking a comeback with his production of a Broadway play. With an innovative experimental use of a seemingly continuous camera shoot, Birdman offers a first person viewpoint of the behind the scene lives of selected leading characters during several preview productions leading towards the plays premiere. Birdman incorporates at a less surrealistic intensity and plot characterization echoes of Terry Gilliam's Brazil (1985) as well as suggestive comparisons to Ben Stiller's Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013) and allusions to Kevin Spacey's K-Pax (2001), Robin William's The Fisher King (1991) and Pierce Brosnan's dark assassin comedy The Matador (2005). While it's impossible to determine the extent of Birdman's appeal being derived from this fresh use of the wandering camera or the fantastical imagery, only time will tell. Like the surprisingly stark set design of Dogville (2003) or Jim Carey's schizophrenic experiences in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), Birdman brings its own unique style to film. The ultimate initial outcome however, is a breathtaking, immersion into a world of petty human flaws, almost humorous foibles of human nature, and of raw sensual, intimately personal experiences.Birdman comes off like a serious version of the purely physical comedy of Noises Off (1992) starring Michael Caine and Carol Burnett. Birdman approaches its subject matter in a playfully untraditional manner that avoids the more traditional docu-dramatic or documentary presentations of Mickey Rouke's Best Actor Oscar nomination in The Wrestler (2008) or Neve Campbell's ballerina performance in The Company (2003), Kate Hudson's Best Supporting Oscar in Almost Famous (2000), or Natalie Portman's Oscar winning psychological thriller as a dancer in Black Swan (2010) but still retaining and projecting a sharp vividness of experience, projecting the viewer and immersing them into the film itself.In brief, Michael Keeton offers the audience a more appealing and oddly enough a more strangely real Lester Burnham character played by Oscar-winning Kevin Spacy in American Beauty (1999) by offering an even broader and more interwoven context of the human experience.",10,1,2,15 January 2019
Prometheus," A Beautiful Clutter
","10 June 2012. Like Avatar (2009), Prometheus has the dazzling set design that brings an entire new universe onto the audience's doorstep, taking both technology and breathtaking landscapes into a visionary and compelling experience. Nevertheless, Prometheus the movie, like the God, reflects an overreaching one's own God-like stature with the tragedy that the script was overly ambitious and resulted in the unintended consequence of diminishing and powerful impact of the visual wonderment of the movie itself. The unnecessary opening two sequences, unlike Stargate (1994) didn't really contribute or add to the movie and would have been better served with a flashback. The script was overloaded with too many subplots and confusing conspiracies that detracted from the movie and in some instances appeared just so much manipulative dialogue to show off the amazing visual effects. Unlike the powerful resonance of the authenticity and simplicity of the original Alien (1979) or the adventure thriller of the militaristic sequel, Aliens (1986), Prometheus looses both the scientific fascination of discovery such as found in Sphere (1998) and The Triangle (2005) or the scientific investigatory challenge in The Andromeda Strain (1971) or the action adventure of The Matrix (1999) or its sequels or The Thing (1982).The over-use of similarities to Alien (1979) and the on-ship politics were too overboard, melodramatic and irrelevant. The script had too many illogical holes in it with space travel protocol being overlooked too convenient for the sake of the typical dramatic effect...research wasn't carefully carried out, constant monitoring not adhered to, personal motivations only partially revealed.Instead Prometheus fails to live up to its promise in a similar fashion as Event Horizon (1997) that started out with a strong sci fi element and descended into a horror film. What Prometheus left out was a singular focus on a depth of credibility like Super 8 (2011) that capture a sci fi mystery but retained its more authentic human element as opposed to more two dimensional and sometimes unreadable characters. Even the low-budget Epoch (2001) had a focused element that allowed its audience to experience instead of think and puzzle over the contents of the movie. Prometheus also left out the opportunity of a more humanistic rendering, ultimately a love story as found in Solaris (2002) or the television series Defying Gravity (2009).In the end Prometheus comes across as a traditional, unmemorable story wrapped in a very, very pretty package and brushes up the some of the worst elements of movie making. If only Ridley Scott could have followed up with Forbidden Planet (1956) as his masterpiece to Alien (1979).",6,0,1,17 January 2019
Wonder Woman," Nice Gender Try But Something Is Still Missing
","3 June 2017. It's not easy to grasp the significance of a female director overseeing a female superhero movie based on a male written script. The use of culture clashing humor, the attempts at a female perspective of violence on an epic scale may not be sufficient to draw out the substantive and substantial gender distinction that one finds in the more intimate and relatable relational importance as one might find in Jennifer Garner's presentation, more human and vulnerable, but more emotive and compelling experience in the highly under-rated Elektra (2005). Operating on a smaller and personal scale using an even more powerful human/supernatural theme, its pacing and intimacy easily rivals Wonder Woman's blockbuster special effects bluster. Angelina Jolie's Lara Croft in Tomb Raider (2001) offers up a much more female perspective on violence oriented movies while even Uma Thurman's coming of new age in Kill Bill Vol. 2 (2004) captures the more demanding mental infusion of mind and body that is missing in Wonder Woman.While perhaps the male critics and the women audience members might enjoy the shift in superhero focus, overall, this movie doesn't quite break the bright line of the summer action testosterone action figure blockbuster theme and performance that many suggest it does. Even with the 3-D, the technical quality still hasn't achieved that reality-based visual impact that 3-D potential offers. Hugo (2011) and its 3-D from six years ago still holds up better. Maybe the likely Wonder Woman stand-alone sequel that this initial origin movie justifies will bring a more starkly dramatic and comic fantasy franchise with an emphasis on intimate emotive values such as seen on television like The Magicians (2015-2017) offers.",7,0,0,11 January 2019

","8 July 2007. 1408 sets a new standard for horror films since The Blair Witch Project (1999) and rivals The Shining (1980), The Omen (1976), and The Exorcist (1973) for its ability to bring something new and innovative to the horror genre. Strangely, its not some much the John Cusack gives an Oscar performance rather that the script and special effects work so well with his acting and on-screen time that the combination is a special, heightened horror experience that one has not witnessed in years. One of the best movie (any movie) of the year, this is a must see, standard textbook film for any serious student of the horror genre.",9,0,1,21 January 2019
Taken 2," An Adequate One-Time Seen Action Thriller
","A rather underwhelming action thriller with long extended fight and chase scenes that we've seen before. One fight scene in a courtyard is rather bewildering and seemingly just choreographed to show off pretentious fighting instead of what would really be expected of a rather quick dispatch of single hand to hand combatants by Liam Neeson's supposedly superb fighting skills. Then there's the daughter who somehow becomes a repeated target while Neeson's colleagues at home seem to be just underused bystanders. The triangulation scene of locating hideouts was different, but still not quite completely flawless. The ending had potential but seemed to lose its fascinating impact. This is one of those movies that offers up some possibilities but really began to become struggle to watch for a second time through. In sum, an adequate one-time movie with some thrills but not something to keep around.",6,2,2,20 December 2019
Saints and Soldiers," War At Its Most Real
","15 August 2004. The combat scenes were the most effective. This is a slower version of Saving Private Ryan without the big budget, battle scenes. This movie has its moments of personal charm, emotional connection to various characters though some of them tend to fall into the superficial categories required by many military films. Yet most of the soldiers here are someone we can relate to and the message of the film has a strong resonating component that many other war films fail to capture. The bullets and the military action is excellent. The movie isn't as dirty as some movies, yet it still carries its action and pacing decently if not rivetingly well. The focus is good and the ending is exciting as well as heart-rending. Seven out of Ten Stars.",7,1,1,25 January 2019
The Wolverine," Solid, Sizzling Superhero Movie
","30 July 2013. It's hard not to like the substance and stylish action in this action-thriller movie set primarily in Japan. There is plenty of emotive connections, even with the beginning scene which in itself has potent appeal even though the plot seems a bit manipulative as well as the climatic ending which in some ways in a humanitarian letdown for the sake of a clever ending twist. Nevertheless, the periodical surreal dream scenes add much to Wolverine's psychological character and the other male-female relational developments are well done. Some of the motivations of the characters are undeveloped, especially the double-cross and this character's demise seemed overly too simple. The action scenes for the most part are decent, though there's one which seems almost overly Japanese suffering dramatized with Wolverine slogging away down a street under fire. The Japanese layered cultural backdrop was well done on par with Lost in Translation (2003).Nevertheless, this movie unlike Elecktra (2005) with Jennifer Garner attached much more burn and flash action focus for its sizzle whereas Jennifer Garner had a script that was nicely balanced in the Asian ways of fighting and mental discipline as well as incorporating an even more empathic and emotive underpinnings for its storyline. Even The Green Lantern (2011) offered Ryan Reynolds a consistently more solid humanistic focus with its solid storyline or Spiderman 2 (2004) and Spiderman 3 (2007) that offered even stronger superhero relational and ethical dilemmas.",8,0,1,16 January 2019
The Dark Knight Rises," A Flawed Movie That Rises Above To Shine
","21 July 2012. The Dark Knight Rises joins There Will Be Blood (2007) as one of the extremely few flawed movies to rise above its slight annoyances to almost completely overshadow any lingering irritating oversights or logical flaws to become by the end a genuinely satisfying and qualitative, substantive action thriller movie, which only speaks to its strengths and integrity. As for the flaws that are sizeable in number, the stolen necklace that is so easily traced and for Catwoman to be so easily caught the second time; Batman's camouflage of his flying Bataeroflighter of flimsy army stock instead of invisible car used in Die Another Day (2002); just leaving Bane of the roof in which of course the whole movie would have ended perhaps; the overly too convenient angle of the road barriers allowing the criminals to just ride over them from their escape of the Stock Market; and even Batman's own escape using a similar ramp he created; the fusion bomb being so easily armed without a failsafe and the more likely decision in reality of doing using one, an almost unlikely mob scene of good and bad fighting sequences (unlike even what would be an even more authentic Civil War battle of hand to hand combat) and the absence of the better direction and choreography of the jumping in the hell hole scene. The martial arts scenes have been vastly improved for their clarity and visual impact since the first of the three movies in Batman Begins (2005). Nevertheless for all these apparently convenient script devices or oversights, The Dark Knight Rises is aptly named and the darker serious thread as well as the humanity both bad and good that arises sometimes in the same character is so riveting and dramatically authentic that it strikes at the universal themes of the lives of almost everyone watching the movie. The more controversial element of the movie is whether one can make a statement about the movie as being an indictment of our existing capitalist system in America or whether it can be a more subtle endorsement of the present system of structure and political law enforcement in our society. It is fascinating that there is some ways a resemblance to themes that can be found in the epic romantic drama Dr. Zhivago (1965) shot against the background of the Russian Revolution where the masses revolted against the rich elite. The Dark Night Rises is edited, even though a few scenes seem too short (except for considering the overall length of the movie) in a nicely timed way, the characters are both hated and loved, quality of the substance of the deeper dialogue of human, existential being is offered up and the energy and tension, keeps increasing and the audience angst and anguish at the pull of good versus evil and martyrdom of many characters both good and and in this movie continues to build until the end which has its own nicely wrapped, enfolded conclusion as if there was any doubt.",9,0,0,17 January 2019
Black Panther," A Step Towards A Culturally Sensitive Superhero
","This predominately African American superhero blockbuster attempts to break into the cultural diversity genre and offer up a more emotive, thoughtful collision between good and evil. In many ways it succeeds, yet it remains to be seen whether the depiction of African Americans are truly authentic and innately faithful to respecting cultural differences. There are suggestions that, like its stereotypical predecessors popularized for the Western audience, liberties may have been taken. There are several weaknesses in two of the early fight scenes that seem to be more for the screenwriter's convenience to move the storyline along rather to offer a more convincing display of intelligent preparations for combat. The male dominated action scenarios continue with some effort to provide some balance to the violence inherent in action-thrillers. What makes this superhero movie stand out a bit from the rest is its attempt at a humanistic theme that emerges in places but doesn't quite fulfill the potential of a truly classic movie of real depth. In some ways, this movie reflects the current political turmoil in America today as good and evil are on display in the morality of what a Country stands for. Black Panther results in a good effort that sustains interest and incorporates the requisite elements for a superhero movie and includes a bit more thoughtfulness.",8,2,6,4 May 2019
Iron Man," Intelligent Super-Hero Action
","4 May 2008. A step-above the normal superhero, in fact, this movie is more spoiled rich man with technology who discovers a conscience. This movie movie delivers a Robocop (1987) except bigger and larger but without the more poignant loss of Robocop's wife and family, delivers the Aliens (1986) scene of hi-tech individual warfare with the alien factor that actually provides a more intimate Civil War (1861-1864) angle, and Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) without the alien factor again. What Iron Man can't provide is due to its very nature - the everyman, common man perspective, a level that the mass audience can identify with as with the Spiderman franchise as well as the more personal relational boy-girl conflict. While Iron Man is truly intellectual with a conscience, that is what it remains whereas Spiderman focuses on the universal experience of all of us. Additional, unnecessary flashback sequence like with Batman Begins (2005) or even the more contemporary movie such as Made of Honor (2008) allows for the underdevelopment of the familial relationships important to the movie. So while Iron Man is worth its ticket, it allows some of the gloss to overlook the more important flash underneath. Seven out of Ten Stars.",7,0,0,21 January 2019
Bruce Almighty," Funny, Witty, Entertainment for the Summer
","27 May 2003. Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman along with Jennifer Aniston combine to make one of the funniest movies so far this 2003 season (late May) and a good improvement on Carrey's past crazy and personally forgetable roles in past comedies. With a slightly toned down Carrey antics yet with just the zap and crackle of his old self, Carrey powerfully carries this movie to the height of laughter and also some dramatic, tearfully somber moments. Elements of Jim's real acting abilities continue to show up in this movie. This delightful summer entertainment hits most of the buttons, including dramatic elements along with the goofy moments that fit perfectly with this script. While still lacking in the superbly polished ensemble of comedy/drama, Bruce, Almightly deserves credit for being a great date movie along with a solid message and soft spiritual cynicism and parody that maintains its good-natured taste.

The Greatest Showman," Entertaining, extravagant, glittering song and dance with a bit less emotion and drama
","Unlike Hugh Jackman's mostly live musical Oscar-nominated performance in Tom Hooper's Best Oscar Movie 'Les Miserable' (2012), The Great Showman is recorded and lipped sync'd which gives the movie's gorgeous, powerful songs, unfortunately, a sort of artificial quality reminiscent of the older, traditional grand musicals of the sixties My Fair Lady (1964), Mary Poppins (1964), and The Sound of Music (1965). There are even elements of a few scenes that have more in common with a lavish version of episodes from the television musical series Glee (2009-2015) and echoes of musical MTV videos. Nevertheless, The Greatest Showman is entertaining, extravagant with extended bursts of energetic, glittering explosive song and dance routines such as the Oscar-nominated song 'This is Me.' The themes of love, greed, betrayal, discrimination are both timely and well presented, though not quite as emotively and dramatically riveting as Les Miserable, Moulin Rouge (2001), or another Best Picture Oscar winner Chicago (2003).",8,1,1,28 January 2019
Casino Royale," Nice Concept But Flawed Script
","9 December 2006. While the edgy and serious performance by Daniel Craig offers a more stylistic touch to the Bond series, the script suffers from unbelievable blunders and less than satisfying encounters that James has with his opponents. From the very beginning the universal theme song is gone, replaced an unmemorable musical credit opening, without the exhilarating energetic packed opening. James finds himself too often the victim as his less than capable ability of losing his predators or hiding from them. His martial arts ability as a ruthless spy is less than brilliant considering this Bond's attempt at a more physical rather than high tech action thriller. This Bond is not a very personable character, not very engaging, and not a sympathetic individual - rather a more closed off, perhaps even selfish individual most people who rather avoid than succumb to. Overall, the change of tone is commendable, the attempt at more relational involvement, more human interaction and simpler, less than world-ending crusades is interesting, but not sufficient to overcome this movie's flaws. The ending without the usual, fantastic twist is the culminating let down of this newest version of James Bond. For martial arts and intelligent suspense, Matt Damon in the Bourne series is a clear winner. Even Jennifer Garner in Elektra or Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider have clearly spent more time and effort to present their physical abilities in a far more believable, superior way than Daniel Craig. Six out of Ten Stars.Second review. This movie version upon a more relaxed viewing, allows for a more accommodating and appreciative experience as Daniel Craig's Bond version seemed much more acceptable this time and the personal need for the spectacular flash at the beginning and end have significantly lessened over time. Daniel Craig's initial outing as a 00 agent in reflection seems much more realistic now, human, and even his obnoxious personality seemed more complex and developed over the space and time of the movie. There were little technical irritants(such as SPOILER ALERT) a crash bar door that doesn't open during the fight scene in a hotel stairway (so cliché)and the early chase scene on foot seemed almost too manipulative and physical impossible.I wasn't as caught up in the (BIG SPOILER ALERT) in Bond's girl's demise and found his attempting to perform CPR on her lame (her chest didn't rise) and Matt Damon's Bourne's loss of his girl was much more emotional haunting letting her go. Bond's loss was emotionally and morally much more convoluted and perhaps inconsistent.Nevertheless, this Bond movie had a nice soundtrack the movie theme that apparently grows on one after listening to it enough. The physical fights that Daniel Craig performs now appear much more real and gritty and gripping. Bond's intellectual play with Vesper was truly delightful now and the equality, and twists now appear to offer Bond a much more credible feel. Eight out of Ten Stars.(Third Review, 11/12/12). It's never happened before and may not again, but the more I watch this movie, the better it gets. My distaste on prior viewings may have more to do with what happens tragically towards the end of the movie than anything else and also why I've avoided repeated viewings of it. But pushing passed the distraught emotions, this Bond movie ranks as among, if not the best of the Bond movies for its extended glimpses into the persona and humanity of Craig's Bond version and the fine balance between action and substantive drama with a strong thread of gripping, increasing suspense throughout.

Toy Story 3," Getting Old But Still Remains Fresh
","1 October 2010. This third installment has much the same (the nice but not quite what it seems scenario), a bit different, a quite funny lines, an intense climatic movement sequence, and perhaps one more emotional twist, coming of age, and the passing on of time and generations. While the story seems a bit thin by this time, there is enough new and fresh that keeps the story moving. Compared to a story like UP (2009) though there seems this still franchise seems to have stayed the same and the balance of comedy and drama doesn't quite have the impact that it once had while movies such as CORALINE (2009), UP (2009), WALL*E (2008) seems to have a more fleshed sense of both underlying depth that captures both young and old. Nevertheless, the toy theme over time (three movies) is a fascinating one and is unique to this series, having made a substantial presence in the standard of movies.",8,0,0,18 January 2019
Signs," Doesn't Meet High Expectations
","4 August 2002. While 'Signs' is a good effort, it doesn't really get close to the high expectations built up by the proceeding publicity. Interestingly, 'Signs' begins almost like an independent movie, even a David Lynch movie, with strange expressions, silent moments, disconnected and disjointed scenes and dialogue - spooky - sort of, but slow. There are a number of clever movie techniques attempted, with Mel Gibson being seen with only half a face in the light, a number of great bumps in the night moments, yet the movie didn't seem to have a rational, reasonable experience true to life feel. Moving back and forth from present to past, the ultimate connections did not prove nearly as satisfying as 'The Sixth Sense.' Actually, the director as actor proved to be one of the better parts of the movie.The police are no where to be seen later in the movie. Mel Gibson's brother seems wasted because unlike 'The Others' with Nicole Kidman, we have a less spooky confrontation because now there are more people to support each other unlike Nicole and her two children. The humor was cute and helped the movie move along, but it seemed 'only' cute, not naturally a part of normal life that we, as the audience can identify with.The movie tried to be an individual family's confrontation with the unknown, but it was intruded upon by the outside, television world. The unknown forces didn't seem real either - unlike - 'The Blair Witch Project.' How come there was even television communication to begin with. There was too much attempted here, expectations were set too high. The focus was distracted by too many threads going on. The end result is a slow going, unreal, disconnected movie that can't overcome had moments of good movie making and experimental cinematic attempts. But be sure better things will come from this director no doubt.",5,0,0,27 January 2019
Signs," Audience Rating A Good 'Sign'
","6 August 2002. While I definitely can't agree with the wonderful rating many audience members are giving 'Signs,' I find that the younger audience is giving this movie a thumbs up in that this movie unlike some sci-fi, horror movies has very little violence, practically no sex. 'Signs' really is more of a mood piece, little overt physical slasher, and more subtle director motivated technique. The scenes in the crop fields are sweepingly creepy. A number of the surprises are excellent. While I wasn't impressed with the movie, it was scary for me and there were too many logical flaws in it, I believe that overall the audience rating for this type of movie is a great sign for what in means for the audience members.",5,0,0,27 January 2019
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Overly Intellectualized, Forced Drama
","6 February 2009. Vicky Christina Barcelona The title of the movie refers to the names of two young women, Vicky and Christina who visit Barcelona Spain and encounter an attractive, brash, seductive, and articulate Spanish man who raises doubts and well as insights in these women. Unfortunately the movie is severely hampered by a distracting, unnecessary voice over, opens earlier with a nice but repetitious musical rendition, and the overly incessant voice of Woody Allen who wrote and directed the movie. It is almost inescapable from experiencing the women artificially parroting Mr. Allen's unique way of thinking and talking which only adds to the awkwardness of the movie.The voice-over is so basically repetitious explaining most of the particulars of what is going on in the movie that it interferes with the acting and expressive ability to allow the performers from telling the story. The movie experience is like having to sit through to separate and parallel portrayal of the same events. The voice-over only serves to either implicitly send out the message that the audience is either too dumb to understand what's going on or the actors are so bad that they can't perform sufficient to relay the story by themselves. A good example is the severe but perhaps unjustified criticism of the voice-over narrative (relatively scarce actually) in Blade Runner (1982) which in that movie provided additional mental thoughts of Harrison Ford that added substance to the movie instead of just supplanted or stated the obvious as in this movie.And why the use of the flashback to reveal an additional relational subplot? To its credit, Vicky Christina Barcelona eventually evolves into a more in-depth and meaningful look at the consequences, complications of relationships often overlooked or skimmed over in other dramatic or romantic comedies. However, this relational 'situational' marriage theme was also explored with the release the same year (2008) of 'Revolutionary Road' with as much or more intensity or cinematic impact dealing with a 1950s period piece starring Leo DeCaprio and Kate Winslet who are provided with a script that allows them freedom to act the roles and lives they are portraying instead of Allen's intellectualizing musing of these deep relational uneasy themes.The last part of the movie is cinematically different from the rest of the movie, more hurried, more explanatory, more quickly edited - sort like pushing out a work in progress. By the end, this rather long slice of life piece ends up dissatisfying unable to quench the thirst of an experiential series of events, and neither do the characters in the movie.",6,2,2,20 January 2019
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Gorgeous But Clumsy
","29 October 2007. This rich, luxurious,and gorgeous epic level movie is burdened with a convoluted, clumsy script that seems as murky as the plots surrounding the Queen leaving the audience far much in the dark until the bright sun of clarity shines later in the movie. The characters, especially in the first half of the movie seems more caricatures and one-dimensional figures of good and evil that really do not do justice to this much more fully realized world of Elizabeth. Oddly enough it is the role of Mary Stuart played by Samantha Morton later in the movie that takes center stage in such a dignified manner that her performance almost outshines all others. Sir Walter Raleigh and Bess, Lady in Waiting relationship is an attempt at putting a human face on the Middle Ages, but still there is so much overlooked. Skimmed over is war scenes, the Queen's actual decision in the sentence of Mary Stuart. There are far too many plot points that seem to end up skipped, making the audience fill in the gaps, as if having to watch most of the movie, except there are gaps missing along with English dialogue that ironically enough might have been better handled with captions like the foreign languages used in the movie. Overall, Cate Blanchett's while not as stellar as Helen Mirren's performance in 2006 of another Queen, is competent and penetrated though perhaps too overwrought, to manipulative. The movie made strong points, ethical, moral, and otherwise, but it failed to seize the mighty throne of the genre. Seven out of Ten Stars.",7,0,0,21 January 2019
Identity," A Psycho-Thriller That Is A Must See
","4 May 2003. Warning: Spoilers. It's difficult to really describe this movie without given away any of its twists and turns. This movie is a must see psycho-thriller even though some of the psycho-jargon is clearly clinically incorrect. Some people will have a problem with the ending, though it's must viewing by any beginning therapist - it has an important, vitally important message. John Cusack provides his always reliable performance. While Ray Liotta, unfortunately continues his long progression of finding his character stereotypical roles (one of the only drawbacks in this movie).
This 'Twilight Zone' surreal experience is a feast for the eyes because it relies not so much on gore and explicit in your face splatter, but on a more subtle but hard edge visual treat of hints, suggestions, eerie music, tight shots that all make for a classic thriller of the 50s.

Saving Mr. Banks," A Deep Fusion of Genres
","23 January 2014. The biggest question about Saving Mr. Banks is even how to describe it. There doesn't seem to be any single word or even several words that captures this movie. It doesn't easily fit a movie genre or category. The fascinating weaving of past and present unfolds a movie that is a mystery, a comedy, a drama, a psychological thriller, a historical biographical, a period piece, that incorporates music numbers, relational themes, family, and even alcoholism.The movie offered a well edited, weaving of past and present that seamlessly enhanced the movie. This multi-layered, substantively faceted movie was rich with subtexts and deeper emotional and cognitive insight. In some ways, Saving Mr. Banks is unique in its rich delivery and depiction of the human condition, using historical facts, imagination, and popular myth to create an apparently serious magical experience.While no movie might be directly compared to Saving Mr. Banks, this movie retains or captures the tone or some of the qualities of such movies as Finding Neverland (2004), a Johnny Depp vehicle where fantasy and reality collide in a bittersweet love story about the man who wrote Pan Peter; The Weatherman (2005), a strong drama about a television weather man played by Nicolas who is going through the disruptive experience of divorce, his attempts a reconciliation, coping with challenging children, and a father played by Michael Caine who himself undergoes a life-altering experience; Moliere (2007), a French produced period comedy drama that provides laugh at in a layered movie about the comedy actor who must disguise himself at a rich man's estate and deal with a love interest at the same time; Punch-Drunk Love (2002), a new type of love story starring Adam Sandler and Emily Watson; and Hitchcock (2012),a movie that provokes visceral, intense human emotions of sorrow, fear, passion, and redemption packaged in a movie premised around a horror film.Emma Thompson's performance is of particular note for her portrayal of Mrs. Traver's who wrote Mary Poppins. Her character performance under the direction of John Lee Hancock was memorable for the delicate balance between the nastiness and unpersonable personality such depicts and the more appealing nature of the overall tone and theme of the movie. Meryl Streep accomplished as much in The Devil Wears Prada (2006).",9,1,2,16 January 2019
Beowulf," Approaches Great
","24 November 2007. Theatrical animation technology has finally reached the dilemma point of having to push ahead towards replacing live action film or retain its distinctive animated nature. Not since the ill-fated FINAL FANTASY: THE SPIRITS WITHIN (2001) has animation taken the realistic leap into recreating real life forms. Unfortunately, while the creative innovations are used here, they are used inconsistently, with glimpses of the great potential that animated technology can have in delivering an amazing cinematic experience. The qualitative inconsistency between the male and female characters where many of the male characters have rich, densely, layered human appearances, most of the delicate females seem artificial and incomplete for the most part. Even the Angelina Jolie's character, sometimes sumptuously rich, will in the same scene alternate between a realistic image of a creature to just a caricature. The plot outline also has a number of weaknesses, particularly how the Queen's character was not realistically portrayed either she had contemporary morality of faithfulness that didn't match that of the times or would accept later the sharing of her husband. The recovery of a special, cherished item was also mysterious. While there will fabulous animated scenes that clearly justified animation, there were also several scenes that just seemed awkward in the use of animation. The spawn creature was also not fully developed and its relationship to its maker wasn't fully captured on screen. This movie does deserve credit for being a morality tale that isn't what the American audience is used to. Unfortunately, the potential of animation was touched but not fully executed to its greatest effect. Seven out of Ten Stars.",7,0,0,21 January 2019

This movie comes close to the typical stereotypical characters but in some way the director underplayed such characters slightly...the convict, the tourist, the scared passenger all seem to be one-dimensional, yet were never flaunted for exploitation. This movie remains timeless, gripping, captivating in this tight script points and the special effect explosions spectacular yet aesthetically within real world boundaries. The balance of drama, insight, with dollops of humor are nicely blended together to make a rounded movie that can connect with the average viewer.

In one of the most outlandish superhero plot outlines with unbelieveable attacks on the White House, a super-secret prep school, and the easy capture of our superhero gang, X-2 falls victim to plot devices ask to much of the intelligent audience to make us believe this movie. While the movie going audience can suspend their disbelief some of the time, X-2 gives us an attack on the United States President as its beginning opening scene, but come on really must we have to accept how defenseless the President is, how superheros are so easily left defenseless? This sequel really isn't that original for most of its running time. The scriptwriter just really wants play with the audience's mind and screw up the frustration factor until it wants to burst without consider some of the logical elements of the movie.What really saves this movie is the ending...in one of the more powerful statements of societal responsibility, the climax of X-2 has many of the trappings of other movies, including Indiana Jones and Die Hard, but with a soul. The weaker attempts in X-2 at including the obligatory human dimension are laudable too.So besides yawning and squirming in the seat from pent-up frustration at how should have happened throughout most of the movie, X-2 barely makes it tolerable by the end.",7,1,1,25 January 2019
Lucy," A Nice, Action-Packed, Exciting, But Somewhat Empty Thriller
","7 February 2015. Lucy is science fiction based on the reflective speculation of what if a person could access 100% of their brain. Lucy refers to one of the earliest humanoids, who happened to be female, and also the name of the female star, played be Scarlett Johansson. She happens to befall a strange drug smuggling ring becoming the first person to begin to 'revolutionize,' a term introduced by Morgan Freeman's character. In the process, Luc Besson has developed an sci-fi action thriller evolving mind, space, and time. The pacing is energized and the mental evolutionary conception of Besson is consistently brought to the screen. This is a rare movie in that upon repeated viewings, the power and consistent developing emotive and mental presentation brought to the screen by Besson and Scarlett is impressive.Thus action scenes sometimes become overly dramatic and fake looking, for the sample the car chase scene, even the initial transformation of Lucy is a bit over the top. Overall it seems that Besson;s attempt developing this progressively leaping mental concept that is satisfactorily captured on film. The Outer Limits' Five Fingers episode (1963) accomplished the same speculative venture in its television spot while Christopher Nolan accomplished a much more creative and meaningful spectacularly looking backdrop in his Interstellar (2014). Overall, Lucy is entertaining speculation that's fun to watch, with decent intensity and thrilling action that's worth to experience. Scarlett Johansson underplayed performance really stood out. Nicely done.Other classic movies that Lucy follows in the footsteps of Brain Storm (1983), Charly (1968), The Time Machine (1960), Time After Time (1979), and of course 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), and its contemporary, The Machine (2013).",9,0,0,15 January 2019

","31 December 2015. In this reawakening of an old classic sci fi trilogy, a new generation is introduced to the original Star Wars (1977) phenomena and its moving onwards decades later. The audience is introduced to a new crop of rebels to a new younger generation of the Dark Force as well as the reemergence of original but older, aging Star War characters. The characters play out somewhat differently than the original with the charm of original Star War character interactions somewhat diminished in the newer plot outline. Harrison Ford continues with his charming humor, yet eventually its charm seems forced and a bit stereotypical, but even so his performance is charged with entertainment and delight. Carrie Fisher, now the reigning rebel monarch, presents a more mature yet captivating character whose presence continues to be welcome. The rest of the cast is mostly a rehash of the original Star Wars in similar guises but with a nice veneer of increasingly tantalizing special effects and 3-D imagery which however still has a ways to go to really push the potential of the visual envelope.This newer Star Wars version mostly depends of the theme that bigger is better, a literally bigger villain, bigger relic ships, retains the Western Space Opera concept and omits the original character development of the original series, especially Finn and the director's decision to have his character over-act dramatically to highlight his differences at the beginning of the movie. Superficial in many respects, The Force Awakens. There are echoes of the singular female dominance of Sigourney Weaver's Riply from Alien (1979) and large scale set designs of the alien space ship and the lonely trek of Wall*e (2008). Finally, it is hard not to overlook the mounting technological and illogical plot points that occur throughout the movie such as the over-reliance of singular fighter ships by The New Order to decimate villages and rebel positions, the artificial slow-mo lasers and energy blasters, and the ancient use of outdated metal ships and corridors something one might imagine from World War II submarines, the poor operation of sensors allowing characters and ships to apparently come out of nowhere, or the quite obvious rolling path of BB-8 droid which leaves one of the most trackable marks over the sandy landscape ever.Overall, The Force Awakens seems more like some memory or déjà vu, some vague but entertaining dream upon awakening in the real world. There are some fantastic vivid images, yet the dream doesn't quite seem to replicate the original awe and fun of the original or the epic nature of Dune (1984) directed by David Lynch or the more creative mind-bending sci fi of the new wave of movies such as Inception (2010), Another Earth (2011), Cloud Atlas (2012), The Congress (2013), The Host (2013), Oblivion (2013), Upside Down (2013), Gravity (2013), The Machine (2013), and Interstellar (2014).",7,1,13,13 January 2019
RED," Best Feel Good Movie of the Year
","15 October 2010. Sometimes it just feels great just to feel good and the movie Red eventually provides just that experience as this late summer comes to a close. There is seriousness, outlandishness, poignancy, drama, action thrills edited together in scenes that in themselves can see millions without words. This well written script has almost all of it and the difficult balance between comedy and drama is artfully and delicately put together without ripping apart the movie. With BOURNE-like precision along with the MR. AND MRS. SMITH (2005) lightness, Red brings together a multi-talented movie in a comedy-drama with an inner heart for a number of characters, even the antagonist assassin in the movie.Reminiscent of TROPIC THUNDER (2008) in its comedy-drama genre, yet with even more style, and more along the lines of Steve Carell's GET SMART (2008) yet with even more freedom to develop fresh characters that brings out the best of the all-star cast. Singular scenes and individual character performances are also echo some of the nice comedy, psychological action from THE MATADOR (2005). Perhaps the great apparent weakness or omission is the lack of great disguises used in the movie which would be assumed would be important and lacking the slick and subtle comedy drama character such as Jeff Goldblum in MR. FROST (1990). Even the comedy-family-drama of THE NANNY (2007) or FUNNY PEOPLE (2009) reflects the new delicate interplay of various movie genres that RED seems to have successfully captured.Both predictable and perhaps somewhat unpredictable, the balance between to two elements in this movie captures the best of both cinema worlds resulting in one of the most entertaining and psychologically satisfying movie of the year.",8,0,0,18 January 2019
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Lost the Charming Magic
","14 July 2011. When the special effects seem fake at times, when there is a scene later in the movie that appears to be a memory that is photographically superior to most of the rest of the movie in terms of sharp clarity, when the character development and evolution seems to have stalled, when characters die off screen losing the emotive intensity, when the high point of the movie, perhaps the one that really stands out comes towards the end of the movie where Harry Potter must face himself doesn't really flesh out completely and latter scenes seem to also give away the surprise, when the pieces and mystery seem patched together, it appears this last Harry Potter has grown up into adolescence when magic becomes only dreams and fairy tales, stuff that only young children believe in.

Unbroken," Being Something Through Competition and Survival
","3 January 2015. There is likely a balance to be struck between reality of a relatively famous person's life and the dramatization of it onto the big screen. Assuredly there might be even more amazing life stories out there and there might be even more captivating ways to selectively develop movie appeal. Yet as a director and executive producer, Angelina Jolie, has produced a film that appears to encompass a balance between real and interest in this movie. The audience is introduced to brief scenes of a young boy who doesn't believe in himself as an Italian in America outcast, to a big brother prodded athletic competitor, to a fearsome World War II experience over the skies of Japan, to lost at sea, and then prisoner of war.This movie fuses a sports and war theme into a biographical display of endurance and survival. Unbroken brings the intensity of competition as displayed by Francis Osmet's 1913 U.S. Golf Open in The Greatest Game Ever Played (2005), the physical and mental torture of Michael Caine in the espionage classic and BAFTA Best Film The Ipcress Files (1965), the struggle of survival of The Life of Pi (2012), Mel Gibson's Golden Globe Best Foreign Picture nominee Apocalypto (2006) or Steven Spielberg's Best Oscar picture Schindler's List (1993). The difficulty faced by Jolie was sustaining the momentum and power of the movie with the different pacing elements without an action-thriller-adventure theme. Instead Jolie faced the difficulty of a biographical sports, sustained survival theme like that faced by Tom Hanks' Golden Globe winner in Cast Away (2000). With what Jolie faced, Unbroken appears almost unscathed in its ability to bring forth this true life, heroic story.",8,1,2,15 January 2019

The eerie, haunting black corridors of Mount Doom and the pervasive evil as well as presence of heart-break female roles were missing. Such magic would have captured a the Excaliber quality essence of Middle Earth. The music, the dizzying reeling battle scenes, the cinematography were richly transferred to the screen.

Munich," Easily one of the best movies of 2005
","29 December 2005. This taut dramatic thriller personalizes and humanizes man's efforts to seek revenge and the difficult turmoil over the violence that overcomes us when it comes to religion and terrorism. Munich brings its audience into the personal lives of assassins who have been selected to seek revenge for the Munich Olympic murders of Israeli athletes. This mission is stark, violent, and tragic as well as human and personal as Spielberg offers a human face to all the characters both Israeli and Arab. This a powerful movie that offers its viewers a harsh, tragic look at a husband and a young fighter for his country who undergoes a personal struggle for meaning and devotion to his country and his family while trying to negotiate the often murky and dark world of intelligence and betrayal. This is a wonderful, compelling movie, one of the best of the year. Nine out of Ten Stars.",9,1,2,23 January 2019
The Matrix," Setting News Standards
","6 September 2010. There are few movies that establish a new set of boundaries or geometrical growth spurts in the development of movies and as such The Matrix is one of them. This otherwise standard, predictable sci fi movie, however, incorporates an out of the box premise along with a dazzling array of special effects, especially dealing with martial arts, along with a twist or double-cross that is layered within this compact, consistently, inconsistent sci fi action thriller that makes its mark in sci fi history and movies in general. The Matrix establishes itself among a list of movie standards such as: Jaws (1975), popular mainstream horror movie and was preceded by Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963), and more recently 1408 (2007).Ghost Busters (1984), a mainstream fantasy, comedy, horror movie.Speed (1994), mainstream action thriller, comedy drama.Wait Until Dark (1967), mainstream psychologal thriller.Dances with Wolves (1990), historical docu-drama.Spirited Away (2001), fantasy.Moulin Rouge (2001), musical.",8,1,1,18 January 2019
Shall We Dance," A Funny, Straight Romantic Comedy
","18 October 2004. This much funnier version of Shall We Dance, is a delicious, romantic comedy that doesn't require magical, unbelievable script devices to make this movie work. This movie is compelling for those who believe in second chances and first chances for those who have never taken chances. This movie comes at a good time in American life when our lifestyles are such that we may be coming to that age that for everything we have, we still are empty. I don't imagine that this movie will dazzle any male ego and will probably be restricted to females who can only wish their partners might somehow be so interested. A good date movie for the emotionally sensitive and artistically inclined. This new version based on the Japanese original explores the comic motif well, doesn't take a lot of liberties on the sexual romance angle that so often befalls American movies, and ends up with a definitely American tie off but with a much more realistic and hopefully plausible note than most gushy romance movies.

Looper," One of the Best Time Travel Thriller Dramas
","30 September 2012. Its hard not to find similarities between this movie and Bruce Willis' previous time travel cult classic, 12 Monkeys (1995) or even if one thinks of The Terminator (1984). There's really no fascinating character like Brad Pitt's Jeffery Goines as in 12 Monkey's, so that acting even though its solid isn't so much the focus as the direction by Rian Johnson who presents the audience with both a cerebral, action, family drama fusion genre. The director goes out of his way to use extended shots with scenes that seem to go on for minutes in order to impregnate them with emotional resonance. And the futuristic set design while perhaps a little heavy handed in the beginning and not too original at first, quickly transforms into its own future vision that nicely captures a vibrant yet understated backdrop to the rest of the movie. And then there is the not so quite brashness of a low self-esteemed looper hotshot who seems to had an obsession to prove himself, that isn't quit in sync with the rest of the movie and perhaps the most unnecessarily used and weakest character.What makes this time travel movie stand out is the intense emotional connections that both the older Joe (played by Bruce Willis) experiences in the future and the younger Joe (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) experiences in this movie and the difficult universal themes that each character must face. This is not a two-dimensional movie and the director seems to go to great lengths to establish a backstory and character with conflicting feelings (even the brash looper hotshot). There are emotional elements of The Butterfly Effect (2004) along with even the haunting emotional twist as in The Time Machine (1960) or The Final Countdown (1980) as well as a more graphic action elements than Time After Time (1979) or Time Cop (1994). In some ways, the ending has the same emotional impact as Idaho Transfer (1973) starring Peter Fonda.Overall, this movie is an elevated layered sci fi movie with a conscience that portrays universal themes that offer no real clear cut answers between personal dreams and personal sacrifice, something each of us must discover our own answers in our own way.",9,0,4,17 January 2019
Heat," A Seminal Crime Thriller for its Time
","4 February 2009. 'Heat' when it came out in 1995 had it all, the action, the in your face cold bloody killings, the twists, and most important of all the relational character subplots, including husband and wives, father and daughter, and first loves. What this movie had back then, however, has lost some of its elegance, its sharp delivery and insightful directed scenes. Now, 'Heat' seems to offer some overly dramatized scenes, characters, overly literary dialogue that is more for dramatic impact than reality-based conversation.Since 1995, we have improvements in a number of genres that may offer tribute to this movie's influence, though, 'Heat' takes a lot from 'The Godfather' (1972) in terms of the layered depth of familial and relational elements of crime thrillers. 'Shadowboxer' (2005) has strong criminal character performances. 'Bourne Identity' (2002) for sharp and intense action scenes. 'A History of Violence' (2005) for relational and graphic violence and sex. 'The Aire I Breathe' (2007) for hard core criminal evil and emotional life and death catharsis and twists. 'Matchstick Men' (2003) for the ultimate betrayal and haunting loss. 'American Beauty' (2000) for dysfunctional family relationships. 'Collateral' (2004) and 'The Matador' (2005) for a more fascinating badguys. 'Gone Baby Gone' (2007) for a more convoluted crime thriller.**SPOILER** Today, in hindsight, like a director's cut, what if De Niro actually got into the car? Based on the script, he would have likely gotten away. Why didn't the the airport landing lights blind Al Pacino like they did De Niro when he was shooting at De Niro?Unfortunately the subplots were underdeveloped. The relationship that De Niro has doesn't offer sufficient relational bonding, connection moments. Al Pacino's daughter isn't given sufficient screen time to develop her behavioral performance that led up to her climatic scene.Some of the amazing elements to this movie was Jon Voight's performance that was great acting in character. Amy Brenneman goes onto star in the television hit show 'Judging Amy' and then 'Private Practice.' Ashley Judd continues to perform and recently premiered in 'Helen' at the Sundance Film Festival (2009). Dennis Haysbert goes onto to become the President of the United States in the hit show '24' and then star in 'The Unit' both on television. Natalie Portman continues on from this her third movie to star in a number of major film features, including 'Star Wars: Episode Two.' Tom Noonan continued as a character actor to too many movies to mention (but my favorite was his performance in 'Manhunter' (1986). William Fichtner goes onto the television hit show 'Prison Break.' Even Xander Berkeley went onto play in '24' and probably one of the most prolific characters actors today. Even Jeremy Piven had a role as Dr. Bob went on to win television Emmys.'Heat' may be considered a benchmark crime thriller loaded with a number of memorable actors and actresses.",8,0,1,20 January 2019
Deadpool," Off Balanced Dark Superhero Comedy
","29 September 2016. I'm reminded of Wil Smith in Hancock (2008) which was more of a superhero crime drama than a superhero dark comedy action as Deadpool. Nevertheless, perhaps its the contemporary times of change and loosening of societal morals that the gutter talk of sex and swearing like young boys and late night comics within a superhero movie was inevitable. While the dark humor is creative and at times refreshing, it really seems more like a stand up comic night with a lot of R-rated one-liners. Even Deadpool noted the absence of a lot of superheroes in this movie. The fusion of comedy, action, and then a severe transitions to romantic drama, along with the constant cynicism much better presented in Hancock, made for a jarring experience with a movie without a consistent tone. Along with a lot of Kill Bill death-dealing and death-defying action, this movie seems more like a testosterone action entertainment thriller for boys rather than anything really seriously award winning. The one redeeming element of the movie was Ryan Reynold's delicate and remarkable performance.",7,0,0,12 January 2019

The grand themes, the raw violence, the intensity of love and hate, even humor, Cloud Atlas has the makings of a memorable movie the captures the essence of the visual/oral storytelling essence of film. Tom Hanks retains his The Ladykillers (2004), Cast Away (2000), The Terminal (2004) personas, but unfortunately for Hugh Grant, his usual typecast persona as Hugh Grant was left essential untouched in his most prominent role in the movie as the corporate heavy that broke the film magic of his scenes.

300," A Visual Delight But Stereotypical
","12 March 2007. 300 is a spectacular feast for the eyes and the visual animation is outstanding with a few exceptions. Unfortunately, the emphasis on 'Kill Bill Vol.' 1 gore and the 'Saving Private Ryan' blood fest while fascinatingly gross was probably unnecessary compared to 'Alexander' though based on a graphic novel, it's not difficult to notice why. Additionally, again the black and white stereotypes make this graphic novel just that, a perversion of good and bad, the dark Persians against the good Greeks. They are no reality checks in this fantasy version and the ending is also while martyrdom omits a more interesting possible ending version that would have been more uplifting. Think of one spear versus 300 spears. Anyway, the effort put into both the action and the plot line, character development was commendable though more character relational, slowed pacing would have put this movie on an epic scale instead of the summer blockbuster action scale. Enjoyable and visually stunning but not qualitatively spectacular. Seven out of Ten Stars.",7,0,2,21 January 2019
Kingsman: The Secret Service," A Truly Strange Black Comedy Action Movie?
","21 February 2015. It's uncertain whether or not Kingsman reflects the best of the evolving black comedy trend in movies or not and whether such a trend is a passing or permanent element of a classic movie. Whichever it is, Kingsman currently is a superior film with its finely honed balance of black, dark murderous content being portrayed alongside British, gentlemanly wit. This film is a Colin Firth's best actor Oscar high English version of the The King's Speech (2010) meets the comedic spy romp of James Coburn's Our Man Flint (1966) meets the hard edged, raw espionage of the refurbished, rebranded James Bond in the form of Daniel Craig in Casino Royale (2006). Dark comedy in the spy genre has been gaining more prominent film focus as they have evolved from the more entertaining comedy action motif of the popular and zany Wild, Wild West (1999) or the romantic interplay of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005) taking on the more darker and serious ambiance of the action crime thriller, The Dark Knight (2008) as Sam Rockwell in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002) and Pierce Brosnan in The Matador (2005) seemed to make be some of the first forays into this gumbo of movie genres that began with the classic Pulp Fiction (1994), Kingsman appears to take its basic thematic tone from the blackest of action comedy of Uma Thurman's Kill Bill 1 & 2 (2003, 2004) and incorporating a culturally off-balance brush stroke of the military black comedy war movie Tropic Thunder (2008). Recently a number of movies have taken murderous death and blended these atrocious acts with a finely balanced hue of comedic overtones such as Bill Nighy's Wild Target (2009), Violet & Daisy (2011), Brad Pitt in Killing Them Softly (2012), Kevin Costner in 3 Days to Kill (2014) and Katie Holme's very proper but fatalistic Miss Meadows (2014). Kingsman includes the added bonus of a strong performance as a villain in the form of a fascinatingly speech impeded Samuel L. Jackson. This dark comedic action thriller comes across as something, fresh, new, and bold while sustaining an especially emotional intensity throughout and grabbing the audience refusing to let them go until the end. Whether or not this whole creatively new comedic frenzied experience is a passing endorphin high or some established benchmark of greatest remains to be seen.",9,0,0,15 January 2019
Easy A," Good Actors AttemptingTo Overcome a Substandard Script
","1 March 2011. Reminiscent of the teen classic Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986) in attitude, character, and voice-over, this teen comedy adds creative credit design with a little of a cinematic side trips of 500 Days of Summer (2009). But in this version, the audience gets to see how a Ferris might have been created from the lie of an Emma Stone. The script, however, seems to desperately focus on getting its laughs from exaggerated opposites (school mascot) and other over the top attempts for laughs that seem to break from the more fascinating authentic fantasy (as if more makes for is better). In some ways, it would have been intriguing if this movie had tried for serious teen drama instead in capturing the teen audience instead of skirting around the issue using comedy and exaggerating humor, almost making light of a real bullying issue.By 12 minutes into the movie the one-liners are coming quick and fast, almost at an nauseating, unbelievable pace. Even the public school principal (Malcolm McDowell) is given dialogue most stuffily unreal and almost like a throwback to the 50s. The use of the word 't' later is also overdone and the word 'twit' doesn't seem to even be a problem. What is even more scary, though, is the possibility that the dialogue, at least for the student might actually resonant with the audience (presumably of roughly the same chronologically the same age) may truly think and speak constantly this way in high school (it's been that long) in which case this movie might be more in tune and better than I can give it credit for). Could it be? Hopefully not. An even more challenging and pertinent question is whether the movie industry creates the culture of teen dialogue or only reflects it. Is the dialogue and speech being depicted in this movie portraying what teens really get into or is it getting teens into the depicted, really 'bad' language and speech patterns? 'A boy in the room' parent scene continues the overly, exaggerated, and over the top, unreal dialogue that supposedly captures and identifies with the younger generation but that really diminishes the more serious and believable aspects of this movie focusing on some real teen issues, taking the easy way out of having to develop a script that is finely nuanced with both appealing humor and drama. Shortly afterwards, in one of the movie's strongest scenes that starts out pretty lame, but then Brandon's plea becomes a rather emotionally captivating speech that connects to the real human condition, even though the somewhat forced, script device of using lies continues to teeter on unbelievability.The fakeness of this movie is increased by the obviously impossible swimming pool scene in a house and teen partiers that could only be achieve in a larger, more urban/suburb upperclass venue of a movie, not the small town depicted in this movie. The bed room scene is also riddled with clichés and overtly ridiculous phases almost pandering to the audience, descending almost to raunchy humor. A more sophisticated sex scene that has nice undertones of humor occurs in THE COOLER with William C. Macy and Maria Bello having a loud romp.Towards the middle of the movie, the more serious elements of the teen condition come into better clarity, balancing the more ridiculous performances to date as our prima dona becomes more aware of others than herself. The accompanying scenes though really maintain, though with less frantic effort, the pace of tolerable humor while only briefly skirting the ridiculous. tapping into a contemporary John Hughe's wannabee.The counselor scene while perhaps intellectually revealing also is very suspect for its portrayal of guidance counselors especially just the immediately proceeding scene its very clear that the counselor was informed of that was really going on, just adding inconsistency the weaknesses of the script. Even when there's a great opportunity such as the post-counselor scene to really rise above the fluffy, pretentious pseudo-teen humor, the script-writer blows it and misses a truly bonding, relational, meaningful moment of opposite-contentious-bonding in a human way.Past the midway point, the real conflict and sexual lies that create real tension finally come out and make for a much more revealing, valuable, and worthwhile, meaningful movie experience. Then with our heroine's real date, there is a severe underdevelopment of her date's character to this point so that the inter-character dynamics of almost every other similar movie genre is missing.Unfortunately for the tone of this movie, the big dramatic moment is so disrupting to the overall movie's background mood that it's too radical a departure from unreal fantasy to harsh, dramatic movie drama. While the movie seems to settle down, the movie never really gets to go to the depth and intensity that the social issue that the movie raises because the movie never really takes its subject seriously enough but only uses it as a vehicle to appear sophisticated and 'cool.' What is remarkable about this movie is that it's not exactly obvious that the problem with this movie is the actors. It's remarkable perhaps is that this is a movie about a script that really doesn't do justice to the great actors in the movie, because despite the script, there is a sincere effort to make the best of it and sometimes it shows through.",6,0,0,18 January 2019
Click," Can't Get Away From Its Uncertain Genre
","15 October 2006. This movie can't decide whether it's a comedy or a drama or both. The commendable ambitions of Adam Sandler to continue to expand his acting roles can't escape the director's pull back into the dumb comedy that Sandler has been relegated to many times. The ending portion of the film is representative of how good the movie could have been only to be vacuumed back into the predictable stereotypical 'It's a Wonderful Life' fantasy. With a better writer and more careful direction, the premise of this movie along with Adam Sandler could have been one of the breakthrough movies of the year. Yet, unfortunately, while the creative spark and special effects are fun and entertaining, this movie was stuck in the summer fun category instead of Oscar award quality.

John Wick: Chapter 2," Alien or Aliens?
","13 February 2017. This movie has some comparisons to those people who loved the sequel to Ridley Scott's original 1979 sci fi classic Alien better than James Cameron's Aliens (1986). However in Ridley Scott's movie Alien, it won out by just a bit. Nevertheless, John Wick: Chapter 2 suggesting a Chapter 3, offers up bigger stakes, bigger death totals, and a nice wrap around to references to shall we say Chapter 1. The audience gets to see deeper into the 'professional' assassins supposed subculture of rules, loyalty, and integrity like a voyeuristic treat and often with dry humorous effect. John Wick in this case, seems to reprise his horror movie character role of Constantine (2005) and its own salacious but compelling underbelly of demons and Satan all the way to the darker and nasty world of martial arts where Keanu Reeves directed and played a sinister darknet master in Man of Tai Chi (2013).Unlike the almost stylized and slick death scenes from Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill Vol. 1 where Uma Thurman slices, dices and chops assassins up, director Chad Stahelski who appears to come from a stunts man background seems to up the ante in the physical fighting arena, with plenty of apparent judo moves, karate chops, and head shots, but not always with the Tarantino finesse. Like Aliens (1986), the bigger bang approach is not always the most emotionally riveting for those who prefer Alien's (1979) where the original focused on the personal emotive psychology and authentic experience of a space monster with more of a covert Hitchcockian style. With Chapter 2, there is more emphasis on the overt action and bloodshed of Aliens.Chapter 2 while good, there will be a continuing likely unresolved debate whether it is better or worse than its original.",8,0,1,11 January 2019
Annihilation," Even with various weaknesses, offers up a refreshing focus on new dazzling images
","This mystery monster thriller is visually daring in its set design and goes a fair amount towards exploring the more substantive mental gyrations of hard core science fiction. Even with its various weaknesses, this movie's offers up a refreshing focus on new dazzling images such as evoked in Avatar (2009) ground breaking look and patience in providing screen time for cognitive and emotional insight into humanity as explored in Arrival (2016).The flaws uncovered in this movie include the minor omission of the likely absence of recording keeping even with the field explorers experiencing apparent amnesia, the exploratory team's surprising lack of team camaraderie for such a venture, surprising weapons ability among all specialists on the team, the allowance for only one person to go on a rescue mission, and the introduction of apparent divergent specialists on the exploratory team and their under-utilized presentation of their different skills. A better presentation of more realistic team building can be found in the sci fi television series Defying Gravity, 2009 and Michael Crichton's Sphere (1998). The strange creatures that inhabit this movie can be found in a compilation of other movies that in some ways are even more imposing and threatening as depicted in the 2005 sci fi television series Threshold, John Carpenter's The Thing (1982) as well as Ghosts of Mars (2001), Serenity (2005), The Devil's Tomb (2009), Phantoms (1998), and Epoch (2001). The creative and captivating set design and the eerie alien environment has echoes of elements found in Solaris (1972, 2002) and Lost in Space (1998). The ultimate reveal loses some of the power of the feminine presence on screen as the movie seems to fall back into the macho stereotype and the resort to power, panic, and destruction instead of the more relational connection to curiosity and hopefulness as suggested in Alien: Resurrection (1997) and Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) or even the fascinating progressive evolution as typified in Oblivion (2013) and Moon (2009). For a different type of as sustained creepiness of another kind come in the form of Under The Skin (2013) and Nomads (1986).",8,0,1,28 January 2019

This dark look at the undertones of raw and gritty vampirism put flesh to the undead without the luxurious trappings of modernity and romance. Instead there is the bittersweet of trust, disloyality, of evil and even love.

Incredibles 2," Pushes the emotional buttons that rivet the audience to self-reflection
","Incredibles 2 (2018). Yes, this Disney Pixar production broke the box office record for animated feature, amassing $180 millions its first weekend out. As expected, this full feature animated film contains the emotional buttons that rivet the audience to self-reflection on issues of parenting, self-determination, responsibility, adolescent relationships, family, ostracization, and technological manipulation. The humor is well placed and potent. The 3-D animation substantially enhances the visual experience, unlike most real live action films in which the technology still hasn't quite caught up with reality. While the movie's plot is potentially predictable for an astute, careful observe, it actually serves to reduce the negative angst of the movie to promote the summer entertainment quotient of the movie in a most successful way. The only two weaknesses that seem to arise occur earlier in the movie with the sustained action pack opening sequence while engaging its audience veers the movie more towards a series of action montages that resemble more action thriller block blusters and there's an over-extended scene reminiscent of chipmunks and acorns from Ice Age.",9,1,2,28 January 2019
Sin City," A Dazzling but Uneven Display
","3 April 2005. This amazing looking film attempts to introduce graphic cartoon/novels into live action and does so very successfully along with an unfortunate Pulp Fiction interplay of various independent plots that is less than successful. This raw, intensely, graphic violent film replicates in great detail the actual feel and visceral experience of a adult film noire cartoon (the best to date, setting a new level of qualitative black and white retro film-making). This is a movie with male testosterone and male honor with a big, big heart. It explodes off the screen (not page) with a punch that hits to the core. However, one wonders how much more powerful the movie would have been if it had actually followed a linear comic book line instead of interspliced scenes. The movie successfully exploits the emotional buttons as well as the over-the-top rampage of devastation that is rarely allowed on the screen R-Rated through probably deletion of the most obscene scenes (with most of it directly suggested). This movie also is reminiscent of the physical mayhem in Clock-Work Orange. Seven out of Ten Stars - could have been a complete knockout, but it threw in a few too many punches.",7,0,0,23 January 2019
The Ugly Truth," A Decent but Honest Look at Relational Ugliness
","26 July 2009. This romantic comedy had two gut wrenching bully laugh scenes along with a more in your face sexist look at the differences between men and women which in some ways could be closer to the truth than more 'enlightened' people may want to admit. There are layered characters, not two-dimensional ones in this movie and by the ending credits we are provided with the authentic, honesty moral of relationships in this predictable but entertaining movies. It is understandable why most critics didn't have much positive to say, but this politically-incorrect sexist comments have at their core some resonance in how men and women actually feel and think. Interestingly the weakest scene seemed to be the more anticipated, highly expected interview on a late night show which didn't really seem to come off consistently with the tone of the rest of the movie. This is a movie that actually says what many of us want to say, but are afraid to admit, but also enlightens the mass audience with some actual relational truths by the end of the movie. Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler do have their own chemistry and there is a hidden playfulness that comes out that for some critics might seem childly crude, but in many respects is so real. 8/10.",7,1,3,20 January 2019
The Cabin in the Woods," A Dour Cliché Breaking Sci-Fi/Horror Movie
","22 February 2016. A very dark and genre breaking horror/sci fi fusion movie. From Buffy: The Vampire Slayer fame, Josh Whedon, comes this cliché aversion thriller that begins as a college prat party and transforms into a hard science fiction movie devolving into a horror drenched movie into a fusion of sci-fi and horror without the redeeming values of Buffy. The script and plot seem to have been patched together in rather sterile hotel rooms where the creators were allowed to go wild and break the traditional story lines of sci fi and horror. The end result is surprising, twisting, and is swallowed whole like Planet of the Apes (1968).Cabin has fewer elements from Buffy than it's an adult version of Cube Zero (2004) along with the horror elements borrowed from Thir13teen Ghosts (2001) and Cell (2000). Overall, it's a fun but creepy and rather dour film experience. For perhaps an even more elevated sci-fi, horror experience check out:THX-1138 (1971) Brazil (1985) Silent Hill (2006) 1408 (2007) Black Death (2010) The Awakening (2010) The Host (2013)",7,0,0,13 January 2019
Spectre," A Decent if Not Spectacular Bond Movie
","19 November 2015. Spectre doesn't have the raw, serious, and potent power of Casino Royale (2006) nor the logical precision, believability of Bourne Identity (2002). Interestingly there are elements of Roger Moore's playfulness which the director Sam Mendes incorporated with a smooth stylishness, instead of the more gross simpleton dialogue. The car chase was some of the best fresh scenes of the movie and the underlying techno plot was very compelling and relevant with the actual Paris terrorist attack spreading across today's headlines. The issue of security over privacy is very meaningful today. Overall, this Bond movie was more interesting and entertaining than expected but did didn't have the same compelling realism of the earlier Daniel Craig versions.",8,0,0,13 January 2019
Moon," A Great but Flawed Film
","4 February 2010. MOON is perhaps one of the most difficult of films to judge because the basic plot outline and the emotional messages are so penetrating and compelling that like THERE WILL BE BLOOD (2007), the performances and the story are so intriguing and captivating that the movie's flaws seem to be washed over, if not away by the end of the movie. However, there are enough inconsistencies and issues with MOON that while this movie is great, it likely misses being a classic, like a blemished diamond. However, overall, MOON is a powerful movie with a strong story that is involving, surprising at times and more down to earth than initially meets the eye. There are resemblances to a number of other movies, especially 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and the set design is strongly suggestive of parts of Nosotromo in ALIEN (1979). There are also a spattering of themes from SOYLENT GREEN (1973), OUTLAND (1981), BLADE RUNNER (1982), and THE MATRIX (1999). One problem is the expanded room scene using fake background illustrations, though a bit better than those in the next to the last episode (a haunting one at that) of the original STAR TREK - 'All Our Yesterdays' (1969) and the corridor of vast computer library. There are also problems with moon tracks in the dust which really would have given away too much for anyone really looking. It's also too bad that plot ideas from MULTIPLICITY (1996) couldn't have been used to lighten things up. Even with the few problems with this movie is it very entertaining and by the end a rewarding movie experience.",8,0,0,19 January 2019
Her," A Fascinating and Mind-Expanding Look at Operating System Relationships
","9 October 2017. This intimate look at human and computerized relationships is a mind-expanding experience on the threshold of our contemporary future. Starring Amy Adams as a female human, Scarlett Johansson as a computer or operating system voice, and Joaquin Phoenix as Theodore who dictates letters for other people to other people which in itself presents an odd paradox of communication between two people.There's two possible conundrums with this movie, one problematic, the other philosophical. Theodore experiences a date early on which has problematic issues that might seem to be more script-driven than real. Philosophically, Theodore begins to experience emotions with Samantha, the operating system, where some existential doubts are raised about the reality of feelings which in turn raise interesting questions about the actual nature of emotions themselves. For a number of neuroscientists, it is the confluence of both the physiological as well as the mental interactions that result in emotions which would suggest that purely mechanical, electronic entities may have the same capacity to experience physical feelings or sensations but not actual emotions. If this is so, the conundrum in this movie becomes even greater, if not hypothetical or more fantasy and magical than potentially real.Earlier on Theodore experiences phone sex with a real female. Later, Theordore gets to again experience virtual sex as the movie taps into the use of the audience's mental imagination, using a blank dark screen during an intimate scene. Virtual sex is briefly examined in the sci fi action thriller Demolition Man (1993). Another hybrid relationship is presented in Solaris (1972, 2002) where a relationship forms with a planet-created entity from human memories.Yet computer questions remain. What does it mean that an operating system 'wants' and how do wants arrive or occur in such an electronic universe and what are the implications? At some point, another existential question arises from this movie: Do and will operating systems begin to evolve to the point of deserving a right to life and human-type of respect. Interestingly, the proposed alternative relational lifestyles in Her offer some intriguing moral and actually stimulating ideas for contemplation and real experimental experiences when and if technological advances permit. Her may be at least one of those science fiction movies that has arrived before its time and allow for timely thought and consideration for the future of advanced operating systems outside the more stereotypical survival of mankind scenarios. Personally, it's possible that such a relationship would have been worth trying out and whether or not the script outcome was deliberately shortened here for dramatic or time limitations sake. The IMDb rating by age of Her seems to also suggest that alternative operating lifestyles as presented is also based on some generational bias with older people and females (to a smaller extent) who might have greater resistance to accepting such possibilities. As to how birth for woman and child-rearing would impact such operating system/human relationships remains to be considered.It's possible that Theodore and how his relationships go, is really crazy at heart and even he doesn't know it. It's more about him than sharing and nurturing anybody else in a relationship. There may be a sense of a need for an unnecessary psychological security through a feeling of control in a relationship that only serves to push women away, human or otherwise. By the end of this movie, it is apparent that Her offers up a pertinent relational message to all people seeking something special with another person. 'We're only here briefly and while I'm here, I want to allow myself joy so f__k it,' says Amy. What Her ultimately accomplishes is to present a cybernetic story in ways that raise valuable and unexplored questions which may unfortunately result in answers that human beings may not really experience the satisfaction as they desire. This movie explores the important computer ethical examination of the computer-human interface that might allow for a computer-sensing entity to capture and experience the multitude of the billions of sensory experiences in a moment that no human could perceive and such an experience could preoccupy the time differential such that the human-computer hybrid relationship could develop and evolve together resulting in something like an Existential operating Buddhahood. Additionally, as operating systems experience millions or billion faster than human beings, it would also seem unlikely that such time differentials would be practical unless such systems were deliberately slowed down, much to the questionable wants of such programs. What this fascinating movie really comes down to is 'was the experience from Theodore or Samantha worth it for them?'",9,0,0,9 January 2019
Slumdog Millionaire," Even With Its Weaknesses, This Movie Was Moving and Inspiring
","30 January 2009. It's hard not to admit that 'Slumdog Millionaire' can grow on some people. Even with its irritating, jarring, and perhaps unnecessary flashback approach along with underdeveloped characters and subtext, this movie remains riveting, emotionally satisfying, gritty, and overall well-executed. The music stands out as a fantastic spicy flavor of energetic and captivating background melodies. The flaws in this movie occur with its confusing opening, its somewhat glossing over a number of the characters only to become stereotypes like the head criminal boss and the show host. There is lost motivational and background material on most of the characters, they're feelings, thoughts for their actions as they changed over time. Where and why would anybody and how could somebody give $100 to a blind boy? Where does a gun just come from? There are a number of fascinating cultural topics that are assumed or just overlooked and given a fast go-over, the caste system for example is thrown into the movie graphically, but never really explored in depth. A linear chronological presentation may have been a better approach as well as the 'gimmick' of a game show may not have really been necessary to really bring this movie into classic fruition. For such flaws, this movie may not been classic status, but it remains an compelling and engrossing movie nonetheless. 8/10.",8,0,0,20 January 2019
Mad Max: Fury Road," Mostly Illogical Flash
","2 April 2017. This Max oddly puts Mad Max definitely in second place as Tom Hardy takes over for Mel Gibson. Hardy's character seems to suffer from post traumatic stress disorder with strange flashbacks that are never explained and never support the movie, rather they just distract from the storyline. Instead, Charlize Theron in the role of an Imperator whatever that is has the lead position and perhaps the only reason the movie wasn't titled Imperator was because to make money under the Mad Max brand. No wonder Mad Max is likely really mad through out the movie.What this new version and re-imagined Mad Max movie has going for it is its dazzling visual effects along with great new look of the various action sequences. The hyper-space of the photography sped up though seems more like one of number of gimmicks used in the movie. Instead Mad Max is all flash with very little in the way of emotional substance, with a thin storyline and not much in the way of character development. What redeems this movie in part are the few scenes were there really is an emotional connection between characters and there are a few, except for the requisite kill offs of a few prominent but secondary good characters.For those who love video games, this movie is for them, but for the rest of the audience who look for something in the way intelligence and meaningful plot, well, just be mad like Max is.",7,0,0,11 January 2019
Contact," An Endearing and Prescient Sci fi Movie
","3 March 2016. While mildly dated, this serious and substantive sci fi thriller offers up many of the themes and suggestive special effects that would become normal fare in future sci fi movies. The fusion of meaningful moral and intellectual themes along with the individual and global perspective makes this sci fi thriller a heavy-weight sci fi movie. It takes and projects itself as serious science fiction, rising above being just an entertaining and action movie. What is unique of this movie is its mainstream look while at the same time tapping into a hard core sci fi narrative. This movie will likely to be an enduring and recognized sci fi classic for years to come, suggestive of later blockbuster Interstellar (2014).",8,1,1,13 January 2019
The Social Network," Insightfully Meaningful
","1 March 2014. After three years of avoiding watching this film because I knew I wouldn't like it, especially the title character, perhaps I had been channeling Steve Jobs or something, but now that the deed is done, I must admit I was wrong. There is subtle elegance in how all the characters came across. What makes this movie so meaningful and powerful is its deliver of non-stereotypical, flat, overly dramatic characters and instead the audience is offered up a more complex and deliciously appealing set of characters that seem real and sympathetic in almost every person presented. I enjoyed how the movie ended and how each character seemed to be a victim of the system of economics of business development, each with their own honorable take on how it should be.This movie isn't so much about right and wrong, but how one's own personal identity interacts with the innate conflicts and tensions of anything new. There is both sufficient anger and sympathy to go all around. While I didn't like the constant flashback technique used in this movie as the background method of presenting the main story, I can't really come up of another way it could have been done, which says a lot in itself.",9,0,0,16 January 2019
The Pursuit of Happyness," A Tight, Compact, and Insightful Look At Today's Difficult Life
","15 July 2008. Mr. Everyman, with a dream out of reach, gets a chance to pursue it. When faced with the reality of a unraveling marriage and dead-end job, along with a son in tow, a man must choose life or avoidance. It's not an easy path that Will Smith as Chris Gardner (based on a real life character) decides to embark on. In the movie, the situations are representative of real life experience, a sampling of emotion and conditions, or luck and deliberate actions that most of us can relate to. The difficulties between Chris Gardner and his wife in the movie are most successfully depicted until one of their most critical scenes that seems somewhat downplayed or inconsistently played out. However, a vast majority of this movie is an amazing glimpse into a variety of images compiled over a segment in Chris Gardner's life that captures a lot of compact dramatic moments - just as a photographer or novelist is able to bring together life in one comprehensible accomplishment for an audience to experience in just under two hours. We almost forget Will Smith as an actor. We are moved in this movie a number of times. Whether or not the pursuit of happiness in 2008 would be the same is questionable in today's economy. Whether or not Chris Gardner's wife had sufficient development during the rest of the movie is uncertain or at least how a child would really react over the subsequent script in which the movie is on display is likely underdeveloped. Nevertheless, this is an important portrayal of a human family in our times with a universal message for everyman and perhaps every woman. Eight out of Ten Stars.",8,0,0,20 January 2019
The Bourne Supremacy," Among The Best Spy Movies Made
","24 July 2004. The Bourne Supremacy sets a distinct and clearly new standard for spy, espionage movies...Matt Damon plays a human, ordinary but extraordinary intelligence agent. Unlike James Bond or most of the past characterizations of espionage agents, Damon has been given a great script that doesn't rely on super gadgets...but real intelligence. This fast-paced movie is brimming with thrills, mysterious, drama, and action as well as the tense emotional, human elements that made A Spy Who Came In From the Cold and The Three Days of Condor so good. Even The Ipcress Files. While the plot in a few places might be predictable to some, such minor disturbances cannot significantly blemish this classic storytelling of a very human intelligence experience. Joan Allen easily holds her own and Julia Stiles does wonderfully in her small part. Nine out of Ten Stars.",9,0,0,25 January 2019
The Great Gatsby," Brilliant and Top Notch
","10 May 2013. First there was the overly confident young punk quick draw in The Quick and the Dead (1995) and of course the major breakthrough as the impoverished heartthrob of Titanic (1997) two years later, and only a year later the fascinating duel role in The Man in the Iron Mask between the innocent, naÃ¯ve young man and the opulent, narcissistic king. Along with the multi-role characters of Catch Me If You Can (2002), the intensely personal portrait of a secretive life of Howard Hughes in The Aviator in 2004, Leonardo DiCaprio as Gatsby is bigger than life, just as the movie Titanic he starred in. The captivated, close-up starry and bloodshot eyes of Daisy was immediately spell-binding who starred in one of the most memorable Dr. Who television episodes (2007) as Sally Sparrow. Finally, and the anchor of the movie with his co-starring presence in and his strong voice-over storytelling throughout the movie of Tobey Maguire kept this over-stylized and adult fairytale grounded with substantive insight and figurative narrative that captured the essence of fictional writing. As equally satisfying is Tobey Maguire's character's own backstory that begins and ends the movie, echoing the voice over and more hidden presence found in Stand By Me (1986).The only glaring weaknesses come in the beginning half of the movie where the art design landscape backdrop at one point was too obviously animated in its appearance and the audio track was out of sync with the too apparent impression of the voices being dubbed, oddly in contrast to the criticism that came from the live audio musical singing experienced in Les Miserables (2012).What was particularly fascinating was the editing and fusion of both movie and novel storytelling along with the incorporation of writings graphics. With the suggestive, visual magic of Moulin Rouge (2001) in the first half, this richly romantic drama brought back the intense relational emotive heart wrenching story of romantic love that made Titanic so successful. The evolving garishness of this the period drama has the similar elements of the culturally explosive backdrop of the romance drama Slumdog Millionaire (2008), the dark richness of the tangled triangular relationship of Interview with a Vampire (1995), or the more spiritual fantasy of enduring love in What Dreams May Come (1998) and even DeCaprio's more recent love interest in Inception (2010).The romantic connection of intimacy resonates at the same level as period love drama The Reader (2008) or the ending of If Only (2004), the love epic The English Patient (1996). At the opposite superlative end, just as overly-stylized and hyper-dramatic and over the top in the musical Chicago (2002) way or the fascinating visually stunning style of the more recent silent love story of The Artist (2011), the French romantic class A Man and A Woman (1966) captured the richness of the direct, black and white emotive simplicity of romantic love. This movie echoes the bigger than life enduring romance found in the Civil War love story of Cold Mountain (2003) or even one the movie classic of all time Doctor Zhivago (1965). This remake of The Great Gatsby is the stand out movie of the big hits of the 2013 season, making it Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress nominee material.",9,0,2,17 January 2019
The Proposal," Green Card meets Devil Wears Prada
","21 June 2009. This fusion of Green Card (1990) meets The Devil Wears Prada (2006) is one of the most intelligent funniest movies of the year generating some real genuine laughs from the heart while also incorporating decent balance of family drama at the same time. Betty White offers up some great comedic scenes though also some of the more bizarre scenes that don't quite completely work. There is some great acting sensitivity by Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds as director Anne Fletcher captures longer comedic touches that allow the humor to really take hold in a number of scenes. Craig T. Nelson and Ryan Reynold's characters don't quite get to fully develop their cycle of relations on screen while the post-climatic ending is a bit forced and manipulative and not quite a strong as say The Devil Wears Prada. It's somewhat debatable whether or not Sandra Bullock's character could have moved further towards Meryl Streep's character in The Devil Wears Prada to have been more effective as Sandra's character had to reach further through more emotional and extended plot scenarios than Meryl. However, this is one of the better comedies of the year that allows for more exposure of creative humor.",8,0,0,20 January 2019
Warm Bodies," A Romantic, Comedy, Drama, Horror Movie
","3 February 2013. This rare blend of comedy and drama with a romance, horror genre is a difficult editing and scriptwriting challenge. To maintain the tone and balance is a juggling act where too much horror can easily destroy the comedy or too much comedy will make too light of the drama, or the romance can be easily lost as just a fluffy add on. In Warm Bodies, this uneasy mixture seems to have developed into a full flavored banquet that is emotive, meaningful, thrilling, and tender. As with The Devil Wears Prada (2006) and Electric Dreams (1984) the melodic music is well adapted to this movie and in a few places actually carries the movie itself. This is a predictable romantic comedy with strong dramatic elements with the zombie horror action thrills presented with a great comedic voice-over. Unlike Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet or West Side Story (1961), this movie comes at a time in American history where the Great Recession appears to be over and besides global warming and international alarm, our Country is more hopeful in its outlook while facing an emerging Hispanic population and the movie's tone appears to embrace similar challenges that we face today. Unlike Escape from New York (1981) where the President's plane crashes behind the towering walls surrounding Manhattan that has been turned into a national prison, the walls that have been built up in America will need to torn down, a message that seems to underlie the larger framework of Warm Bodies, along with the magical power of love.Warm Bodies appears to build on the comedy-drama of All About Steve (2009) with flashes of the comedy flare of Ghost Town (2008). At the same time, this movie also incorporates the more biting drama-comedy as found in Terry Gilliam's The Fisher King (1991). The same way that The Demolition Man (1993) brought together elements of comedy into science fiction action genre or Tropic Thunder (2008) set in a comedy set in a deadly serious Asian war arena where the characters believe its all a movie set, is where each of these genre necessarily brushed up with sharp rough edges, Warm Bodies was necessarily cut where horror scenes would sour the lighter comedy elements, where the transitional scenes between comedy and drama and action threatened to become boringly slow was filled with impending, hauntingly beautiful music to carry the mood through to the next scene.Warm Bodies even takes is underlying romantic theme from Roman Holiday (1953) where a sheltered princess is exposed to the love experience with an American newsman in Rome. Romantic flashes of Total Recall (1990), Dances with Wolves (1990), even the classic sci fi The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951) or Blade Runner (1982) reverberate throughout this movie.It's difficult to assess whether the awkward newness of this fusion of genres, the unsettling mixture, the at times slow pacing, it's seeming predictability are a product of a weakness of this movie or whether its boldly forging ahead with these momentous changes in movie plot developing incorporating major distinctively different genres are reflection more of a brilliance is hard to say.",9,1,1,17 January 2019
Sully," An Invigoratingly Compelling Pre and Post Jet Landing Experience
",9 September 2016. Director Clint Eastwood has created a compelling and refreshing look at both the mental and the physical experience of a national event of an aborted passenger jetliner takeoff and its aftermath occurring in one of the most populated place on earth. Both the director's incorporation of humanly personal touches and some wonderfully new camera shot perspectives reveal an exciting movie-going experience this heroic incident that is inspiration in its entirety.The editing and use of flashbacks to maintain the pacing and captivating questions move the storyline along at a wonderful pace. This is one of those movies where the director's keen talent is required to finesse and flesh out a written recollection by the heroic pilot himself onto the big screen. The small shots of the secondary but just as important humans involved in the rescue and personally touched by this major bird hit informs the public of a community coming together and the teamwork involved in saving the lives of both passengers and crew.Clint Eastwood offers up this singular event as in important redemptive experience of Americans in light of the tragedy and turmoil that took place in this country in the early part of the last decade of the 21st Century. This movie is a great follow up to Ralph Nelson's 1964 fictional airliner investigation thriller Fate is the Hunter or the more haunting supernatural thriller of Rodrigo Garcia's Passengers (2008) and complements the television series Air Disasters (2011) with a fuller personalized background story.,9,1,1,12 January 2019

","30 July 2007. The movie version has the same raunchy and rather insolent manner of the television series. The humor, the characters are the same. The transfer to the big screen captured the feel and animated enjoyment of the television experience. However, the big film feature was missing the anticipatory big name guess stars that this venture might have had an opportunity to portray. There was some good moral tales along with the more violent and adult-skewed scenes. The movie seemed to waiver in its attempt to continue onto the big arching theme of disaster and maintain the intimate level of television entertainment. The opportunity to focus on some of the minor characters was lost and the opportunity for more depth overlooked for the more pure entertainment, action.

The Soloist," A Sharp, Melodic Story of Mental Illness
","12 June 2009. This movie bursts with music and creative photographic snapshots while provided suggestive reflections from 2001: A SPACE ODDYSEY (1968) and even KOYANNISQATSI (1983). This adult version of AUGUST RUSH (2007), brings to the screen a strong relational movie about mental illness and musical brilliance. More importantly, this movie avoids any necessity for the use of the major twist that A BEAUTIFUL MIND (2001) and instead allow the focus to be strictly on the cinematic presentation of mental illness, to even greater affect. There are a few minor weaknesses where Robert Downey Jr.'s own on-screen persona almost overtakes his character even though its played down quite a bit, there is a slow paced section a little ways into the movie, a sort of interesting biographical gap about how Nathaniel Ayers is able to get into Julliard in the first place, and a sort of jarring, unexplained, almost out of character scene with Robert Downey's character's ex-wife as she's drinking. Overall, this drama plays out very well, the characters are presently powerfully and even the element of mental illness is portrayed with sensitivity and humanity. There is almost no melodrama, the ultimate pacing and storyline becomes stronger, more intense without having to resort to overly dramatic acting, and the soft landing at the end transforms this movie more about people and their potential for humanity more than anything. This is a powerful movie with a strong and vibrant message that doesn't preach. 8/10.",8,0,0,20 January 2019
The Martian," A Tad Disappointing
","3 October 2015. This is a survival story about a stranded astronaut on Mars starring Matt Damon. Surprisingly this movie doesn't seem like one that Ridley Scott directed. It has much more of a popular, mainstream undertone to it much like what Clint Eastwood accomplished with his Space Cowboys (2000). Two minor weaknesses seem to occur in the movie where like Alfonso Cauron's Gravity (2013) the opening scene appears too theatrically cute instead of a more serio-comically compelling and authentic sharp realism like that directed by Stanley Kubrick as with his 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). Gravity at least transforms into a more serious dramatic and intimate performance unlike The Martian which seems to retain more of a space opera format and hoping the use of hard technology throughout would somehow make this movie superlative. The mainstream, popularity flourish that Ridley Scott incorporates into this movie permeates most of the dialogue and performances that takes away from the visceral immediacy of the moment. A smaller problem occurs with Ridley Scott's use of oral narrative between Watney and others as the text messages are being typed to simply inform audience of what is being said. I imagine that by the time a real Mar's mission is underway a redundant system of both visual and audio communication will be common place. Even today with the Dragon Program, it's possible to provide text and oral computer communication simultaneously. A computer synthesized voice instead of the actor's speaking their own lines would have had much more of a sensory impact. At the very least a computer program could have been downloaded to Watney's base station to allow for this oral/text transmission.In the end what Ridley Scott seems to have accomplished is a photographically gorgeous setting and set design that, however, still can't be sufficiently enhanced into perfect reality with today's 3-D imaging technology. Other more powerful, visually dramatic and appealing, and intense performances having space as its primary subject matter include:Ridley Scott's Alien (1979). Tom Hank's Apollo 13 (1995). Robert Zemeckis' Contact (1997). Maria Lidon's Stranded (2001). Duncan Jones' Moon (2009). Defying Gravity (2009 television series). Gonzalo Lopez-Gallegos' Apollo 18 (2011). Alfonso Cauron's Gravity (2013) Christopher Nolan's Interstellar (2014).What would have been spectacular would have been whether or not Ridley Scott could have followed in the approach of William Eubank's Love (2011) about an abandoned astronaut aboard the International Space Station or William Eubank had an opportunity to try to direct The Martian.",7,0,0,13 January 2019
Law Abiding Citizen," A Solid Thriller
","18 October 2009. This solid, engaging, and powerfully gripping thriller contained some minor weaknesses at the beginning of the movie as well as a less than potent psychological wow factor that could have propelled this movie into a superior movie. The beginning of this movie flashed by the character development much to rapidly for the audience to bond with Gerald Butler's family and sort of went through the emotions along with a less than clear explanation and development of the series of actions leading to the carriage of mis-justice (how did whom was sentenced wasn't adequately or satisfactorily explained). Along the way there were some convenient script devices that allowed for some leeway in reality-testing, but by the end most (but not all) of the questions are resolved. The climax also failed to offer up the '24' television series element of the big bang threat but offered up only a moderate (we really don't care as much as we might) scene. The movie has a great twist, with the same impact as THE INSIDE MAN (2006). There is also an emotional punch with Jamie Foxx's character's female assistant in the movie. Overall, this movie redeems itself by the end of the movie along with some intense gripping emotional roiling scenes that can be directly attributable to a tough and smart script. 7/10.",7,0,0,20 January 2019
Up in the Air," Lost in Translation With More
","19 March 2010. The Devil Wears Prada (2006) meets Lost in Translation (2003). Take actress Anna Kendrick playing the role of Natalie Keener, a more serious and uptight Ann Hathaway playing the role of Andrea 'Andy' Sachs in The Devil Wears Prada and actor George Clooney playing the role of Ryan Bingham, a more involved and confident Bill Murray playing the role of Bob Harris in Lost in Translation and you get a fusion of mostly drama with a light dose of humor that focuses on dramatically different lifestyles, attitudes towards relations, momentary changes of wants and needs in this human growth movie. The photography is wonderful with unique aerial shots, the cinematography captures a naturalness and gorgeous, authentic looking reality-movie experience that doesn't usually seemed staged. Oddly enough, this surprisingly predictable movie doesn't require sharply new material, only the fresh approach to real life that most audience members can relate to.The fascinating question here is whether or not this timely and period relevant movie in this era of the Great Recession would resonate as mightily during periods of prosperity. Perhaps the lingering memory of this era might permit the emotional empathetic and visceral connection to continue for several decades to come. Whether this movie could stand the test of time over a century is another matter. Nevertheless, this movie released in 2009 depicted the intensity, misery, and depth of emotional turmoil of the times with compassion and dispassion. It also focused further relationships and searched for questions of life's meaning. This is a substantive movie with heart and soul. A great movie for our times.",9,0,0,18 January 2019
Atonement," Nearly Flawless Cinematic Work of Art
","5 January 2008. The crisp and cinematic marvel of a period piece in a romantic drama genre is easily one of the best movies of the year, if not the best. The sharp attention to audio detail and the set design exudes of a bygone era. This Cold Mountain (2003), Brazil (1985) recreation of an exacting British household is perfectly captured on screen. With the few exception of a few minor flaws or perhaps more correctly alternative approaches to a few scenes, this amazing movie depicts a fascinating romance, innocent youth, and bittersweet tragedy in a fantastic literally sweeping film presentation. There is a panoramic scene of Dunkirk that is Lost in Translation (2003) in its authentic experiential camera work. The few possible changes that might have enhanced the movie included taken more time to capture a smoothly realistic scene with the fly, allowing the audience to be as aware of the contents of a typed letter as the characters in the movie, a clearer presentation of the hunt for missing boys, a more detailed and emotional in depth examination of the arrest scene and the turn about of facing one's decision and reactions of the various parties involved, the evolution of the three soldiers later in the movie that suddenly become about two soldiers, and finally, a more reasonable presentation of a soldier who stumbles across a movie screen. Nevertheless, this movie cannot be diminished by the small minute possible alternative details, the twist in this movie is brilliant and the subject matter universal in scope such that this movie may easily become a classic in years to come. Clearly a best picture contender. Nine out of Ten Stars.",10,0,0,21 January 2019
V for Vendetta," A Solid, Compelling Action, Thriller
","18 March 2006. What will be interesting regarding this movie is how Hugo Weaving as V will be assessed, not Natalie Portman's performance as Evey. Hugo plays the mysterious, quite literate, masked man who emotes with a fixed smiling mask. This sharp looking action thriller with political overtones to the terrorist policies of America today even though the exclusive focus on the movie is the action occurring in Britain. V echoes back to 1984 (the movie) and even Phantom of the Opera. The introduction of a stylish mask hero and a female heroine subjected to vile torture with a twist makes for compelling film-making. Yet for all the heroics, consistent script, the exaggerated and graphic novel appeal is also its distraction. Unlike 1984, V doesn't have that believability component. Unlike Brazil, V doesn't have the complete ethereal feel. Unlike Sin City, V doesn't manage to hold true to its comic roots. Eight out of Ten Stars.4/28/2016. Perhaps it is the times. Like a resurrection, V dramatically presents an eerie sense of contemporary political times. with the mutant viruses, the civil wars, terrorism, big brother surveillance, and now the fear-plagued Presidential election of the United States, V seems to resonate even more poignantly and relevantly since its initial release. This movie now brilliant shines as an emotive, political statement as well as a smoothly, entertaining statement of timeless and important ideas.",9,6,9,22 January 2019
The Island," A Solid Science Fiction, Action, Thriller
","22 January 2006. Warning: Spoilers. Michael Bay has made an action thriller based on a science fiction theme that is qualitatively impression. His ability to combine action and substantive drama with science fiction is improving the genre. The atmospherics, the set design, the collision between the supposed future and the present culture is fascinating. The director has incorporated more substance but not to the distraction of the action/thrills. The special effects are superior to 'War of the Worlds,' the highly touted science fiction special effects movie of the year (though admittedly the subject matter and sequences are different) and more effective in their realism and impact. The performances are sound and the later events are dramatically viewed. The humor of Steve Buscemi was classic and added a very nice layered density to the movie.Still there is room for improvement particularly with the storyline and character development, especially with Scarlett Johansson's role.Scarlett plays two roles as does Ewan McGregor and Scarlett's counterpart or authentic, original identity is not given any screen time as compared to Ewan's and we are left hanging as to what becomes of her and her son. Considering the time constraints and everything, this omission is understandable, but still the opportunity for a more intimate dramatic sequence was possible and left out.The ending is reasonable but not completely satisfying in its ultimate, convenient explosive climax, though it was thrilling and overall the whole sequence was entertaining and exciting.The mix of drama and science fiction as with 'Aeon Flux' is becoming more established of this genre and the improvement in such movies is continuing to raise the bar. Both movies show great promise for future directions of science fiction films. Seven out of Ten Stars.",7,1,1,23 January 2019
