Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Terrific new start to Star Wars franchise
","'Phantom Menace' gave a glorious new start to the legendary 'Star Wars' series. It is a prequel to the old movies, but still the viewer doesn't know what will happen while watching the film and, honestly, he doesn't have time to wonder - 'Episode I' is full with gorgeous action-scenes such as fight with lightsabers - here much better than in the old movies, race with supersonic machines, space battles etc., etc. The characters are well made even if younger Obi-Wan is slightly irritating and Padme is very annoying. Quan-gon is however a very interesting and charismatic character, little Anacin is cute and likable and Jar-Jar is hilarious. The villains are even cooler, from the devious racer Sebulba through the merciless killing machine Darth Maul to the cunning and ruthless Darth Sidious. The plot is well made, the special effects are still stunning, after so many years and the story moves with good pace, neither too fast, nor too slow. Overall, one of the best scifi movies, ever.",8,1,2,31 March 2005
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Very good movie
","As a long-time fan of 'Narnia' I was thrilled to understand that there'll be a new 'Narnia' movie and in the same way I was weary - it's like this when you expect a movie, based on a fave book. Fortunately, the new 'Narnia' movie is terrific. The movie has vision, wonderful actors - from the kids to the fascinating White Which, terrific battles, excellent visual effects and which is most important - it has the magic atmosphere of the books. I might even go as far as saying that the movie is no inferior, even superior to the book. It has the feel of wonder from the books, but the kids are definitely cooler in the movie and some wonderful combat scenes are added. Overall, third best movie of 2005 (after Episode III and Harry Potter IV).",10,0,0,1 January 2006
Spider-Man 2," Not very good
","'Spider-man 2' was one of the biggest hits last year, but, at least in my opinion, it is not very good. Basically I didn't like anything in this movie, except maybe the performance of the actor who played Harry Osborne. Actually he should have been Spiderman and Toby should have been Osborn jnr. Sadly, this is not the case, so we have a whining fragile super-hero, who is a complete loser. Why? In the comic books Parker isn't like this. He is almost a humorous character. This Parker is pathetic. About Marry Jane... nothing personal against Kirsten Dunst, but she is not for this character. Mary Jane from the comic books is witty, clever and very beautiful, in the movie she is an ordinary girl, who knows only to cry. Molina as Dr. Oc... he played well, but where is the costume? In the movie he looked like a fat worker. I'm a fan of the comic books and the TV series, especially Spiderman Unlimited, but this movie wasn't good, it didn't capture the spirit of the hero. More it was a copycat of the first movie as story. I give it 4/10 just because it's Spidey and he is my fave comic-book hero.",4,1,3,1 April 2005
The Terminator," One of the best movies ever
","With this low-budget scifi movie one of the greatest series in the history of cinema begins. Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is an ordinary woman with ordinary life. One day this changes. From the future comes a hideous killer, a cyborg wo can not be killed. It is known as the Terminator(Arnold Swartzenegger). A lone human warrior, also sent from the future, must confront him and save Sarrah, for she is to give birth to a great leader, who can defeat the Terminators in a chilling war in not-so-far future. But how can a man and a woman stop an invincible robot of terrible power? This is a great film. The actors are excellent, especially Arnold. The action is very interesting and seems very real. The atmosphere in the movie is great. In conclusion, this is a wonderful film for every fan of scifi actions. But watch out, the second one is even better!",9,0,1,10 November 2004
Sleepy Hollow," Entertaining mix of fantasy and horror.
","Tim Burton's 'Sleepy Hollow' is a very good Gothic story, full with magic, gore and dark humor. The main character in the movie is portrayed by the cult-actor Johnny Depp ('A Nightmare on Elm Street', 'Pirates of the Caribbean'), who is excellent as ever. But the other actors are also great - Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Christopher Lee and the rest of the cast play very well, and Christopher Walken is the ideal choice for the murderous Headless Horseman. The story is action-packed, fast paced and will entertains fans of horror-movies, even if the film itself is not scary at all. However, it is enjoyable and if you see it, you won't regret.",7,1,2,9 February 2005
The Beach," Beautiful, original and... pointless
","'The Beach' is a movie which left me with mixed emotions. It was really a beautiful and well-made film. the beaches, the sea, the jungle, the kisses- all was beautiful and cleverly shot. On the contrary, when something bad happens, like shark attack, it is really gory and nasty. The contrast was brilliantly made. The actors played very well. I'm not a great fan of Leo Di Caprio, but he proved his talent again. The plot was original and interesting. But after all this strong points of the movie, I wondered - what's the point of 'The Beach'. It is obviously not 'just for fun' and I really tried to figure its message. But I didn't find any. People go to a secret beach, live happily, than with shark attacks and drug farmers the dream becomes nightmare. Few of them die, they leave the beach. This is the film. A beautiful, well made, original, but... pointless. Still I recommend it and maybe you will find something I didn't.",6,2,5,28 March 2005
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," My personal favorite
","Of all 'Star Wars' movies this is my favorite. Lighter and faster than its predecessor, it contains marvelous action scenes, excellent plot, a lot of humor and in the same time drama. It is the conclusion - at least for now - of the long running scifi saga and it has everything in it. Luke finally becomes a very cool and charismatic character, like his teacher Obi-Wan. Han and Leia are again likable and the Ewoks are hilarious. Darth Vader, the ultimate villain in the series finally reveals his better side and to look his personal dilemma, hidden behind his vile looking skull mask is fascinating. but fans of bad guys, do not worry. Hell has a new face as Emperor Palpatine, the true arch demon of the series and it is a great new face. The emperor is cunning, evil, dangerous and almost terrifying. The action scenes in the film are excellent and the tension is very high. Overall, a classic. I love it.",10,0,1,31 March 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The best scenes of the series are in this movie; sadly, the worst, too.
","The long-awaited sequel of the new Star Wars sequel arrives, and honestly, it was not what I have expected. The grown up Anakin, played by Hayden Christensen is nothing more than a very irritating teenager and for me it's tough to imagine him as a future Darth Vader. His teachers, Obi-Wan and Yoda are not better - Kenobi looks like a beggar, not like an old warrior and for Yoda the less I say, better. Padme also is very unpleasant young woman and with ALL good guys annoying the movie loses much. The love story between Anakin and Padme is horrible. It is pathetic, slow and cheesy and I personally hope that awful things will happen to these two in the next installment. However, the movie has its strong moments and they are delivered by the bad guys. Darth Sidious proved again his malice and cunning characters, Jango Fet was extremely cool and count Dookoo, played by the legend Christopher Lee is simply the best. The action scenes in the movie are spectacular, maybe the best in the whole saga and the visual effects one more time are outstanding. This almost made the film great, but with so unlikable main characters it is just OK. I hope for a better Episode 3.",6,0,1,31 March 2005
Predator," Enjoyable, but not great.
","The first movie about the invisible hunter known as the Predator is considered to be a great scifi action; it is an enjoyable movie indeed, with a lot of action scenes, crude humor, gore and really a fascinating villain; Arnold is also cool, even if not as much as in the Terminator. It's really not great however. The Predator appears in the end of the movie, the final battle between him and Arnold is not that memorable. His cruel laughter and gruesome methods of killing, however, make 'Predator' really an entertaining scifi action. The soundtrack is also terrific. So in conclusion, this is quite decent movie, but not as good as it's sequels ('Predator 2' and 'Alien vs Predator'), which are terrific.",7,0,4,9 February 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," Quite chaotic.
","The last movie in the popular 'Matrix' trilogy concludes the series with a lot of action and battles, which, sadly, does not make a good plot. As in the second volume, there are many annoying kung-fu battles and people, who try to look cool just for the sake of being cool - goggles, long coats, you know. The two main characters are as distasteful as in the previous two movies and the bad guy is even more laughable. That said, the battle for Zyon was very entertaining, even if unrealistic and the last combat between Neo and Smith is the best moment in the whole story - not because of the fight itself, but because of the creepy atmosphere in the Matrix. The finish also is not candylike, which was a pleasant surprise. But after three not-that-great movies, I was too tired to enjoy it.",4,1,3,15 February 2005
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Not as good as the first two, still highly enjoyable
","The third part of the 'Terminator' series is often bashed for being childish, compared to the first two, but this is not the case. The first two parts of the story were darker, true, and better - for this there can be no argument; but this is still a great action scifi movie, full with cynical humor, jaw-dropping action and very good visual effects. The actors are decent, especially Arnold who is as good as ever. The story is a little bit stupid, because it basically ignores the message of the 2nd movie, but it is enjoyable and entertaining. The final of the film is really great, though. In conclusion - not on the level of T2, but very good indeed.",8,0,0,9 February 2005
The Shining," A masterpiece of modern horror
","'The Shining' is without a doubt one of the greatest horror-movies ever made. Loosely based on Stephen King's best-selling novel and directed by the master director Stanley Kubrick, it is scary, creepy and in the same time very beautiful touching. The actors are excellent, little Danny is really likable, his mother Wendy played by Shelly Duval really looks scary and Jack... Jack is great. Spooky, hilarious and terrifying, he is really a great villain, even without special powers like Freddy Krueger for example. My only (minor) complain is that the action is a little bit slow-paced in the beginning and sometimes the soundtrack make you jump with no reason. Apart from this 'The Shining' is a must for horror-fans. Timeless classic.",8,0,1,9 February 2005
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," A stunning scifi epic.
","'Terminator 2: The Judgment Day' is without a doubt the best scifi action ever made. With great script, jaw-dropping visual effects and stunning action, it entertains and in the same time chills the viewers. The story is set several years after the events of the original. Sarah Connor is considered mad and is in hospital, while her son, John is a cocky pre-teen, who hates his step-parents and lives mainly in the streets. Unfortunately for him, from the future comes a new and deadly Terminator of liquid metal - an unstoppable killing machine, which can not be hurt. Of course, a new protector is sent - this time he is the villain from the first movie, or at least a Terminator from the same model. He must save John from the liquid assassin. Which is impossible. The movie grabs you from the start and is great to the finish. The actors are excellent - not only veterans Arnold Swartzenegger and Linda Hamilton, but also Robert Patrick and Eddie Furlong. The story is epic in scale and action-packed, and the visual effects are still among the best in the genre, even today. In conclusion - the greatest action scifi ever made.",9,1,1,9 February 2005
Van Helsing," Entertaining movie
","This one is a very nice and entertaining movie, one of the best about vampires I have ever watched. The story is simple, but cool (minor spoiler lie ahead): Van Helsing is a hunter of dangerous monsters. After successful combat with the gigantic Mr. Hyde, he is sent in Transylvania. In this accursed land the mighty vampire lord Count Dracula has evil plans, including Frankenstein's monster and a large, ferocious werewolf. Van Helsing, who allies himself with beautiful Anna (and believe me, she is really sexy), must stop Dracula and save the world of humanity. I really like the idea of so many famous monsters, fighting each other. And I also really liked so many beautiful women in a movie (ahem)... It is not an Oscar-material, but it is a very nice and entertaining film.",6,0,1,23 October 2004
Spider-Man," Enjoyable, but not a 'true' Spiderman
","'Spiderman' was an enjoyable flick, with a decent visual effects and some nice moments, but overall it was not very impressive. The first big NO-NO in the movie is Toby as Peter Parker. Nothing personal against the actor, he actually played quite well, but he is not for this character. He is more fit for Harry Osborn and John Franco would have been an ideal Spiderman. Kirsten Dunst was not too great, too. The bad guy was OK, although he was too intense from the beginning, while in the comic books Norman was just a corrupt businessman. Apart from this, the film is quite good. The story is slow-moving but interesting, it is well shot and the battles between Spidey and The Green Goblin were very well made. Also there were some classic moments as the Goblin disguised as an old woman or the people, turned into skeletons and then killed. Unfortunately, the sequel of this film is quite stupid.",6,1,2,1 April 2005
Dark City," Dark, original, great!
","'Dark City' is doubtless a great scifi movie with very original ideas (rip-offed by the Matrix), chilling atmosphere, stunning vision and complicated, yet interesting plot. The main character, John, awakes with no memories and he is chased by a creepy beings, known as the Strangers trough the strange streets of a dark and constantly changing town, which is actually not what it seems. Many of the ideas of 'Dark City' are used in 'The Matrix (John-Neo, Strangers-Agents, The Dark City-The Matrix), but this film is far, far superior. It is really disturbing and unpredictable, with very human message and in the same time it uses rather cold vision of a retro-imaginary world, which will chill your bones. The actors are very good, the visual effects are used cleverly and not pointlessly. The closing stages of the movie are really great and heart-stopping. In conclusion - great motion picture, a must see for scifi fans.",9,0,2,15 February 2005
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," the best of them so far.
","I was very excited about this movies. I love the 3rd book of the series and the saga in general, I love the first two movies and so I was very eager to watch this movie. I expected from it to be great. But it was even better than expected. The new director, Alfonso Quaron created a new cool vision of the movie and the result was fascinating - the 3rd movie about Harry Potter looks even better than it's predecessors! Also the kids are playing their characters better and better, Daniel Radcliffe won my sincerest admiration as Harry Potter. The special effects are spectacular, especially the Dementors, which are, in my opinion, one of the coolest monsters in cinema. The film was also very touching, I almost cried in some parts and I'm quite old for this sort of things - 20 years. The movie was much quicker than the previous installments as action, but still, it tells the story from the book very well. I think that the part withSPOILER the time travel was better explained in the film, than in the book.END OF SPOILER In general, it is the best Harry Potter movie so far and my all-time favourite film. I can't wait for the next one.",10,1,2,23 October 2004
Alien vs. Predator," Highly enjoyable
","First I want to say that I was very excited about the idea of this movie. I'm a big fan of the 'Predator' series and I also like 'Alien' series, so I was sure that this will be a great movie. And it was. Paul Anderson offers the fans a great new and complicated story about Predators - they are the ancient aliens, who helped us to built our civilization. But they had a deadly ritual of maturing - a teenage Predators had to fight a hideous Aliens. Now, when a mysterious pyramide is discovered frozen on the South Pole, a team of scientists go to explore it... but discovers a terrible battle between the most notorious monsters in the universe. This film will really entertain every real fan of 'Alien' and 'Predator' series. The monsters are very cool, especially the Predators, the combats are breath-taking and the plot is very interesting. If you like scifi action, watch this movie, you'll never regret it.",8,2,3,10 November 2004
Batman Begins," Well, not as good as the Burton's vision, but better than the last two.
","'Batman Begins' is yet another movie about the dark night, but, fortunately, it is not a sequel to the much-maligned 'Batman & Robin', it is the old story, told again. Which is not too great either, because Tim Burton's movie was very good and this one isn't better. But still it is very good. Christian Bale is a very good Batman, Liam Neeson is truly great and the plot is interesting and original. There are few things which were not really good however - the movie is more about Bruce and less about Batman and the battles aren't really well made. Still, the movie is cool and has a great vision, unlike 'Batman & Robin'.",6,1,3,27 August 2005
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Excellent beginning
","The movie is really a nice introduction to the magical world of 'Hogwarts'. The actors are really nice, especially Dan Radcliffe as little Harry Potter and the film is similar to the book unlike other fantasy movies, based on famous novels. The effects are good, not stunning, but well made and the movie has some memorable scenes such as the magic chess game. In conclusion, great beginning to a dare project. I watched it after I have read the first book and liked it more than the novel, even if I am an admirer of J. K. Rowling. But with this movie I saw the world of Harry and the feeling was great. 10/10",10,0,1,8 October 2004
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Brilliant!!!
","The tradition is not broken - the 4th Harry Potter movies is the best one yet, full with terrific action, dazzling plot twists, stunning visionaries and typical ironic British sense of humour. Dan Radcliffe is great. I have always liked how he portrays Harry Potter, but in the 4th movie he is simply amazing. If he is so young and can shows so well the emotions of his character, he has a bright future ahead of him. I wish him well. He deserves it. But the other actors were very good, too. As a Bulgarian I can't help, but feel proud with our boy Victor Krum. He looked like a tiger in this movie, dark and dangerous. And the dragon, oh, the dragon! Finally someone to show how a dragon should be made! His chilling fight with Harry was extraordinary. My only complaint is about Voldemort. He looked too disgusting in my opinion. On the other hand this is what Voldemort is - a wizard, who thinks himself great, but actually is a pathetic cruel creature, which takes pleasure only in suffering. Overall, the 4th Harry Potter is the best one yet and tied with 'The Revenge of the Sith' as a movie of 2005. Kudos for Dan Radcliffe, Mike Newell and the others, who created the magic!",10,0,0,28 November 2005
The Matrix Reloaded," Chaotic, boring, pathetic
","I knew that I should not watch the second part of the 'Matrix' series. After the horrendous ending of the original, I felt that the sequels would be bad. However, this was even worst than expected! First of all, there is no plot. Just a lot of dumb kung-fu fights (in scifi action I prefer shooting, BTW, that's why people invented the guns), a lot of people who are there just to look 'cool' and extremely irritating love story between the two main characters, Neo and Trinity. Agent Smith, who is back for no apparent reason is pathetic villain, just talking cheesy lines and completely unable to do a scratch to the main character, who is like Superman. The visual effects are BAD. They are completely unrealistic. I am a big fan of scifi actions, don't get me wrong. I absolutely love the Terminators, and like pretty much Alien, Pitch Black, Predator, Robocop and even the Japanese Godzilla movies. This, however, is beyond redemption. I give it three only because so much money were thrown in it and the guys who made it so badly wanted to make a good movie. However, they failed.",3,0,1,11 February 2005
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Better than the first one
","It is amazing, but unlike many sequels, 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' is better than the first part of the series. And the first part was really good. Still, this movie is quite spectacular. The actors are obviously matured after the first film and the atmosphere of the second part is cooler, darker (like in the book). The mystery of the creature-from-the-chamber is very interesting and the final moments of the film are simply amazing. Watch it and you'll see. My final words are a big 'Congratulations' for sir Richard Harris. In his last role, the great actor played a wonderful Dumbledore, it was obvious, that he enjoys his work and this was a great thing. My rating: 11/10 :-)",10,0,1,8 October 2004
War of the Worlds," Very good, if not great.
","This is the best movie about alien-invasion I have watched. It has a fascinating vision, a chilling atmosphere and great action, which is destined to stay as a classic. Based on H.G. Wells' masterpiece, it tells the story of malevolent aliens, who attack the world. The main character, played very well by Tom Cruise must save his kids from the apocalypse, unleashed by the aliens. The film is really great. I think that its strongest point is the atmosphere of lurking doom and despair, which floods from the movie. If aliens really attack humans, we'll be like this. Without stupid heroics like in 'The Independence Day'. Just stunned and very scared people.",8,1,5,3 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Possibly the best 'Star Wars' movie
","'The Revenge of the Sith' is, I believe, the best movie in the entire series, full with fascinating characters, breathtaking visual effects and a complex and interesting plot. Hayden Christensen redeemed himself after mediocre performance in 'Attack of the Clones' - here is excellent as the falling hero Anakin Skywalker, future Darth Vader. Ewan McCregor is also very good as the coolest Obi-Wan Kenobi in the whole series and Ian McDiarmid (Palpatine), the arch-villain of the series is terrific. The fights between Jedi and Sith in the movie are terrific, but what is the best in this movie is the atmosphere - you feel the impending doom and sometimes the sadness of story chokes you like Vader himself! Overall, a great movie, a must for every fan of fantasy and science fiction.",10,2,8,19 May 2005
A Nightmare on Elm Street," The scariest movie I have watched.
","The first part of the long-running Elm Street series is by far the scariest of them all, even if I liked parts 3 and 7 more. But here we have the introduction of the possibly most evil villain in cinema - Freddy Krueger. The story is not very complicated - a hideous spirit of a burned child murderer is torturing the dreams of inncoent teens - but the film is cleverly shot and with some very interesting ideas about mixing dreams and reality. I also like very much the personality of Freddy, I think that he is much more interesting than ordinary slashers like Jason Voorhes and more clever and sinister even than Hannibal Leckter. The special effects in the movie are old now, but still, they are well-made and impressive. The only thing I didn't like is the ending, I think that it was too nasty. But overall, a good movie.",8,0,0,23 October 2004
The Matrix," Pathetic love story ruins a very good scifi action.
","'The Matrix' is considered to be a great movie and one of the best scifi actions ever made. This is true, but only to some degree. The film has really fascinating visual effects and everything in it has cool look - the good guys, the bad guys, the action scenes, the strange Matrix-thing, the hellish future. It is also true that the movie was quite original and not an ordinary Terminator rip-off. That said, the film has some major flaws. Individually, neither Neo, nor Trinity were irritating, but as a couple they were extremely frustrating. The whole love story was annoying and pathetic and in the end of the movie I really hated all about it. The other big failure was the villain. Agent Smith was a joke, a machine who laughs evilly and talks about the problems of humanity is the cheesiest idea ever to be created. Why Terminators are scary? Because they act like robots. Smith is a clown. So my overall opinion of the film is low and I gave it 5 rating only because of the good action scenes and visual effects. I haven't watch the sequels and I don't plan to.",5,1,4,9 February 2005
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Very good movie, but not the best in the series
","The legend begins with this old, but great movie - Star Wars. It is obviously made with love and it is a very nice introduction to the magnificent world of George Lucas, full with humor, terrific action, very likable characters and creepy villains, including the notorious Darth Vader, probably the coolest character in the series. The movie begins like a typical faerie tale, on a small planet, and the main character Luke Skywalker is just an ordinary boy, caught in extraordinary events. Ben Kenobi, the wise old man with mysterious past is really an interesting and charismatic hero, Han Solo and his friend Chewbakka are hilarious and even princess Leia is nice - not with striking beauty, but likable and human. And the villain... Vader. When I was young I dreamed to be like him. He is a symbol of the true evil - big, black, menacing, ruined and with this skull-like mask. His voice, his powers and his attitude made him possibly the greatest movie villain, even if in this film we saw a glimpse of even greater evil in the face of the hideous old Emperor. The story is good for a beginning, but a bit slow. However, it becomes better in the next two movies.",8,0,1,31 March 2005
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The darkest Star Wars movie
","'Empire Strikes Back' is definitely the darkest and possibly the best 'Star Wars' movie. It has a spectacular atmosphere, a very well developed characters and stunning - even now after two decades - action scenes. The movie is interesting, breathtaking and very cool. Darth Vader is very evil and ruthless in this movie, Luke is almost desperate and the Empire seems invincible, unstoppable. The final battle between father and son (sorry for the spoiler, but I don't think that anybody is unaware of that) is one of the greatest moments in cinema and very well shot too - the young, almost fragile Luke against the menacing, dark figure of Darth Vader. Truly a great movie.",9,0,1,31 March 2005
