First Man," First Man (to leave the theater)
","In my opinion First Man fails on multiple levels. From a historical perspective, there is nearly no conveyance to the audience about the political motivation that was behind the entire program to get an American on the Moon before the Soviets. The Soviets' lead in the 'space race' prior to the Apollo program had been considered an existential threat in the struggle for the hearts and minds of humanity and the American government considered it essential to win the race to the Moon. While the American flag is seen at a distance next to the lunar module, the actual planting of the flag on the moon was, in a certain sense, the entire raison d'Ãªtre for the Apollo program and yet this moment was completely ignored by director Chazelle, making such a blatant omission seem an intentional anti-American political statement.
From a cinematic perspective, Chazelle seems obsessive in his constant use of closeups for even mundane moments and downright abusive in his use of 'shaky shots' during moments of physical trauma. I always feel 'cheated' when a director wimps out by an excessive use of shaky-shots as a cheap way to avoid the expense and creative effort otherwise required to depict what is actually happening to cause trauma.
From an acting and character development perspective, none of the characters gain our sympathy or empathy in this film. Its as if they are all reading their lines from a script rather than investing themselves with the spirit of the people they are supposed to be portraying. Armstrong, in particular, is portrayed by Gosling as extremely unemotional and cool, even when saying goodbye, 
perhaps forever, to his wife and children. And while Armstrong may or may not have been that way, it seems overdone in this film. Strangest of all was Claire Foy's depiction of Janet Armstrong who is portrayed as constantly annoyed with her husband and resentful of the sacrifices he had to make as the first human selected to set foot on the moon. I find it hard to believe that Armstrong's wife could have been this way in reality and if she was not then Chazelle and Foy have done her a great disservice.
Finally, from a story-arc perspective, the movie's pace is plodding with Chazelle spending way too much time on the familial interactions of the Armstrong clan. While this may stem from the fact the movie was based on a biography of Armstrong rather than upon a depiction of the Apollo mission itself, the fact that this was, as far as I know, the first major cinematic portrayal of mankind's first voyage to the moon really deserved a much more expansive treatment than it receives in this film.
I am confident that this film will not be, nor should it be, the definitive telling of America's triumphant landing of man on the moon, a story that is epic and will require a director with an epic vision to tell the tale. It is with regret that I say that this movie and this director were not up to that task.",4,278,485,15 October 2018

","If you can't get by an actor's politics to watch a movie then suit yourself. I certainly don't believe in Deniro's liberal world view. But that's not going to stop me from watching a movie he happens to be in unless the movie itself is political propaganda, which is not the case here. There is no denying the virtuosity of certain actors and watching Deniro, Pacino, Pesci and Keitel all together in one epic film was a rare treat. It's like a renaissance painting in which DaVinci, Michelangelo, Caravaggio and Titian all had a hand. In a thousand years, are the politics of those artists going to matter one fig when it comes to appreciating their creations? What's striking and engrossing about this film is the arc of the narrative that ends where we all know our own lives will end but don't want to think about it: old, infirm, possibly alone, facing our mortality and the possible consequences of our choices in life. We, as men, can empathize somewhat with Sheeran as he tries to justify his life's choices to his estranged Daughter as his attempt to protect his family from the horrors of the world. We observe Deniro as he is preparing for his own end. We watch Sheeran's attempt at confession as a Catholic priest incredulously tries to evoke repentance from a man who is so morally callous that he cannot even summon the remorse needed to save his own soul. The priest is left with no option but to fudge a loophole that he hopes will gain his supplicant absolution, but probably won't. In the end, we watch voyeuristically as Sheeran is reduced to selecting his own coffin. It is due to Deniro's virtuosity that Sheeran seems simultaneously both disturbed and matter-of-fact as he does so. In the end, we see Sheeran, alone, in a nursing home contemplating his past and its consequences. And we find ourselves wondering if Sheeran, on some level, is us.",10,22,44,30 November 2019

","I'll be generous and just say that ant director who can make a film about one of the most dramatic and decisive battles in history and make it boring has to be in a directorial slump or malaise. And although the buck stops with the director, the actors can't get be held blameless either, especially when they are as seasoned and talented as Woody Harrelson (think No Country For Old Men) and Dennis Quaid. The acting is boring and clichè....like someone's stereotypical idea of how guys spoke during the forties...straight out of the movies made at that time. The half-grins, the winks, the stentorian speaking between generals...as if they are caricatures instead of real, live human beings, the calm demeanor of the airmen as they are about to jump out of their burning planes like they're going for a stroll. Just dumb.",2,1,6,23 May 2020
