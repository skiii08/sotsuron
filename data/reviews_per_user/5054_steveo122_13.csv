Blade Runner 2049," Villeneuve: I'm ready to hand all my sci-fi needs to him.
","Again I say, as a pessimist, being wrong means good news.
I fully expected to be disappointed. Early.
After an hour, I relaxed.
My first thought as it started was that they had made the clever choice to tie in to the first film through the soundtrack rather than through visual re-creations of settings from the original. But I don't remember the distinctive sounds of the first being so 'heavy handed'. Essentially that's my only complaint.
I have issues with the third act developments but nothing that drags down the overall effect of the film.
Very well made, thought out and controlled. I found the story-line compelling and the 'savor it' pace fitting.
This is seriously one of the best sequels made.
I was well pleased.",8,0,4,12 January 2018
Passengers," Romance?
","Romance? Stalking, kidnapping, attempted murder leavened with some romantic Stockholm Syndrome. Nice ship and a few effective exterior scenes. Otherwise essentially a silly business culminating in fancy FX footwork and a 'Perils of Pauline' resolution. 'Winter's Bone' is still Jennifer Lawrence's high point for me and now that she has become a glamorpuss, deservedly, I keep wanting to fault her for being too pretty to be a good actress, but I can't. She hasn't proved it yet. Here, as usual, she delivers. Chris Pratt, on the other hand, has no weight, gravity or not. He delivers cotton candy. The tactic of casting 'pretty and popular' was only 50% successful.Notice how good Laurence Fishburne was? Imagine if it had been he that woke her up. Yeah, creepy, I know, but it would have been much deeper. And I would have cared, instead of wishing some 'eat 'em one by one' alien would've shown up.",5,6,11,8 April 2017
The Irishman," An admirable work of speculative history.
","The story:
More than any other gangster movie, this one never lets go of the impression that you are willingly spending time with axxholes. It's based on real events and regardless of how accurate or truthful it is, that connection to reality, to the 'horror' aspect of knowing there are people out there doing these things, strips away the basic protection an audience has while enjoying viewing reprehensible/repugnant human tricks by having the 'It's only a movie' justification. For example, there comes a scene in which the audience is tempted to have some high level of empathy for the emotional pain a central character feels, as a 'normal' human would have while watching a 'normal' fictional tale, when the reality is that the character never actually reaps the level of pain a scumbag like him deserves.
Did Scorsese intend the dichotomy?The movie:
That said, there was very much to admire and take delight in, most of it technical, front and back of the camera. On every level, it is as polished a production as one could expect from such a team.
Some scene/dialog pairings were alone worth the price of admission: the De Niro/Pacinos especially, much better than 'Heat'. And both of them, individually, give very impressive performances. Oscar talk is justified. Everyone, including the extras, top of their game.
The age-reducing software worked surprisingly well, to the extent that by the time film time catches up to the actors and their current faces, one suspects they used aging-software on them; the casting of supporting actors/extras was excellent - the faces were entirely fitting.
The period details are exceptional.An admirable work of speculative history.",8,3,6,28 November 2019
The Grapes of Wrath," This one is in my celluloid firmament.
","This one is in my celluloid firmament. I've been returning to it for over fifty years.
I still think it is one of the most rewarding film experiences a person can have.
With very little encouragement I could call it John Ford's best/greatest film/work of art.
With a little bit more of very little encouragement I could call it the greatest american movie ever made.
Exquisite moments and performances.",9,4,4,20 June 2018
The Lost City of Z," In the British/colonial/exploration genre of film, this is upper shelf.
","Currently at the top of my 'I wasn't expecting to like this' list.
I was reluctant to look at this as Hunnam does not have a good track record, for me. But continued praise and 'best movies you've missed' lists made me reconsider
My opinion is raised somewhat after this. My opinion of Pattinson continues to rise.
The little 'fails' are due primarily to the need for drama, such as the over-amped bombastics of the RNG lecture. Yes, there were ridiculous arguments in the Society over intractable preconceptions, and it's very possible that those very words were spoken. But in my nit-picky fashion I feel I can sense when the director has decided to 'juice it up a little'.",7,0,0,12 January 2018
Justice League," This is a four star presentation of a bowl of tomato soup.
","And I thought 'Bright' was a checklist/algorithm driven product.
I have been uninspired/unwilling to watch any of the recent comic extravaganzas.
But this's got everybody! What could go wrong!
I refuse to accept that I have 'matured' to the point of not being able to give myself over to 'comic' universes. My maturity settings are safely encrypted and password protected from change from exterior threats. And, I recently praised a lower budget movie as a better comic book movie than the blockbusters.
My fallback position with weak storied sci-fi/fantasy is to just enjoy the candy onscreen.
But this is filled with 'that's good enough' CGI effects. It's like being invited to dinner with 'It ain't very good but there's lots of it!'
I've had it up to here with just about enough of more than I can stand of super-powered fistfights. I never realized that my comic heroes were actually too stupid to fix things otherwise.
Time for my favorite review line:However, I did take notice of Ezra Miller, who I couldn't place until I looked and realized that he was the monster in what I still contend is a very good horror film: 2011 'We Need to Talk About Kevin'. His 'presence' as an actor presages many good possibilities if he can wean himself away from blockbuster money, which I wouldn't do either.",5,0,1,12 January 2018
Dunkirk," Very well done, respectful and somber
","As have many of us, I've been watching war movies since the '50s.
This is technically, the finest war movie I've seen (save for one tiny little cgi moment, but I'd have to be desperate to pick nits to mention it).
I was mesmerized for most of it. I liked the 'episodic' structure and the seemingly 'scattered' character stories. (Had Cameron done the same thing for 'Titanic', it would have been a successful movie).
I had no trouble empathizing with the characters so I don't agree with review charges of coldness from Nolan.
But it is not about the characters. It is about an event. A huge event.
So huge that even after all that, as the film was wrapping up, I thought 'Wait...that's it?'
I could have spent another hour hunting with the Spitfires.
I didn't catch on to Nolan's manipulation of time until later in the film.
Best of all, there was no gratuitousness in the presentation of the harrowing events.
Very well done, respectful and somber with an excellent, excellent soundtrack.
I think it's a worthy tribute and I had no complaints near the end, when patriotic pride rears its deserved head.",9,1,2,12 January 2018
The Lives of Others," 'The banality of evil' meets the insidiousness of applied state power.
","'The banality of evil' meets the insidiousness of applied state power.
Really excellent drama and some skillfully applied suspense.
Much deeper than just a Stasi cat and mouse game.
High praise for this by many who claim familiarity with the East Germany of this era, so, apparently the authentic feel is actually, um, authentic.",7,0,0,12 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Visually: 10/10 - Everything else sucks.
","Visually: 10/10 - everything and more my inner 1959 fan/self could have wanted. Possibly the best of the bunch.
Script: Competent re-hash of everything we've seen before made acceptable by improved tech and the above.
Dialog: Insipid - is there a filter to remove just the dialog?
Fathiers are cool.",5,3,6,12 March 2018
The Shape of Water," Whether intended or not, this is 'Blackie's' long overdue update/tribute
","It's very rare for me to push 'play' with no expectation of disappointment.
Certainly I was biased going in. I've been waiting for Sally Hawkins to score and I knew choosing to cast her was no fluke.
Nothing made by mankind is perfect, but that's no reason not to try. This is one of the most 'as perfectly as can be' thought out, planned and executed works of art, cinematic or not, I've experienced.
There's too much good in every department, on every level, to list here/now.Whether intended or not, this is 'Blackie's' long overdue update/tribute",10,18,32,12 January 2018
Da 5 Bloods," artless waste of relevent content
",A collection of CLUMSILY DIRECTED/WRITTEN clamped-together-with-staples-and-duct-tape scenes filled with actors gamely selling unbelievable as best they can but now forever tarnished by association with a bad movie by a director who could have done much better,5,88,160,12 June 2020
Annihilation," Walk, don't run.
","Walk, don't run.
I made 3 mistakes going in:
1. I forgot that I disagree with the assessment of 'Ex Machina' as 'brilliant'. It was a good production of a remedial '50s sci-fi plot. If you think you're good, do something written by Harlan Ellison. Without a dog.
2. Garland is no Villeneuve, Scott or Cameron. He could/should work for any of them as an art director.
3. Gina Rodriguez is not Michelle.",6,0,1,12 March 2018
True Romance," I wonder what that cast would cost these days?
","The direction; the script; the score; the performances.
It was good and it was fun.
Then, it felt like throw-away good and fun.
Now, it's a wealthy repository of some of the best performances in what are now iconic movie scenes.
The Scott/Tarantino blend was what you would call fortuitous, for everybody.",7,1,2,27 February 2018
