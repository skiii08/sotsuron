The Blair Witch Project," BORING!!
","Not since Stargate has a film bored me so much, I cannot believe that I fell for the hype, but this time everybody was in on it.  With TV shows and websites, I honestly thought it would be really scary.  When waiting to go into the cinema we where all held back, an entire screen full of people waiting in anticipation to watch.  The reason for this was somebody had been sick on the steps (this sounded even scarier now!).Yet when we finally got in I spent the best part of the movie trying to keep my eyes open, I found it no wonder that somebody had thrown up as it felt like I was on a roller coaster.  Anybody with a video camera could have filmed this, it seemed to have been shot in a plot of wood no bigger than 600 yards either way, and the worst part was the night when it was just a blank screen with what sounded like somebody rattling a bag of crisps, all I can say is I was more than happy to get out of the cinema after this rubbish",1,1,3,18 July 2000
