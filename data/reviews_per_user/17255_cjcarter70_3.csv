The Avengers," A+ for Avengers
","With a simple plot, each character gets to shine (brilliantly) and despite all the previews there's still plenty of wit and action to keep you grinning from beginning to end. It's an incredible feat that Joss and all the team have pulled this movie off. There's one very minor little criticism, where two scenes noticeably seemed to cut off the characters heads. That said, I've just seen this film in 2D and I will be going again to see it in 3D. BRILLIANT!! p.s. I'm totally in love with the HULK..swoon! (Hopefully this heralds a new HULK movie headed by Ruffalo.. and an action intensity following on from the Avengers, that was lacking from the first two attempts).",10,17,33,26 April 2012
The Bourne Legacy," The Legacy
","A very good first outing for Aaron Cross. It's a perfect extension to the Bourne films with strong acting and a good pace which neatly and intelligently interweaves with the Bourne Ultimatum to deliver a good plot, script and action. For all the reviewers that slam this film clearly you haven't seen the dark knight rises.. that is a perfect example of poor characters, second rate acting, ridiculous plot and dire-plodding pace.Put Jason Bourne to the back of your mind and make room for Aaron Cross before you're to quick to judge.Great Film!!!",7,10,18,16 August 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight Barely Rises
","I'm lost for words when reviewing the praise heaped on this Batman finale. I can't tell if it's blind faith or bribery, but The Dark Knight Rises fell far short of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. The plot is ludicrous with an absence of excitement or action. Bane fills most of the screen time and yet fails to show any menace or strength. In fact Nolans vision has pushed the realism of Batman to such an extreme that the original imagined characters look like a bunch of idiots running around in Halloween costumes in broad daylight. Without revealing any spoilers I cannot emphasise enough how ridiculous the plot is, filled with sequences that make no sense from the beginning to the end. It's bad enough that the director has turned out a really poor film to what was an exciting re-envisioning of a Batman trilogy; but for critics to then heap praise on top, just turns this film into one large stinking pile of garbage. Shame on you all! In summary... liked the Catwoman, Batman was absent and overall I was BORED!!!!!!",3,8,19,2 August 2012
