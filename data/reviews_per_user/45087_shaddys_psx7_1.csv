The Ring," If you like horror films - prepare yourself!!!
","Before i'd seen this film, i'd heard about the Japanese version of the film, so i'd got a rough idea about the film ... but it didn't even come close to prepare me for what 'The Ring' was about to put me through.Now i'm a bit of a lover of horror films and i've seen quite a few of them in my time, but this film actually got to me, i'd even say it scared me, there's no blood or gore in the film at all, its one of those movies that messes with your mind and leaves you thinking about it long after the movie has finished. The sound track is also suitably scary too and it compliments the film and it leaves you wondering when the next frightening sequence is coming.All in all this  movie is a must see for any horror film fan and i can guarantee you ... you'll never look at a television the same again!!!",8,0,0,12 October 2002
