Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Ugh! prehaps the worst of the trilogy
","I wasn't sure what was worse Jar Jar Binks or Jake Lloyds acting, maybe George Lucas' script, in any case his special effects are again amazing and the impersonation Ewan Macgregor does of Alec Guiness is well done, but Darth Maul gets killed too quickly and he had the most appeal of anyone in the picture.  And he flawlessly delivered his one line with Perfection, 'Yes Master'  other than that I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you are a glutton for punishment.",4,0,1,12 July 2002
Casablanca," A timeless classic
",One of the best movies of all time!  Hands down the script the acting and the plot all can stand as one of the best movies of all time.  Plus for a love story it is not the typical chick flick and appeals to the male gender. Because of Humphrey Bogart's tough guy image.  Excellent Film and definitely one to own.,9,0,0,1 August 2002
Se7en," Dark Drama Masterpiece
","If crime is your thing, then this is a splendid movie for you.  As murders happen according to the 7 deadly sins.  Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are excellent in this crime drama. As well as supported by a great script and great supporting acting.  I have watched this at least 10 times and still it ranks up there as one of the best of its kind.",9,0,1,15 July 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Better than Episode 1 but lags behind the rest.
","It has its moments with humor and special effects are still amazing.  But you still have a script that has more to be desired.  You still see Jar Jar Binks but his screen time is significantly cut down, THANK GOD!!!  But also you have to sit through about 2 hours of slow stuff just to see Yoda kick some butt, which is definitely the best part of the film.  Save time and rent the film so you can just fast forward it to that scene, the rest is like the Jake LLoyd acting school took over.",5,0,0,12 July 2002
Spider-Man," well done all around
","The only thing that was prehaps missing from the movie was the Ramones cover of the theme song Spiderman but, all cast and crew delivered a great movie. Prehaps one of the best adaptations to date.Tobey Maguire, Kristen Dunst, Willem Dafoe all deliver and Sam Raimi makes the movie work to perfection.",9,0,0,12 July 2002
The Usual Suspects," Modern Crime drama
","Excellent movie, good acting, and a well told story.  Kevin Spacey won for best supporting actor and deserved it.  Well done crime drama with some twists and turns.  Eventhough you kind of figure it out 2/3rds of the way through it is quite fun watching the drama unfold.  This is one to watch again.",9,0,1,15 July 2002
Men in Black II," Better than I would have thought
","Definitely Frank the pug steals the show in this sequel to the 1997 blockbuster.  Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith go back and forth and they are supported by a good cast and fun.  Mind you no one in the movie will get a best actor nod and the story is fine but it is a fun picture.  Rosario Dawson is cute, but who can out play Frank the pug, nobody!!!",7,0,0,12 July 2002
Vanilla Sky," makes me want to jump off something.
","Ok Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, hmm what can I say to be fair.  Ok the soundtrack was weird the plotline was interesting the screen play was jumpy. The only way this movie could be better seriously is if David Hasselhoff played the lead.  Then when one goes in thinks the movie is trash they don't walk away disappointed.  This movie had about 10 seconds of decency when Penelope Cruz was topless but other than that it isn't worth the rental. Ed Wood movies had more of a story and better acting at times.  What a waste of a good cast.",2,1,2,12 July 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," still good after years but not for its script
",Back in 1977 it was prehaps the best of its genre and still betters the newer prequels but seeing it again for its acting you realize how poor a script Lucas has.  Special effects are amazing and worth the view if that is your thing.,6,1,8,12 July 2002
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The best of the whole trilogy
",Darth Vader beats Luke and everything seems to work for the Empire in its quest to destroy the rebels.  Prehaps the best of the whole trilogy. Definitely worth the praise.  Special effects are amazing and even the script works.  Yoda jedi master is introduced and the puppet is the most endearing character in the whole trilogy.,8,0,0,12 July 2002
