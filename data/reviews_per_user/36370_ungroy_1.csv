The Equalizer," Excited and then let down
",I was anticipating a really good action movie with Denzel Washington but was disappointed. The movie took its time getting started. I liked that it developed the characters but it took too long to get there. The language was over the top. Too many f this and f that. If you are offended by the word then do not watch this movie. The action scenes were engaging but were stuck between Matrix/Bourne Identity and a Stephen Segal wannabe. I like Denzel's movies but this one could be his worst.If you have watched the original TV series then you will get it in the last 30 seconds of the movie.Do not waste you time on this one unless you completely board and have finished that novel you have been planing to write.,3,1,5,2 January 2015
