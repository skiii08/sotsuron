Walk the Line," An Academy Award Winning Movie!
","Walk The Line is a story about the life of the famous singer Johnny Cash. Joaquin Phoenix stars as Johnny Cash, who sings, talks, looks, and even acts as if he actually was Johnny Cash! The cast also includes Reese Witherspoon, who has an amazing performance as the famous June Carter (Cash's wife). Walk The Line includes some of the most incredible acting skills I have ever seen! This dramatic tale will bring tears to your eyes with the terribly sad story of Johnny Cash! Walk The Line is also one of the most romantic films I have ever seen, with the love between Cash and June Carter! I think that this movie is a qualified academy award winner and deserves a great review!",10,0,0,26 February 2006
Coach Carter," A Chead Imitation Of A Sports Movie!
","Coach Carter is one of the worst movies of 2005! The Theatrical Trailer made it look like a great movie about college basketball, when it really was a cheap imitation of one! All it is, is just a movie about college basketball players and their dirty lives! For example, after winning the victory, the players went to a party with girls they had never met in their lives, even though they had girlfriends back at home. Don't be fooled by this movie's great looks, and inspiring Starr's. Never judge a book by it's cover, in other words, never judge a movie by it's looks! If i were you, i wouldn't waste my time, and good money on a movie like this! This movie is like a scam on the internet! I think the director of this film doesn't know a thing about college basketball, but only college lives. Coach Carter is one of those movies that only teenagers would be expected to like.",1,1,12,26 February 2006
Cinderella Man," One Of The Greatest Films Of 2005!
","Cinderella Man shows the truth about the great depression and the effect on people's lives with the story of the amazing boxer James J. Braddock. James J. Braddock went from a good life, being well-paid, to a jobless, terrible and poor life in the great depression, and then to a well-paid boxing champ! James J. Braddock was with out a doubt the Cinderella Man, and that's what makes this movie so great! Cinderella Man also has one of the greatest casts of the year, with Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger, and Paul Giamatti. Russell Crowe's performance as James J. Braddock is amazing, and portrays James Braddock fantastically! Cinderella Man is definitely one of the greatest films of the year!",10,1,2,26 February 2006
