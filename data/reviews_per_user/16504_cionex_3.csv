Catch Me If You Can," Light, inoffensive, ultimately forgettable entertainment
","Really more of a place for set and costume designers to show off than much of a story.  Enlightening in terms of the amount of information available to people today in finance, and DiCaprio and Hanks have a reasonable screen chemistry.  The Jennifer Garner cameo's pretty weak, pointless, and forced, and by and large, this is a film you'll be seeing 8 million times on cable eight months from now.Nothing particularly noteworthy about the movie, and you'll forget the vast majority of it before you leave the theatre, and the rest a few hours later.",6,0,2,5 January 2003
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Kurosawa spins in his grave
","Myths put to rest by this 'film':1. Natalie Portman can act. 2. Low Expectations aren't enough to make people think a turd's a ciabatta. 3. George Lucas isn't distracted by family, wealth, and business. 4. The worst dialogue in history was written by Jack Chick. 5. The 'Top 250' on IMDb can't be excessively influenced by buffoons. 6. A lack of Jar Jar Binks automatically improves a film. 7. Suspension of disbelief is entirely the responsibility of the audience. 8. English actors help avoid the problem of stilted, hamhanded performances. 9. Actors can easily work in front of a blue screen and make it seem real.",1,199,363,23 May 2005
Signs," Ham-handed and forgettable
","After reading a few of the other comments here about _Signs_ being an intelligent film, I have to wonder if I was in the right theatre.  It was somewhat entertaining, but about as subtle as Allen Iverson's jewelry.  You get pummeled about the head and shoulders repeatedly with some of the most obvious foreshadowing ever to hit the screen, and the whole movie is pretty manipulative.If you love Wal-Mart, double-wides, and sport a mullet, this film may strike you as intelligent.  Otherwise, go in with reasonable expectations, and don't pay full price.  The acting was good, but the script and direction were extremely disappointing -- kind of like M. Night Shyamalan wants to sell Beanie Babies or Angel Figurines on QVC or something.",6,0,1,4 August 2002
