Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Shockingly Brilliant!
","After the 3rd movie, I was horrified at the thought of having *another* pirate movie! The 3rd one was far too difficult to understand, and I felt it was stretching the series too far. Reluctantly, I viewed the 4th one with the bar set very low.I've never been so thrilled to be so wrong! I'll cut about six paragraphs of gushing by just listing what I liked and disliked.Liked:1. Johnny Dep. Gotta say it, he was brilliant. His chemistry with Penelope Cruz was perfect and was flawless as Jack Sparrow. 2. The simpler plot line. The 2nd and 3rds' plot lines were so complicated it made the movie very difficult for me to understand. I had to watch them about forty times in order to get a vague thought of the general idea of the plot. 3. The fact they cut the old ideas and characters loose for the most part. They still had a few of the old jokes and the classic characters, but they didn't bring up the absence of some of the lesser characters like Orlando and Keira. 4. The fact that the missionary was shirtless for a good portion of the film. To say this film was with out eye candy was very untrue. Yum!Disliked:1. The slapstick stunts at times. There were several moments where I expected Jack to slip on a banana peel. 2. The apparent need to involve zombies in the plot. Really? They accomplished no necessary part in their roles. But that's me.Overall, I feel Pirates 4 was a significant improvement over the last few movies. I'm certainly putting it on my Christmas list!",Null,0,1,27 May 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Ehhhh...
","(I apologize for any misspellings of character names in advance.) I grew up with Harry and the gang. I spent my evenings waiting at the bookstore until Midnight, eagerly expecting the next book of the series. I wasn't disappointed. I cried at the end of the 7th book; I expected to do the same at the end of the 8th movie.I walked into the theater with 10 misty-eyed buddies, three boxes of Kleenex, and expectations high (I loved the 7th movie.) I walked out of the theater with 10 confused buddies, three unused boxes of Kleenex, and a feeling of slight disappointment.What went wrong??? The Good: Gringotts was flawless. Loved everything about it.Neville, Professor McGonagal, and Mrs. Weasely were awesome in every sense of the word. Their moments of epic earned well-deserving applause and standing ovations from the audience.Snape's death. I never react to movies, but I gasped and grabbed my friend when he was killed. Only time I got tearful through out the whole film. Perfection.Battle of Hogwarts. With a few exceptions (you'll read those later) it was well done.And now....the bad.Tonks and Lupin. Their whole 'we have a son' thing was really random and shoved in. How the heck did Harry know? He was traipsing around the countryside! Very confusing.Dumbledore. His back story, his acting...I'm sorry, the guy was terrible. Him and Harry was an awful moment for everyone, regardless if you read the books or not.Fred's death was way too underplayed. I don't know if they were shooting for the 'oh, he's just one amongst many' thing, but I was disappointed. You couldn't even tell it was Fred! It could've been Percy or Bill for all they showed!The Snape/Lily Montage. It was cute....for the first 10 minuets. Then I all I could think was 'Can we speed this along, please?' It was awkward and lengthy. I'm all for showing the soft underbelly of grouchy semi-evil Snape, but suddenly throwing a weeping, puppy dogged eyed Snape who moons after Lily for, like, ever, was a 3000 degree character turn-around and ruined his character for me. Too much, too fast.There were several other moments of 'Well, that was disappointing' or 'Whoa, that was amazing!', but those were the big ones.The bad moments were equaled out by the good....for the most part. The HP saga ended on a decent note, but it was not the tear-jerking awesomeness that I was expecting.",Null,7,11,16 July 2011
