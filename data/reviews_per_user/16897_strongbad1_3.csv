The Incredible Hulk," Marvel's 2 and 0 now..
","MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS Before i go into my review, i must comment on the hulk film that came before.Ang lee made a beautiful film, all the players involved were great. The desert battle was the highlight of that piece and the cinematography was beautiful. Ubfortuneatly An Lee made a movie with the hulk in it, not a hulk film The orgin was too complex and over drawn and the whole scientific approach to explain the hulk didn't really make sense. Plus the hulk looked more like a giant green man (although in some scenes he was pure hulk).Over all it wasn't the hulk i wanted to see.Now , The incredible hulk on the other hand IS a hulk film and a very good one at that . Right off the bat we are introduced to everyone to all the characters in the story ( with a nice nod to the TV series) . Gone is the 45 minute explanation of how Bruce is the hulk and we are thrown right into his life as he is desperately trying to rid himself of his ill tempered alter ego. We are also introduced to the hulk right at the beginning of the film ( which was one of my fav scenes i n the film) After the first hulk out, Bruce banner ( ed Norton) heads off to find Betty Ross ( played wonderfully by live Tyler) to try and find a cure his anger issues.The story moves at a great pace with little bits of humor thrown in the mix ( the purple pants bit was classic). The special effects are as promised a lot darker and this time out the hulk looks more like a real monster. Wilam hurt's general Ross and Tim Roth's Emil blonskey make great villains ( the later being the best of them). The inclusion of Samuel sterns provides a great setup for the inevitable sequel. Marvel got Right this for sure ....so what doesn't work? The final battle between Hulk and the abomination could have been a little longer. There were some scenes that moved a little too slow but these are just minor issues. Of course the part that made me smile the most was the delivery of the most famous words the hulk has ever spoken HILK SMASH! which comes in at good time .With iron man under their belt and the hulk being a great compliment, marvel is really getting their act together... all leading up to the moment we fans have been waiting for ( spoilers alert) AVENGERS ASSMEBLE! i almost forgot the last sense marvels man of iron steps in to delight us with the surprises to come en spoilers i gave this film an8 out of 10 , good job by everyone evolved HULK SMASH!",8,5,8,20 June 2008
Hellboy," a wonderful adaption
","Hellboy was a  cinematic wonder, a beautiful adaption of a very unknown comic series that worked to the fullest potential. Born in the flames of Hell, Hellboy was sent to earth to bring about the damnation of the world. However he was found and adopted by the good guys and brought in to work for the B.P.R.D(bereau for paranormal research and defense) I have so many favorite parts  in this movie thats it's so hard to pick just one. The settings were awesome the effects were unbelievable save for one. The story moved ahead wonderfully to keep everyone interested with out dumbing them down. Ron Pearlman IS hellboy, nobody else could have played that part no one, his performance was totally the character from the comic. Doug Jones did an awesome Abe Sapien ( voiced by David Hyde Pierce)and became my favorite character in the film. the story was so faithful to the comic that it's like watching it unfold on the screen. Blade 2 was good but Gdt really out did himself with this one.definitely 10/10",10,0,0,6 April 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," fantastic
","As the credits began to roll at the end of this film, i was left with a heartfelt sadness that this long journey was at last over. that there will be no more journey's for the beloved fellowship.This film really moved me like none of the other films i have seen this year or maybe ever, every thing from the story to the acting to the effects is justgrand. This movie brought me to tears and i don't really cry at movies. i can see why peter jackson liked this one the best.ROTK is such a great film that it goes way beyond impressive ( at least for me)bottom line is this is a landmark in epic film making.
