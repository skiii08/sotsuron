The Mask," Hero in a Mask? I
","The hero, stanley epcis, hope I spelled that right, is a banker. He is quite a cartoon fan with a dog, which I believe is the most adorable, bright creature I've ever seen. Then he met this woman and the story starts to run.Its basically it. But what made this a good view is its comical ways and I meant it to be both figuratively and literally. Jim Carrey takes up the figurative part. I think he is the best in this regard, for what I've seen so far in years, ever. The Literal part will be about the effects and animation and it is impressive. To make guns move so real but you know it doesn't spin like that in reality, and that is the amazing part, considering the time in its production.The ending, you will find it predictable but the story though important, not quite the only factor that makes this good. Though there is a sudden twist in it. The good was stupid and turned out bad and the beautiful and enemy turned out a trusted ally.The hoola, hoo, holla! was the best of my watch. The choreography with exaggerated movements we know Jim Carry carry out so well was superb. The coco bango, yah! Well, this isn't turning out to be a good, intelligent review. Let's resume then...The music and dance routines. There were many of them. Quite the jiggle and before you'd know it, a smile is painted in your lips and laugh out loud. It is super comical and unreal, and it's obvious this would never happen even if it was the common reaction of talking and walking, but it is part of the goodness of the movie.Obviously, I've enjoyed the movie, of re-watch and year 2015. But I can't say its humor would appeal to the people today. No need to say that this kind of things evolve along with everything else. Maybe, perhaps, but to my believe, more likely.",8,0,0,22 July 2015
Speed," Fast paced movie. Speed is adequately titled
","A lunatic is playing around with a bomb, and in the end, hoping to get something out of it. It is an exciting enough movie. Especially the antagonist. The bomber I mean.Oh how he reminds me of some bully in school. An old man that has the character of a bully. He laughs and jumps of excitement when a person burns to death. It is demented and disturbing. But I'm lead to believe that a good movie can be due to a good antagonist. Annoying and sociopath.There are shouting and dialogues though that are, to my understanding, stupid and childish. It seems it is its way to express excitement and action on the moment. Well, it doesn't work on today's age. We just don't go for that anymore. It is unreal and obvious. When asked the difference between the action movies in the 90s and 21st century, then that would be it.And hey. Did I said it is stupid. How? and Why? Couldn't he just do this and do that? Should have done this to avoid that. But even with this notice, I find the movie good enough for an hour and a half of my time.To sum it up, it is annoying yet enjoyable at 7/10.The hero is Reeves. He is a bomb expert. A hotshot as the terrorist defines. Full attention to his work. Has a blond friend and some shouting officer as a team. Together, they work and battle against the forces of a maniac, a sociopath, and a kid, trapped in a old man's body. During the fight'n the hero would meet somebody. Somebody to meet! the stunts, bombs blowing off as metal expands and go to waste is believable enough. The action and thrill is no doubt top notch. the jumping and catching, heart stopping. I just didn't like how it ended up like him doing that, or her staying there. It's just so unreal, no common sense. Stupid.Burp!",8,0,5,25 July 2015
