Minority Report," SPOILER Major GOOF A 2nd PotHole
","This is the 1st PotHole on IMDb: Plot holes: SPOILER: Anderton gains access to pre-cog using his own excised eyeball. As he was wanted and on the run, shouldn't his access have been canceled - or at least shouldn't the police have been alerted to his presence? This is the 2nd PotHole: Anderton's wife gains access to the jail using the same excised eyeball as above. How stupid are the police that after the first access, they STILL did not remove his access code. Ugh! Surely they had to scan his new eyes in jail, like taking fingerprints today, and found the problem. Duh! The movie would have been much better had it not been for the so very obvious errors. I should know, I am in law enforcement in the 21st century.",4,3,5,18 September 2006
