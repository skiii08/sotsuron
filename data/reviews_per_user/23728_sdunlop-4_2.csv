Sucker Punch," It's not bad!
","I just watched this at the cinema and had no expectations. The girls look well though, the costumes are worth a few points alone. Besides the eye candy, the movie is entertaining, the special effects are good and you find yourself not too bothered whether or not it makes any logical sense.I had no previous experience with the comic/graphic novel and I know this can influence some peoples perceptions of film adaptations.If you intend on watching this, just relax and don't question it too much, the action is good and I particularly enjoyed the soundtrack!Seven Stars.",6,1,5,17 April 2011
Limitless," Entertaining...but not without gaps in the plot.
","My girlfriend and I watched this last night, and we agreed that it was entertaining. This is one of those films that to enjoy you kind of have to just 'go with it' and not scrutinise it too heavily.Bradley Cooper is easy to watch, and a likable character, he plays a failing writer who changes his life after ingesting a new wonder drug.Robert De Niro takes a back seat with his role, and is fine but is not going to amaze anyone anytime soon I don't think, but in his defence he is an acting legend and can do what he likes!There are several aspects of this film which do bug me however, i'll mention just one:The main character murders a lady in a hotel room, manages to get away with it and there is nothing more said, and he returns to being the nice guy again! Either include this aspect of the story and deal with it properly or take it out would be my opinion.Others include the vague description of the drug and the idea that although everyone else who takes it eventually dies or becomes a shadow of their former self, Eddie Morra just has one bad hangover and then continues being the well polished super intelligent charmer, forever!But besides these and other discrepancies I mostly enjoyed the movie. The action scenes are good and the direction keeps you interested, and who can stay mad at that smile?Watch it but leave your thinking cap at home!6.5/10",6,0,1,17 April 2011
