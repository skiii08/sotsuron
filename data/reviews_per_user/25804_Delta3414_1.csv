United 93," It was done right
","Opening day I was United 93 the theater was packed. Never in my life have I gone to a movie where you could hear a pin drop. That's how quite it was. The movie itself (I don't want to go into details about the film because we all remember that day) was... there are no words to describe this film, just plain 'it was great' doesn't do it justice. Director Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy and Bloody Sunday) did just an amazing job with every detail of this movie. Any of you that have seen The Bourne Supremacy know about how Greengrass uses hand-held cameras. Giving you the feel that your right there watching what it taken place at the time. It is no different in United 93. My girlfriend commented that to her it felt like someone had a regular camera on board 93 and that is what we were watching that's how real it felt being in that theater. Right now I still cannot find the words to describe United 93. I guess to give anyone reading this somewhat of an idea... at the end of the film right before the credits started everyone was either just completely silent or crying, when we all started to get up out of our seats no one was talking, no one talked until they left the theater. Yes it is a very powerful and moving film, I'm still in awe. Hollywood got this one right.",10,15,33,28 April 2006
