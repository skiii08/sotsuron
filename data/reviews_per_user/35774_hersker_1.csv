Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Boring and silly
","Am I the only one who found this boring? Vol. 1 was mostly a big disappointment for me, but the over-the-top fight scenes and some of the comments sort of made up for it. I like all Tarantino's other movies, but I just don't understand what the big deal was about this. Vol. 2 had no really engaging fight scenes, and everything they do in the movie seems unintentionally silly (the bride's old trainer for one thing). There is no real humor and throughout the movie I just wanted them to get it over with. A lot is probably meant to be satirical, but it is hard to spot due to the graphic violence, which makes everything seem real. The only part of the movie that gave the feeling of coolness was the comment about Michael Madsen's character's hat. In such a long movie, this just isn't enough.",Null,1,3,4 June 2004
