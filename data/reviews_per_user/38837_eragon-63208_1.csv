The King's Speech," The King's Speech
","First off let me say I was Moved to tears by this film, I had no idea that King George the Sixth had a Speech Impediment. this film is British History personified and exemplified and Expounded on upon, this is an educational experience, for mind,s young and old alike Except for brief periods of profanity I see nothing that a child as young as 15 could not grasp, I found this film to be an excellent way to pass two hours, it is also a look in the the early life of Queen Elizabeth. I would put my personal seal of approval on this masterpiece of Movie making excellence. this had an all star cast Michael Gambon as King George the Fifth Colin Firth as King George the Sixth and Geoffrey Rush as his Speech therapist this is an All star Cast Michael Gambon you might know this name aka ( Professor Albus Dumbledore) from the Harry Potter Film Franchise.
