The Devil's Advocate," Deeply philosophical and gives something to think about
","MINOR SPOILERSThe Devil's Advocate probes deep into the human mind and shows that we are all corrupt in some way, that no matter how hard we try to do right we cannot escape from some form of 'evil'.  The last scene of the movie, without which the film would not be nearly as good, makes this point by showing that even if Kevin escapes the temptation to win the case by turning away from his guilty client, he still gives in to vanity when he agrees to have his story written.  The devil can get to Kevin any way he wants; he just has to appeal to his self-love and vanity.The film is unique and powerful.  I especially liked the scene in which Al Pacino talks about how God is a sadist while the Devil nurtures every human emotion and never condemns people.  You don't have to be anti-God or a devil worshiper to understand the point that he is making, and it is very interesting and philosophical.I really enjoyed the film and highly recommend it.  It's not only entertaining and suspenseful but makes the interesting point that we are all susceptible to corruption.",Null,0,1,27 July 2001
