Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," effects orgy, entertainment starved
","Considering that George Lucas has not directed a feature in 22 years, it's not surprising that while, SWTPM, has its share (more than its share) of effects, it's very short on plot or acting.  Most of the actors looked confused and more wooden than the robots they communicate with.  (Samuel L. Jackson looks to be in the wrong movie entirely.)  It's a shame that someone with the vision of Lucas has so little ability to see that vision come to life.  In two or three years, the film will be completely forgotten.  In fact, during the screening I saw in Hollywood, the audience pretty much went to sleep after their initial excitement at the first twenty minutes or so. The loudest reaction was for C3PO and R2D2. Truly a disappointment and not a very worthy sequel to such a film as 'The Empire Strikes Back', which was really a breathtaking film.",1,1,3,30 November 1999
Match Point," Woody, go a different direction, like Manhattan.
","I'd read some good reviews for Allen's new film and even seen a few friends who mildly suggested it. I was not prepared for the flat, slow, boring, by the numbers script, that Allen lays out in Match Point.It's as if a guy suddenly decided one day to write a show about 'rich people', but had never met one outside of a drawing room comedy. Allen simply has no interest in a film noir or erotic thriller or whatever you wish to call this trifle. The lighting is never moody, on the other hand, it's bright and sharply lit. The tension is certainly lacking in the acting. It all seems to be happening on a bad, old TV show. Wow are some people jumping up and down about the film? I think maybe the fact that Allen tells a story, albeit a very structured, limp one that he has no feeling for. It remeinds me of Kubrick's last film, Eyes Wide Shut. Kubrick couldn't or wouldn't shoot in NY, so he just built in the UK. Allen goes to the UK, but he might as well have stayed in NY. It's a crazy movie. The audience is always nine steps ahead of the doddering characters. What exactly is Brian Cox playing? He got rich by constantly giving away his money and having zero ability to gauge character? It's like a character in an earlier, funnier Allen film, suddenly forced to play it straight. In fact, the whole movie is like that, and wow, what a letdown that is.Allen was once one of the funniest men to ever make a movie. Now, like so many other directors, he's just plodding along, making dopey cardboard ones.",1,24,39,30 January 2006
