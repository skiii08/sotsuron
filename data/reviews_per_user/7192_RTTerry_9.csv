Skyfall," Old-school Bond - Welcome back!
","Briefly - This one will take you back to the time when the good Bond movies were based on a relatively simple plot, great villains, pretty girls and the focus stayed on getting rid of the bad guy at all cost.Don't buy into these nay-sayers claiming the plot doesn't make sense or that the movie abandons ideas before they fully develop - nonsense! The only reason they are saying that is because they are too ignorant to figure things out on their own.If you want to enjoy a Bond movie where 007 is not some Super-Spy-World-Is-At-An-End heroic figure, but instead is brought into play because the villain needs to die - this one is for you.I enjoyed the gritty edge to this one and a plot that stays the course, with the usual mix of a few fantastic chase/fight scenes and some good twists to keep you sharp. Keep makin' 'em like this one and I'll keep comin' back for more!",10,4,15,9 November 2012
Gravity," Fast moving & fun!!!!!!!!!!
","Well worth it!Do not be swayed by those who claim 'this would never happen'. This isn't a movie based on a true story, nor is it a NASA documentary, or a premonition of something to come–it is entertainment, and to that degree, a top notch motion picture! The editing, visual displays and acting are unforgettable and should not be missed, particularly in IMAX if possible. You come out of this movie before you can truly catch your breath – the fast pace and stunning images will mesmerize you and I pray a great many directors and studios follow suit. Set the camera and let the story tell itself–wonderful!Oh yes, back to my opening, for those who claim all of this is impossible–next time do YOUR homework, because Alfonso Cuaron DID his research and recent interviews with NASA have verified elements of the movie could, or have happened. The odds are greatly against all of this happening in conjunction with one another, but bear in mind we are talking entertainment here. Ham radios CAN be heard in space and the stations are equipped with them just for emergency purposes. Space debris CAN and DO hit objects, it doesn't happen often, but it does. YES, there are operational manuals on the stations and, if can translate them, you can control other crafts. You CAN access modules and crafts from the outside, it has to be set up right, but it can be done. YES, astronauts have communicated with Huston 'in the blind' and are taught to do so when they do not receive responses. Now granted this movie happened to throw all the intangibles into a huge crock pot and the story is fascinating to the point we aren't expected to believe it could be duplicated during real missions, but WOW, what a ride and how thrilling it was to be a part of it!!!",10,4,6,10 October 2013
BlacKkKlansman," Why this bombed at the box office
","There's good reasons this bombed at the box office - it's far too political and full of race baiting innuendos. Save your money. Too much fiction was added to the real story to try and boost the racial-appeal, which is a primary reason racism exists. Spike Lee wasted a good story for getting his blah-blah-blah political message out.",2,11,25,6 December 2018
The Book Thief," Wonderful!
","Wonderful! I never read the book, therefore I had no expectations which needed to be satisfied from this movie, so whether or not it lives up to the printed version doesn't matter to me – from that perspective this is a WONDERFUL movie! I wish they made more movies like this, where the violence doesn't have to be graphic and realistic, or the language becomes embarrassing, even though dealing with such a humanistic and horrific situation as WWII. It seems you can no longer take your kids or grandkids to movies that simply tell historic stories, without the screen flashing nudity, violence and rough language to give it 'real' feel.It was absolutely refreshing to experience this story from the child's point of view, and to have the narration done by DEATH - that added to the flavor of the movie and made it easy to follow. It also takes adults back to our youth, when we can remember going along or doing things simply because the adults were doing it. The acting is wonderful and the story is priceless.On a side note, I read a review by a critic that gave The Book Thief a poor rating, indicating that if you want to see a war movie done like Disney would do it, this one would be perfect for you. I think that was the critic's problem, this isn't a war movie; it's a story of coming of age and dealing with challenging issues when you are growing up, which happened to occur around Stuttgart, Germany during WWII. There are plenty of war movies you can't take younger audiences to that are already out there, this was a welcome relief.Do not miss this movie!",9,4,9,12 December 2013
Dunkirk," Poorly done
","At no time during this movie do you ever feel the connection between what is happening on-screen, to the terrors and reality of what actual occurred at Dunkirk. This is nothing more than a handful of rather boring sub-stories, tossed into a poor setting, which is supposed to represent one of WWII's worst events for the allies of France.It's as if the historical episode of Dunkirk only involved a handful of boats and ships, a few airplanes, and a couple hundred British troops standing on the beach. Not even the town of Dunkirk is portrayed as being in a state of peril - other than a few columns of black smoke and some homes missing some windows and doors.An awful attempt at making you 'feel' the reality of war. It's is nothing more than a daytime soap opera, played out on the water and beech. BORING!",2,1,6,13 May 2018
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," A fairly decent movie, but not The Hobbit you may have read...
","I will do my best to keep this review short, like the story Tolkien created, NOT like Peter Jackson is doing by making this into a trilogy.I will start by telling you that all the special effects and CGI magic works well for visualizing an adventure story. The settings, the costumes, the filming, yes it all works well and looks marvelous! For that reason alone, and the wonderful soundtrack, Hollywood will love this movie. But... I came to the theater to see The Hobbit, and this is not how I remember the book to be. This is a drawn-out, over done attempt to milk the viewers for 6 plus hours and a lot of money, for a story that can easily be told in 2.5 hours.The Hobbit is a very simple story, if you bother to read the book. It tells about a brave little creature teaming up with a band of hard-nosed dwarfs, who head out to fight a dragon.Peter Jackson has taken way too many liberties with the film by adding elements which were not a part of the book, and by dragging everything to the extreme just to lengthen his movie(s). He is trying to make this into another LOTR, which was not Tolkien's intention, and why Tolkien wrote The Hobbit first - THEN went on to write LOTR. A prime example of this is the first 40 minutes of the movie, which was covered in the book by just a dozen pages! Go see the movie to whet your appetite for some spectacular scenery and action sequences, but please do not think that these characters and the storyline were as they appeared in the book. I urge you to read the story if you haven't already, so you can understand how the focus was on a timid little character who managed to survive perilous situations. It seems that Jackson is more intent on making EVERYONE a hero, a fighting master, a focal point and portraying them ALL as main elements to the story.",7,10,19,28 December 2012
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Quentin Tarantino's worst movie thus far.
","80% of this movie is yet another dig into the slams and jabs of what goes wrong and right for actors in the process of their careers. The problem with that - the Cohen Brothers did a much better job of that in the movie Hail Cesar. The remaining 20% takes a tongue-in-cheek-look at Sharron Tate and Charles Manson's 'Family'.What's the matter with Quentin, did he suddenly go pussy on us in the telling of this story? What the hell is this all about? He wants you to somehow feel good about allowing Sharon Tate to live at the end? What a waste of two hours and forty minutes. There is no 'grit' in this movie. There is no 'street hard' dialogue to cling to. There are no original characters in this, save for Cliff Booth. Unfortunately, Cliff is just a sub plot in the whole scheme, and just played as a resurrected Lt. Aldo Raine character. Let's get to the rat-killing (the only gritty scene in the movie).What went right?
Mike Moh nails Bruce Lee! Mike's voice and portrayal of Bruce Lee is better than any other on film. Leonardo DiCaprio (the main focus) is very good as the struggling-actor role, but totally unnecessary as a plot for the movie. The character Rick Dalton doesn't add anything to the story, other than Leonardo acted well doing it. Brad Pitt's Cliff Booth is the only character you really care about, though we've seen this Pitt character before (see below). The 10-minute scene at the Spahn Ranch, which has Cliff Booth pitting (pun intended) wits against the Manson Family. The Spahn Ranch scene is heads and tails the ONLY nail-biting scene in the movie. A few decent cameos (particularly Al Pacino & Kurt Russell), but you quickly forget about them once they're off-screen. Could've done this movie in 1:10, just to ensure you included some of the better BS scenes, and to toss in the few worthy cameos. Nice old cars. A decent cigarette ad during the credits - though even that was too long, as Tarantino should've left out the whole complaint afterwards, by Rick Dalton (just another hint that Quentin is getting pussy on us and doesn't want to 'promote' smoking, even though he fills his films with more tobacco then you can harvest in all of Cuba!)What went wrong?
Boring. Twenty seconds of a worthy eyebrow raise - followed by twenty minutes of crap. It's an hour and a half too long. Brad Pitt is just playing Lt. Aldo Raine once again, with the same mannerisms, voice inflections and sarcastic glances. The scenes involving Damian Lewis as Steve McQueen and Rafal Zawierucha as Roman Polanski, leave you scratching your head with a bewildered 'what the hell did we see that for?' Ten minutes of a party scene at the Playboy Mansion - huh - why??? You never care about Margot Robbie's depiction of Sharron Tate, because we all know what happens to her in real life. Let's also not forget that Sharron Tate was never an A-list actress. If not for getting killed in the crime of the century, it's doubtful she'd ever be remembered. As a matter of fact, the whole Tate-Murder-Influence in this picture was worthless and an utter waste of film (save the afore mentioned scene at the Spahn Ranch). Unfortunately, Quentin's true-life youthful crush on Sharron Tate, dominates this movie. Take all of Sharron Tate's influence on this movie, and you end up with something much more appealing and Tarantino-esque. If you want to tell the Tate murder - tell the Tate murder, which is what we were all waiting for. If you want to remake Hail Cesar, you get a worthy-effort nod, but adding in the Tate-Manson angle, just sank this film.Go back to re-making movies Quentin, your latest 'original' stuff, sucks.",4,21,34,5 August 2019
Zero Dark Thirty," Tremendous – gripping and thrilling!
","Short-n-sweet because this movie  was AWESOME, and I don't want to ruin anything for you!!!!! Kudos to any movie that does not Hollywood-ize a true topic – ZDT does exactly that and perhaps better than any other true-life story made to date.Do not get caught up in some of these reviews that claim 'torture scenes' will turn your stomach, or that the first part of the movie is slow and boring – I found the first hour of this movie to be extremely well done and absolutely necessary to establish what the CIA went through to find OBL.There are many scenes in this movie that will leave you on the edge of your seat and startle you, but do not expect to see over-the-top writing or easy-n-cheap one-liners that most directors would have thrown in the movie to draw attention to themselves – again, this is NOT a pro-Hollywood movie. Which is probably why Kathryn Bigelow was sniped of any Oscar best-director possibility.The depiction of the raid which kills OBL is one of the best/realistic scenes every filmed. I was very pleased with the length of this film and the attention to detail. Despite some reviewers who claim human sentiment is missing or that the characters are shallow – don't believe a word of it. This entire film is overflowing with emotions and the story lines of these characters are spectacular – don't forget for a minute that these are CIA operatives, whose job it is to find and kill OBL.Well done Kathryn Bigelow, VERY well done!",10,18,36,20 January 2013
Saving Mr. Banks," An actor's movie
","A very well done docu/drama about the making of Mary Poppins.The movie has enough to entice you, make you smile and make you appreciate what goes into making movies from the perspective of the producer and story writer. The acting, sets and 60's period costumes are wonderful. Not a movie children will enjoy, or even understand, but worthy of adults who want to see something that is rather anti-climatic and lends itself quite well to the subject matter.A good portion of SMB provides us background details which prompted the writing of the books in the first place, while the other half focuses on the challenges and frustrations both the studio and Mrs. Travers endured when they tried to come to terms with the screen adaptation.Stick around for the credits to see the actual pictures and hear the tape recordings of the events.",7,2,5,22 December 2013
