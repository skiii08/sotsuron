The Blair Witch Project," Sorry, but did I miss something here?
","This wasn't half as frightening as it is made out to be and unfortunately I'm part of the brigade that believe it doesn't live up to the hype surrounding it. I suppose it was Ok for the money it cost, but to be honest I found the sixth sense more scary than this! To compare it with The Exorcist is risible! To be fair the people who I attended the cinema with were more impressed with it than me, so you can only conclude that it must hit a nerve with certain individuals. But sorry for me, I was left waiting throughout the film for the scary bits, and to be honest I found the final scene too unbelievable (ie. If I was wetting myself, I wouldn't be running round with a camera still trying to film!) Glad some of you found it scary, but The Blairwitch project just didn't quite do it for me.",Null,0,1,10 January 2000
Monty Python's Life of Brian," The funniest film of all time
","I remember seeing this film as a seventeen year old when it first came out. There were christians picketing outside the cinema, which just added to the notoriety. I was eagerly awaiting this film and I wasn't disappointed. I don't think I'd ever laughed so much in my life and i don't think I ever will.This was the Monty Python team's masterpiece. Now, understandably as aging men they continue seperately making tame comedies, but this cannot diminish the laughter they created when they were at their zenith.I too, am older, and the teenage rebellion seem a long time ago. But whenever I watch this film, it still raises a chuckle, not quite like the raucous laughter it induced when I first saw it, but enough to remind me of why I found it so funny. I have seen nothing approaching it, in terms of comedy in the ensuing twenty years.It may not be as fresh and innovative as it was in '79, but if you still haven't seen it, you may still be able to detect why we laughed so much and why so many people commenting here regard it as the funniest movie ever made.",Null,0,2,17 May 2000
Unbreakable," Drags a bit but has a good ending
","This film drags in some ways and reminds me of the general ennui one associates with a french arthouse movie. It's definitely an original story, but the sub-plot about his marital difficulties is unnecessary. Also the focus on his relationship with his son is wishy-washy and I wasn't impressed by the scene where he threatens to shoot his father to test his powers - too melodramatic.Samuel Jackson is excellent as the ultimately twisted Elijah, but Bruce Willis trying to convey sadness is slightly irksome and super-heroes are generally not bald if we're sticking to comic book depictions.A bit of a rip-off of the Dead Zone in some ways and influenced by Usual suspects, but ultimately, worth watching if only for the unpredictable twist at the end. Just expect a little bit of restless wriggling in the seat early on.",Null,0,0,2 February 2001
Fight Club," Despite the hype, I found this film disappointing.
","I'd heard a lot about this film being the movie of the decade etc. so when I eventually got to see it I was left wondering what all the fuss was about. The film starts off by making a fair point about males being demasculated with all the political correctness going on, but to insinuate that what the inhibited millennium man really wants to do is knock f**k out of each other, doesn't wash with me, and what was a good basic premise, turns into cartoon violence.Although, the cinematography was excellent and the performances outstanding, I felt that the basic message of the film was naff and that the violence, instead of making a point, was second-rate Jaackie Chan/Jean-Claude Van Damme and would ultimately appeal to that audience. Maybe I missed something, but I left the cinema with a sour taste in my mouth and the disappointment that this wasn't the film I'd been led to believe it was.",Null,0,1,9 January 2000
This Is the End," Just another dumb Hollywood 'comedy' starring a load of jerks
","It's not often I disagree with James Berardinelli at reel-views. In fact, I watched this film as he had given it three stars and said it was as funny as The Hangover, which is one of the few Hollywood comedies I have enjoyed in recent years. Unfortunately, I have to disagree with him on this one. I found it irritating rather than humorous and the self-indulgent actors performances were not convincing. Probably a good idea when they were high on some night out, but in reality it just turned out to be another sub-standard Hollywood comedy that insults the intelligence of any one of discerning taste. Very disappointing.",2,1,3,1 August 2017
Bloody Sunday," an authentic-looking recreation of events.
","Shot in a hand-held documentary style, this conveyed the feelings of anger on the one hand and indifference on the other that lead to the killing of 13 people.It is clear why so many turned to the IRA after the tragedy of this event and perhaps puts some of the terrorism of the ensuing years into context. That is not to say that perhaps there were some omissions. I thought it didn't quite convey the fear the soldiers felt that might have caused them to fire, it is assumed that they did so with little provocation. Maybe this was true. On the whole it does tend to cast them as heartless b***ards intent on zero tolerance and they were one dimensional compared to the Irish characters. It is never really clear why they pulled the triggers.However, it is plain to see that this event set the tone for the remainder of the decade and hopefully a similar massacre will never be purpotrated by the British army, especially on people with whom we share this group of islands.On whether another film made to redress the balance on events in places such as Enniskillen, Omagh and Brighton should be produced, I'm not sure. It probably wouldn't achieve anything.Hopefully, we've moved on from all this and the peace process is irreversible. It was interesting to see Gerry Adams and Martin McGuiness walking into Westminster today. This is where this issue on the partition of Ireland will finally be solved and not by the bullet and the bomb.",Null,6,10,21 January 2002
Billy Elliot," Ken Loach meets Busby berkley
","Sorry, but I don't understand the rave reviews. Despite the fine performances, this is a run-of-the-mill 'it's grim up north, but you can reach for the stars if you want to.'As soon as Billy enters the ballet class it becomes predictable. The dialogue is your standard ' I'm a macho Northerner, I hate coppers and swear a lot'When is somebody going to make an original film about Northern folk? I wait in hope",Null,0,0,29 September 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Tim Burton in his usual good form.
","The team of Jonnny Depp and Tim Burton come up trumps again. I can't think of another director who could have carried this off as well and what could have been just another revamped children's story from the Hollywood production line was turned into a gothic fantasy that managed to keep me interested from start to finish. The village and the wood were straight out of a storybook and even the graphic violence ie the heads being lopped off was done in a humorous manner, that Burton specialises in.I don't think it's a classic like Edward Scissorhands or Ed Wood, but it matches them im style and cinematography. One or two criticisms could be made, but it's not really worth carping and the film turns out to be a thoroughly enjoyable two hours, which is a welcome relief after the over-hyped films coming out of America, which have proved to be disappointing ie. Fight Club and Blairwitch Project. If your a Tim Burton fan this is a must-see.",Null,0,0,16 January 2000
The Beach," A modern parable, well told
","I had to force myself to go and see the film after reading all the bad reviews like 'it wasn't as good as the book', 'Boyle doesn't live up to his Trainspotting potential' etc. But I was pleasantly surprised.This is actually a good film. it depicts what it is like out there, as anyone who has travelled through South-East Asia would have noticed. What did make me laugh was the way it depicted the thai resorts as new Sodom and gomorrahs. I did find this kind of snobbery out there and Di Caprio and his friends captured the so-called 'real travellers' well. Searching for paradise and scorning anybody who goes the well trodden trail, but ending up their own arses and creating their own hell. Give me a beach party on Koh pang gan and a few months sharing the same life as Di Caprio and cohorts I'm not sure which I'd choose. The leader seemed a nightmare, Thatcher in a bikini, and she is the type of person I left England to escape from!!!It was a very true depiction of what eventually happens in so called paradisical communities. Eventually the idiosynchrasies surface and groups self destruct due to personalities clashing. It doesn't matter if it's on a beach in Thailand or downtown London. paradise is not a place it's a state of mind!One thing I think the film lacked is the way it only touched on the drug culture that goes on out there. I would have liked to have seen a few scenes on how much a part of the illusion is enhanced by the mushrooms. Which I can tell you are something else! I'm certain they influenced Alex garland who wrote the book. The film totally avoided the in-your-face sex-culture out there. But I suppose that's another film.All in all, a beautifully filmed, well acted parable, that could have gone further, but was enough to satisfy. it certainly made me feel like dropping out and going on my travels again. Only this time I wouldn't waste my energy searching out Utopia. Basically, you have to accept that Thailand is commercialised, and will be more so after this film, just enjoy the beauty that is there and try not to be so cynical about the blatant exploitation of the tourist industry. Maybe Alex garland should have gone to Papua New Guinea!",Null,0,0,30 March 2000
Man on the Moon," It grew on me
","I never really watched taxi and if no one had made this film I probably would never heard of Andy Kaufman, apart from the line in the REM song. At first I found him irritating, but as the story went on and his stunts became more bizarre, I realised he wasn't your stereotypical comedian looking for acceptance but a performing artist who wanted to provoke a reaction, not just laughter, although he certainly amused himself and his cohorts.Perhaps it's a good thing he died young as I can't see him ever making it as a big hollywood star and he might have faded into obscurity, but you never know, he might have been as big as Robin Williams or Bill Murray - I doubt it though.The film is an interesting biopic of an artist, but no more. Jim Carrey makes the film and I particularly liked the ending. Worth seeing",Null,0,0,8 May 2000
Toy Story 2," The last great work of art of the twentieth century!
","Toy Story 2 is everything that you've heard it is. The finest animation, entertaining and better than the original. beneath the corporate philosophy of Disney there is still an intrinsic desire to be innovative enough to transport everybody into a world of make believe. I think if Walt were alive today he couldn't be more pleased with the legacy he left and that his name still manages to attach itself to pieces of magic cinema such as Toy Story.Only a cynic could fail to derive pleasure from this marvellous spectacle that is a joy to watch from the opening credits to the closing out-takes. If you still have a bit of the lost child inside you go and see this movie right away. It is quite simply the most wondrous children's film since ET. I f you talk about works of art, i'll argue the toss with anybody that this is as fine as it gets....",Null,0,1,21 February 2000
The Shape of Water," Ignore the cynics, this is a beautiful, modern fairytale after all!
","Seeing all the negative reviews on here, I had avoided watching this film till now. However, I found it to be enchanting. A beautiful love story about outsiders with touching performances by the lead actors. It was beautifully shot and very atmospheric and left you with the feeling you had seen a classic film. Don't believe the critics, or at least find out for yourself. The best film of the year doesn't always win the Oscar but this one did. Although I approached it with trepidation, I'm now glad I finally watched it. Quite simply, it is one of the best films of the decade...",9,0,1,27 June 2020
Gladiator," Probably the last of the great Roman epics
","We've trodden this route before. Anyone familiar with the Kirk Douglases and Charlton Hestons of the world will recognise what this film is about. It was interesting to note the number of elderly people in the cinema, another indication that this film was a throwback to a bygone era.Having said that, it was visually stunning, the cinematography added another dimension to this genre. The battle scenes were vivid and exciting and the scenes in the colleseum kept me enthralled. Russell Crowe was a fitting choice for the part of Maximus and generally it was well cast apart from the irritating Lucius. Oliver Reed chose the perfect vehicle for his swansong and filmic epitaph.Despite enjoying it as a thrilling spectacular and not finding it long at over two and a half hours, at the end of the film I did have a certain sense of deja-vu. Apart from technological advances there was nothing new that would differentiate this film from the the Cecil B de Mille epics. Still, I ask myself is there anything wrong with turning out a good old-fashioned movie with all the tricks that entertained previous generations.However, there was something about it that left me pondering that as we are now in the year 2000, perhaps we demand a little bit more. Maybe we've spent too many years watching too many films to be surprised, and that's my biggest gripe - there was nothing surprising or unexpected about this film.Still perhaps I'm over complaining. I felt I got my moneys worth and would certainly recommend it to anyone who was unsure as whether to go or not. There is a lot to enjoy about this movie and I suppose if it happens to be on the box on a Good Friday in a few years time, I'll probably tune in again. So it's a thumbs up from me!",Null,0,0,16 May 2000
The Wizard of Oz," Still has that magic after all these years!
","This is the best children's film ever made. It's appeal grows as we look back on it with nostalgic eyes. Any kid, young or old who hasn't seen it has a treat to look forward to. It's been a standard for over sixty years and my guess is that children will still be getting pleasure from it in another sixty years time. Technology cannot erase the magic. And it will be dusted down for future generations, as long as we still need classics.",Null,0,1,8 May 2000
