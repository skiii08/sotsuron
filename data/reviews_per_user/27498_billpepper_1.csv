Requiem for a Dream," Really Good Movie
","This movie is really good. It is different from a lot of movies and is quite serious. It uses many interesting effects and angles. It involves drugs, sex, amputation, and dealers. The story basically follows and young adult, his friends and his moms lives. It shows how they started and how bad they get. The son has a girlfriend and a friend and shows how addicted they are to drugs and what they will do to get them. His girlfriend also goes to desperate measures. The mom ends up on drugs as well. I don't want to say anymore because that would ruin it. This is a movie which you can really get into and will hopefully thoroughly enjoy. It is slightly like the movie Spun. So go watch it.",10,0,1,1 December 2004
