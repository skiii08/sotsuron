It," Better than the original.
",I defiantly loved this movie. Better and more detailed than the original and the Pennywise was more creepier as well.,10,0,0,9 October 2019
It Chapter Two," A great movie.
",This is a good movie and what makes me laugh is that some people have said that it was more funny than scary. I dont think so. I mean really people if a supernatural clown came after you would you run or sit there and laugh like an idiot. Didnt think so.,10,1,5,9 October 2019
