The Blair Witch Project," Very Creepy
",I was fortunate in the fact I missed most of the hype about this movie. I heard it was scary and liked the premise so I went to see it. I wont say much about it that will give away the movie (although if you are reading this I am sure you know by now)but I liked it and liked the affect it had on me and several others who saw it. Its hard to describe how it did it but it really creeped me out and the final scene gave me chills the next day. I really liked the sound fx also. Its not a typical horror film which is a good thing. It seems that most of the people who really hated it are wannabe film makers and the reason for that is the simplicity of it. A lot of people could have made this movie as far as the cost/equipment goes. It was the idea and execution of it that made it work so well and that is talent.Hank,8,1,1,3 August 1999
