Catch Me If You Can," Mischievous movie
","I am a very mischievous person and I like to watch movies like that. Leonardo DeCaprio's character fools everyone. It's not all fun and games though, it has a really good plot with his family and the detective following him around. DeCaprio's character sort of reminded me of Johnny Depp's character on Pirates of the Caribbean. That is only because they both fool everyone to get what they want and it's funny to watch. If you liked Pirates of the Caribbean I would recommend this movie. Tom Hanks did another excellent job as the detective. They pulled together a great cast. I was really able to get sucked into this movie. That's how I judged that this is a great movie.",9,2,3,8 December 2005
