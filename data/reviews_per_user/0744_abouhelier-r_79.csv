The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1
","When Katniss destroys the games, she goes to district 13 after District 12 is destroyed. She meets President Coin who convinces her to be the symbol of rebellion, while trying to save Peeta from the Capitol.Producers are making money with the saga so why not split one book into two movies? Twilight did it, Harry Potter did it and The Hunger Games is doing it as well. I am not a huge fan of the first Hunger Games movie, but I loved Catching Fire. It was a very smooth and well directed movie by Francis Lawrence; who is taking over once again for MockingJay. At the end of Catching Fire you were literally burning to see Katniss and everyone go against the Capitol and kill them all. Actually I was pumped to see what will happen. Unfortunately, MockingJay Part 1 is just an extended trailer for Part 2, nothing interesting and relevant happen until the last 20 minutes of the movie. They are trying to stretch the events of one book into several movies but the thing is that even the tiny details are not that interesting and exciting to watch. This film deals with how you run a rebellion against an evil empire, giving endless political and motivational speeches, this on purpose to be filmed for propaganda. It's not enough to keep the viewers check in through the whole run time of the film. However, I liked the fact that this film takes The Hunger Games to another level as you have to think things through all this propaganda and point of views, the political intrigue is good. It approaches the story and The Hunger Games world from another angle, different from the first two movies. Nonetheless, the shaky cam is back from the first movie and there is not much action aside this trailer scene where Katniss is shooting an arrow to a jet. Jennifer Lawrence is obviously a fantastic actress and gives a great performance once again but coming back to the first movie I don't see how Katniss' character grows, matures and learns anything. She is the exact same character she was in the last one and the one before. Consequently you don't get to catch the interest of the viewers with a main character, this added to a movie where nothing really happen, the viewers are checked out pretty quickly. In fact, all the performances are very good, the drama is very well done but the characters who are actually interesting don't get to do anything beside sitting around, talking and give speeches. For instance there is a really tense scene in which Gale, starring Liam Hemsworth, explains how District 12 has been destroyed and how he could have done something more to help people to survive. This scene is also dealing with his relationship with Katniss, and you get to see that Gale's character is really deep and interesting but in reality you don't care about him that much. Finally, in the last 20 minutes of the film I was relieved to watch the proper movie beginning and building tension for the big finale, but then, it ends.Overall, MockingJay Part 1 is a well directed and good looking movie filled with potentially awesome things that never really reach the proper core of the film, nothing really mesmerising happen throughout the run time.",7,7,25,23 November 2014
The Monuments Men," Monuments Men Review
","Back behind the camera, American actor and ladies lover, G.Clooney, directs the unbelievable story of WWII platoon tasked to rescue art masterpieces from Nazi thieves and return them to their owners.It must have been hard to find a new angle, a new point of view in order to display an original and mostly unknown exciting story. It could appeared as a legacy of Frankenheimer film's The Train (1964) but it was at that time still more focused on the French Resistance. It seems to me that Monuments Men is in the same genre as famous films such as The Dirty Dozen, Kelly's Heroes, Von Ryan's Express, The Longest Day, A Bridge too Far or even The Great Escape. All those masterpieces were epic films gathering a bunch of famous Cinema figures with suspense and humour. The Ocean's saga directed by Soderbergh works quite on the same concept. Monuments Men is highlighting a part of the WWII history. However its most important strength is that this films is not an Historical/Arts lesson or a boring documentary on the period and people. It finds the appropriate ton and pace right from the beginning. A sort of comic and non- solemnly ton. Plus, each one of the characters, apart from the team is interesting. They have their own identity. This film is build around more than Arts and War, it's build around character's back stories and how each one of them affected and helped the film to grow. Finally the question behind it is: Can you risk your life for a piece of Art? The film answer is clearly YES! Personally, I don't think that I will find myself running into a house on fire in order to save a painting someday. (A family member...yes... or my dog.) Monuments men is peculiar of Clooney's way of directing, Capra's idealist heir, who systematically search hope and redemption in Human nature. Overall this film is engaging, entertaining and sentimental.",6,0,1,19 March 2014
The Equalizer," The Equalizer
","A man believes he has put his mysterious past behind him and has dedicated himself to beginning a new, quiet life. but when he meets a young prostitute under the control of ultra- violent Russian gangsters, he can't stand idly by - he has to help her. The Equalizer is directed by Antoine Fuqua and stars Denzel Washington. Direction of this movie was discussed for a long time. Indeed it had been told that Nicolas Winding Refn was first approach; which I can perfectly understand as there are some Refn' violent scenes brand throughout the film. I love Denzel Washington, he could make a movie about a man sitting on a toilet for the entire movie ant it would be a good thing to watch. However this film is a little bit more violent than just a man sitting on a toilet (more exciting as well) and Denzel Washington is the one thing that carries this movie along from the beginning to the end; and gives it the credibility it deserves. I really enjoyed the movie on the one hand because Denzel Washington sells every scenes he's in, he makes the over the top violent nature of this movie fun and more acceptable; and on the other hand thanks to Marton Csokas playing a pretty strong villain. Seeing them both interact is one of my favourite part of this movie. My favourite scene is in fact both of them having a pretty deep and serious conversation in a restaurant. This movie is violent, which can turn off some people. I have to admit that some violence may be over the top and unnecessary sometimes, as well as some side plots. For instance, Chloë Grace Moretz' character bring him back into this world and totally disappear for the whole movie. As an older bad ass character Denzel Washington is extremely compelling and endlessly watchable. But I was expecting to learn a little bit more about him though. I like roles like this, played by actors like him or Liam Neeson as well; they are good and smart, nothing about those guys is uncool. Finally, The Equalizer is totally aware of itself, there is no deeper meaning, no Oscars nomination pretending. This movie knows what it is, it knows what it wants to do and does it that's all.Overall The Equalizer is really entertaining. I loved it. The action is good, Denzel Washington is great, the villain is strong, but the story has some holes in it.",9,11,25,2 October 2014
If I Stay," If I Stay
","Life changes in an instant for young Mia Hall after a car accident puts her in a coma. During an out-of-body experience, she must decide whether to wake up and live a life far different than she had imagined or let go.If I Stay is directed by R.J Cutler and starring Chloë C. Moretz. This film is based on the best- selling novel written by Gayle Forman, novel that I did not read. The trailer depicted the movie as I thought it would be but the movie is actually really not like that at all. The film does have this 'out-of-body' experience happening throughout it but ultimately it's a container to tell the story of how she met her boyfriend in the first place and how they love each other and everything. They are cute, it's working as it's a teen drama story. It's a romance and it's what it is. Then they break up because they want different things out of life. What disappointed me the most is that the 'out-of-body' experience is very brief, it's not like mainly she's in the hospital and shows her back story. The movie shows her in the hospital way less that I thought. If I Stay tries to surf on the wave of a way better movie i-e The Fault in Our Stars . It's trying to cash in on the success of teen romance movie. The movie itself establishes that heaven is real, it's not questioning it or whether or not you believe in it; *SPOILER ALERT* at the end she refuses an eternity of happiness with her family in order to regain the love of this young eighteen years old musician that she loves. She's the main character, played by Chloë C. Moretz who was good in her role though, and we are supposed to want her to live happily ever after and fulfil her dreams. However at this point of the movie we DON'T, we want her to walk towards the light that's all. It's a big fail.Overall if you're a young teenage girl: THEY GOT YOU! They achieve to waste the potential of having a ghost in the movie by telling us a boring and easy love story.",5,6,12,23 September 2014
John Wick," John Wick
","An ex-hit-man comes out of retirement to track down the gangsters that took everything from him. John Wick is a new action movie starring Keanu Reeves, directed by David Leitch and Chad Stahelski. Since a little while I'm a huge fan of Keanu Reeves and I watched many of his interviews; he really seems to be a very cool and down to earth gentleman. I've heard and read many positive things about John Wick. It's one of the best action movie of the year and possibly Keanu Reeves' best performance since a long time. It doesn't arcane back to the 80's action movies ,actually it's an excellent 2014 action movie, no nostalgia required. Firstly, this film blew my mind and Keanu Reeves gives a lot of himself which is such a great thing to see. He is the perfect actor for the lead role. Everything he does is cool: driving, fighting, shooting and even speaking. All those things in general are what an action hero has to do in a good action movie. He is bad ass but also as he's retired for a certain time it makes him rusty enough to produce an interesting and tensional movie. Plus, John Wick is a slick looking movie, with fantastic action scenes and most importantly and surprisingly great dialogue scenes as well. The main villain of the movie starring Michael Nyqvist (Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol and Millennium) is absolutely terrific, Russians seems to always be the bad guys. In fact all the acting on this film is really good. I think it's actually Keanu Reeves' best film since The Matrix. Mainly because this film requires a lot of an actor, it's fantastic to see him properly doing the action scenes. He knows how to sell action; but I'm not only talking about physical work, he also has some very emotional scenes which involved a lot of anger and despair; he does a very great job with all of them. The screenplay is good, it's not only a revenge/ killing movie. There been a lot of action world creation, you learn a lot about these underworld war criminal. I completely understand why the hero goes on this bloody path. I have a dog. If anyone hurts my dog for any reason I'll do John Wick on them. Plus, the Club scene is the best scene of the whole movie, it reminds me of a club scene in Collateral which is crazy good action. However, the only flaw I could see in this film is the end; as my mum would say: the end seems a little bit forced up and a little bit put together really fast. That's it. Finally, John Wick also sets up ideas of sequel (not being forced like in The Maze Runner). You are able to see the character's evolution and the potential for a franchise along the movie. John Wick's the nicest guy ever just don't screw with him. Overall John Wick has incredible shoot out sequences, it's anon-stop action movie that actually has a clever script, a really awesome hero, a great villain (a few great villains actually). It does everything an action movie is supposed to do, it understands what its doing and does it extremely well. Go see this film!",10,8,21,30 October 2014
Fury," Fury
","April, 1945. As the Allies make their final push in the European Theatre, a battle-hardened army sergeant named Wardaddy commands a Sherman tank and her five-man crew on a deadly mission behind enemy lines. Out- numbered, out-gunned, and with a rookie soldier thrust into their platoon, Wardaddy and his men face overwhelming odds in their heroic attempts to strike at the heart of Nazi Germany. Fury is written and directed by David Heyre, stars Brad Pitt as the team leader, Logan Lerman, Shia Laboeuf, Michael Pena and Jen Bernthal. David Heyre is a very good director and writer but he has made some not so great movies in the past, I'm especially talking about Sabotage. This film displays another great Nazis killing performances by Brad Pitt, there's this uncompromising composure about him. Logan Lerman is fantastic; he delivers his best performance yet, far from Percy Jackson and way better than Perks of Being a Wallflower. Shia Laboeuf is great as well. You see, I don't really care about the press he had but as an actor he does a really good job in this film. He succeeds to prove that he is a good actor. Keep yourself out of the tabloids and I think you're on your path. Plus the director has been able to create a sort of camaraderie that make you want to root for these guys, they feel like family. Fury is a well-shot standard WWII movie with locked down, fluid pictures, an interesting story and very good action sequences. In fact the action the action is extremely realistic, it does not seem fake at all, this thanks to amazing sound effects. Plus tanks scenes are intense, you really feel like you're actually part of the crew inside it with them. This film grasps the concept that war is ugly, there's nothing heroic about it, there's no medals. This is war, it's all dirty and mainly no one wants to be there. Apparently sometimes to fight monsters you need ass holes. However, the movie doesn't have enough substance around his characters though and is a little bit overstepping his boundaries with religious messages sometimes. Overall Fury is very well directed and entertaining movie, with very good performances all around and most importantly that displays his point very well: war is ugly and violent. This is an effective war movie.",8,2,5,26 October 2014
The Maze Runner," The Maze Runner
","Thomas is deposited in a community of boys after his memory is erased, soon learning they're all trapped in a maze that will require him to join forces with fellow 'runners' for a shot at escape. Since all of us were hoping for yet another young adult novel to be adapted to the big screen, we have The Maze Runner. Apparently this is the new trend in Hollywood since Harry Potter and Twilight have exploded. This film film is directed by Wes Ball and stars Dylan O'Brien (Teen Wolf), Kaya Scodelario, Will Poulter and Thomas Brodie-Sangster among others. It's a pretty well directed movie with a very good lead performance by Dylan O'Brien, who is excellent. Will Poulter (We're the Millers) is also particularly good and his adversary relationship with O'brien's character ad something to the movie. The Maze sequences are very impressive and suspenseful. The creatures are good even if the cgi is not the best we've seen this year and a little obvious from time to time. I liked the tone of the movie as wherever you look 360° is just a big wall, a confine feeling is settling very quickly, a feeling that these guys are really cut off from the outside world. We don't know where they are. Who put them in this maze? Was it human? Was it Alien? Why? All you see is this field in the middle of the maze that's where I feel really isolated and I loved that because that's what you are supposed to feel like. As I said before there are few intense chase scene and in a movie called like this: I want to see that kind of things. That's what the movie delivers. However very quickly you kind of know where the movie is going though, it doesn't keep the intrigue alive too long and 'it's in the book!' as friends said to me is not an excuse. Because certain aspects are not working on the screen, keep in mind it's an adaptation. Plus the ending is once again a disappointment. I think I'm doomed to bad endings in young adult novels adaptation. It's one of those endings the more you are thinking about it on the way home the worst it gets. It completely deconstructed the whole movie and make it irrelevant in some way. It does not make sense because the movie does such a good job isolating you, it was all about the environment. This lead me, finally, to the obvious sequel announcement. It's so obvious that when a character said his line I actually laughed. There's going to be another one guys *winky face*. Overall The Maze Runner I liked the movie, it does look good, there are some really good running/chasing sequences, the main actors were very good but the end is a little bit disappointing.",7,0,2,17 October 2014
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Rogue One
","It takes a pair of Death Star-sized balls to release a Star Wars prequel at this point. Gareth Edwards, director of 2014's Godzilla, did it. He has this got-to-know curiosity that the most hard-core Star Wars fans have always had. And he rewards us with a thrilling adventure that's every bit as satisfying as The Force Awakens. The thing that has always made George Lucas' 'Galaxy Far Far Away' so unique is its richness. Every character, every planet, every plot line and technical spec seems to have been considered. It is a thoroughly imagined universe, full of tiny details and arcane backstories. There are no answerable questions just untold tales - and unmade movies. This first stand stand-alone chapter in the franchise is set just before the original Star Wars 'Episode IV: A New Hope'. Of course, that was our introduction - our gateway - to Lucas' world of Wookies, droids, rebel heroes and imperial villains. But the thing about that movie was, more you watched it, more questions it raised. How did Princess Leia come to possess the plans of the Death Star? Where did they come from? And that one tiny missing puzzle is the entire narrative of this new instalment. This is a whole new stable of characters operating on the fringes of the world we all know by heart. As in The Force Awakens, Rogue One screenwriter's centre on a female warrior, driven by destiny to take on the mightiest power in the galaxy. In fact, this film is ultimately Jyn's story, she is a fierce fighter, a rallying leader and the kind of role model any movie-going parent would want to expose their daughters and sons to. Felicity Jones plays this character with warmth and turns her into more than just a chest piece. She makes her human. Plus, alongside Jyn there is a droid named K-2SO, who is a more useful, resourceful and sarcastic than C-3PO. Beautifully designed and voiced with wit and exquisite timing by Alan Tudyk. He is the most useful of Jyn's cohort, as well as the most entertaining. However - and I can't believe that I am actually writing that - the film might lack a strong and charismatic male character (such as Han Solo or John Boyega's Finn) to balance and supply Jyn with a sparring partner. Though, the jaw-dropping resurrection of the late and singular British actor, Peter Cushing, who played the role of Grand Moff Tarkin, the Imperial leader first seen in 1977's original. Cushing, who died in 1994 at age 81, pops up here with matter-of-fact naturalness and complete credibility, playing the same character he did before with fresh dialogue. It is the art of CGI taken to new and perfected lengths and it has to be said that this actor dead now for more than 20 years, give a better performance than some other actors in the cast. More importantly, the Dark Lord of the Sith's appearance is more impactful than ever. Undoubtedly contributing a couple of entries to future Best Vader Moments lists and finally answering the question 'Who would choose to live in a fortress with a lava waterfall?'. Shot on a more spontaneous-feeling manner than his predecessors, it keeps the energy high and both the actors and the audience on their toes. Edwards builds up to a gigantic third act showdown. Moreover, Rogue One is loaded with allusions to other films in the franchise, without ever relying on them too much. It is fun, but the risk is to make it too elaborate and complex-to-the-point of confusing space opera, which will only appeal to the already converted. This film has undertaken extensive and very publicised reshooting and you can tell sometimes. Lastly, younger generation might be bored, confused, or both. But for the original generation of Star Wars fans who were not sure what to make of episodes one, two and three, Rogue One is the prequel they always wanted. Overall, Rogue One is a Star Wars film, yes. And it feels epic. But what it really is at its core is an Ocean's 11 in space. It perfectly connects events we already know by heart with ones we never even considered. Mix that with loads of actions, great effects, good comic relief and stunning locations, you get a perfectly entertaining movie.",8,10,20,17 December 2016
Passengers," Passengers
","Two passengers on a spaceship heading to a distant colony are woken up 90 years before they should be. Now they are stranded together but alone. They have to figure out a way to survive. That is the way the trailer makes it seem at least. And I will be honest, that is a movie I'd like to see. But that is not what you get. Actually, it is not even close. Chris Pratt character, Jim, wakes up Aurora. For the filmmakers it is a minor obstacle on the route to romance; for the audience, it's a deal-breaker. Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt have a spicy chemistry. They work well together as literal star-crossed lovers. The setting is unorthodox but the blossoming romance is entirely familiar. Though, Chris Pratt ultimately carries the whole movie. His character is far more interesting than hers, he has more layers than she has. Plus, Michael Sheen injects a welcome third perspective, laying bare their flaws.Passengers is not just short on surprises, it is also like a castaway love story set in the world largest and emptiest Apple Store in space. This movie has opportunities to be great, there are some scenes when I think they could have made something a lot more interesting and challenging than what they settled for. However, the CGI, and particularly a zero-gravity swimming pool sequence, is impressive. Believe it or not, there are more twists and turns half a movie left after all this, but none of it is very interesting either. Finally, the movie keeps jerking from tone to tone until you end up feeling like you are weightlessly drifting in zero-gravity. In fact, the film can't make up its mind if it wants to stick to Pratt's comic instincts or go someplace more serious or existential. Moreover, the Titanic parallels are left throughout sometimes in explicit nods as a cheesy space walk stands in for 'flying' on the prow; and elsewhere in the film's broader structure. Much like Cameron's nautical disaster, Passengers' early love story gives way to a latter disaster flick.Overall, Passengers is misleading at first sight and as surprisingly as it is undeniably effective. A timeless romance stranded in a space-age. A heartfelt tale of loss and love for the Gravity generation.",7,2,5,29 December 2016
The Danish Girl," The Danish Girl
","A fictitious love story loosely inspired by the lives of Danish artists Lili Elbe and Gerda Wegener. Lili and Gerda's marriage and work evolves as they navigate Lili's groundbreaking journey as a transgender pioneer. The Danish Girl is adapted from David Ebershoff's novel by Tom Hooper, retelling a true-life-story. The point about the film, of course, is that it has two Danish heroines and that one of them started life as a Danish boy. Well-meaning and polished as it is, this film is determinedly mainstream melodrama that doesn't really offer new perspectives in theme; in the year of Caitlin Jenner, it's a theme on which mainstream audiences are ready for more trenchant insight. In fact, some might have wished for a more adventurous approach to this moving story, particularly at a time when transgender representation has taken over from gay rights as the next equality frontier. If the movie remains safe, there's no questioning its integrity or the balance of porcelain vulnerability that Eddie Redmayne brings to the lead role. For an actor, there can be few more challenging roles than this, in which the nature of identity, performance and transformation are all wrapped up in the very DNA of the character itself. Redmayne gives an infinitely more intimate performance and far less technical than the already stunning character he played in The Theory of Everything, that so recently won him an Oscar. He's once again certain to reap plentiful laurels in this awards season; with another role about a slow process of physical and psychological transformation. Einar's dawning discovery of his inner woman is treated somewhat like a superhero origin story. Offering more light and shade this character becomes undeniably affecting. There's an understated emotional surge in seeing Lili go to work behind a chic department store perfume counter, radiating happiness at being a woman among other women and timidly studying sensual female body language in a Paris peepshow, is one of the film's most exquisite and indelible scenes. Here, Alicia Vikander sports the same archly knowing English accent as in Testament of Youth. Tom Hopper and writer Lucinda Dixon take a deeply conventional approach by framing their story as a portrait of a loving marriage with an awkward flaw. The cinematography sets up the exquisite visual tone at the start with a series of atmospheric, deeply painterly landscape shots. There are hints of a more interesting film. Overall, this film is an impeccably made period piece.",8,7,11,21 January 2016
Creed," Creed
","The former World Heavyweight Champion Rocky Balboa serves as a trainer and mentor to Adonis Johnson, the son of his late friend and former rival Apollo Creed. Don't be fooled by the title. For all intents and purposes Creed is Rocky 7. Some will even say that this emotional new film is the best instalment since 1976 original. Sylvester Stallone first Rocky was dark, a downbeat masterpiece that reflected a new era in Hollywood. Creed taps into that same gritty underdog authenticity. This film isn't only about boxing, but about these two men and mainly about this man who doesn't have a father and who really needs a positive male figure in his life. Characters are very well realised. Michael B. Jordan is looking every inch like a fighter, he brought a terrific sense of grit and realism. He obviously sold the physicality but also the emotional scenes in which his character breaks a little and reveals finally some of the things that is going on in his mind. Jordan has washed the terrible Fantastic Four off his career, let's be honest, he earned that from us. Rocky has always been essentially the same person, for better or worse. It's Stallone signature role, his baby, way different than Rambo. I found him continually surprising, showing an understated note of tenderness and regret. In fact I used to think he was just a cartoon version of the actor he used to be anymore. But, Sylvester Stallone is not buried yet. Director captures the streets of Philadelphia so beautifully, he added such a great urban feeling that you can almost smell the city. It's so well filmed that the city genuinely feels like a character on its own.This film is very fresh, even if it's using elements that are a bit seen before. We expect it to end with a big sporting events. The problem with that type of ending is that once the suspense is gone and you know what team looses and who prevailed, going back to watch this film a second time is not that entertaining. Creed reaches back to the archives a few too many times for key locations, costume elements and music cues - which are by the way magnificent, loud, big and exciting - but it's the details that elevate this material. The first major fight is staged with breathtaking precision, in what appears to be a single take. This being a Rocky movie, it goes without saying that the training montages are plentiful, featuring virtuosic editing and one bloodily beautiful extreme-slow-motion shot. Finally Creed is as formulaic and sentimental as you'd expect any Rocky movie to be. Plus, it reminds you why it was great in the first place. This film is a testament for greatness and it comes from the heart. Overall, this film doesn't rely only on the fights but doesn't waste anything in it as well. It's not always as exciting as you expect it to be but it's a good character movie.",9,0,2,21 January 2016
Spotlight," Spotlight
","The true story of how the Boston Globe uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, shaking the entire Catholic Church to its score.It's been nearly 40 years since All the President's Men turned two young reporters into stars and inspired a whole generation of young people to become journalists. Now the best journalism movie since Alan J. Pakula classic is coming to theatres; hoping the film will give a similar boost to journalists and their profession. This film is a disturbing movie, but in all the good ways. This happened, people dealt with it, they brought the story to light and this is why they were doing so good. The truly dramatic story here lies offscreen and goes a great degree in the past, while the journalists work consisted mostly of persistence, constant grinding and not having a life until the job is done - and maybe not even then. This film is most of all a reminder of the kind of investigate print journalism, which is becoming even more rarer. This material can't help but be interesting, even compelling. As numerous notable films have demonstrated, the spectacle of lowly scribes bringing down the great and powerful can make for exciting, more than interesting cinema. However, there's none of the paranoia of a picture like (mentioned before) Alan J. Pakula's 1976 film or Michael Mann's The Insider (1999). Spotlight has a few inevitable journo clichÃ©s where male reporters are dishevelled, don't need to keep the same hours as everyone else, machismo on the subjects of poker and sports and they somehow never need to do the boring grind of sitting down and writing on computers. Though, this movie is honourably concerned to avoid sensationalism and the bad taste involved in implying that journalists, and not the child abuse survivors, are the really important people here. Plus, what is interesting about this film is that it reminds you that the theory of child abuse by priests was widely accepted until relatively recently. On the one hand, there's no real depth given to these reporters. Unfortunately, characters are not interesting or distinctive enough, even the uniformly excellent actors playing them can't bring them to life all by themselves. On the other hand, the movie doesn't make them look like heroes as well, but more like what they truly are: reporters, doing their job in order to highlight a true story. In fact, Michael Keaton is terrific here again after Birdman. Throughout the film, as this case built and built to the point where you are just amazed this is a true story displayed in front of you; actors performed and hold back so well that as you watch it you almost don't feel like you're watching a film anymore but a documentary. Despite having actors that are so recognisable, they truly disappear into their characters and when you can say that of a film, they win. What McCarthy is saying in this movie is that threats never need to be made. A word here, a drink there, a frown and a look on the golf course or at the charity ball, this was all that was needed to enforce a silence surrounding a transgression that most of the community could hardly believe existed anyway. Finally, there is something cautious about the film dramatic pace and as McCarthy keeps the narrative motor running, there are some very good scenes. Chiefly the extraordinary moment when Sacha Pfeiffer starring Rachel McAdams confronts a retired priest ans asks him, flat out, if he has ever molested a child. The resulting scene had me on the edge of my seat. Overall, this well intentioned journalism drama capably tells an important story. It blew me away, it's a remarkably well written and acted film.",10,1,1,27 January 2016
The Hateful Eight," The Hateful Eight
","In post-Civil War Wyoming, bounty hunters try to find shelter during a blizzard but get involved in a plot of betrayal and deception. Will they survive?Most of us were raised to believed that cowboys were men of few words, but Quentin Tarantino is out to prove otherwise with this film. He delivers once again, a film with icy cold dialogue, amazing sequences of people talking back and forth; the movie is roughly three hours long and so old fashioned. It's difficult to lock this film down a genre, much like many Tarantino's movies and here it is what makes this film brilliant. Snowed in together like Agatha Christie characters in a country house, here characters must face a plot unlike any Christie's story - but very much like, say, Reservoir Dogs - in which there is no notional authority figure to exert control over everyone. The only authority is violence and superior firepower. In this film as well as in Reservoir Dogs: the idea of being in unbearable pain from a gunshot wound, but still talking and still being a threat is present. Samuel L. Jackson is definitely Oscar worthy in this film, every scene in which he has a monologue is perfect. It might be his best work since Pulp Fiction and I genuinely mean that. He never get a monologue of such awesome calibre here, Quentin Tarantino did give him some of the best lines. Plus, it's great to see Tim Roth back on a Tarantino movie. Kurt Russell is fabulous: funny, likable, a total badass and Walton Goggins gives a hilarious experience.There's no denying Tarantino's been down this road before, when he reheated the Spaghetti Western to such spectacular effect in Django Unchained. The use of location is perfect. It is such a claustrophobic movie, all actions are centred in one place. You are isolated and you feel like you are in this cabin, everything is cold (except the coffee), you feel the location. Tarantino's treatment makes this film epic. To be sure this film looks grand. The mountainous landscapes and snowfall of the opening reels have a dense splendour. Quentin Tarantino dusted off the Ultra Panavision 70 format used on epics cinema legends such as The Greatest Story Ever Told or How the West Was Won and he put those vintage lenses to curious use. The real test of Tarantino's decision to shoot in 70 mm comes inside, as it raises the question of what advantage a super-wide screen format serves when the drama is mostly limited to one room? Plus, to eyes young enough not to remember luxuriating movies like Ben-Hur, shot in the brilliance of Ultra Panavision 70. The Hateful Eight offers a genuinely different sort of experience? Anyone who loves great images on the big screen will appreciate the movie. Its hefty running time (the 70 mm version clocks a thrilling 187 minutes, including overture and intermission) should appeal mainly to cinephiles. Tarantino manages to stretch the suspense as far as it can possibly go, he withholds the first bullet until roughly the 100 minute mark. He even insinuates himself just after the intermission narrating what transpired during the break and introducing a twist, whereby someone poisoned the coffee while the audiences were restocking on popcorn. Finally, Tarantino's use of music, like his choice of shooting formats, marks a dramatic break from the rest of his oeuvre. This film does include an original score by Ennio Morricone, who you may know from everything basically. He's one of the most famous composer who ever lived - equal to my personal favourite John Williams. Tarantino has creatively recycled existing songs and score, while giving them such accuracy that they may as well have been written for him.Overall, Quentin Tarantino has created another breathtakingly stylish and clever film. Everything about this movie screams 1960's style: the score, the wide screen and the look. Tarantino still got it. I utterly enjoyed seeing some of the actors on the screen delivering amazing performances with great dialogues.",9,4,12,17 January 2016
Moana," Moana
","Moana is Disney's latest animated film and it comes from the same creative team behind Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, Hercules, The Princess and the Frog and Treasure Planet. Moana feels like a worthy successor to Disney's most beloved animated classics while in the meantime pushing the genre into 2016, introducing a smart, diverse and convincing heroine. Plus, I don't know why but it reminds me of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker for the most part. The weight and core of the film is based on both of the main character shoulders and their chemistry. Dwayne - The Rock - Johnson charisma comes through, even just in the voice. At this point, he has proved that he is a real superstar and that he is here to stay. I love his depiction of Maui, he is sort of a sarcastic prick but still lovable because - let's be honest - it is The Rock we are talking about. Auli'i Cravalho is splendid, showing off her pipes with 'How Far I'll Go', delivering the kind of classic Disney 'I want' song that brings to mind The Little Mermaid's 'Part of Your World' and Hercules' 'Go the Distance'. The music is, in my opinion, the best of their most recent films. Especially one which is destined to be the next 'Let It Go', parents out there, be prepared, it is coming. Moreover, Moana offers us all a wave of girl power that we can ride and we love that. First, Moana will be chief after her father and nobody questions it. Second, she doesn't have a love interest, because she has an island to save. Third, her grandmother and mother are both strong presences in her life; in a perfect Bechdel Test fashion, they don't talk about men. Finally, she can do it all and keeps on fighting for what she believes in. As per usual with Disney animated films, the animation is out of this world stellar, with each passing year Disney is getting better and better at the animated photorealistic background, here especially the Ocean. Overall, Moana is a very fun and entertaining film with everything you'd want in a Disney film: great animations, good songs, good voice work, good moral core, good message and most importantly heart.",9,2,13,7 December 2016
Black Mass," Black Mass (Strictly Criminal)
","The true story of Whitey Bulger, the brother of a state senator and the most infamous violent criminal in the history of South Boston, who became an FBI informant to take down a Mafia family invading his turf.Black Mass is a horribly watchable gangster picture taken from an extraordinary true story and conceived on familiar generic lines. It's the portrait of both men's worlds - in some ways diametrically opposed, in others oddly similar. Each has his own crew. Portraying these men Johnny Depp and Joel Edgerton both give richly absorbing performances. In fact, after too many Caribbean holidays, Johnny Depp finally gets back down to some serious business. His mesmerising performance is a return to form for the star after a series of critical and commercial misfires. He is the chief selling point of this film. With his nearly bald head, weird icy blue eyes and deep voice like Ray Liota in Goodfellas; he perfectly embodies a fully accredited sociopath. Less is more. Depp more than rises to the occasion, doing career-best work as a man who emerges as complex and an undeniably charismatic figure. The viewers also experience an oddly tender side of Bulger himself: a devoted son to his mother, a loving sibling to his state-senator brother - Billy (an excellent Benedict Cumberbatch, as per usual) - and a protective father who even indoctrinates his young son in the ways of the streets. Plus, Whitey and Connolly - played with equally impressive skills by Joel Edgerton - share a sentimental sens of Irish neighbourhood loyalty and tribal paranoia. Moreover, Joel Edgerton is superb at showing how his ambitious character is seduced by the decadent gangster lifestyle, his professional ethic muddied by the clan loyalty and street justice that, in some corners of Boston are more sacred than the Constitution. The script introduces some satisfying nasty twists, turns and shocks. Director Scott Cooper and his screenwriters have something substantial to add to the genre: making the point that gangsters do not arise from nowhere like comic-strip villains. They are the symptoms of political corruptions, parasites created by agencies of the state and by weak, accepting law enforcement officials who are content to sub-contract policing to the bad guys. Lastly, the violence in Black Mass, when it comes, is swift and brutal but nothing here is more startling than a single sudden lock at Bulger eyes across the room. This film isn't just taking place in the late 70's and early 80's, but seems to have been made then also. Overall Black Mass is a pessimistic tale about how gangsters are nurtured by corruption. This film is both directed and acted with tremendous confidence.",8,0,1,28 November 2015
Suicide Squad," Tentamen Suicidii*
","* Latin for a suicide attempt. It is often referred to as a failed suicide attempt or nonfatal suicide attempt. A secret government agency recruits imprisoned supervillains to execute dangerous black ops missions in exchange for clemency.Nevermind Deadpool: Suicide Squad is the bad boy of superhero movies. Defined as 'F****** insane' in promotional interviews. it's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice's nasty little brother. On paper, Suicide Squad was summer's last best hopes. Its premise was interesting to anyone who's ever found Hannibal Lecter and Darth Vader more interesting than Clarice Starling or Luke Skywalker. Intended as an antidote to the rest of the DC Cinematic Universe. If Marvel has the best superheroes, so the prevailing geek logic goes, then DC must have the coolest villains. How ironic then, that a superhero story determined to celebrate the genre's villains should feature the worst villain that the genre has ever seen. Director/writer David Ayer opens the film by attempting to compress origins stories, unique abilities and how they were captured for nine different characters into the film's overload first act. Blasting Hip-Hop songs to show how gangsta they are. In fact, each character is introduced with an instantly recognisable song, helping to ground these super freaks in the world as we know it. While also confirming suspicions that the movie is DC's answer to Marvel Guardians of the Galaxy. Amanda Waller starring Viola Davis, whose self-interest eventually poses the film's only provocative moral dilemma, is going to use those villains: she's going to use fire to fight fire and she's going to get burned. Every character is missing someone. Deadshot misses his daughter, El Diablo misses his wife and Rick Flag his girlfriend. Beside that there's Cara Delevingne's Enchantress, a humanoid crocodile who doesn't contribute much to the team and my old friend Jay Courtney: a dumb Australian guy who contributes even less to the team. And THEN, there's Dr. Harleen Quinzel aka Harley Quinn aka Margot Robbie, who is sexualised as hell and a caricature of male fetishism. Plus, she's 'potentially' a poor representation of psychological abuse. Though I loved her character. Moreover, Will Smith hopefully has been given good characterisation within small but thorough lines and some touches of humanity, just like Harley Quinn underneath her unhinged insanity. Will Smith charisma and wit unable him to throw one-liners like no one else, giving the movie a comic aspect without it turning into full mode comedy. This is not the Joker's film we were all waiting for. But must surely be a taste of things to come in future sequels. Attempting to honour the history of the character without stepping on Heath Ledger or Jack Nicholson's toes, Jared Leto creates a surprisingly sensual Joker. He's part gangster, part clown, but nor really part of the movie unfortunately. His character is reduced to a long cameo of some sort. Giving the audience a feeling of second movie within the movie they're currently watching. The brief Batman's appearances are awesome, Ben Affleck is amazing as Batman and I can't wait to see this man again in new Batman features. Blame it on Batman, but the DCCU has gotten awfully dark in recent years, especially compared with the candy-coloured party they're having over at Marvel. Finally critics often complain that overcrowded comic-book movies don't devote enough energy to psychology or performances, focusing instead on action and big CGI set-pieces. But Suicide Squad strays in the opposite extreme. Though this film is full of fancy action sequences in which our anti-heroes fight off a bunch of anonymous CG baddies (like the Avengers) while exchanging witty one-liner (just like the Avengers) and using their various abilities to emerge victorious without breaking a sweat (like, guess who? the AVENGERS!). I don't really like to trash a movie and you know that but certain aspect of the second and third acts reminded me of Fantastic Four, yes, it is that messy. Overall, Suicide Squad flips the script around and forces the audience to root for the bad guys. But is this enough? Clearly: NO. This film is not half as badass as you wanted it to be.",9,0,2,19 August 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Captain America: The Winter Soldier
","As Steve Rogers struggles to embrace his role in the modern world and battles an old threat from his own past: Hydra. A new enemy appears: the Soviet agent known as The Winter Soldier. Captain America: The Winter Soldier trailer looked so good when it came out almost a year ago. We know that it's a Marvel movie, there's a lot of money behind it. And it's obviously a new super hero movie. The question back then was how does the story look? It's spy-espionage related around a larger than life super hero. And it's working pretty well. Writers took a comic book film very seriously, as a crime story which is a great way to approach this type of material. A little bit like Nolans did for The Dark Knight. And as usual settings look very fun. Furry get his ass kicked, which is great because it takes a character that have been a kind of invincible awesomely cool guy, and show his human side, his vulnerability. Plus, Robert Redford (Alexander Pierce) add some serious actor credibility to the movie. My favourite scene is the 'elevator' one. Rogers appears almost naive. But here he proves that he may be idealistic but he's certainly not stupid. At the end of the fight, he kicks that thing up like it's Marty McFly's skateboard but it's cap shield, so cool. The Winter Soldier is some sort of anti-hero, not really a villain, but a very bad ass soldier on his own way. I believe that other than Loki he's the most successful villain character. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is one of the strongest instalment of the individual productions. It's operating on several level with a sharp script and displaying several level of actions such as: gun fight, handsome hand-to-hand combat, and really well executed car chases. Marvel is offering a very good piece of entertainment. I feel like they've taken every lessons they've learn from every previous films and it's right there on the screen. With those events, they can't come back. It can potentially reverberate into every single other Marvel property *NO SPOILER* but I can't wait to see how it will go. If you thought The Avengers was Marvels best action movie wait until you see this one!",10,4,8,29 March 2014
American Sniper," American Sniper
","Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle's pinpoint accuracy saves countless lives on the battlefield and turns him into a legend. Back home to his wife and kids after four tours of duty, however, Chris finds that it is the war he can't leave behind. American Sniper is directed by the one and only Clint Eastwood and stars Bradley Cooper. In fact Cooper completely deserves his nomination for best actor in a leading role, he is terrific in this film and gives an excellent performance. Plus, the cinematography does look very good, action sequences are fairly well handled, there is definitely some suspense and heart pounded scenes as well. There are a lot of controversies surrounding this film, in the fact that a lot of people don't really think that this man should be idolised because of some of the things he has said on his own biography. What I liked is that this movie doesn't glorify war with the usual American honor and medals. The movie first trailer, with this kid carrying a RKG grenade, was the most intense trailer I've ever seen. The question is do I shoot him or not? Those decisions are one big/important key theme of the film and the fact that it's weighing down on this man; because no matter who you are you can't go to war, pull a trigger, have someone across from you die and don't feel anything. You do. It shows how ugly and damaging it is for a person. However Eastwood's approach of this story is a little too black and white as the subject matter is kind of a grey area. The movie itself does not explore any of that, it basically depicts him as a perfect war hero who rescued a lot of people lives but there is this downwards spiral in which the more he takes tours and the more he loses himself. There is this dark hidden story of this man who's deeply damage. It doesn't properly get into the more deep and darker aspect of what PTSD can do to someone and how it can truly affect a family. Some scenes show that Kyle is a wounded man but it doesn't get once again in the emotional core of it. Do you remember this clown from The Hungover? You can be sure that this man is going to stick around for a couple more decades. Overall American Sniper is a well directed and acted war epic drama looking at certain point of a The Legend' life without truly exploring the depth of his emotional damage and PTSD.",8,34,63,21 February 2015
Southpaw," Southpaw
","Boxer Billy Hope turns to trainer Tick Willis to help him gets his life back on track after losing his wife in a tragic accident and his daughter to child protection services. Directors sure do love a boxing ring, that great square where (usually) two men face off in a battle that is often about more than sport. The ring is a great place to put a camera and there's the obvious, easy metaphor that boxing provides: the fight, you see, is really the fight of life. Many venerable Hollywood's directors - Scorsese, Eastwood, Mann or Howard - have (thanks to Sylvester Stallone maybe) made boxing pictures for that particular reason. The think is that there's so much contain within the bounds of those ropes, all the struggle and triumph and defeat of life, neatly compressed into 12 rounds. This movie is one of those film you think can't get worse but it does, it really got worse for this guy in this story of rise-and-fall- and-rise-again. Their daughter evolves into a central character as the film goes on and the legal system seems equally cold and unjust as money-grabbing fight organisers, in taking Leila away from him; though it also motivates Billy to mature into a responsible dad. By now you've probably heard a lot about Jake Gyllenhaal's astonishing physical transformation, to a point where he's even hard to recognise in the opening shots. But generally speaking the cast is incredible, they're all great actors. Harvey Weinstein loudly speculated at earliest Cannes Film Festival preview that Gyllenhaal would receive at least an Oscar nomination for his breathtaking transformation here, partly as 'revenge' for previous snub in the best actor race for last year Nightcrawler. Spectacle of Gyllenhaal throwing himself into the role of Billy Hope with a sort of abandon that makes even his creepy, Gollum-like part in last year Nightcrawler look like a drama class exercise by comparison. He's never looked tougher on screen. In fact, he's virtually unrecognisable here, which in this case is more than enough to satisfy the expectations of a truly great performance. It's in fact a solid piece of acting, one that never lets us forget every ounce of effort he should have went for into achieving it. Billy's character is thrilling to watch and the only unpredictable thing in this 2-hours-plus-movie. Gyllenhaal manages to give his character a raw inner fierce, he turns his pain into an unarticulated rage. You get the sense that the ring is a place where he finds peace through oblivion. You can practically smell the blood, the sweat and the fierce rising from Jake Gyllenhaal bruised and tattooed body. When his character is in emotional agony, you got it, you know it, you feel it and you're there. He created something complex and arresting at the same time, within the character of Billy. That's more impressive than anything the actor's achieved with his personal trainer. He's hands down a fantastic actor even with this relevant physical appearance. Moreover, Rachel McAdams has more to do than I worried she would, and is, slightly better than the material. She gives Maureen more tangible humanity than her 'I'm worried about you, baby' character might otherwise get. I loved Forest Whitaker in the role of the rough old trainer with a heart of gold as well. Particularly a scene where he points to Billy's fists and says 'Boxing isn't about this. It's about this. It's a game of chess.' pointing to his head. However, there's nothing truly out of the box in this competent and effective first screenplay by Sons of Anarchy creator, Kurt Sutter. The second act slows down for some growing up time away from the ring. The action scenes are pumped up and the emotional time-outs smoothed over softly with James Horner's last score that ranges from moody to rap. The boxing scenes themselves are dynamically lanced and cut, always seeking to position the viewer in the midst of it through wide array of camera angle. Especially the climatic fight between Billy and his mortal enemy, is appropriately brutal and undeniably exciting. Finally when it's done well this film involves nuance and the subtle submission of self - which are imperceptible and utterly mysterious. Overall Southpaw may be thudding around from cliché to cliché and lack of narrative agility but when it gets to the ring, it knows just what to do. It's all about the fight, the rest is just hype.",9,2,5,25 July 2015
Ant-Man," Ant-Man
","Armed with a super-suit with the astonishing ability to shrink in scale but increase in strength, con-man Scott Lang must embrace his inner hero and help his mentor, Dr. Hank Pym, plan and pull off a heist that will save the world.For many moviegoers whose knowledge of the Marvel Cinematic Universe doesn't extend to its second tier pantheon of superheroes, the thought of a microscopic man in a microscopic suit and mask may sound a bit, well, ridiculous. Neither super nor particularly heroic. However, if you don't have Thor's hammer, Captain America resolve or Iron Man know-how, what's an Avenger to do? The answer is: go small and exude a good sense of humour, which is precisely what floats this latest addition to the Marvel Cinematic firmament. Marvel had more to prove with Ant-Man than any other post-Iron Man MCU entry and Phase 2 closer might be the sucker punch few expected this year. In fact, there never been true classics among human shrinkage wee sub genre, as the format does force filmmakers to visualise the world from a very particular point of view and that never been easy for anyone. After Captain America: The Winter Soldier's conspiracy curves, Ant-Man arrives with a burglar trying to go straight who reverts to crime because the only post-prison job he can get is a McJob. The run time of the movie is well spent on setting fresh character connections. Those links are plotted with satisfying symmetry across a pattern of fathers/children and mentors/protégés. Paul Rudd nails it as Scott Lang, he's such a likable addition to the MCU and I absolutely loved his portrayal of the character. This guy brings a sort of average-Joe charm, bringing the film to life with his sharp comic timing, almost like Chis Pratt (Guardians of the Galaxy) he's smart enough to handle these films with a light touch. Rudd is helped by an ace supporting cast. Having an actor of Douglas' calibre on board lends the film some gravitas to balance the humour. Michael Douglas is fantastic in this movie, not just because it's Michael Douglas and he's a hell of an actor, he's talented and it's nice to see him in a good movie; but they gave Hank Pym such a good back story. His relation with his daughter ads a great depth to this film and took it in the right direction. Douglas resumes his Wall Street-ish mentor mode which ads wrinkly warmth, he sells every line as Hank Pym: this genius who, by the way it must be noted, also fathered Ultron in the comic books canon (in earliest movie he was created by Tony Stark and Bruce Banner). Michael Pena is comedy gold, every word coming out from this guy mouth is perfect, he nails every line as well. Yet, the villain is purely a plot devices. He's just a big evil guy who's really good at being evil and like to do evil things, like shrinking lambs without even feeling a shred of guilt. He's not a compelling character. Darren Cross acts stupidly and harshly when things are on the line. He doesn't have the demented grand vision that a major villain should have - Ultron would have him for a snack. Marvel was once again able to take a less known, a lot smaller hero and make it as entertaining as this film was, it really paid off. Writer Edgar Wright mostly perfectly captured the comedy/drama/action balance. The story dynamics are fundamentally silly but the action sequences are very well done. The film deals with divorce, estranged fatherhood, societal alienation which sounds more like a Bruce Springsteen song than a Marvel pitch; but the comic relief is judiciously dished out and the first half hour has a lighter hearted approach. The story central conflict does not involve Scott but rather, Pym and his betrayer. This movie understood that it was a smaller movie. It's knowingly small scaled which is alright because heroes are also small scaled sometimes. Visually, the 3D really ads something to the action scenes at least - god knows I'm not a huge fan of 3D. This has to be highlighted as those scenes where Scott shrank down in size, they blurred out the background so deeply do that the focus was solely on this tiny man running around. It worked very well for those sequences. Indeed, the action scenes are stunning to look at, the cgi isn't obvious at all, it may be due to the photo realistic aspect of the whole cinematography. Ant-Man isn't perfect. The structure isn't perfectly balanced in the first act. Sometimes it's very funny and sometimes deadly serious. This feels like couple different movies are happening at once. Finally, the comedy prevails in a project that is historically integral to the Marvel map of the world but also seems on the margins of it. I won't spoil anything but I also loved the way it tied into other MCU instalments with references. Marvel did it again. Ant-Man is a lot of fun, I laughed constantly throughout this film. Overall Ant-Man is a refreshing proposition, in a super-sized summer, the dinosaurs and Arnie-bots won't know what it them. Reed and Rudd's film, is proof that no matter how silly some ideas might sound at first, good things often do come in small packages.",9,1,9,17 July 2015
American Hustle," American Hustle
","The story set up in the 70's when a con man named Irving Rosenfeld and his seductive partner, Sydney Posser, are forced to work for a FBI agent, Richie DiMaso. He pushes them into a world of powers-brokers and mafia. In this Choral Polar D. O'Russell is paying a tribute to Scorsese cinema. One of the most overwhelming fact about this film is the cast transformation and how amazing all their performances are. We knew already that all those actors are great and in this film each and every one of them play their part and they play it well. Dialogues are efficient and seem quite natural, maybe because O'Russell already worked with them before, know them and how they could play it. Characters are dealing with issues such as reinvention, ambition and manipulation. Irving and Sydney are successful in their business as they keep it small enough and simple. However when the FBI agent starring by Bradley Cooper appeared, he's bringing them into a whole new level as he's eager to level up an be remembered. Our Bonnie and Clyde of the 70's are founding themselves in a very complicated scenario. On the one hand Irving starred by Christian Bale pop out as the mastermind who came out with plans. On the other hand Sydney (Amy Adams) is empowered by her sexuality over men characters: over Irving but mainly over FBI Agent DiMasio. In fact, it's crazy to see that so much things happened and actually work predictably at the end. There's so much events going on in the same time, that viewers could be finding themselves a little lost at some point. Finally American Hustle is solid, awkward and funny though I don't see the point to nominate it for best comedy. It's entertaining and pretty well edited.",7,0,1,8 February 2014
Nightcrawler," Nightcrawler
","When Lou Bloom, a driven man desperate for work, muscles into the world of L.A crime journalism, he blurs the line between observer and participant to become the star of his own story. Aiding him in his effort is Nina, a TV- news veteran. Nightcrawler is written and directed by Dan Gilroy, it stars Jake Gyllenhaal. A lot of people were buzzing about this movie and Jake Gyllenhaal's performance, then I read things about the screenplay and that is mainly why I was really looking forward to this film. Firstly, Jake Gyllenhaal gives probably the best performance of his entire career. He has blew my mind earlier this year in Enemy and he's elevating the acting level one more time. Gyllenhaal is fantastic because he manages to make you forgive who he is and what he has done before: he embodies perfectly this character. His performance is honestly worth an Oscar nomination alongside with Matthew McConaughey as he has as well did such good choices in the last years with Zodiac and Prisoners for instance. Secondly, the screenplay is a real masterpiece; you cannot stop focusing on the dialogue scenes and the fact that the character is becoming this obsessed guy trying to capture the perfect crime on film and making money doing so by selling it to news channel. As you watch him and his obsession you can actually see his evolution, him turning into this psychopath. It's really interesting as you are trying to figure out how his brain is working, what he is thinking, you're even starting to root for him and want him to succeed even if he's the protagonist and the villain of his own movie, Bill Paxton's character is likable next to him. In fact, he's not the most likable guy ever but he intrigues you, you want to know where he goes, see how he gets to the next step and how he optimizes everything. Moreover, Nightcrawler is a very good looking movie. But the main point here, is the understandability of his obsession as you know where he's coming from and little by little you understand him as a person. It makes you questioned yourself and it made me crazy. That is also why his performance works so well and why the screenplay is so good, it focuses entirely on characters. Finally, this movie has also the most suspenseful finale I've seen all year; the last 20 minutes are absolutely brilliant. Overall Nightcrawler is an interesting and intense character based movie evolving around the underworld of the news, with a brilliant performance by Jake Gyllenhaal.",8,1,2,26 November 2014
The Revenant," The Revenant
","A frontiersman on a fur trading expedition in the 1820s fights for survival after being mauled by a bear and left for dead by members of his own hunting team.The Revenant is a brutal hymn to the beauty and terror of the natural world. The movie opens with a moment of serene beauty - almost Terrence-Malick-like. This film is filled with striking passages of pure cinema, it has some of the best cinematography my eyes have ever seen and I mean that. These scenes help the audience overcome the film considerable length and extreme carnage at time. There were moments in this very lengthy runtime where I gazed in awe watching some of the shots they were able to accomplish and I genuinely do not understand how they got them. Revenge, as goes the old Klingon proverb, is a dish best served cold. This movie is as much a film about revenge as it is about men. An epic about the existential extremes, human beings will go to for revenge. Well, that and witnessing one of Hollywood's biggest stars endure a Passion of the Christ-like beating from man, beast and nature. The near constant threat of death from predators, starvation and exposure, combine into an impressive study of Human endurance and isolation that makes up the film's strong midsection. Most importantly Leonardo DiCaprio's raw performance helps elevate what could have been just another man-versus-nature drama, even if he has very minimal dialogue and most of it is not even in English. This man has done everything at this point, but still manage to constantly surprised us. Though, no ones ever seen him suffer for his art quite so vividly on screen before. Now onto this Oscar nomination. He should have won a few time at this point and most of us are rooting for him with all our hearts; but right now it doesn't really matter anymore. A statuette doesn't actually matter. However, the performances he's been given us in his movies: THAT matters. Moreover, the supporting cast is uniformly terrific, from Domhnall Gleeson to Will Poulter and, of course, Tom Hardy.Tom Hardy is in fact also very good, even if his lines are the least intelligible element of the masterfully brilliant sound design. He tends to fall back into this habit he has to mumble - sometimes hitting Batman-Bane or Mad Max-Max level. Generally immersive movies enclose, they put you inside, they dunk you down into what it is supposed to feel like. Here, the cinematography do the opposite: it exposes you to the elements. You are out in the cold, in the snow, under this grey sky. The imagery, with these primal landscapes and impressive natural lightning, is sublime. Some director may have been tempted to follow an Oscar win by a cushy comedy; But Alejandro Gonzàlez Inàrritu pushed himself and his crew to the limits against the elements. He defied conventional wisdom by shooting with natural light only, in chronological order and by doing so, has emerged with something we have never seen before. You almost feel uncomfortable watching this film for entertainment. The Revenant is filled with mesmerising violent piece of action choreography. The fights were dirty. Especially one jaw-droopingly limber steady-cam shot which pursues a character until he's killed, then switches to the killer until he's dispatched too and so on. It would look like showing off if it weren't so effective. No spoilers, but this scene involving a bear is an amazing achievement. I don't know how they did it. I have no clue. When it was over, it took me a few minutes to lift my jaw off my lap. This scene is intense in the sense that it looks actually real. This film is so realistic that you would never ever want to hike in the woods if you see it, ever again. Overall, The Revenant is a filmmaking triumph. You cannot afford to miss experiencing this on the big screen. It's a brutal, disturbing, violent movie in which it is one man against nature, and nature is not playing nice.",9,1,4,24 February 2016
Bridge of Spies," Bridge of Spies
","Bridge of Spies premiered at the latest New-York Film Festival, is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Tom Hanks. I loved this film but I have to admit that going to the movie I did not really know what to expect. You never know with Steven Spielberg; though it's more than likely it will always be a well directed film. However as far as Spielberg is concerned there's two types of well directed historical movie: Saving Private Ryan and Lincoln (that last one is perfectly crafted but if you've seen it once, you'll probably never watch it again). Here, the entire cast is engaging down the line. Tom Hanks is one of my favourite actor. He's genuinely one of the most likable actor in cinema history. This film is his fourth collaboration with Spielberg and once again he nails it.His performance is ultimately Oscar worthy with dry humour and reserve of intelligence that makes his character a man with very particular American 'greatest generation' characteristics such as modesty, fundamental adherence to core principles he's been raised to value and live by. Hanks plays the movie's voice of conscience, he also can go dark but wasn't built to remain there for too long. Plus, Mark Rylance portrays a Soviet spy: Rudolf Abel with all his contemporary stages actor skills. He's very good bringing fascination and very, very subtle comic touches to a man who has made every effort to appear as bland, even invisible, as possible. Rylance really does a fantastic job, best supporting actor nomination at least.Like I said earlier, most Steven Spielberg's films are consummate entertainments that swipe you up with pure cinema. Bridge of Spies wonderfully comprehensive detailing of 1950's American life in the opening stretches, slides the viewers into the period. This is genuinely one of the best, if not the best, directed movie of the year so far. It's easy to say that because of Spielberg but I can easily see myself rewatching that film. Obviously Tom Hanks' character isn't sent to the Soviet to kill spies, but to negotiate a deal: so there's a lot of talking involved. You may be bored. But if like me you get butterflies in your body when you watch a perfectly crafted scene. When you notice that you've just seen a long wild single take of two people talking with no break, all because of Steven Spielberg brilliance: simulating a close up and mid shot. If this is your jam, you are going to enjoy this film as much as I did. Moreover, you get invested in this non-physical war. A war through words. Spielberg directed it as it was an action movie. He heats up the drama with some action, throws in crowds, chaos and transforms ordinary spaces like a home, an office or a street into battlefields. This film elevates to a new level of intrigue, tension and complexity in its last act and shapes up expertly into a John Le Carré style. Finally, this film generates an unmistakable nostalgia for a time when global conflict seemed more clear-cut and manageable than it does nowadays. Overall, Bridge of Spies is one of the best Cold-War thriller I've ever seen, a true life espionage tale smoothly handled by old pros who know what they're doing. Masterful old Hollywood style filmmaking.",10,1,4,5 December 2015
Split," Split: 23 Shades of Creepy
","Think Room meets The Missing at 10 Cloverfield Lane. Having seen Split, it is a very good time to be a M. Night Shyamalan fan. Split might be M. Night Shyamalan most compellingly warped concoction to date its genre trappings, acting merely as gateway drugs to the altogether more insanely interesting thriller taking place in Kevin's head. Shyamalan puts all his trust in his audience as he sets up various story elements here and there that won't be fully understood till you have seen the full movie; we learn about characters and the big picture becomes so much more impactful afterwards. The more we learn, the scarier McAvoy's character(s) starts to sound. Split goes all-in on McAvoy slipping from persona to persona, and luckily the man has the acting skills to do so. Indeed, James McAvoy might be one of the most underrated actors nowadays. I loved him in every movie he has done so far, he is excellent, insanely courageous, fully committed and it pays off. Every personality is specifically distinguishable just by his different vocal pattern and his mannerism. Nominate this man right now. This is the role of his career. Usually, when a character talks to a shrink it is because the screenwriter couldn't find a more elegant way to weave in exposition. However with this film, despite being a horror-thriller, the most fascinating moments are the ones, McAvoy spends on Dr Fletcher's couch. Betty Buckley has an amazing character as she tries to cure Kevin. She shines and brings a lot to the proper film. Plus, Anya Taylor-Joy's character back story is beautiful and haunting. She was very impressive in The Witch and is even finer here as a deceptively docile captive whose passivity masks both intelligence and gumption. yet it would be foolish to suggest this is anything but McAvoy's movie. Here's where I mention that Split resembles Psycho when the screenplay makes some riskier moves. Shyamalan's love of tricks is very much alive and well. He also hired the director of photography of It Follows and it really paid off because Split has some brilliant claustrophobic camera work, the lighting is superb, this is a great looking movie. the score is refreshingly subtle. Sometimes you won't even notice how it will be creeping into a scene, while slowly building an intense aura of dreadfulness. Finally, I loved the ending, I won't spoil anything for you but you know I do love me some good ending. There's a neutron bomb dropped in the final scene that essentially reframes everything you just saw. It isn't a whopping reveal like the one in The Sixth Sense. For a movie nerd like me, it is extremely gratifying. For others, it will fly right over their heads and they will wonder why others in the audience are whispering, 'Oh my God! NO WAY!'. I am so genuinely excited by the ending of this movie, the implication it has and what it can mean for Shyamalan's fans, the future and what he can do with his career.Overall, Split is a masterful blend of Hitchcock, horror and therapy session. The storytelling is amazingly brave because Night Shyamalan ultimately trusts his audience.",9,2,11,22 January 2017
The Shining," Shining Analysis
","Shining is an American film released in 1980, screen played by Stanley Kubrick, Diane Johnson and directed by Stanley Kubrick himself.This film is based on a novel written by Stephen King, bestselling writer and master of suspense books. He has written Dead Zone, Stand By me, and Misery all three adapted to the cinema. Wendy Carlos, Rachel Elkind, Gyorgy Ligeti, Bela Bartok and Krzysztof Lloyd have composed the music. In it, we can hear magnificent melody mixed with rasping noise that we rediscovered throughout the film every time that a character having 'The Shining' gets a vision. We find, in this film, Jack Nicholson awe-inspiring in his madness, as well as a young Danny Lloyd demonstrating a rare maturity for a young boy. Shining is completely based on acting. The young Danny Lloyd plays a little boy with 'The Shining', this gift is embody in a certain way by an imaginary friend named Tony, who lives in his mouth. Little by little Jack Nicholson let his talent came out, here to play a man with murderous madness. Role that he already played in Milo's Forman film, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's nest, in 1975. In Shining, as he write his new book, his madness progressed, and the fact that he wants to stay alone tenfold his isolation. This link between his madness and the writing is explained afterward in the film, when Wendy, his wife, discovered that he wrote one and only sentence since the beginning: 'All work and no play makes jack a dull boy'. New scenes are in this version of Shining, as the one when the doctor comes in the family house to see Danny after his first vision. Which let us see briefly this family's past, mainly Jack's alcohol problem that come back, later, when he moved to the Golden Room's bar of the hotel.Is this evidence in order to put us on the trail of the evolution of Jack's madness?Shining includes a very strong symbolic around the mirror and what is reflected inside, located in Jack and Wendy's bedroom, this mirror reflect an idea of parallel world where this family's story could be totally different.Danny uses this reflection to write on the bathroom door with a lipstick the word: 'REDRUM', what gives 'MURDER' in the mirror's reflection.This mirror is here as an eye. Several theories are possible.The first one, of a parallel world join the second one, which is the evolution of Jack's madness, saw by his son, Danny in one of his vision. 'REDRUM' can let us think of 'RED ROOM' which could be a reference to the bathroom of the Golden Room that is red. Where Jack met Grady (the former custodian of the hotel), who helped him awareness that he must kill his wife and his son. This parallel world joins ours when Danny is attacked in the room 237 and Grady opened the door of the room where Wendy succeeded to lock Jack.At the beginning of the film, the labyrinth located in front of the hotel is introduced as an attraction. This idea seems very charming at first, but much less at the end with the famous pursuit. Evidences sown by Kubrick throughout the film leads the viewers to this final outcome. For instance, we could linked the moment when Wendy and Danny played in the labyrinth at the beginning with the picture of Jack who is walking alone in the hotel's corridor and arriving in front of a labyrinth model which shows us the superiority of Jack's madness.Let us return to this legendary outcome in the cinema history. Kubrick had chosen to never show us the position of Jack (relative to Danny) that increased prodigiously the suspense for the viewers. Finally, hundreds of scary films have been made but there probably just five of them that are genuinely creepy. Shining fits alongside of the Exorcist released in 1978 by William Friedkin as the best horror film of all time.",8,0,1,15 December 2013
Divergent," Divergent
","In a world divided by factions based on virtues, a young teenager named Tris is learning that she's a Divergent and won't fit in any factions. When she discovers a plot in order to destroy Divergents, Tris and Four must find out what makes Divergents dangerous before it's too late.Fans will be pleased as Divergent is actually working well on the big screen and people who didn't read the book are easily drag into this both dark and really realistic world as well. Neil Burger did some good direction choices; Artistic direction and special effects are great. The two and a half hour run time of the film was not unbearable, mostly thanks to Tris character and an interesting plot. On the one hand, Tris' character starring the neo-Jlaw: Shailene Woodlay is ambitious as we're able to see, due to how the movie is shot, her external ad internal experience as well. We got to see how she becomes so strong through the film. On the other hand, Four (Theo James) is a sort of mysterious military leader but everything change when he meets Tris and fall in love with her, his character opens up progressively. Plus, Jeanine played by our beloved Kate Winslet, believes that the rigidity of the factions maintains peace. She knows as thus everyone, that there is such a thing as the Divergents and that those people are messing with the purity of the factions. She wants to exterminate them. Divergent belongs to teen movies, such as Hunger Games (hard not to link both of them) and many more. Combats made Hunger Games looked fake and pointless. But it's not only a franchise piece or a teen novel full of action scenes. I feel like there's so much more than that. I mean a concept; We as human being, we all want to come from somewhere, count for something, be true to who we are, to follow a path we chose. For instance, Four back tattoos are symbolic of what he intends to be. Each one of us went through idealistic questions, and I am not afraid to say that is tough work. This film is dealing with very important values. Overall, it seems like every popular books nowadays, especially if it's a book series targeting young adult, is being turn into a movie franchise but actually what's most surprising is that it's not that bad. Don't miss it!",9,1,3,15 April 2014
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation
","Ethan and team take on their most impossible mission yet, eradicating the Syndicate - an International rogue organisation as highly as they are, committed to destroying the IMF. Over the past 19 years Mission: Impossible movies have become synonymous with its star's fearless stunts. This new entry takes the best of all the 'good' Mission: Impossible, blend them together as the formula of ingredients is familiar and time tested. This might actually be the best fifth instalment in a franchise, its only real competition is Fast Five - no The Empire Strikes Back doesn't count despite the fact that it is Star Wars: Episode V. Those films have remained Tom Cruise safe harbour, his teflon franchise. Ethan Hunt will always be embraced as a returning hero. You can shoot him, stab him, drown him, blow him up or pair him with the baddest of all; but you will never stop Ethan Hunt, because he is played by Tom Cruise. Make no mistake, even at 53, Tom Cruise is still Hollywood's hungriest leading man. In the previous chapter, 2011's Ghost Protocol, Cruise wowed audience by hanging from the side of the world's tallest skyscraper. Now in the latest sequel director's understood perfectly Cruise's signature and he wastes no time serving it up, opening the film with the guy himself sprinting and leaping onto the wing of a Russian cargo plane speeding down a runway. Cruise is - obviously - the definitive modern movie star. A charismatic force that can make the bad watchable and the average ultimately quite fun. Plus, he's very far from being a candidate for The Expendables series any time soon. Rebecca Ferguson is also great in this movie, she is the right balance between femininity and bad-assery. The light hearted tone of this movie is mostly due to and expanded role for the comic-relief maestro: Simon Pegg. This man is hilarious, he's a quite actor who - I believe - doesn't get much credit for his work. If you watch Shaun of the Dead, he has this comic aspect as well as a very good dramatic one. The villain is also good. He has motivation and you can really feel where he's coming from; still not an incredible villain but he's functional. Shockingly, the theme music is - after an initial blast - sabotaged. In fact, Rogue Nation might not be the tightest, or even, the most logically coherent Mission: Impossible movie but there should be more movies like this one: relentlessly thrilling. It recalls the first film a lot, coming back to that more tense, suspense oriented espionage; with a sharp script that springs a little surprise or two. It does more than just connect the dots between action set-pieces. The writers perfectly balanced the espionage devices with gadgets while having thrilling action sequences. The action is indeed amazing. That is the very heart of why you like action movies. This franchise is the few remaining series (along with 007) where globe trotting action is still appreciated. Action scenes are extremely well handed by Christopher McQuarrie, characters are still very accessible, enjoyable and seeing them coming together again is very important as we can see that a lot happened to this team before. The film's most exciting sequence - a tussle between Hunt and three assassin sent to murder the Austrian Chancellor at the Vienna State Opera - is a beautifully managed action sequence. Unconventional and quite brave for a mainstream franchise picture. Yet, the motorcycle chase is one of the best I've seen for a long time in a movie. Overall, this movie is not so much about the outcome as it is the breathlessly thrilling journey Tom Cruise takes us on to get there.",9,1,3,13 August 2015
X-Men: Days of Future Past," X-Men: DOFP
","The X-Men send wolverine to the past in a desperate effort to change history and prevent an event that results in doom for both humans and mutants. To me it's a very welcome return to Bryan Singer as X-Men I and II were very good! He really captured the essence of the X-Men comic books which was as it's heart the mutant and humans struggle, politics and emotions of that. Bryan Singer returned this time, taking what Matthew Vaughn brought us with X-Men: First Class and linked the two world together in a perfectly satisfying and epic new film. This exciting summer blockbuster will satisfy fans of the series. Singer is clearly comfortable in this world once again bringing humour to it as well as incredible action. It's in fact great to see the X-Men fight together in a unique and interesting way. Plus, he exceeded people expectations (unfortunately for him though, particularly in this world where expectations are always higher), pleased, surprised and shocked them as well with X-Men I at a time when there were no genre. X-Men II, I think, for many people is a favourite of the entire series. He managed to elevate that again with Days of Future Past. This film is not only an X-Men movie but it's also a time travel movie. Which can go both way. It gives the writers and director the chance to do something that we're not expecting as they could literally pull anything out of the bag. This film might be the best X-Men movie we've ever had as Singer fixed all the mistakes made since his departure with X-Men III and Origins. It's great! However, people tend to smash those big blockbusters because of all the special effects and kids related things but this movie has on display incredible acting talent, the cast is absolutely incredible, such as Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen. Plus, the big stands out are Michael Fassbender and especially James McAvoy who is amazing as Professor X in far more difficult times. They have such a fantastic chemistry, we can feel the endless amount of back stories in place within those characters. Yes, there are many characters in this film which is pretty easy to mess up with. We've seen that recently, for instance in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 which handled his characters terribly. But here, every single one of these characters having really awesome bad ass fight scenes and cool comic book moments, have emotional arcs as well. Undeniably the emotional core of the movie is intact from the beginning. One of the best sequences involved Evan Peters as Quicksilver, trust me as I say that he steels every moments he's on the screen. Every scenes he's in it, not a whole bunch, but still every scene is PERFECT. When he's demonstrating his powers, is actually one of the best scene I have ever seen in a comic book film in my (short) entire life. Finally, only a couple of minor issue including on the one hand little to much silly humour, but I have to admit that it's part of the series. Sometimes humour was extremely clever throughout the movie, characters did jokes and it works. On the other hand there were to little time spent on worthy character such as Dr. Bolivar Trask. Indeed, Peter Dinklage is an amazing actor but he didn't really strike the fear and intensity that I was hoping from him, as we didn't really know what are his motivations to exterminate mutants by creating the Sentinel. The character of Bishop also disappointed me as he doesn't look like the comics in any way. X-Men: Days of Future Past represents a great conclusion as well as a fresh beginning for the next films to come. Overall, even if you're not an X-Men fan despite just the fantasy and spectacle, the story is so deeply human and moving that I feel like everyone has to relate to this franchise. As you could tell by now I'm a huge fan of Marvel universe. I loved X-Men DOFP and of course I'm really looking forward to Apocalypse, more than ever before!",10,20,33,21 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Captain America: Civil War
","Political interference in the Avengers' activities causes a rift between former allies Captain America and Iron Man. As the third Captain America entry jump-starts the summer movie season, and so called Phase 3 of the MCU, its box-office muscle is beyond question. When the Avengers first assembled four years ago, it felt like a grand culmination, THE Ultimate Marvel superhero event. Since then, the studio's ever expanding Cinematic Universe has delivered sequels or varying quality and introduced new heroes in stand-alone movies, but it has never quite matched the ensemble-balancing finesse and Earth- quaking action scale of Joss Whedon's initial assembling. Not until now. This is not some hastily assembled battle to sell more movie tickets; these two have been quarreling over the course of two Avengers movies - one of their first conversation includes Captain America telling Stark 'Put on the suit, let's go a few rounds'. It's all been building to this; with hashtag-powered marketing campaign, prompting True Believers to pick a side. This film is build around a bigger conflict that, despite the title, does place it as a direct sequel to Age of Ultron. While Bucky and Cap friendship being the core of the film, makes it Captain America Three rather than Avengers Two and a Half. Captain America: Civil War might be the best Marvel Studios move yet. There, I said it. It does what the best Marvel films do: juggling between characters so each is allowed to shine in a story that pushes forward the series continuity and while also forming and concluding its own plot. Forget Batman v Superman. Here you get Ant-Man v Spider-Man, Hawkeye v Black Widow, Scarlet Witch v Vision, The Winter Soldier v Black Panther and Captain America v Iron Man, all rolled into one film. And that is what you call THE Ultimate Marvel superhero event. What could serve as the detriment to some hero-stuffed movies, actually works to the advantage of Civil War. Part of what is so delightful is how easily the characters, the majority of which we've come to know over the course of thirteen Marvel Studios movies, interact and play off each other. However, it all comes to these two characters, ultimately Captain America v Iron Man and their own beliefs, personalities, neuroses and paranoia coming out to play. For both of them, the bonds of friendship are shown to run deeper than any commitment to the greater good. Steve defense of Bucky is questionable: he may be his childhood friend, but now he's a lethal, robot-armed killing machine forever in danger of being reactivated. Sebastian Stan remains, for the most part, as blank and frosty as he was in Winter Soldier. Chris Evans meanwhile, further hones a role he has effortlessly owned for five movies now; pushing Rogers to impressive new depths and reminding us that his straight arrow still has a dangerous edge. He's perfect. The stoic heart and soul of the MCU. There's little doubt why anyone would risk being branded as fugitive to follow him into battle (I VOLUNTEER!). And as perfect is Robert Downey Jr., who shows a completely different side of Tony Stark. He's more the elder statesman here than the witty merchant; reflecting on the consequences of his actions and looking to make amends. The brilliance of Downey Jr. sympathetic performance is that even if (like me) you are resolutely #TeamCap you can still (obviously) feel for him. As you might expect, it's one of the MCU's more serious entries, tonally a world away from Age of Ultron. But that doesn't mean it's humorless; far from it. Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson can be relied upon for laugh-out-loud one-liners wherever he's on screen, Vision stylish new wardrobe is comedy gold and Paul Rudd's Scott Lang is 'HUGE' fun in relatively brief appearance. Moreover, Black Panther gets a lot of shine too. Going in I didn't know much about the character, so this bing my strong introduction to the character, I really liked him. He works for this story and situations in many ways ( I can't reveal in a spoiler free review). Now let's get into what everyone seem to be waiting for - except me, because I've never really been a huge fan - 19-year-old Tom Holland's Spider-Man. he might be the best Spidey so far. His Peter Parker is great: nervy, goofy and instantly endearing. In the airport fight, in which he's truly spectacular, using his webs in entertaining and creative ways; while his wit couldn't be better. I have to admit that I'm in love and I can't wait to see more of Holland's Spider- Man. And no Loki or Ultron equivalent this time. Who needs a villain when you have Steve and Tony? Both protagonists. Both antagonists.Civil War is rises above the series' greatest weaknesses. In a movie that has an almost literal army of superheroes, it's remarkable that a film this big can still feel intimate. Reflecting the material's comic book roots, the Russos keep the film's action heavy. 'It always ends in a fight', says > You could read more on my blog",10,16,33,28 April 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," The answer is: in the suitcase.
","The adventures of writer Newt Scamander in New York's secret community of witches and wizards seventy years before Harry Potter reads his book in school.Maintaining David Yates as director lends a consistency to the project, and yet, it could have been refreshing to get a completely new take on J.K. Rowling's world with this series. In this new instalment, Jacob is clearly meant as our way into this magical new world. Dan Fogler as Kowalski, this normal no-maj' or muggle who gets caught up in all this, is the audience character and comic relief of the movie. He is all of us, he is the guy who is constantly like 'Hey what's going on?!' and they explain things to him but they are actually explaining them to us. Dan Fogler is so good, he never gets annoying and he never feels like a side-kick either, for that I was very happy he was in this film. Moreover, by the end of the movie, he also becomes one of the most important emotional core of the movie as his romantic relationship subplot with Queenie is by far the film's most charming detail. Unsurprisingly, Fantastic Beasts amplify both the strength and weaknesses of Rowling's storytelling approach - a cliffhanger-oriented tactic that works well in novels but feels less elegant on screen. Nonetheless, David Yates is a director that understands this world. He is building great set action sequences as well as several slower paced scenes and are not overly relying on our knowledge or love of the Harry Potter universe. The major problem with this movie is that the visual panache comes with a whole lot of plots. In fact, the film has some structural problems and really feels like two movies. On the one hand, you have the beasts plot and on the other hand, the chasing going on with the Obscuro and Grindelwald plot. Finally, this film has Harry Potter-esque magic but the world itself is the muggle world. I'm addressing this point because I believe that the magic in this film is the most awe-inspiring where it shouldn't have been the most magical. Magic is in the details.Overall, I did enjoy this film but it feels too much like a setup movie for future instalments of the franchise.",6,0,2,30 November 2016
The Conjuring 2," How James Wan is Rewriting the Book of Horror
","Lorraine and Ed Warren travel to North London to help a single mother raising four children alone in a house plagued by a malicious spirit. The brilliantly terrifying The Conjuring is the second highest grossing horror movie of all time. The first being: The Exorcist. This film was genuinely the best horror film I had ever seen in a long time and James Wan is in my point of view, the best director working in horror today; so I was really excited to see this second instalment. This movie makes a perfect follow-up to the original Conjuring's lesser known case. Plus, the movie starts with a certain Amityville House. Yes, THAT Amityville. Here, the Enfield Case is probably one of the best documented, most studied and most contested hauntings in existence and in British history. The real recordings of paranormal investigator Ed Warren interviewing the entity through Janet live at the end of The Conjuring 2 and it's difficult not to let chills run down your spine. Nonetheless, director James Wan offers its potential fans a helping of reinsurance to go along with the fear. If there are ghosts and demons out there, then God must be out there as well. James Wan, who directed Saw and Insidious, is a horror filmmaker of such skills that even when he makes a by-the-book haunted-house story, it's easy to feel a hint of admiration for his talent beneath your tingling spine. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson couple really ground the film in realism as their backstory and relationship are really touching and heartfelt. Being more than a horror movie, it's about marriage and being with somebody that understands you. The realistic family story grounds the film and makes it better than your average horror film. Horror lives in the unknown. It hides in abandoned asylums, in catacombs, in cabins and haunted manors. These are safe places to die. You don't want to die? Maybe don't do an Ouija Board, stay home and watch Netflix instead. Nothing can find you there. Except James Wan. Wan is a modern horror maestro who brings the fear home to you. All these events take place in the very real world, occupied by everyday people trying to get on with their life. We've all been children hiding under the duvet from whatever hid under our bed in the dark. Even now, home alone on a rainy day, we've sat on our couch and wondered what creaked the floorboards in the seemingly empty room next to us. Wan's fear construction is effortless, his best moments lie in the silence between scares. He also has a sense of the audience: of their rhythm and pulse, of how to manipulate a moment so that he's practically controlling your breathing. He became a master of THE face. He must have a card in his office reading:'All you need to make a hit horror film is one truly awful face!'. THAT face. The face that's staring through the window. Staring through the dark. The face that's coming to get you eventually. James Wan again proves with this film that he knows how to use a jump scare. Those are meant to get you. This man knows how to built tension until it feels insurmountable. He's also a wizard of timing, i-e he toys with us by throwing so routinely unsettling images at us, like, let's say a toy firetruck that starts to move ion its own. Then, letting that omen menace pass at which point the movie will simply pause, stopping dead in its tracks. It's right there, in the middle of that storm of quiet, that our anxiety starts to rush in. Finally, it's truly the craft, performances and the writing that make this film a billion years ahead of all films of its kind, out right now. This film is really good. It's scary, suspenseful, the tension is real and a lot of that is due to a brilliant cinematography. Overall, James Wan knows his craft. And all he has to do to bring you true horror is take you home, where you think you're safe from harm. Sweet, sweet dreams.",10,1,4,2 July 2016
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," The Hobbit: The Review of Smaug
","The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug has been released on December 11th i-e four days ago, and it's already made up to more than $65 mil and on its way to $254 mil total. I enjoyed the first Hobbit film, and I was pretty excited to watch this next episode of the saga. I wasn't disappointed. I read Tolkien's books and let me tell you that Peter Jackson did pretty well so far. He knew how to focus on characters emotions and personalities with a full of actions as visual. Plus, it's interesting to see the evolution of those characters throughout the two first films, actors tried to wide their characters as tight as they can under their tragic forms. It's good to see them be careful of what they deliver. Obviously, we met for the first time Smaug. Who I think is the key character as we saw him briefly in the first film and imagined him since then, mostly through the story telling. Stories promise us an enormous dragon, much bigger than anything we could ever imagined. In this case, scale is very important as he is not just a dragon but a real threat. Therefore, Peter Jackson has done a brilliant job embodying Smaug with the Bafta winning actor Benedict Cumberbatch's voice. I have to admit that his voice is not easily recognizable but it fits well. I guess it should have been a massive challenge for the production to create a speaking character where the most dominant thing is his personality. In fact, Smaug appeared to be a total psychopath and in one way his physical appearance is really important but on the other way people will more remembered his voice, personality, how he behaved and how he moved and talk than how many teeth he has. The Hobbit is efficient and the special effects are beautifully orchestrated. The director know where he is heading to, as well as his very talented actors. I highly recommend this film and all Jackson's adaptations of Tolkiens' work. Now we just have to wait for the third film were I hope the establishment of the first two films are gonna be played out, especially characters stories and how their relationships between each others end up. Plus, the Five army Battle promises to be epic!",9,4,11,15 December 2013
The Fault in Our Stars," Movie Vs. Book: TFIOS
","Hazel and Gus are two teenagers who share an acerbic wit, a disdain for the conventional, and a love that sweeps then on a journey. Their relationship is all the more miraculous given that Hazel's other constant companion is an oxygen tank, Gus jokes about his prosthetic leg, and they met and fell in love at a cancer support group.The Fault in Our Stars is based on the New York Times Best Seller novel published in 2012, and written by John Green. At first I was a little bit worried to walk into a theatre for another book adaptation to a movie because (1) I loved the book and (2) there are so many of them nowadays. It became a proper trend; but gratefully TFIOS is different. This is a love story. It's a story of joy, devastating loss and most of all, life. It will make you laugh, rejoice, think, feel and will expend your heart with gratitude and humility, as well as change forever the way you hear the word 'okay'. YES it will make you cry! If you are one of the millions of people who have read TFIOS, you know this already. If you're not, prepare yourself as you will not walk away from this book, or this movie unaltered. I cried for the whole movie, if we're being honest. What struck me the most is that I thought I would leave really sad, but instead I felt hopeful and inspired. This movie is an encouragement. One of a kind you can take down into the darkness and it would still give you light. Personally, I read TFIOS the way Hazel falls in love with Gus: 'slowly, and then all at once'. I started out reading it a chapter at a time in between the papers I was grading and then I gave up on grading and read straight through till down. The strength of the film clearly comes from John Green's novel. The beauty of the book, and now the film is that it's a Young Adult novel that brought teens back to reality, which is good after years of popular YA fiction novels and movies revolving around vampires,wizards, deadly games and dystopian universes. That isn't just a 'movie', Hazel's voice over intones over a close up of Shailene Woodley expressive eyes; but a document that dares to stare terminal illness baldly in the face rather than hide behind euphemisms. TFIOS' end is not that sad if we think about it for a second, it's uplifting and hopeful. It's emphasising the importance of making your days count, even if you have very few left. The movie manages to imitate those different feelings and does a great job of accurately bringing the book to life, thanks to a smart screenplay and dialogues. Plus, there are some aspects of this half-dreamy, half-earthbound romance that the director Josh Boone gets just right. Obviously certain scenes are cut but oddly non of these scenes are particularly crucial to the plot. However they may have helped to add some depth to the character. Mostly, I feel like the movie didn't really missed of anything. In fact, the most important aspect of this romance is the character's chemistry. Shailene Woodley (Hazel) and Ansel Elgort (Augustus) created two vibrant, believable parts filled with humour and intelligence. Hazel is clearly not afraid to die but she's scared of getting too close to people, and what they're going to do, how they're going to live without her. That's probably why it's so interesting to see how her parents deal with the fact that their child is dying. On the one hand Shailene Woodley embodies perfectly Hazel. She's her. She's funny, sarcastic and cynical. On the other hand, not to disrespect how amazing Shailene is in the film but Ansel Elgort is a real star. He's kind of the revelation of the movie. Gus character is tough as his heroic journey goes from strength to weakness, instead of the usual hero's journey from weakness to strength. He seems to have perfectly understood Gus in deep ways. He's brilliant. His character appeared like the best human being ever. By that I mean if everyone was like Gus there will be no problem at all on earth. Once again it's demonstrating how important is a strong supporting character in romance as they are are both overcoming the fact that they're dying of cancer (almost) together. Indeed, cancer provides the butt of the film's most funny jokes, provides the power with which the story starts to squeeze the viewers first tears.

Non-Stop," Non-Stop Review
","Non-Stop deals with an air marshal springs into action during a transatlantic flight after receiving a series of text messages that put his fellow passengers at risk unless the airline transfers $150 million into an off-shore account. We're used to know J. Collet-Serra in horror films, indeed, he directed House of Wax (2005) and Orphan (2009). For his second action movie the director of Unknown (2011) pays a tribute to the old plane catastrophe movie of the 70's such as Airport with Burt Lancaster directed by George Seaton. There are a pronounced Hitchcokian atmosphere which have an outrageous 90's style. The investigation is thrilling, the murders are, clever, the plot is well formulated and the atmosphere is oppressive in this flight-constrained area. Every twenty minutes someone die, and in between the pace is pretty good, especially when we can see Liam Neeson kicking ass. In fact, Liam Neeson could ad credibility to just about anything, he could even sit on a bench and look at a bird saying 'I'm an air marshal, come here now!' I will probably enjoy it. But in this film he's actually not just a mindless action hero. Julian Moore provided some good supporting work as well, she brings some humanity in Neeson's character, he reveals himself to her. Each one of the characters look suspicious and at some point you could find yourself thinking 'Oh it could be him - or her - or him with the sunglasses and the cap' and even the seven years old girl looks guilty. Which is pretty exciting, and mind-blowing. Plus as the film is in a constrained area I've had this feeling that i was in the plane as well, searching for the terrorists and looking at each one of the passengers. However, Non-Stop is not realistic at all. Nothing makes sense. It's cheesy, but fun enough to be kind interesting and enjoyable to watch around. I believe if a film is written, played and filmed with enough passion and at one time everything fall into place, a movie that is even endlessly implausible and doesn't always makes sense; I think it could be good. Non-Stop is that movie. That one movie that comes along once in a while. A basic but efficient plane thriller, supported by really good actors.",6,0,2,2 March 2014
How to Train Your Dragon 2," How To Train Your Dragon 2
","When Hiccup and Toothless discover an ice cave that is home to hundreds of new wild dragons and the mysterious Dragon Rider, the two friends find themselves at the centre of a battle to protect the peace and the people they love.How to Train your Dragon 2 is the sequel to the oddly named original film; which was a huge surprise both for critics, fans and box-office. At first How to Train Your Dragon's trailer wasn't that good. Plus DreamWorks Studios hasn't made a great movie in a while (since Shrek in my opinion). Against all odds the first movie was actually a really good movie. And How To Train Your Dragon 2 follows in its footsteps. This time the film appears like a very adult animated movie and it goes where the original movie didn't in regards to characters and even the story, which is what a sequel must actually be doing. It's mixing an animated film genre with a very mature cinematography and direction. It's really great as I think this film is considering children as 'grown up' people; not waiting for them to sit in a cinema and watch cool stuff happening till the end of a movie. There are lots of things going on under the surface, actually How To Train Your Dragon 2 is dealing with universal concepts such as growing up, maturing, family background, responsibilities, obligations and stepping up from the crowd in order to find our own voice. Moreover, it's good to see how Toothless and Hiccup relationship evolves. The only drawbacks of this movie I think is the villain. I was a bit disappointed by Drago's character. At first sight he is not as evil as I imagined him to be but his evilness is pulled out little by little along the movie. Beyond the fact that the score is awesome (John Powell), all the CGI aspect of the film: from characters to landscapes and dragon's action scenes are boosting the technical credit of the movie. Finally How To Train your Dragon 2 is emotionally deeper than just massively good cinematography visuals. This is a quite classical plot for an epic and drama animated movie but it's what makes the film really efficient at last. Overall, this film is exciting and has everything a great movie can wish for: great characters, great plot evolving around very mature and universal concepts, really good action scenes, well defined emotions and DRAGONS!",10,3,8,4 July 2014
Foxcatcher," Foxcatcher
","The greatest Olympic Wrestling Champion brother team joins Team Foxcatcher led by multimillionaire sponsor John E. du Pont as they train for the 1988 games in Seoul - a union that leads to unlikely circumstances. Foxcatcher is directed by Oscar nominated Bennett Miller, stars Steve Carell also nominated for best actor in a leading role, Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo. In fact Steve Carell performance is very good, he's properly unrecognisable. At this point, his performance is clearly career defining. Plus in my opinion Channing Tatum is largely underestimated. He gives a performance that is so restrained and in which you can read so much on his face, some moments you can literally feel his pain and torment. Mark Ruffalo plays a father who is very protective of his family but also of his brother and he also deserves his Oscar nomination for best actor in a supporting role. In fact, all those three performances are Oscar worthy to me or at least nomination worthy as the movie cannot function without them. However it is a quite slow paced movie, there are few 5 to 10 minutes long sequences and you are left wondering what was the real purpose of those scenes. This movie is based on a true story and tries to make a statement on why Dupont did what he did. The emotional core of the movie is very hollow and distant. As I said before I think Channing Tatum is the lead actor in this film; some of you can disagree and think that it is Steve Carell, but Tatum's character is the only one I really felt connected with. Finally, if you combined the slow pace, the blank emotional core and the fact that you can't really understand some of the character motivation behind this film it's a little bit disappointing. Overall Foxcatcher is a beautifully shot movie with some out of this world performances but the heart and soul of the film itself is a little bit distasteful.",5,1,7,22 January 2015
Legend," Legend
","The film tells the story of the identical twin gangsters Reggie and Ronnie Kray, two of the most notorious criminals in British history, and their organised crime empire in the East End of London during the 1960s.There are two good reasons to make what might otherwise seems an inessential new biopic of Ronnie and Reggie Kray - and both of them, as it happens, take the formidable form of Tom Hardy. In fact, as a performance showcase Legend is sensational; Hardy is astonishing. To this dual role, Tom Hardy brings physical, intellectual and emotional commitment. His inspired twin turn elevates and complicates the otherwise straightforward terrain of the film. In my opinion, these roles are prestigious awards vehicle. His Reggie is suave: a charismatically volatile antihero calculated to inspire perverse admiration among younger male and his playfully eccentric inhabitation of the gay, mentally unstable Ronnie would, on its own, balanced the extravagance of the era. Moreover, it's an unexpected way into the film's story, narrated by Frances (Reggie's love interest and future wife) starring Emily Browning, her point of view takes on an unconvincing omniscience, in assuming equal narrative authority on their domestic and professional lives. The formerly institutionalised Ronnie is the film's most fascinating, conflicted figure and the one whose interior life most eludes Frances narration. His romantic relationship with young lackey Teddy Smith - a poignant, under used Taron Egerton - is played in tender fashion. However, the film is less satisfying on deep psychological profile: for all Hardy's expressive detail and physical creativity; incident-packed script offers little insight into what made either of these contrasting psychopaths tick, or finally explode. Director Brian Helgeland has fashioned the Kray's rearing of London's underworld from Whitechapel to Soho perfectly. But by doing so, turning the period into a playground it softens the horror of what really happened and the tyranny of the Krays becomes diminished. Overall, this film takes on a fascinating period of time and leaves us sorely uninformed, as if we've skim-read a pamphlet. There's not enough within Legend to elevate it from other British crime films.",8,0,0,29 January 2016
Gone Girl," Gone Girl
","With his wife's disappearance having become the focus of an intense media circus, a man sees the spotlight turned on him when it's suspected that he may not be innocent.Gone Girl is directed by David Fincher, adapted by Gillian Flynn from her 2012 novel of the same name. It stars Ben Affleck, Rosemund Pike, Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry. I was really excited about this film as David Fincher is on of my favorites director and he's a perfectionist so I knew deep down that it'll be a good one. I was even more excited when I discovered that he hired Ben Affleck to play the husband. This role is perfect for him and he's fantastic in this movie. Rosemund Pike is also excellent; this is probably the best work I've seen from her. I loved it. First I have to say that I read the book before... But for those who did not read the book before, you barely know anything going to this movie. The trailer didn't reveal a lot of things and details, which you don't need to know until you are sitting in the theater experiencing the movie for yourselves. There are so many hidden facts to the story and that I won't spoil to you as so you'll be able to experience them without knowing. I'm glad to see that Fincher cherishes this kind of movie experiences as well. As the film progresses I was continuously surprised, it got darker and darker and meaner. My mouth was dropped. It's really intriguing and you don't know who to root for. You are the detective, watching everything the husband does. Plus, this movie legitimately make you think about the way we perceive the media, the news and factual events. How you just see what the media is showing you. You don't know all the facts. Also how the news and media affect the situation of this man; as a viewer I evolved behind the scenes of how a person's life can crumbled to the ground simply based on a few lies. Technically Fincher is a visionary director and that's what I love about his work. His frames are PERFECT. Secondly I liked the fact that twits and turns of the movie don't came out as showy as I'm use to; just as 'wow...' thanks to this really good screenplay. The cast was really good. Beside Ben Affleck and Rosemund Pike who are fantastic, I wasn't sure of Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris... So let me tell you that they are great as well! Finally, for being as long as it is the story keeps you certainly interested till the end with an heavy content. You want to get to the end to find out what really happened? What will happen now? And then? What's next for them? This movie is REAL, every situation is realistic. This is obviously one of the best movie of the year. It's a dark story, even a bit rude but I can see the truth in a lot of things that are portrayed. What is so shocking is that things like this are really happening in nowadays society. Overall Gone Girl has some flawless features, a dramatically powerful core, it's wonderfully acted and it's damn sad when you start thinking about it.",9,3,13,11 October 2014
The Theory of Everything," The Theory of Everything
","'One: remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Two: never give up work. Work gives you meaning, purpose and life is simply empty without it. Three: if you are lucky enough to find love, remember it is there and don't throw it away.' 'However bad life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. While there's life, there is hope.' <ul><li>Stephen Hawking</li></ul>The Theory of Everything deals with the life of the famous physicist Stephen Hawking. If you don't know who he is: he's arguably the most brilliant mind alive today; and his life from school to when he gets this disease and if you also don't know what it is: it's pretty much why you dumped a bucket of ice on your head last summer. In this movie Eddie Redmayne gives a really impressive performance embodying this physicist; performance which grants him an Oscar nomination for best actor in a leading role. In fact, as it is a progressive disease, every stage of this disease is like a completely new performance for him. You witnessed how he has to adapt and communicate in certain way. All this process of learning how to cope with this terrible disease, how how his family's relations change throughout the film and his romance is very interesting. Undeniably Felicity Jones is an absolute revelation, she is incredible, and totally deserves her Oscar nomination for best actress in a leading role. They both brilliantly portrayed good people in a shitty situation. Above all this film is about all Stephen Hawking's life aspects: from schooling, his theory, his disease and his relationships. However the film is not really showcasing and focusing mainly on his theory but on his life journey. The little chunks of science are really accessible though, as Stephen Hawking is explaining his theory such as everyone can get it. Finally, there are twists and turns that surprised me at times. Now I really hope Jupiter Ascending is good because otherwise it will ruin Eddie Redmayne' career and I am going to be really really sad. Overall The Theory of Everything fully deserves its Oscar nomination for best picture, it is really good. It is an engaging, romantic and touching movie.",10,2,3,21 January 2015
22 Jump Street," 22 Jump Street
","After making their way through high school (twice), big changes are in store for officers Schmidt and Jeko when they go deep undercover at a local college. 22 Jump Street is directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who are coming fresh after the success of The Lego Movie. It's starring Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill, back from the first movie 21 Jump Street. This film makes fun of comedies and action movies; and it does a great job at doing it. 21 Jump Street was a huge surprise, if I'm being honest I thought it would be terrible but instead it was hilarious and very clever. This time they've being able to surprising again with this film and even better. The chemistry between Tatum and Hill is once again excellent, and they handled action sequences better than in the first one. Plus, there are extra scenes to stick around for at the end; and let me tell you that the end credits are actually the funniest thing ever. This film is really effective, totally aware of itself and enjoyable. I laughed. I liked what they did with the character and where their relationship goes. What else could we ask for in a comedy? At the same time it's the exact same film as 21 Jump Street but the fact that they're joking about that and in the know of it makes it more O-K to watch. it's a tie as it feels on the one hand like a proper sequel and on the other hand like a reboot. Overall 22 Jump Street for the most part is better than 21 Jump Street, I loved the chemistry between the stars and there are a lot of great jokes.",7,4,10,16 September 2014
Magic Mike XXL," Magic Mike XXL
","Three years after Mike bowed out of the stripper life at the top of his game, he and the remaining Kings of Tampa hit the road to Myrtle Beach to put on one last blow- out performance.They're back with abs more defined than ever, Steven Soderbergh's praised Magic Mike is back for another go-round: this time with his longtime assistant, director Gregory Jacobs at the helm. A lot of women might have been disappointed in the first movie as it actually explored more of those men's life, what they do and the hardship it is to live that type of lifestyle. After three years in the making the project wasn't exactly a rush job. This mixed road trip and musical: this new breed provides a sense of structure. One of the major theme is something they talk about a lot in the film: the idea of being everything this person you're dancing for in this moment needs, everything this woman needs right now, you can give that to her and she loves you for it. It's philosophical. The film explores the strange beauty of that. They dance because they love it, they've chosen a legitimate career bringing happiness to the ladies of the world. Characters are all rethinking the male burlesque but it's exactly the same thing all over again for the muscly strippers, except with no Matthew McConaughey this time around. Channing Tatum is a very good dancer, but there's none of the physical brilliance of Tatum's performance in the Oscar worthy wrestling movie Foxcatcher; nor the wit and fun of his cop in 21 & 22 Jump Street. This film really deals with the camaraderie among those men, the conversations they have about what they do, their view point on their position in life and the way they affect the women their dancing for. While the draw of handsome men in their underwear is obvious, it's the chemistry between them that makes Mike Magic. These laid-back ladies' men manage to be blocky and vulnerable, in their geniality, old fashioned manners and tendency to put women on a pedestal. They're a welcomed antidote to the obnoxious all-male ensembles that have become mainstream in commercial comedy (Earliest Entourage being the best example). The attitude is that we all (mostly) know why we're here and let's have a good time! Writers have junked the do-I-really-want-to-be-a-male-stripper concept which allegedly gave the first movie depth, or at any rate some dramatic interest. There's no narrative pull or jeopardy about anything that happens on screen. Even the movie reminds you , just before its final showdown, that there's nothing at stakes here, nothing to be won or lost. Just the joy of amazingly sculpted bodies in motion. This fact increased the quotient of pure entertainment by lowering its ambitions. Stripping isn't comic or tragic: it's just great! However the film is actually a lot deeper than you might expect; with a quick witted script that refuses to take it all seriously as its simply notes the passage of time while stressing the importance of living in the present and making the most of your gifts. Their ideas is to make all the ladies in their audience feel special and catered, that it's about them but in a self consciously fun way, not as dominance. We're all invited to believe that this is of course not demeaning or ironic but romantic and fun. In this consciously fun way a positive energy is building throughout the movie from scene to scene until the explosive finale. Indeed, it's a gorgeous looking and beautifully shot movie (in every possible way...), with excellent cinematography and lightning, very similar to the first one. This isn't the MTV movie the trailer tries to make you think it is. Moreover, I may not be entirely over this fantastic gaz station scene, involving Joe Manganiello and a Backstreet Boys' song. Freaking good! Plus, there's one moment when the movie regain its soul and comes alive in its goofy way; it's when Mike is in his workshop, brooding about the possibility of hitting the road again and he improvises a little dance routine around his saws, drills and workbench. It's silly, but there's some flair, mostly because it's not weighed down with mock sexiness and the need to patronise women with naughty but nice pelvic thrusting. Finally, Magic Mike XXL is set in the real world too but delivers more of that original promises: you want the hottest male strippers, you got them. It may be the gayest straight film ever made or the straightest gay one and I don't care either way because this film is ridiculously entertaining. Overall, this film might be deceptive for a certain demographic because it's actually a well shot, well filmed, dealing with interesting and well acted character. In some ways Magic Mike XXL is the film that many feared the original might be (and wasn't). Channing Tatum still packs a bagful of charm along with his merry band of male strippers.",9,4,11,11 July 2015
Big Hero 6," Big Hero 6
","The special bond that develops between plus-sized inflatable robot Baymax, and prodigy Hiro Hamada, who team up with a group of friends to form a band of high- tech heroes. Big Hero 6 is the first Disney animated to have Marvel characters in it as the story is inspired by the Marvel comic of the same name! Apparently we get Marvel movies in a form of Disney movies now: it is a good time to be alive! There's even a Stan Lee cameo! Life is good. A large theme of this film is science, how it could be use to help mankind and before the adventure even begins they make it look cool. What makes this film special is the relationship that forms between Hiro and Baymax. In fact, Baymax is one of the most lovable character I've ever seen in an animated movie, everything that come out of his voice and behaviour is hilarious. This bound that forms between them is what gives the movie its emotional core. We mostly have seen this movie before as it is a sort of amalgamation of The Incredibles, Iron Man, The Avengers and Terminator 2; but the movie is written and directed so well, is so funny, that characters are what drown you into it. Obviously this film is aiming children but the major theme being science it will appeal to all ages, it has this feeling of ingenuity which can influence and inspire children to make something special for mankind. This film tells a story that is realistic and that children can understand, sometimes in life certain things do happen and even though this is a fictional/fantastic movie there are a lot of human emotions to be felt; emotions that are not forced at all. It is good for kids to know that they're out there. Finally it has some quite entertaining action scenes however for an hour and a half long movie it also has some pacing issue, at one point I feel like the movie was dragging a little bit but then it goes on. Overall Big Hero 6 is a movie for the entire family in which everyone can learn something and be entertained",8,31,45,13 February 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy," GoG
","Light years from Earth, 26 years after being abducted, Peter Quill finds himself the prime target of a manhunt after discovering an orb wanted by Ronan the Accuser. Guardians of the Galaxy was my second most anticipated movie of 2014 after X-Men: Days of Future Past . As a huge Marvel and Sci-Fi fan I've loved watching Star Trek, 2001, Firefly and of course Star Wars. I also always hoped Marvel Studios to run into their cosmic universe someday. There are been plenty of Sci-Fi movies to keep me entertained and to charge my imagination but I was waiting for Cosmic Marvel more than anything. The Asgardian Realms haven't really counted as they were cool but they use magic mainly as a super science. They were getting there with The Battle of New-York in The Avengers and this big hole in the sky above Manhattan spewing out Aliens. Now with Guardians of the Galaxy we're talking about all details of a stunningly beautiful spacecraft. That beautiful and ALIVE! This film is a celebration of the form and I never believed I'd ever get to see a movie quite like what James Gunn dished out with this one. GoG takes Marvel cinematic Universe and open it up to a galactic scale. It takes us to corners of space that only the truest Marvel fans knew even existed; which are very rich as extraordinary stories could be told there. This is probably why people could more easily identify with it as it's not 100% an American movie, it could be appreciated in a global scale as it even doesn't take place on Earth (for the most part it's all very Alien). James Gunn suitably created a world which hearken back to the past with bright colours of all Pop Sci-Fi movies like Forbidden Planet but then also being edgy, looking forward, being dirty and real in any way that other movies haven't been in that genre. It's also kind of a gamble for Marvel as those characters are not as well known as Captain America, Iron Man, Thor or Hulk. They are a bunch of losers who think they're bad and realize along the process that they're good. This Space Opera Odyssey is different from everything they've done before but in the same time it still feels like any other Marvel movie with a same humor, action, scope and sense of stakes. GoG is the holding truth to that tradition. This film is everything I wanted it to be! Read more at http://offscreenreviews.blogspot.fr/2014/08/guardians-of-galaxy.html",10,0,3,14 August 2014
The Imitation Game," The Imitation Game
","During World War II, mathematician Alan Turing tries to crack the enigma code with help from fellow mathematicians.The Imitation Game stars a brilliant bunch of British actors such as Keira Knightley, Benedict Cumberbatch, Mathew Goode, Allen Leech, Charles Dance and Mark Strong. I've already heard quite a bit about this movie so I was really eager to see it and I had the opportunity to attend a premiere of the film on Monday evening. A brilliant, brilliant, brilliant work by Benedict Cumberbatch. The man is a masterful actor, he's genuinely good in this movie; me writing those things about how amazing he is, it's almost a cliché at this point. He just nailed it and 300% deserves his Oscar nomination for best actor in a leading role. In addition to be well performed this film is also very well directed by Morten Tyldum, who is nominated for best director as well. The work he did with this film by portraying this time period in which people were actually fighting a war without ever touching any guns, it feels like their purpose is even more important than the physical combats that are going on. Moreover, Alan Turing is not the most likable person at first, a bit rude but really smart. It's complicated to understand him but through Benedict Cumberbatch performance, the script and the direction you just find yourself liking this man. This movie is not just about a man who is gay in a time period where it was literally illegal. It's largely about the struggle of hiding who you are and the difficulties that come with it. I think Cumberbatch got it right: the pain and torture it must be for someone to imitate something you're not.Overall this film looks terrific, the score and performances are excellent and the dialogue is so good that at one point you don't think at it like a dialogue anymore as you're so invested in the movie and the plot. It well deserves its Oscar nomination for Best picture.",9,3,9,27 January 2015
Jurassic World," Jurassic World
","Twenty-two years after the events of Jurassic Park, Isla Nublar now features a fully functioning dinosaur theme park, Jurassic World, as originally envisioned by John Hammond. After 10 years of operation and visitor rates declining, in order to fulfil a corporate mandate, a new attraction is created to re-spark visitor's interest, which backfires horribly.'Welcome to Jurassic Park' those words disclaimed and the music will be graved into my memory forever. When I saw the first Jurassic Park I had my mind blown, it was like cinema has been reinvented decades before and coming to life right in front of me. It made generations want to be directors, actors, writers: story tellers. It was a breakthrough movie with the use of technology and new cgi. Jurassic World depicts (at first) everything John Hammond wanted this place to be and it's fully operational. Here, the film renews the experience and transports us where Jurassic Park took us 22 years ago; capturing only a fraction of the original film's overflowing awe and wonder though. I didn't go to this movie hoping it to be better because lets be honest: it won't, ever; but just hoping it it would be good. The 14 years-layoffs since the last one may have helped to ease the mind of antiseptics. In fact, Universal's big summer action release is sufficiently 'toothsome' to make audiences everywhere happy for a return visit to a once-wild world that looks as safe as a Disney ride. The first wise move was to pretend that The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) and Jurassic Park III (2001) never existed and that the world depicted here descends directly from Spielberg's 1993 adaptation of Michael Crichton's novel. This line of reasoning takes us to the current star attraction of the park, in the form of a gigantic sea creature that zooms straight up out of its pool to swallow in one bite a big white shark: a spectacle which inclined to interpret as a ingenious admission by Steven Spielberg as to how far the world has moved on since Jaws. This film is as its core a caution about the dangers of trying to keep up by doing always bigger, better and faster. From the beginning, fuelled by Michael Crichton's big brain, Jurassic Park has always been a debate about the boundaries of science and here that explored further. It's an example of scientist's being so preoccupied with whether they could that they stopped thinking if they should. It's at once a sharp comment on our been-there-done-that generation which so quickly gets bored with the new and a genuinely menacing monster movie. The same thing could be said for our cinema industry and the global corporates that dictate the films we get every year. This movie lays out a really clever and thinly veiled critique nowadays blockbuster mentality. Jurassic world features a story about humankind's fallibility and inclination to bring destruction upon itself. Plus, there's something about director Colin Trevorrow's approach that marks him as a humanist rather than a director determined to hammer you into submission. Characters wise, Bryce Dallas Howard appears as the third generation of damsel in distress with a light touch of feminism, quite like Kate Capshaw in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984). They set up a stereotype of the uptight and over controlling girl, to knock it down afterwards; while nodding to our contemporary views, as we get a heroine who can take out a dinosaur with a stun gun and also run very fast away from them in heels. It's not hard to see why Joss Whedon tweeted, that early footage of her made him think of '70's era sexism'. It doesn't help that, rather foolishly, she spends the entire film in high heels; even sprinting in them, in one slow-mo sequence. More importantly, Chris Pratt is a sort of velociraptors whisperer, appealingly playing a watered-down Indiana Jones type of guy. With his charisma on screen he cements his reputation as movie's new leading man, giving a tremendously likable performance as Owen: easy going and relaxed, somewhere between Harrison Ford and Tom Hanks. If Guardians of the Galaxy Peter Quill was Pratt's Han Solo, then Owen is his Indiana Jones. He completely blew me away.Treverrow opted for a Spielbergian slow build as we don't see any dinosaur until roughly 20 minutes in the film. Moreover, he needed something new: enters the genetically engineered Indominus Rex. If a character noted early on in the movie that 'no one is impressed by a dinosaur anymore' let me tell you that you should have seen my face as I enjoyed every bit of them on screen. The problem is not that much that dinosaurs have ceased to impress but that dinosaurs and few good characters alone are not enough to sustain us in a sophisticated blockbuster culture that has the emotional landscape of Inside Out, the fugitive craziness of Fury Road and the all too human ape leader Caesar in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. Those movies are as bold in their storytelling and as rich in their emotional stakes as they are in their visual aspects. There are lots of characters and lots of subplots that doesn't really belong in the film which create storytelling flaws, where the story goes back to less important characters such as the two brothers and their family problems, then you're like 'Can we focus on our core here?!' Besides the self aware old fashion thrill and heroism, the romance when it flares is swift, unexpected and makes the heart leap. Furthermore the dinosaurs themselves have rarely looked better than they do under the direction of VFX supervisor Tim Alexander and it's what makes Jurassic World such a breathless summer entertainment.Check out the rest of the review here > http://offscreenreviews.blogspot.fr/2015/06/jurassic-world.html",9,16,42,14 June 2015

","When Tony Stark tries to jumpstart a dormant peacekeeping program, things go awry and it is up to the Avengers to stop the villainous Ultron from enacting his terrible plans.Marvel's Avengers Assemble hit theaters in 2012 and it was an instant success. Joss Whedon had delivered everything we wanted: charm, action and heart. The film is ranking now in the three highest grossing film of all time after Titanic and Avatar. Kevin Feige and his associates have built a cinematic empire quite unprecedented in Hollywood history, a genuine solar system. In fact, since the first Avengers movie we've seen Iron Man, Captain America, Thor on their own; now we have the chance to see them interact once more and how their have changed, how their world have changed through those films which is something very unique to Marvel in movie business. Age of Ultron is picking up where last year's Captain America: The Winter Soldier left off. The film actually dives right into the action as the team has already been assembled, we get straight to the things that matter and skip the hour long 'assembling' part of the first movie. It helps that characters wear these roles as comfortably as second skin. The film benefits also from this much more global scale, compared to its predecessor. We needed new location, as the majority of superhero movies are set in New-York, it became a little cliché and repetitive to see another tall skyline with a fight happening on top. Age of Ultron provides just that. Our heroes visit Europe, Asia and Africa as Ultron goes global in attempt to wipe out mankind. The opening sequence is an incredible piece of action filmmaking, staged as a single shot that shows all Whedon's brilliance.These characters are the most important thing. This film allows us to a deeper understanding of the characters and to emotionally connect with them in ways we never did before. There are material for humour and conflict as they pair up some characters in unexpected ways. Furthermore Humanity is found in each hero in more intimate and building-characters moment that had distinguished the first Iron Man and Captain America. We knew very little about Black Widow's back story, we heard some interesting hints at her past in The Avengers though. This is a character who's back story would translate very well onto the big screen due to her espionage narrative, plus she's a spy and spy have secrets. She also becomes the 'Hulk whisperer'. The intuitive tenderness with which she deals with the troubled and introspective Dr. Bruce Banner, played greatly again by Mark Ruffalo, is turning into a sweet love affair which gives the tender core of the movie and the most moving scenes. Clint Barton/Hawkeye checks in after spending most of the first movie as a mind controlled puppet. This film defines him as a person and as an Avenger as well, he's not only a cool guy with a bow and arrow. Distance from his usual family drama allows Hemsworth's Thor to shine a little more than last time. Steve Rogers/Captain America is once again a solid reminder of wartime values. While Stark's self doubt journey he took in Iron Man 3 is still evident and his obsession to create a perfect piece to protect the earth is still alive. Robert Downey Jr. is pure gold as Tony Stark and his differences with Captain America provides most of the comic relief, as well as the serious differences in their philosophy is where the real depth can be found.

Everest," Everest
","A climbing expedition on Mt. Everest is devastated by a severe snow storm. Mount Everest is fascinating, even though I have no particular desire to ever climb it. I guess it must be exhilarating to stand on the highest point on Earth. I've read that the odds of dying while climbing Everest differ based on how it's calculated, but seems to break down at about one for every 61 attempts. People pay thousands of dollars to take that risk. It's so dangerous that, if you die, they just leave your body there. It's like riding Space Mountain and seeing trails of dead bodies from people who did not finish Space Mountain. This is something viewers will have to wrap their mind around while watching people fight for their lives. This isn't a plane crash; no one forced these people to climb the tallest mountain in the world. Their fight for survival was completely their own doing. For the 99% of us who will never climb Mount Everest, this new 3D Imax drama provides plenty of vividly illustrated reasons to keep it off our bucket list. In fact, watching this film is all the experience with Everest I will ever need. However there are quite a few good reasons to see this solid dramatisation of the 1996 disastrous trek of the world's tallest mountain.First of all, the cast is rock-solid. Not knowing who survives and who doesn't beforehand, I did find myself rooting for characters, because they are real people. Including multiple characters sufficiently humanised to create real concern for their fates. With a gallery of individuals - some of whom are destined not to make it - you could say Everest is a disaster movie in the old Hollywood sense of the term, but it doesn't quite feel like one. And that's a good thing. The fact that some engaging, friendly Aussies are front and center as the main tour organisers and guides may account the competent, reassuring type you'd feel good entrusting yourself to on such an expedition. It's sometimes impossible to identify who's who under all the coats, hoods, goggles and masks. Moreover, Jason Clarke is an actor generally cast as the bad guy or hothead, but not here. His character, Rob Hall is the smart, capable, responsible professional. He has to enforce discipline and make his team of paying customers realise the dangers of doing something unnatural as scaling Everest. Plus, Josh Brolin's character becomes kind of a gag, masking real vulnerabilities. You expect the movie to be centrally about Clarke & Gyllenhaal and their friendship or enmity, as they begin the film by having a tense conversation about approaching Krakauer and whether their rivals team should co-operate. But this idea disappears into the snow as well. Jake Gyllenhaal has a role which is surprisingly peripheral and small. The poster appeared to give him third-wheeling. It's hardly that. His star power means that fans and even non-fans alike will be waiting for him to save the day or fail to save the day in some interesting way - or do something, anything at all. Director did a very good job at keeping the action coherent and involving. Everest seems bigger and more complex than anything he's done before. In narrative terms it's a little messy - as true stories tend to be. The dramatic focus is split around half a dozen characters based on real people and it's not clear who we should root for, or why this exactly particular expedition went as wrong as it did compared to all others. Everest doesn't go in for cheap shots or sensation for sensation's sake. Remaining close to the women and men who get to the top of the world. beginning with the eye-popping, you-are-there visual techniques that make you feel glad that you're not actually up there with them. Attention to realistic detail gives the film texture. Plus, In a way that is engagingly welcoming rather than just informational, the film provides an account of the 40-day- prep period. Where camaraderies develop, fear are exposed, anxieties and anticipation appear. The very fact that climbing Everest had become bu the second act of the film, if not simple, at least somewhat commonplace, is part of what led to the disaster that has been effectively condensed at the end. The second hour is devoted to the final ascent and its aftermaths, which is all quite intense. I also wonder if anyone will watch this movie and think to themselves 'You know what..? This looks great! I now want to climb this mountain and give it a shot!' I would guess no but climbers are wired differently than I am. Overall Everest is beautifully shot (one of the few times I'd recommend watching a movie in 3D) but despite its height this film doesn't quite delivers the edge-of-your- seat thrills that many were hoping for and all those moderately engaging characters means that there is no centrally powerful character.",7,0,0,26 September 2015
Selma," Selma
","A chronicle of Martin Luther King's campaign to secure equal voting rights via an epic march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama in 1965.Selma stars David Oyelowo as Martin Luther King in the first official theatrically released biopic about the legendary leader. The question is how can this film be the first one? This is sad to have waited for so long and so this film is very welcome. It is a great movie. Firstly, I have to admit that I was a little worried of how sentimental or too romanticised those kind of movie can be, and that, because Biopics have to be inspirational. However here, Selma is not cheesy or melodramatic at all. It takes a very factual look at things that happened on this specific period of his life and more importantly MLK doesn't look God-like, flawless or perfect. The movie doesn't loose that Human focused centre. It doesn't shy away from some of the flaws of the real man that are well known. I found that really interesting because he was first and foremost a human being just like any of us. Obviously he is this iconic leader who march in order to make his point relevant for other people to understand but deep behind, he is just a regular man, with doubts. This is important to show especially when the legends are too big, so the people can identify with the character, he's just like you and me. David Oyelowo is amazing in this film, he really captured what MLK fight for and of all the speeches I've studied he embodies the man spirit perfectly. However, there is no other really interesting character beside MLK which is sad because there were a lot of other people around him who were equally involved with the movement; but Oyelowo as MLK is so damn good that all other characters suffered because of that. Finally, the 'normal' scenes when he's home with his wife and children are equally as powerful as the speech scenes. Throughout the whole movie there is this political chest game happening between the government and MLK Civil Right Movement as they're not just marching, actual political issues were involved. Some scenes are hard to watch as that is what happened 50 years ago in Selma, Alabama. That was a really dark time in Human History.Overall Selma is a very factual and straight forward movie, filled with excellent performances and a very good directing/editing. A powerful movie.",9,1,2,11 March 2015
La La Land," La La Land
","A jazz pianist falls for an inspiring actress in Los Angeles.There was a moment back in the 1970s when the image of people bursting into song and dancing in the middle of a motion picture wasn't simply cheesy, it had come to be seen as downright strange. But not anymore. Our era is immersed in a retro musical culture. Damien Chazelle wants to make a musical that celebrates the classic Hollywood vision of love as a spiritual perfection. This is is really quite beautiful and as another Oscar season begins, this time under a dark cloud of controversy, movies like this one take their natural place: escapist wonderment that reminds audiences and cinephiles like me why they bother staring at flickering images on a wall in the first place. The heart and soul of this movie are rooted in the past and so are its characters. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is a romantic that almost feels chemically balanced to perfection. These two belong together because of Gosling, his malice dipped in honey, and Stone, her vivacity and pensive awareness; creating a teasing romantic connection. But mostly they belong together because... they dance like this. They are the new Gene Kelly and Shirley McLaine. Their not-so-'meet cute' takes place on the freeway. Indeed, the film opens with one of the most extraordinary sequences in years: a musical number, set in the morning commuting and traffic jam along with a vast stretch of L.A. freeway. The camera hurls with astonishing choreography intricacy among the passengers on their way to work. Cinematically the sequence makes the impossible look easy. It also serves as a setting for optimism and emotional expectations. By staging this number Chazelle invites us to return and stay inside an enchanted romantic universe. In my opinion, Damien Chazelle's La La Land is the most audacious big-screen musical in a long time. An irony of ironies, that is because it is the also the most traditional one. Director pays an awe-inspiring homage to the look, mood and stylised trappings of the Hollywood musicals of the 40's especially, the 50's with starry nights and streets lamps lighting up the innocence of soft-shoe romance and two people who were meant for each other literally dancing on air. The 'stroll' scene is one of my favourites as Damien Chazelle stages a gorgeous scene over a view of L.A.'s glittering carpet of lights that merges into pastel twilight. They sit, talk and start dancing, just like actors did on sets in the 1950s. Sooner, she lays her eyes on...him. Across a crowded room. A stranger playing the piano. Except that the look on her face tells you that he is no stranger at all. She is not just starring - she is falling. That is the sublimity of Old Hollywood where we believed that it could happen, just like that. Maybe only French cinephiles of a certain age will realise that the writer director's true inspiration here is not as much from vintage Hollywood musicals as from the late French director Jacques Demy's two landmark 1960s musicals with Michel Legrand, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and The Young Girls of Rochefort - especially the latter which was far more dance and jazz oriented. What I love about Damien Chazelle's movies is that he incorporates music in his movies, he did that with Whiplash and he does that more than ever here. The music becomes a character among all other characters. Moreover, L.A. has rarely looked this gorgeous in films, a credit to the director's romantic imagination as well as to the technical expertise of Swedish cinematographer Linus Sandgren (American Hustle)Finally, La La Land is the story of old-school dreamers trapped in a world of entertainment commerce that is designed to crush the life out of you. It is a reminder that the often self-destructive act of dreaming is the very elixir of life. This film is a love story to passionate people, people who have a dream, people who want to succeed in doing what they love. Someone who is going to, no matter what anyone says, go ahead. This film grabs the shoulders of anyone who is passionate out there, shaking them until they get out there and follow their dreams.Overall, La La Land is an unapologetically romantic tribute to classic movie musicals, splashing dream - chasing optimism everywhere. I was utterly absorbed by the film's simple storytelling and the terrific lead performances from Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling who are both excellent, particularly Emma Stone, who has never been better. They both carry Chazelle's musical numbers off with delicacy and charm.",10,3,13,12 January 2017
Sicario," Sicario
","An idealistic FBI agent is enlisted by an elected task force to aid in the escalating war against drugs at the border area between the US and Mexico.Prisoners director Denis Villeneuve returns with a suspenseful and ever surprising cartel thriller. Sicorio begins with one carnage scene which sets the apocalyptic tone for everything that follows. In fact the plot demands attention but never becomes too difficult to follow and displays an almost sadistic level of suspense. The message is: are we willing to bend the rules and sell our souls to fight a war that will probably never be won? Plus, who earns our sympathy? From Brolin's to Del Toro's characters. The answer is no one. The environment characters are constantly surrounded by sips into the audience and you feel the crashing weight of their situation. Some may complain that the lead, played effectively by Emily Blunt, is a sexist portrayal. But this might just be the best piece I've ever seen from her. In a terrific performance that recalls the ferocity of Jodie Foster in The Silence of the Lambs. Though she's still young and naive enough to believe that there's a right side in this war and that the US is on it. Moreover, Benicio Del Toro is every inch impressive, with a considerably more complicated character. Calm as a predator lying in wait, or revealing flashes of humanity when least expected. Even sometimes a Hannibal Lecter-ish lust for this young woman thrust into his path. Denis Villeneuve is a master of the kind of creeping tension that circles around the audience like a snake suffocating its prey. The opening sequence is a marvel of action and exposition. In fact, the film opens with a drug-raid sequence, slickly handed by Villeneuve. Still Sicario has a definite beginning, middle and end director isn't interested in cosy, comfy three acts armature. The film smoothly departs first into a kind of Zero Dark Thirty style and then it wades into an old fashioned No Country for Old Men blood-and-revenge territory. The movie flows extremely well as a suspense film. Even scenes where nothing remarkable happen, you are waiting for something to happen. Villeneuve stages one extraordinary suspense set-pieces after another. Using sharp, colour saturated, compositions of cinematographer Roger Deakins - probably one of the best cinematographer alive; and airtight cutting of editor Joe Walker and the subtly menacing score of composer Johan Johansen. There's no hope, this film is utterly dark. Overall, Denis Villeneuve with Sicario delivers (once again) an impeccably well crafted film.",10,1,4,11 October 2015
Steve Jobs," Steve Jobs
","Steve Jobs takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution, to a paint of the man at its epicentre. The story unfolds backstage at three iconic product launches, ending in 1998 with the unveiling of the iMac.This movie establishes as the only Steve Jobs movie the broader public will really need or want to see, offering a richly unconventional take on the life of an American visionary. For those who believed that the late co-founder of Apple was both an iconic visionary and a monster with a stone where his heart should be, rest assured that writer, director and star Michael Fassbender have given their subject the brilliant, ingeniously designed and monstrously self aggrandising movie he deserves. The question this film answers is why? Why Steve Jobs is that way? Why he sees the world that way? Why does he do the things he does? And unfortunately we don't often get that sort of answers in movies. That is why this new take on Jobs' life is quite interesting. A smart film driven by dialogues and great moments that allow the actors to shine. In the first act alone, the film establishes core aspects of Jobs' personal and professional identity that will be further advanced and imaginatively set in the next two segments. Plus, the movie emotional core comes from Steve relationship and family life. Though sometimes the presence of ex and child Lisa seems pretty unrealistic and even forced. We witness firsthand his impossible perfectionism and refusal to take no for an answer. Jobs' gift for innovation was perhaps inextricable from his capacity for cruelty. The puppet master who kept all around him on strings. The impresario of a circus dedicated to the creation and dramatic unveiling of technological wonders that changed the world. More importantly, this film explores Steve Jobs and who he was as a person: it doesn't wildly explores his life but more his inner life. Moreover, hardly any of this would matter without a dynamic actor at the centre of things, nailing the part of Jobs. Michael Fassbender fully delivers the essentials of how we can perceive the man: intellectual brilliance, force of personality and power to inspire. Both Christian Bale and Leonardo DiCaprio were once embarked for this role, but it's hard to imagine either of them matching Fassbender's capacity to engage and repel at the same time. He knows exactly how to toss the writer's dialogue and delivers a performance so deep that it's impossible to take your eyes off him. His on screen presence at every minute makes it all the better. Danny Boyle wasn't an automatic fit for the material. However, it's his best film in years. Here he made a very straightforward movie, compared to his usual style he pulled back a little this time. One of the major positive part of this film is the choice Boyle made to film the first act of 1984, in 16 mm film and as time progresses to 1988, the second act is in 35 mm, to finally shot the last act of 1998 on digital so that it gives the movie a genuine tangible feeling of technological progression. The film's face is evolving with its products. The script is written by Aaron Sorkin who is in my opinion one of the best screenwriter of our time, he wrote The Social Network, A Few Good Men and created the series The Newsroom: this man is a genius regards to writing. Blowing away traditional storytelling conventions, Sorkin's screenplay has mastered the art of conveying a character's essence. Not by delivering the most comprehensive account possible (Pixar, Xerox and cancer are just topics that go unmentioned), but by compressing the most relevant topics into one significant time frame. Rather three time frames, each one centred around the public launch of a Jobs-created product that would change the course of his career and thus the course of global technology. Overall, Steve Jobs has a boldly theatrical three act-structure, tightly choreographed narratives and visually clean lines. The dominance of Aaron Sorkin's script and focus on business mean this film will mostly appeal the Apple geek. Filled with amazing performances for a dialogue driven film, this film is the perfect synthesis of writing, performance and direction.",9,0,1,6 February 2016
12 Years a Slave," 12 Years a Slave review
","This story begin in the the late 19th Century, introducing the character of Salomon Northup a very talented free black musician. Who has been abducted and sold into slavery. Through Salomon Northup story, the acclaimed director Steve McQueen offers the darkest part of American history. This film is not all about Slave Trade. It's much more than that. At that time African American were treated like chattel property that owners can move and buy as they want, a kind of hereditary slavery rise, as children born of a slave mother were slave as well. They were born and raise to be slave. 12 Years a Slave is not an usual slave story, as Salomon knows freedom. He was living in the North with his family, he has a job. Then, he has to deny his name, his freedom, who he is in order not to live but to survive. How a man can have the strength to endure this promise lifelong servitude? Mr.Ford, his first owner appeared, on the one hand as the worst one of them all as far as a slave owners is concerned because he is saying one thing but doing another. He knows that Salomon is a free man, and what does he do? Nothing. On the other hand he is not pure evil, if he was born in different circumstances he may have been a more acceptable person. Nevertheless, female characters have a great part in this story, either in good and bad ways. Patsey depicts a sort of stereotypes of the black young woman slave, who try to escape her faith from an assured death. In contrary , her master's wife, Ms Epps came out to be worst than her husband (starring Michael Fassbender) when she beg him to beat their slaves or whipped Patsey to death. Even when a slave woman let her children behind, a mother seems to have no compassion for her, when she may be the only person on earth who can understand what she's going through. Thus, a religious pattern is enlightened along the film as if Faith was the last way for Salomon to find peace and Freedom. A very special care is given to breathing, once when Mr.Ford save Salomon from death and once again when Patsey's been raped by Michael Fassbender character. The violon which Mr.Ford give to Salomon at the beginning of the film is a symbol of his previous life as a free man, it represents hope. When all hopes are lost Salomon fall into darkness and despair, burn his letter to his family and broke his violon. he is not fighting his destiny anymore. Until his testimony to Bass, whom genuinely save his life. This film was very profound and I'll certainly remember it for a very long time partly because it taught me a few things about Slavery that I didn't know already and it encouraged me to read the book. I encouraged you to do the same!",10,1,4,24 January 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," Edge Of Tomorrow
","An officer finds himself caught in a time loop in a war with an alien race. His skills increase as he faces the same brutal combat scenarios, and his union with a Special Forces warrior gets him closer and closer to defeating the enemy. Edge of Tomorrow is based on the novel All you need is kill written by Hiroshi Sakurazaka and also adapted as a manga by Ryousuke Takeuchi. This film is directed by Doug Liman, best known for Bourne Identity which I really loved back then. It was a very good franchise starter depending on Liman style. My biggest fear was that this style won't go that well with this type of sci-fi epic movie. But surprisingly I was wrong. Edge of Tomorrow has a very different style than Bourne, with long takes and big action shots. It's an non-stop action movie from beginning to end, as well as incredibly entertaining and at the same time very funny. The humorous is that he has to relive the same day over and over again. However they manage to keep it not repetitive at all, which is really hard especially with this kind of story lines. They make it feel new and in a solely different way each time. In fact, they found a good way to make those repetition scenes entertaining, by going for the comedy of the situation rather than for the drama. Plus, special effects are solid peculiarly the alien are looking great. Moreover, Tom Cruise delivers a good performance, he's funny and in the meantime sells the drama. I can't help myself to make the parallel with Oblivion as he's always committed to his action roles and always really good at it as well. There is a chemistry between him and Emily Blunt, who is also completely badass. However, when we start to think about it the unbelievable thing is that every time he's talking with her she knew him for a few hours so she can't really get to attached, but on the other hand Tom Cruise' character doesn't feel that way because he's met her many times and the viewers feel that way too; that's why we can fall into it easily. Finally, the suspense and tension of the third act is so palpable. Edge of Tomorrow is relevant for today's audience as it deals with the detachment from which we view war through today's media. Overall, this film is a solid smartly constructed movie which feels refreshing, intriguing and reliable.",7,0,2,13 June 2014
Pitch Perfect 2," Pitch Perfect 2
","After a humiliating command performance at Lincoln Center, the Barden Bellas enter an international competition that no American group has ever won in order to regain their status and right to perform.Pitch Perfect comes back with a sequel, directed by Elizabeth Banks. Everyone is familiar with these characters by now and we all wanted to see what could happen to them after the first movie. So the good things in this acapella world aside, now we are witnessing those characters growing older and becoming real people. This film allows us to spend more time on characters that people love, to tell more of their stories and to see where these women be at three years later. While in the first one it was more about coming together, bonding and being freshmen; this film mainly deals with the notion of graduation as their in majority in their last year of college, companionship they have in college that will last forever as Bellas will always be Bellas, moving on, breaking apart, leaving the nest, staring life right in the face and going their separate ways. However they find themselves right back where they started: as underdogs of acapella. There are a lot going on this time, plot- and character -wise. Some endearing elements were taken back from the first film such as the romance between Beca and Jesse, that keep all the component in harmony as they are settled characters. Indeed they are a nice balance to the melodramatic aspect of the movie, grounded to the real stakes of this world. Yet once again Fat Amy, starring Rebel Wilson, is very charismatic. She embodies a confident woman that never thinks about her size at all. Proving that your body type doesn't determine your fate in life. Giving her a real love story with Bumper is such a good idea as she really deserves it and both actors have a great chemistry together. John Michael Higgins' character smoothly delivers his misogynic lines such as 'Let's hear it from the girls too ugly to be cheerleaders!', and casual racism throughout the movie is even funnier this time around!Moreover, new girls fit right into the dynamic of the group. They're all the same characters but pushed a little bit further, they're a little bit bigger, crazier and global. Hailee Steinfeld's character represents what Pitch Perfect has become which is that kind of bonding enthusiasm and likability. People will identify with the movie for different reasons but ultimately for the joy and happiness it spreads. Obviously men are not the targeted demographic of this movie - or basically people who don't watch Glee. Nonetheless, if you just enjoy music this film will get points with you. Musically, the songbook is far hipper with a younger song selection. Executive music producers J.Jordan and J.Michels have ensured that every performances are note-perfect and soundtrack album ready; which I have to admit rather detracts any sense of realism: it's not humanly possible to sing so in-sync spontaneously. Plus, jokes are all amazing, not one falls flat. You clearly know where the movie goes from the beginning but this film is not here for an Oscar, it's just here to be fun and show some good acapella. Finally, Banks has crafted a sequel that's edgier, sexier and best of all more female centered than the first one. Showing that women can be as funny as men, even funnier. So get over it, picthes! Overall Pitch Perfect 2 proved once again that acapella is not lame at all, with a nerdy and inspirational movie and with much more sophisticated layered music.",10,88,159,10 May 2015
Whiplash," Whiplash
","A promising young drummer enrolls at a cutthroat music conservatory where his dreams of greatness are mentored by an instructor who will stop at nothing to realise a student's potential. I finally got to see Whiplash starring Miles Teller and J.K Simmons. I remember the first time I noticed Miles Teller in a movie and that was in The Spectacular Now; with those two films he has shown us that he has a lot of talent and here especially on the drum. However, J.K Simmons in this film is an absolute revelation. He's brilliant and totally Oscar worthy. What's the most beautiful aspect of this movie is the drive Teller's character feels, this desire he has to be great, this passion he has for this subject and how he struggles to express it to his family. Every person with a dream and a passion for a particular subject where you know everything there is to know about it can understand that. Sometimes it can be hard to communicate this idea to someone else, make them understand and appreciate it as you do. This is a psychological film. This movie is so much more than just music, it's a psychological battle between two people who believe so strongly in their opinion. In fact, J.K Simmons' character is coming at him at all angle: verbally, mentally and physically. He's taring this kid down in the first place and till the end he's giving him hell the entire time. This movie builds a level of intensity that I haven't seen a lot in movies (and I've seen a lot of movies); particularly through the tune and drumming but also through something bigger, it's so intense because it's so personal. We get Teller's character feelings as we've all wanted something so bad enough, so bad in our lives that we'll literally put ourselves through hell to get it (and if you don't. Don't worry. You will!). Overall Whiplash is an intense film in which I can't see one flaw. It's simple and efficient. It deals with an ambitious young character played by a really good actor and his teacher played by J.K Simmons who kills it! Somehow you're able to project yourself into this movie and now more I think about it, better it gets!",10,0,1,11 January 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," The Wolf of Wall Street
","The Wolf of Wall Street promised to be THE film of this late 2013 year and indeed, I can tell you that it was a successful gamble. After Django Unchained and The Great Gatsby earlier this year, Leonardo DiCaprio is joining (one more time) Martin Scorsese in one of the most overwhelming film ever produced. The carefully set scenes of money, sex and drugs are efficiently paced by a non-stop and breathtaking rhythm. Which stops three times, based on several important parts of Jordan Belfort's life. His involvement in taking Steve Madden company public, his first divorce and when he tries to flee with his daughter. During the whole film a sort of sadistic atmosphere settles, little by little we can see the evolution of Jordan's character. He begins as a greedy trade connector and rise till his successful life as a wealthy stockbroker. A parallel narration is settled between Jordan and us as if he's trying to justify his criminal actions, it can be related to his thoughts, conscience or inner morale. It makes me think a lot of Kevin Spacey's character in House of Cards, who talks directly to us. In Wolf of Wall Street, Belfort is trying to explain why he behaved like that. None of the FBI's point of view is shown, only the 'bad guy' is display here which give him more credibility. He doesn't appear like a real white collar criminal, like a real threat, because all he does is having fun doing what he loves the most: earning money. Moreover this year must be very prolific for DiCaprio. Leo's acting all along this more or less three hours long film is BRILLIANT and I don't know if it's Scorsese direction or just his talent but it makes the film works efficiently. Pointed out the moral and cultural decadence more than just the economic part of all this process. His 'Empire' is compare to America : where you could choose to be who you want to be in a country where all you have to do his choose which opportunity you want. And obviously America always win. Jordan Belfort's fall involves both his private and public life. As on the one hand Jordan's wife is tired of all his excess (drugs, pills, sex, alcool, etc.) and decides to divorce. And on the other hand his implication in crime and widespread corruption on Wall Street and in the corporate banking world, as a result he is convicts of more than twenty official charges and sentenced to thirty-six month imprisonment.

"Hail, Caesar!"," Hail, Caesar!
","A Hollywood fixer in the 1950s works to keep the studio's stars in line.Hail, Caesar! lines between drama and comedy get blurred, but so do the lines of what makes a good story. Coen Brothers celebrate the movies of this era and have some good-natured fun at the expense of the system that produced them. This film is full of real world specific references ranging across nearly 15 years, beginning with Capitol Pictures based openly on MGM in the 1940/50s. There's a lot of variety in the Coen's formula and an extremely wide range of tones. But all of their stories eventually come down to the question of whether the protagonists have any sort of personal moral compass, whether they follow it, and how the world punishes them if they stray from it. In a blind viewing, the average cinephile could probably identify this film as a Coen Brothers picture, because of their signature: serious people taking ridiculous situation gravely, straight-faced film references, several distractingly famous people taking on cameo-levels roles and George Clooney playing a dummy. The main theme is a man following his code, but also, the craziness of man, the nature of faith and the terror of trying to figure out what path through life is the correct one to take.This film showcases the greatest cast the Coens have ever assembled. Josh Brolin character is a fast, decisive thinker who doesn't examine his choices once he's made them; though he was really good, funny and likable as Eddie Mannix. Plus, a great performance comes from the 26-year-old Alden Ehrenreich, astonishingly good at playing a bad actor and surprisingly selfless. This film deals more directly with existential questions than most best-known feature films about filmmaking; about the frustrations of the business, most of them feature characters touching on the questions 'Why do I do this? Is it really possible to make art under these conditions? Am I selling out? Should I get out of this business while I can?'. While divided on these questions and the industry in-jokes are nearly always funny, this film is unabashedly in love with Hollywood and regards the 1950s studio system with the utmost scepticism even as it becomes an expression of movie love at its purest.Hail, Caesar! delights in the genuine magic of the old studio machine and it luxuriates in the details of this period. As ever it is the details that win us over. This is a very weird movie but in a good way because it's different. The cinematography by R.Dickens is beautiful. Coens Brothers craft seemingly grinds to an even sharper point of perfectionism and clarity than usual. The most sublime moments in the film occur when the behind the scenes machinery drops away, the films being produced become the film we're watching and we're invited to lose ourselves in a state of vintage Hollywood.Next to these gemlike moments - which the Coens very smart editors of their work as always, refuse to linger on - the story being told here all fades into insignificance : Baird's disappearance is resolve with little tension or surprise which leaves some narrative holes: it's rather an excuse to explore 1950s Hollywood than the other way around. Overall, Hail, Caesar! is a noising new testament to that old time religion known as the movies. This film is one of the Coen's most serious pictures as well as their silliest.",7,1,3,19 February 2016
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies
","Bilbo and Company are forced to engage in a war against an array of combatants and keep the terrifying Smaug from acquiring a kingdom of treasure and obliterating all of Middle-Earth. After fifteen years, five films and countless hours of on screen magic depending on whether you were hardcore enough to sit through the extended editions and features of each films; Peter Jackson brings this journey to a close and to what now ranks as one of the most monumental work ever completed by a single filmmaker. It's also arguably his biggest challenge. Without wasting time on any kind of flashback or prologue, the film plunges right in where The Desolation of Smaug left off; It's like beginning The Empire Strike Back with Luke Skywalker blowing up the Death Star. Here opening with Smaug swooping down in a blaze of vengeance, while the panicked Lake Town locals disperse. It's an exciting sequence animated by a real sense of danger and by the nightmare figure of Smaug himself: one of the movie's most special effect, again voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch. Plus, we are launched into nearly an hour or arguing and reflecting as various armies get ready for war. This is an effective crescendo to battle and when the things do finally kick off, the fight worth the wait. The battle is endlessly inventive. From all corner of the land, and the frame, they come: dwarfs, elves, men, assorted forest creatures and orcs; all displaying numerous ingenious tactics to sustain pretty much every verse. In fact, Peter Jackson is able to give an intimacy to even the biggest, noisiest battle scenes. This final instalment of The Hobbit trilogy ties very well onto the last two films but also with the beginning of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It does feel like The Return of the King at times, when bodies are just flying everywhere and heads rolling all over the place. It is long and epic. The Battle of the Five Armies is the strongest, boldest film in this trilogy and provides just the send off that this series deserves. Peter Jackson knows when to punctuate the carnage with a gag or a tender moment as it's not focusing on the action and the battle itself. This film is rewarding all the characters built up over two and a bit movies, all f them flawed. With Martin Freeman ever-excellent Bilbo more of a player this time. Indeed some conversation between Bilbo and Thorin create the most interesting moment of the movie, as Bilbo has the Arkenstone and Thorin really wants it. It's starting to drive him mad, almost like Gollum towards the ring. This film feels psychologically weightier than the previous one, largely a credit to Richard Armitage who plays Thorin with the paranoid despotic rage of a Shakespearean King. Yet he never allows him to become a monster. Gandalf: Sir Ian McKellen, of course everybody knows he is awesome and knocks out the part. The Stage is set for other characters to stand out, such as Luke Evans, as Bard, a genuine leader and maybe the most human character ever in Middle-Earth; while Kili (starring Aidan Turner) and Tauriel's (Evangeline Lilly) romance is undeniably touching. At the end all of the key players are where they need to be. Wrapping things up with a suitably return to the Shire that effectively brings the saga full circle. It's hard not to marvel at Peter Jackson's facility with these characters and this world, which he seems to know as well as John Ford knew his Monument Valley. It's easier to see now that it stops the entire Hobbit project as a labour of love on Jackson's part, rather than a descent into the box-office opportunism. This film is a fitting cap to an extended series that, if nothing else, has transformed Tolkien's place in the wider culture. His books were once strictly for teen nerds (we've all been there), while The Battle of the Five Armies is just as enjoyable as each of the five movies that came before it. I'm part of these nerds and I've always been a huge fan of Tolkien's work. Much of the movie is not like the book at all but I was aware of if that going in: there are a tone of added characters. Purists have to deal with it I guess! The most important point is that Peter Jackson captured perfectly the tone of the source material he has adapted. If a filmmaker is able to capture the feels and tone of the source material then he has succeeded and Jackson's vision of Middle-Earth is as good as we'll ever see.Find the end HERE http://offscreenreviews.blogspot.fr/",10,9,19,13 December 2014
Finding Dory," Finding Dory Among Pixar's Magic
","The friendly-but-forgetful blue tang fish begins a search for her long-lost parents, and everyone learns a few things about the real meaning of family along the way. Finding Dory is written and co-directed by Andrew Stanton, returning to Pixar after the live-action fiasco of John Carter. Pixar movies have been so consistently good for so long now that they carry the burden of infinite expectations. Anything less than a masterpiece is eventually a disappointment. That's why Finding Dory is fine. It's not Toy Story, The Incredible, Finding Nemo or even Inside Out. But it's a perfectly enjoyable family film, a little bit like what we got when I was younger – back in the 90s, Disney used to ship straight to DVD/VHS those Lion King spin-offs. Unfortunately, you also feel a sense of déjà vu. Dory's quest to be reunited with her parents is more or less the same exact fate that a little clown fish named Nemo.Dory, that adorable, excited blue tang fish, suffers from short-term memory loss. The slightest distraction or break in concentration wipes her mind clean. The creators have done something better: they figured out how to take an already perfect character and deepen her in an exquisitely satisfying way. In a flash, a character with a singular funny trait comes at us in a whole new way. She's no longer a (daffy) amnesiac. She's a child fish with a serious disability.There's real emotion. You feel every (ounce) of Dory's panic and her parents' desperation – something that any father or mother who's ever taken their eyes off of their children in a supermarket can identify with (I assume). On her own Dory grows up and matures into the impressible, caffeinated stammering of Ellen DeGeneres – who is the heart and soul of the movie. Like Robin Williams before her in Aladdin, Ellen DeGeneres has this gift as a comedian to keep the film moving and speeding along. Dory's glory is that her amnesia makes her completely responsive to life. This film eventually is about how the past, for her, isn't really so past. It's just the ability to remember life as we're living it, one moment at a time. As surely as the death of Bambi's mother, the premises of this movie rips a small emotional hole in the audience's heart. One of this film most important messages is how resonant Dory will be for parents of children with disabilities. To them, life can feel like a lonely struggle where anxiety constantly affects their state of mind. If you are invested hard enough, the film's message to these parents is: you are not alone! Dory's failing memory may be a handicap, but it's also the key to her resilience. Finally, this movie like many before it invites you to dive in with your eyes, which is why these movies are submersive daydreams for children. Who needs 3D glasses? Even if you – like me – happen to see this film in 2D, just about every shot in it pops out at you with beauty.Overall through her journey Dory learns to remember what life is all about. This film doesn't quite fit in the top drawer as it lacks that full-on audacity of imagination. Yet, it has so much soul and heart-of-the-ocean visual poetry that some of us will cherish it as a classic.",9,5,15,29 June 2016
Arrival," Another Close Encounter
","Arrival scored big at the weekend box-office and is muscling its way into the awards race. It has been almost 40 years since Steven Spielberg made Close Encounter to the Third Kind. That is not a Spielberg film that people tend to revisit the way they do Jaws, Raiders or E.T. In its time, though, Close Encounter cast a spell of majestic awe that still reverberates through pop culture today. This film with its obsessiveness and mystery, its spaceship of light that seemed as big as a city; made the prospect of an extraterrestrial visit look as wondrous, eccentric and spectacular as we imagined it might be. Amy Adams is the film's quiet and luminous heart. Jeremy Renner's role is rather modest but he also seems to understand that, while Amy Adams draw on her gift for making each and every moment quiver with discovery. The actress is alive to what is around her, even if it is just ordinary, and when it is extraordinary the inner fervour she communicates is quite transporting. She is more respected as an actress than bankable. The film isn't a sequel nor is it a superhero film, it is not an Alien invasion film like Independence Day Resurgence that basically exists as an excuse to blow up stuff. Sci-fi isn't just for boys. Amy Adams is front and centre in this film, a performance that surely owned her all this Oscar buzz. The film also gives her character a personal tragedy to live with and a one that grounds the fantastical story in human emotion. As a woman, I really do believe that there is a genuine emotional storyline that can speak to women, either mothers or daughters. This film has been made by the godly gifted director: Denis Villeneuve, who crafted Sicario and Prisoners. He manages once again, to ground this story in a hyper- realistic way. By hooking us with the news of spaceships hovering over Earth in the most random and unsensational way possible. Denis Villeneuve builds our anticipation with great flair. Discovering what the Aliens look like, sound like and how they communicate is the dramatic heart and soul of the picture. That kind of suspense is pretty rare these days. Plus, this film has an obvious poetic grandeur. The images are stately and vast, with an almost super-earthly clarity. Indeed, there is a pleasing circularity to the structure of this movie and also a circular logic to it. True to its title, Arrival makes an absorbing spectacle of the initial Alien set- up. Though the Aliens don't quite have personalities, there is still something tender and touching about them. There are also, frankly, elements of familiarity. The sounds they make, and the way they look. The point being that even if Denis Villeneuve is a bold and brilliant filmmaker, when it comes to this subject, Spielberg's vision is hard to get away; it still somehow infuses everything. Finally, this notion that if you learn a new language it can rewire the way you think and that the Alien language is their big gift to Humanity is beautiful. Add to it that when learning this language, then you are able to rewire your brain and it actually alters the nature of time: it is mesmerising. The film ties it in with *SPOILER ALERT* a back story that forms the action about Louise and the daughter (in a prologue) who she watched grow up and die. Overall, like all the best sci-fi it has something pertinent to say about today's world, particularly about the importance of communication and living in the moment. An ideal that shouldn't need any translation. It grips you with the strength of its ideas and the quality of its execution.",10,4,12,16 November 2016
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Birdman
","A washed-up actor, who once played an iconic superhero, battles his ego and attempts to recover his family, his career and himself in the days leading up to the opening of his Broadway play.Birdman is directed by newly Oscar winner Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and stars Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, Naomi Watts and Emma Stone. This film deals with a multitude of theme: one existence, one place in real life, how you view your own life, duality, Critics, family life, drinking, special effects and blockbusters. Firstly, the way the movie was filmed surprised me: the film is made to look as if it's one continuous shot through clever editing techniques, really long takes and some very skilled actors to accomplish that. It feels like the opening shots of Goodfellas but for the entire movie which is a mind-blowing experience and kind of revolutionary. I can't even fathom how a movie can work like that. This aspect of the film makes us feel like we are behind the scene, on set with these people, it feels absolutely real. The score is very jazzy and feels unpredictable which is very similar to the movie itself. Michael Keaton plays Emma's Stone father, they have a difficult relationship. In fact, they all feel like they are pretending in real life and throughout the the movie Keaton character ears the voice of Birdman in his head telling him to do things; he also happens to have some mysterious power of some sort. This movie is WEIRD. Keaton character battle is a little bit like Dumbledore's saying 'You do what's right or you do what's easy.'. Undeniably every character in this film is dealing with an intense psychological issue of some kind that makes them feel split as they're two halves for one whole. It touches also, on distance, what your place in the world is and what you're here for. The movie is filled with brilliant metaphorical imagery which install thoughts into your brain, explained afterwards through very good film making and excellent acting. I can't say it enough but actors are AMAZING. Michael Keaton pulls off the best performance of his entire career, Edward Norton is the best he's been in years and Emma Stone may be the best she's ever been. Birdman approaches blockbuster movies, not in an insulting way, it questions our vision of this industry. However what hold the biggest impact on me is the way this film deals with Critics in general. In a scene Michael Keaton literally explodes and exposes in a monologue each and every problem film criticism knows nowadays. It's heaven! Indeed, film critics do not talk about film making anymore, they do not talk of a scene structure or shot composition, they are looking for a quote they can put on a DVD cover (yeah DVD because I'm old fashioned). I'm guilty of those things myself but it doesn't make his point less relevant to me. An other scene assault on audience members that don't care about anything but green screen and explosion sequences. I do absolutely love good action movies and some big fun entertainment movies but I also respect Art films that are trying to be just ART: a film that has so much thoughts provoking behind and so much to say about Humanity, relationships and also movie business in our society. It emphasises perfectly the conflict of Hollywood right now: Blockbusters Vs Indie Movies. If you are in a Blockbuster it doesn't mean you're a bad actor as well as if you are in a smaller production it doesn't mean you're a good actor. This is breaking the fourth wall and talking to all of us. Plus, the fact that they reference real Hollywood people such as Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Ryan Gosling or Jeremy Renner. Those references are things we actually know as entertainment, as Hollywood movies and actors. It makes it feel more real, like it is happening in our world.Overall everyone was great in this film. I felt like I was part of it, I was there, it was unique and original. Birdman is one of those movie you're glad someone made it happened. We really do need more movie like this one! After this movie you are going to notice all the scenes changing and all the jump cuts involved in the editing process of a movie, EVERYTHING. It's going to drive you nuts!",10,11,21,27 February 2015
The Big Short," The Big Short
","From outsiders in the world of high-finance who predicted the credit bubble collapse of the mid-2000s decide to take on the big banks for their lack of foresight and greed.Adam McKay to me was the least likely candidate in Hollywood director to make a brainy movie such as The Big Short; as the only film I've ever seen from him is Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. Still this film is based on Michael Lewis' 2010 non-fiction Best-Seller. Of all the current century's most cataclysmic world- historical events: the 2007-2008 financial crisis is probably among the most poorly understood. The road taken by this film is by far the most radical approach of the story. Above all, the cast is on point, to be sure, with everyone seeming to take enthusiastic pleasure in disappearing into the roles of societal misfits of one kind or another. In fact the script focuses on the handful of men in the field - most of whom are at least half-insane. However none of them are really easy to root for. Ryan Gosling's character uses smart-ass charm, leading viewers through the ins and outs of this game. Christian Bale as a socially awkward, speed metal-loving-doctor-turned- money manager who was the first to notice that the market was built on a house of cards. Only Steve Carell's character comes out as genuine and empathetic. This film reminded me a lot of The Wolf of Wall Street in its hyper-caffeinated energy. Plus director hyper real approach might be exactly what the story needed, given how far removed from the reality-based community so many of the highest paid financial gurus were at that time. I supposed you could call The Big Short a comedy as it is very, very funny. But it is also a tragedy as McKay couldn't be more serious about his film's message: which is that anyone who ever bought into the version of the American Dream, that included their own home, has been fooled by the banks, the regulators and the government; who all seemed to interpret capitalism as a license to rob people blindly. Overall McKay deserves a lot of credit for making this movie and he also deserves to be taken seriously now as a filmmaker.",9,2,4,27 December 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice
","Fearing the actions of Superman are left unchecked, Batman takes on the man of steel, while the world wrestles with what kind of a hero it really needs. Within Batman and Superman fighting each other, a new threat, Doomsday, is created by Lex Luthor. It's up to Superman and Batman to set aside their differences along with Wonder Woman to stop Lex Luthor and Doomsday from destroying Metropolis. This DC new extended universe is as loud and glossy as you'd expect from a Zack Snyder production. In fact Snyder long awaited Batman v Superman may be the closest thing fangirls and fanboys will ever get to their childhood playground dreams, with these two movies squished into one. Both setting up a plausible conflict between the two superheroes and shifting pieces into place for future sequels and spin-offs. It's a film with a lot on its mind. As well as being the introduction to the DC cinematic universe and embracing the new, financially lucrative Marvel-inspired reality of shared-universe blockbuster filmmaking, it does a little more creating a darker and more mature environment. The main issue facing the writers of a superhero smackdown like this, is concocting a reason why. Two titans of the pop culture will, we are assured, rearranged city streets with each other's faces. And once it arrives, the fight is a tightly choreographed treat. That Wagnerian final battle is exactly what you want in a film called 'Batman v Superman'. Let's address fans number one fear: Ben Affleck as Batman. I was one of those people who genuinely thought since day one that he would be great, so let me tell you that he is a solid successor to Christian Bale, even if he's a better Bruce Wayne than Batman. He (literally) killed it! He was phenomenal, his Bruce Wayne is interesting, investing, I cared about him, I was behind him and I completely understood why he disliked Superman. Batman never looked more badass in a movie. Henry Cavill works as per usual perfectly as the man of steel. Gal Gadot is fantastic as Wonder Woman. Her appearance in this movie is brief but crowd-pleasing as a lot of people were excited to see her show up and kick some ass (myself included). Last but not least, I was really anticipating Jeremy Irons as Alfred and he was also brilliant. However, I do have a problem with Lois Lane character, this film as Man of Steel before, has a hard time making her relevant, especially in the third act. She has an object, she gets rid of it, then she has to get the object back, then she gets trapped and she's a damsel in distress. She goes back and forth between being a character that deserves to be in this film and a character that is just there because she's Lois Lane. Plus, the solemn, grandiose atmosphere is disrupted by Lex Luthor, portrayed by Jesse Eisenberg and his over-the-top performance. He might as well be wearing a buzzing sign around his neck that says '> Head over my blog for the full review",8,3,5,25 March 2016
Lucy," Lucy
","A woman, accidentally caught in a dark deal, turns the tables on her captors and transforms into a merciless warrior evolved beyond human logic. Lucy is directed by Luc Besson and is starring Scarlett Johanson and Morgan Freeman. At first sight this film could appear to look like Limitless, which is quite similar. This time again Luc Besson works his magic on a beautiful woman with her gun (Nikita, The Fifth Element, etc.). Scarjo is pretty good at that in the movie, as she quickly turns into a bad ass killer in the first act. Morgan Freeman's character is not that interesting, he has pretty much the same part as in Transcendence except that the film itself is better than Transcendence. Mr Jang starring Min-sik Choi is nothing more than an evil guy, killing people in cold blood, we don't really know more about him. However the movie is looking good, it is very well edited. There's a cool car chasing action scene, several very natural and fluid action scenes as well. I have a divided opinion on this film as on the one hand Lucy has some conventional action movie themes and on the other hand some too unconventional parts; it's dealing with smart things in a dumb way. It's like Luc Besson wanted to make cool things happen in a movie and he did it, but I don't really care about the plot and characters and where the story is going. We can't really like Lucy or relate to her as she doesn't encounter threatening situations, as she can access 100% of her brain capacity she becomes nearly invincible and as a protagonist nothing properly challenges her. It's entertaining but there's no tension as in an actual action movie.Overall Lucy looks good, there are great action sequences despite the fact that tension really isn't there it's entertaining if you're just seeking that. Prepare yourself; it's different and a little bit more ambitious that you may have thought it to be just by watching the trailer.",6,3,10,7 August 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars: The Force Awakens
","30 years after the defeat of the Galactic Empire, a new threat rises. The First Order attempts to rule the galaxy and only a ragtag group of Heroes can stop them, along the help of the Resistance.Has any film ever promised so much by giving away so little? Ever since we got our first look at The Force Awakens over a year ago, the secrecy surroundings its plot only served to increase our expectations even more. This film is the 7th chapter but also the first film in what's now being called the 'sequel trilogy'; which means that The Force Awakens picks up years after Return of the Jedi (1983), the third release. This series grew quickly into a phenomenon, most crucially a sensibility that is now rooted in the human being. Star Wars has gone beyond the sci-fi genre, to its own kind of intergalactic almost-Arthurian quest and romance. J.J. Abrams may not have the powers of God nor the scale of an Empire builder like George Lucas but he turns out to be what the franchise needs: a 'Star Wars' fanboy and a pop culture genius. It seems fitting that this new instalment is directed by one of our own that has this desire to transport the viewers - to return us to a wondrous, childlike state of movie-going innocence. You can see why Disney and Lucasfilm wanted to hide their spoilers, it's very interesting and pretty fun discovering the character played by Lupita Nyong'o or learning some of Han and Leia's family secrets, which I will not reveal here. This movie serves its function, which is to transition from one universe to another along with these younger characters. Appealing women and men whose victories, scars, goofiness and decency reminds you that a pop mythology like Star Wars needs more than odds to sustain it. The Force Awakens is modern, diverse and female- empowered that its predecessor. While there's an undeniable pleasure in the return of actors like Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher - particularly Ford, whose return to Han Solo is fully present and committed; the new characters truly stand out as intriguing additions to the adventure. Daisy Ridley and John Boyega are worth the ticket price alone. You'd assume they'd starred together in a trilogy before. I can't speak highly enough of their dramatic and even comic ranges. Most importantly Daisy Ridley is not a sexual object for nerd to fantaisies about. Gone are the days of golden bikinis boys! She's a thinker, a doer and a strong-willed rebel fighter also able to rewire devices on any spaceship: a terrifically capable character who addresses some of the gender imbalance that has long been an issue in Star Wars. Her presence is exactly what the part calls for. She emerges as the star of the show particularly when she dodges all attempt to confine her character to the role of damsel in distress. Rey's character development matches the film's rapid pace, almost as if Abrams and screenwriters couldn't wait for her to reach her full potential. Poe Dameron starring Oscar Isaac nails the goofy and irreverent tone of the series. An outstanding pilot and charming soldier, this is the sort of character Anakin should have been before his fall to the Dark Side in the prequels. Plus, Kylo Ren is set to be a villain that could rival Vader himself with a lofty presence, booming voice, fits of anger and this red lightsaber everyone has been talking about; but he never reaches the enigmatic statues of Vader's early appearances, he has nonetheless the potential to become a lasting icon of villainy in his own right. However, the less said about his villainous cohorts the better: Domhnall Gleeson's General Hux seems neither frightening nor useful while Andy Serkis' large CGI Supreme Leader Snoke feels more like a throwback to those forgettable prequels than anything. On the plus side Abrams' Stormtroopers have a bit more smarts to them than we've previously seen. When Han Solo and Chewie come on, I had a feeling in the cinema I haven't had for a long time: not knowing whether to burst into tears or into applause. Harrison Ford really looks like he had a blast, he's just a guy having fun on the set of a Star Wars movie. An all together splendid Harrison Ford who, unlike original co-stars Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill, has a full fledged, roaring leading role rather than a cameo. He has been here before and his 'It's all true' speech featured in the trailer, is a highlight of the movie. In fact, what is intriguing about this moment, though, is that it isn't just about the character or Abrams > Link to my blog to read more",10,5,27,18 December 2015
Godzilla," Godzilla
","The world most famous monster is pitted against malevolent creatures who, bolstered by humanity's scientific arrogance, threaten our very existence. I knew nothing about the movie, even if I watched all of the trailers. All I could tell you back then, is that it was a new Godzilla movie which might include several other monsters in it. So I didn't really know what I was in for. This film focus a little bit more on human beings and character's back stories, It's not all about monsters and a lot more about humans. Godzilla is in it obviously, but it's not all about him. It's about humans who have to deal with the fact that there are big walking monsters in the world. The point is that we have to feel that those monsters exist and that they are a real threat for humanity. That's why this film is working so well. However I wished they show a little bit more of Godzilla fighting scenes, not those special report news telling us that the monsters are devastating cities etc. Since it's mostly about the characters, they are pretty good. Bryan Cranston for instance is awesome in the movie. He has a couple of really emotional scenes but he's not out there that much though, which is a little bit disappointing as well. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is in the movie and he's good enough. Kind of statues as a military force, he just wants to get the job done which make sense in a way. 'Let's get it done!' I can't help myself but to compare this Godzilla film with Pacific Rim which annoys me as Godzilla is so much more realistic - not that cooler though, but good nonetheless. It's directed extremely well and gives a kind of humans perspective regards to these creatures, it sold them. They're not monsters. Those creatures are animals who are trying to survive on this planet. Finally, the score by Alexandre Desplat is fantastic, I loved how it sounds.Overall, this movie was epic and looked epic. But don't expect Pacific Rim because you will be disappointed. This film is smarter displaying a mankind view of nature.",7,2,5,18 May 2014
Deadpool," Deadpool
","A former Special Forces operative turned mercenary is subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers, adopting the alter ego Deadpool.After a BRILLIANT marketing campaign that set some pretty high expectations, the wait is finally over. The timing of things is perfect, especially with the superheroes overload we are getting lately. I'm not complaining. We like comic book movies, they're fun, but even the most hard core comic book fan can tell you that right now we are oversaturated . Some of them are really good and then we have the Fantastic Four. I was blown away by this film, I loved every minute of it. Coming from someone who didn't know much about Deadpool character, it surprised me in so many ways. It sure as hell beats Kick-Ass and is many, many cuts above Green Lantern. This offshoot of the X-Men series feels like a nasty child next to the shiny delegations of the MCU, as represented by Disney's Avengers franchise and Sony's not-so-amazing Spider Man. This wholesome 'reboot' pulls off that postmodern trick of getting away with formulas and clichÃ©s simply by pointing them out. Deadpool knows what world its in and since it exists within this world, the movie is fully aware of it: self-aware in every way and self-referential. It completely breaks the fourth wall, with its main character looking at the audience and stating something that we are already thinking about in today state of comic book films, this is beautiful. Let's talk about this, as it's easy - especially nowadays - to watch a comic book film and just go like 'OMG! There's so much action and cool stuff, him punching things really hard, I loved it!' Thats' not what I loved the most about. It's the script. The script is extremely funny. It's a smart structure, one that really sidesteps the major issue with origin stories: the suited up main attraction being mostly absent for the first hour or so. Plus, Wolverine or Superman require something interesting to do - for the most part - but what Deadpool is up to here is less important than the fuss he makes about it and the film still is quite entertaining (a fight, a kidnapping, a rescue attempt and roll credits). For years, Hollywood hasn't known what to do with this 'Sexiest Man Alive' and his caustic charm. At least in this film they new exactly how to use Ryan Reynolds: an actor whose smooth leading good looking man roles have long disguised one of the sharpest funnyman in the business; as fans of The Proposal, Definitely, Maybe and Just Friends attest. Here he truly has his role of a lifetime, with his mad energy fuelling the film and his likable almost Clooneyesque goofiness. It's not the kind of star profile that immediately screams 'blockbuster' and Reynolds first appearance as Deadpool in X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) offered sadly little hint of what he could do with the role. Indeed, this film function as a star vehicle for him, demolishing his physical beauty - a small price to pay when an actor's tongue is this gloriously sharp. Though, even with a face that's been horrifically shattered into what his friend likens to the 'offspring of an avocado that had sex with an older avocado', Ryan Reynolds and his character are a blast of laughing. Giving all these self-referential potty talk a delirious comic momentum. He's at his best as Deadpool, nailing snappy jokes and slaying one liners; weirdly similar to his cousin Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man but with more sugar in the mix. Reynolds genuinely is fun and he seems to enjoy giving the chance to his chimichanga-loving hero the main stage he deserves. His love story with Vanessa (starring Morena Baccarin) doesn't appear like a plot devices at all. They have good chemistry that sells the love story even more, they feel like a real couple who really enjoys each other. Though Ed Skrein does a far better imitation of Jason Statham as this British badass than he managed in The Transporter Refueled, he doesn't look or sound like a proper villain. He looks more like the villain henchman. In fact, that 'British villain' joke in the opening titles is misleading. The Brit in question ... > More on my blog",10,8,22,10 February 2016
Spectre," Spectre
","A cryptic message from Bond's past sends him on a trail to uncover a sinister organisation. While M battles political forces to keep the secret service alive, Bond peels back the layers of deceit to reveal the terrible truth behind SPECTRE. 'The Dead are Alive' are the very first words printed on screen in Spectre, the 24th and far-from-last James Bond adventure. The success of Skyfall three years ago - yielding not just $1 billion worldwide but breathless reviews, two Oscars and even a BAFTA for Best British film - places this new opus in a tricky returning position. I am a huge James Bond fan, I've loved James Bond my entire life, so I was excited to see what Sam Mendes had done with this one. I've always saw them like superhero movies, starring an indestructible character who simply wore a tuxedo instead of tights and a cape. This film goes to epic lengths to deliver all you could conceivably want from this invincible franchise. From the gun to the other gadgets in Q's workshop, everything is back where it belongs. The 't' in Fleming's Spectre stood for terrorism - the SPecial Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge andExertion - and perhaps one of the first uses of the word in pop culture. Indeed, this is a thoroughly British movie franchise. Made of pure action mixed with a real sense of style.Bond's adventure this time is a genuine personal journey, learning more about himself and others as well. Still, the death of Dame Judi Dench's M at the climax of Skyfall raised the personal stakes for the usual impermeable Bond in a fashion that can't be automatically repeated an instalment later. When Casino Royale have taken those elements away in order to do a more compelling story, here a more traditional Bond character is bring up. Daniel Craig is probably my favourite James Bond ever - equal to Connery. He has grown into the role of the British spy with flair and a welcome lightness of touch, a mix of inconscience and playful self-awareness, just right for a character still trying to find his place in the modern age. Plus, in Spectre Craig offers his most relaxed and witty performance to date as 007. If this is his farewell to the tux, he's going out in a pretty stylish way. Another person who has grown into his part is Ben Whishaw, as the perennially stressed quartermaster and tech supreme: Q. Given much more to do this time around he has developed him as a very enjoyable comic character.Léa Seydoux and Daniel Craig have an excellent chemistry and you feel like something tangible is there in regards to a possible romance but the film doesn't explore that relationship as well as they could have. Indeed, Sorbonne-learnt psychologist Madeleine Swann skills with a gun doesn't offset the annoying damsel-in-distress role she's been assigned in the action; which at one point is so depressingly retrograde, it's a wonder Mendes didn't just tie her up to some railway tracks. David Bautista shows up every once in a while, does something incredibly bad ass and that's it: very minimal but functional character. Nonetheless his brutish physical threat leads to one of the greatest fight scene ever seen in a Bond movie. Later, we also get a horrible hi-tech torture scene, a new version of the sadism that was on display when Mads Mikkelsen was roughing 007 up in Casino Royale. Most importantly the shadowy introduction to Oberhauser was masterfully done, suspenseful and marvellously well shot, it gave us a promise for an intense character. Christoph Waltz has an almost papal presence while bringing his familiar streak of fruity menace to the role. He introduces us to the new big bad , Franz Oberhauser - aka Ernst Stavro Blofeld; please don't act surprised, neither of us were born yesterday! This new (old, really) villain makes Bardem's Silva look like a junior at best. Every scene he's in is amazing. You know those James Bond movies are not usually short so giving three scenes to Christoph Waltz. Three scenes! This was disappointing. You just want to see the villain and then comes this great scene and nothing for a long again. These movies need a good villain, a great villain, we got one but we need him to - like Silva in Skyfall - get things done. However Christoph Waltz just talk about how he hurt James Bond in the past and how good he HAS BEEN. Check out my blog to read the end!",9,91,180,12 November 2015
Her," Her
","Her deals with the story of a lonely writer who's developing a relationship with his newly purchased operating system that's designed to meet his every need.Her narrates an intelligent, overwhelming but very unlikely love story. Behind a sort of innocence some cruelty pops out and slowly, without expecting it at all, a spleen settled. This film is depicting an era - ours - which is gradually drown by doubts and culpability. Many ideas are displayed, such as: desire, love, human contact, loneliness and connection. Most of the characters are realistic and very interesting. Joaquim Phoenix is so good in the part of this self-implose isolation man, named Theodore. Amy (his best friend), ironically starring Amy Adams, is experiencing her own exploration of intimacy, so they can go through it together. On the one hand in a proper relationship and on the other in a friendship. Plus both of them are evolving, growing and changing through these. The most important theme is how each heartbreak teaches you something about yourself, that's how Human are designed, they keep trying to connect with each other in many ways. Mainly Her is not about technology, future and even more not about OS (Operating System), it's more likely to be a study on connections. Her feels so new and fresh, as it's amazing colors. This film is original. I think we have to celebrate this film because some people are still able to make awesome and original ideas, even it twisted around something we had seen before. Spike Jonze believes in it, and we can feel it. He creates a film that makes us see the world in startling new ways. Finally, musics by Arcade Fire are sounding like lullabies. We ended up caring about each one of the characters as we knew them, and it's transporting us into another super realistic world. Overall Her is very smart.",8,0,0,22 March 2014
The Nice Guys," The 'Not So' Nice Guys
","A mismatched pair of private eyes investigates the apparent suicide of a fading porn star in 1970s Los Angeles.The Nice Guys reunites director and co-writer Shane Black and producer Joel Silver, who have previously given us the Lethal Weapon movies, The Last Boy Scout, and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang - among others. Where Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans or Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer have gone before, now we have the sublime pairing of Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling. Before our emotionally liberate 21st-century world invented the idea of the 'bromance', we had the buddy comedy and the first reference that come to my mind is Roger Moore and Tony Curtis in The Persuaders on television. This film is an arch return to this tradition. Not unlike Deadpool, this is a rare American Studio movie willing to acknowledge the stupidity of mindless action with cathartic elements. The complex plotting bears a close resemblance to Inherent Vice in its dirty arrangement of events in which the main characters generally seem lost in the fog of their own pursuits. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling are funnier than ever in this buddy movie about crime investigation. Though at the end of the third act, it sometimes shifts into more straightforward procedural details that lack the same spark as its stars. Still there's no doubting the appeal of these two bumbling entities. The Nice Guys delivers brilliant physical comedy, null the actor's ability to turn their screen presence into a punchline. In this movie, everyone is trolling everyone else. Ryan Gosling, among his many talents, has blossomed into an inspired physical comedian. While what's fun about watching Russel Crowe is that he treats the savagery of his job as casually as if he were filling out a tax form. Indeed, they are a brilliant pairing and fit like a glove. So well in fact that you will wonder why it didn't happen sooner. It's a Hollywood buddy pairing that leaves you wanting more - a sequel, if it happens, would be justified and welcome.This movie is likely to score big with audiences, and for the same reason that it's proved to be a perfect fit. It's a treat to see popcorn movies this decadent made by people who know exactly what they're doing. Philippe Rousselot's cinematography gives L.A. a night bloom glow but not so much of a period authenticity, unfortunately. Finally, the hotel elevator scene, when the heroes duck back into the elevator with a 'we don't need this' shrug. The timing of the gag is exquisite because it's Black's way of expressing what it feels like when whenever you're expecting is almost certain to turn out worse.Overall, The Nice Guys is a cynical movie but yet more or less sympathetic. An innocent pleasure that you can just let slide.",8,3,8,3 June 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Mad Max: Fury Road
","In a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken, two rebels just might be able to restore order: Max, a man of action and of few words, and Furiosa, a woman of action who is looking to make it back to her childhood homeland.Mad Max: Fury Road is directed by George Miller, stars Charlize Theron, Tom Hardy, Nicholas Hoult and is the continuation of the legendary Mad Max series - if you haven't heard of it, where have you been for the last 30 years? To be honest I haven't really enjoy any of the two and half Mad Max movies I've seen before, but it would be stupid to critic the heck out of this one just because I don't like the world created by George Miller in those movies. Fury Road is an action movie at its core, it's intense and rough. This film is insanely crazy. There's this guy that depicts perfectly the atmosphere of the movie: he's playing electric guitar on top of truck, shooting flames out of the neck of the guitar during the entire run time of the movie - until he eventually get killed of course. This film doesn't stop from the first shot to the last, hand to hand combat scenes and wide shots of chaos and destruction are very well handled. It involves emotion as well, brought mainly by Charlize Theron's character, due to her backstory. Plus I feel like she is actually the most badass of all. Her and Nicholas Hoult' characters are genuinely interesting and brings a 'little bit' of humanity in this world; which is fine because we are use to root for Max who is the eternal good guy against all the crazies. Moreover, Tom Hardy as Max is pretty good, knowing that he had to fill Mel Gibson's shoes. Finally, you see some death, destruction, carnage, car explosions, more death, more destruction, more carnage and at last this craziness weirdly makes sense in this film as we are way past the precipice of madness. People clearly aren't sain anymore. Overall Mad Max: Fury Road is CRAZY. This film does Miller's Mad Max things with a bigger budget i-e a post-apocalyptic movie with a two hours action sequence.",7,1,4,17 May 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," Hacksaw Ridge #OscarNoms
","I am so glad to see Mel Gibson back to directing movies because ever since The Man Without a Face he has made many very good movies, among which my favourite has to be Braveheart, being an incredible film as well as Apocalypto, which is just as good. This time around, at the heart of this cinematic cyclone is a more conventional character study; of a man torn by his need to serve in a fight against Japan and a strict moral code that prevents him from taking life. Though, once on the battlefield the complexities of his moral fall away, replaced by the simple maths of saving lives. Andrew Garfield, former Spidey, is so good at being an optimist in life, he has this infectious smile, he seems to be such a sweet guy and you really root for his character. Garfield is the warm anchor the film needs. Between this film and Silence, two contrasting tales of faith in an unforgiving world, any memories of the sad end to his web-slinging days should be well and truly banished. Teresa Palmer gives also the best performance of her entire career, as a nurse who Desmond meets, they get to know each other and their relationship is genuinely sweet and charming. Vince Vaughn is in this movie and stole every scene he's in, as an aggressive motor mouth drill instructor. That casting choice is a reminder that Vince Vaughn is obviously very funny, but he also has some dramatic arcs. Moreover, Hugo Weaving gives one of the best performances in this film and I am so happy to see him again. I haven't seen him in a movie in a long time. He is always great, as his legendary roles can attest: Smith, Elrond, Red Skull or in V for Vendetta; this is what we love him for. In this film, he gives such a harden and emotionally powerful performance, as a man who has to deal with alcoholism. I am blown away by his work here. The slow-burn promise of the film's opening acts pays off in a fierce focus on characters we have come to know, from all of the above to Sam Worthington and Luke Bracey. Biblical themes resonate and Doss's faith and certainties are tested in the movie's second act, a shift happens from home-baked heaven to the purgatory of military training. Mel Gibson and his scribes: Andrew Knight and Robert Schenkkan's grip on a familiar material is firm; their images, motifs and structures lend purpose to a potentially cheesy material. The combat sequences, set on a blasted, blood-soaked Okinawan ridge in 1945, are filmed in Viscera Vision - they blaze and roar with the expression of pure violence. At some point, Mel Gibson leads us up a cliff and into a Bosch-ian nightmare. Between the mud, splayed bodies, bullet-pierced tin hats and torsos used as shields; the Battle of Okinawa pulverises. War has been hell in movies before, this is worse. What is impressive here, is how Gibson pushes his direction beyond the exploitative possibilities of raising hell. The war scenes are brutally realistic and you can see that nothing has been held back and they are very well done and not romanticised at all. This happened. This sucked and this is the story of a man who tried to do something good. This is effectively shocking. Finally, you don't need to be a religious person to appreciate the movie. It addresses strong perspective for the character but you don't need to be religious to appreciate the spirit of this film, and the eternal truth that Human spirit is the most powerful thing you can have.Overall, Hacksaw Ridge is an old-fashioned story that Mel Gibson mainlines with bleeding-edge craft and technique - he has lost little of his knack for spectacle and has proved once again that he is a master behind the camera.",10,4,8,29 January 2017
Warcraft," Warcraft
","The peaceful realm of Azeroth stands on the brink of war as its civilisation faces a fearsome race of invaders: orc warriors fleeing their dying home to colonise another. As a portal opens to connect the two worlds, one army faces destruction and the other faces extinction. From opposing sides, two heroes are set on a collision course that will decide the fate of their family, their people, and their home. Duncan Jones embraces Warcraft's world with commitment but when it comes to charging it with life, it is quite difficult. His adaptation of the online game has a sense of grandeur but also a strong fixation with CGI spectacle which makes the emotional core lifeless. Though it is clear that as a professed Warcraft fan, he clearly has put a lot of love and care into fleshing out a story. Warcraft is an expensive, high-fantasy epic reminiscent of The Lord of the Rings or Narnia. Newcomers - like myself - have a lot to get up to speed with here. As far as I understand all this, our home world is Azeroth, a Middle-Earth-like realm along the lines of Medieval Europe. The population is mostly human, mostly white, but there are also dwarfs, elves and various other mythical creatures in the fringes. There's a lot going on and yet we're never quite engaged with the storyline. In Lord of the Rings, we had the Shire, the Hobbit's idyllic pastoral realm, as an image of what everyone was fighting for. Here we barely see Azeroth, outside the Royal Castles, Wizard's towers or epic battlefields. There are much to admire in its ambitions and its design. Still, I don't know why I have this John Carter feeling about it. Like the 2012 Martian Disney flop, Warcraft is a complex, jargon-heavy, battle epic. This film occasionally manages to feel both rushed and dull, impressively staged and disengaging as well. Indeed, the heavy use of CGI and its awkward interactions with the live-action elements, distance the audience even more. Overall, this film feels incomplete and if Warcraft's fans want a sequel, every single one of the 12 million players - even their extended family and friends - is going to need to turn up to see this one, if they want this film to get past its first instalment.",6,4,12,2 June 2016
Me Before You," Movie Vs. Book: Me Before You
","A girl in a small town forms an unlikely bond with a recently-paralyzed man she's taking care of. It's easy to be cold and cynical these days, but we should never lose sight of the simple, cathartic pleasure of a good cry at the movies. At first, I didn't want to review this novel – nor the movie – because I knew I would want to re-read it. Which might seem perverse if you know that for most of the last hundred pages I was dissolved in tears? Based on the best-selling 2012 novel by Jojo Moyes who also penned the screenplay. This story will feel familiar to anyone who sniffed through Love Story or The Fault in Our Stars. Surprisingly it's better than both. Me Before You is a love story, a family story and above all, it's a story of the bravery and sustained the effort needed to redirect the path of a life once it's been pushed off course. This is also a story that is eloquent not so much in its delivery as in its humanity. The set up is the same as many of classic (and non-classic) romance: a poor but cheerful young girl meets a rich, grumpy gentleman and begins working for him. But what makes Me Before You different and quite interesting in principle is that Will Traynor is physically broken as well as emotionally.You'll forgive the movie's clichés because of its surprisingly winning performances. As the film goes on and the frost between both protagonists melts, both actors give their stock roles unexpected emotional layers. On a basic level, it is engaging watching Lou enter this new world for which she is entirely unprepared. Game of Thrones' Emilia Clarke stars as Louisa, she's like Love Actually-era Keira Knightley, crossed with a Hello Kitty doll. Clarke's sincerity doesn't just win Will's heart, it wins ours too. Will Traynor since he's played by Sam Claflin, whose Finnick Odair was one of the best things in the Hunger Games series, isn't just killer handsome or impossibly good- looking even if his condition has left him bitterly depressed and cuttingly sarcastic in a wheelchair. The actor is good as Will, working well with the physical demands of the role and even bringing a gentle flirtatiousness to his character, as he develops his relationship with Lou. In fact, his grin, with its slight touch of a smirk – creates an unmistakable echo of a young Hugh Grant. Sam Claflin makes Will a broken man with a powerful life inside him. Plus, Will's character makes me think of Mr. Rochester in Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre; with his rudeness and temper. While Louisa is so Jane Eyre: 'One of the invisible'. Lou has never lived; Will has, but no longer can. You don't have to be Nicholas Sparks to know where this is heading – that these two opposites will end up attracting, and that love, at least for a while, will prove stronger than death. Lou is not heroic and her male counterpart may be nobody's idea of a leading man or Prince Charming, and yet with both of them, Jojo Moyes created an affair I will always remember.Me Before You is a heartbreaker in the best sense. Employing emotional truth to bring the reader to tears. And yet, unlike other novels, tears are not gratuitous. Some situations, the author forces the reader to recognize, really are worth crying over. Furthermore, people can take an awful lot of sadness if you can be funny about it. Jojo Moyes is a literary stylist. Just a storyteller. And a really good one. She manages to draw on the skills she owned as a journalist to create a clear, candid picture of the practicalities of Will's situation. While the novelist's mind casts an illuminating light on her character's reactions. Moyes makes them coming together extremely tender, both sweet and real. But there's a deadline. One that haunts their love story haunts the novel. The author is masterful, in not shying from the complexities or shading the agony of choosing between life and death. It's achingly hard to read at moments and yet such a joy.Screenwriters choose to lose the 'Maze' scene when Lou recalls a sexual assault when she was younger. Often when you read about rape in fiction, it's the defining event of a story. And cutting it from the movie, I think, was a good thing because the scene is very opaque in the book, and putting it on film would have given it far more weight than it has in the book. Plus, it would have eventually change the mood of the story. However the 'Birthday Dinner' scene, at Louisa's home, hits a particularly high note, offering the most poignant moment both in the book and the movie – its soul, really – as well as a pitch-perfect hilarious one. Finally, my favorite part of both the film and the book is when Will and Lou go out on a 'date' to a concert. She wears a dress of sexiest scarlet, and as they are in the car ready to go home, he confesses in a very Hugh Gratian manner: 'I don't want to go in yet. I just want to be a man who's been to a concert with a girl in a red dress.' I know a good British rom-com reference when I see one.Overall, Me Before You doesn't try to reinvent the genre. We've all seen some version of this movie before, but that doesn't make it any less effective. It knows what it is and embraces it. 'Tell me something good,' Will says to Louisa at two transformative junctures of the book. This story at its heart is about two people who properly listen to each other, it is something good. Now if you'll excuse me, I have something in my eye. It's allergies, I swear.",8,8,13,4 July 2016
13 Hours," 13 Hours
","As an American ambassador is killed during an attack at a U.S. compound in Libya, a security team struggles to make sense out of chaos.13 Hours is directed by Michael Bay and inspired by the true story of some soldiers who took a stand in Benghazi when they had no idea of what was going on and unclear orders. I really wasn't sure what to expect, especially from Michael Bay. It's his third time trying to reenact a true story, after Pearl Harbor and Pain & Gain. But now having seen the film, I can say that Michael bay has made his most mature movie since... ever. The first hour is pretty rough as it is the same thing we always saw, setting up characters. It sets them in the most standard ways, so you never really grow to be attached, you respect them but there's no connection whatsoever. John Krasinski is no longer that skinny nerd from The Office, he's in the military now. He does an incredible job in this movie. We should be seeing more of him than we currently are. Him and his team aren't simply badasses, they are badasses from Michael Bay's Alpha Male Signature Series Collection. Their gut instinct is always right and they don't need an Ivy League education to know what's what. It's in this regard that 13 Hours crosses the threshold between just being a Michael bay movie and being a Michael Bay movie that has something to say. Unlike American Sniper, the film doesn't bring up and doesn't explore, the tension within many men between the lure of danger and excitement, and the longing for intimacy and home. For the very first time though, I think Bay actually found the right balance between fun entertainment for everyone and honoring a true story. Plus, the screenplay limits the audience infos and politic because the infos that the men involved in this situation got back then were also extremely limited. Still, sequences go from firefight to firefight and gradually gains a video game-like structure with a little too much shaky-cam again but nor throughout the whole movie. Directors can do that, but we're coming out of Abrams and Inàrritu so please... Finally, Bay's action is still confused, but he works best in chaos. At one point he even couldn't resist repeating a shot he introduced in Pearl Harbor, that shows a large mortar shell falling slowly and then exploding. Overall, this film is the living proof that Michael Bay is able to listen to his fans and adapts. He deserves credits for mixing politics and pop filmmaking.",9,3,9,8 April 2016
Jurassic Park," Jurassic Park
","During a preview tour, a theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok.Jurassic Park is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum and Richard Attenborough. When I first saw this film it was the most mind blowing film I had ever experienced. On paper, the movie was made for Steven Spielberg: combining the scares of Jaws with the high tech, romance of E.T the Extra-Terrestrial , Close Encounters of the Third Kind and of course adding the challenge of creating the dinosaurs themselves. This 1993 dino-fest, has gone down in movie history as the film that cracked open the Pandora's box of cgi. This film is a true movie milestone, a real experience and it made an entire generation of children fall in love with dinosaurs. Jurassic Park changed the entire game of film making for ever, creating cgi dinosaurs that still holds up 20 years from then: good work Steven! He steped the bar so high that it's still there today. Michael Crichton who co-wrote the film with David Koepp presents his story on a fascinating and detailed note on both the possibilities and evils of modern science. Moreover, characters are all very good as each one of them have something special that make them human. Sam Neill isn't particularly close to children, Laura Dern actually has a strong female role and has a good chemistry with both Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum; who is one of those supporting characters that steals the entire show. Jeff Goldblum character is so much fun, he's smooth and smart, not this goofy guy that pops jokes every once in a while. Ian Malcolm is actually a well written character with a great brain and he seems to foreshadow what is going to happen. Plus, Richard Attenborough's character has so many layers which is very interesting. Each one of them are important and not just funny, they are likable characters who seems like real people with backgrounds and who all relate to the story. 'Welcome to Jurassic Park' doesn't quite cover it. Spielberg did such a good job engrossing us into this world. From just a visual and technical aspect this film is near flawless. Watching this film 22 years later, there obviously some point where you can tell it's cgi but for the 95% of the film the cgi is still outstanding. The realism with which they were able to create those dinosaurs is amazing. They are all indeed a triumph of special effects artistry. Steven Spielberg created one of the most jaw-dropping scene in movie history. The brachiosaurs Neill and Dern see for the first time are tall, majestic leaf-eaters, grazing placidly in the treetops. There is a sense of grandeur to them. Half of that is due to John Williams brilliant theme. This music is fantastic! I love it so much, I may even love it more than Star Wars. This very scene when Sam Neill stares at them, with this music, at that point everything's okay with the world. Everything's perfect. We don't make movies like this anymore. That kind of silence in a movie when a character stares at something and the music swipes you into it. I miss that awe. Nowadays most of the movies are so quick-edited, so packaged and ready to be delivered on a theatre, so an audience could sit there and not be bored. This movie takes its time to tell a story, get you to the characters, make you understand the plot and then the dinosaurs are everywhere. Clearly dinosaurs dominate Jurassic Park in every way. Amazingly graceful and convincing, they set a sky-high new standard for computer generated special effects. They create a triumphant illusion. You believe you have spent some time in a dino-filled world. Plus, Spielberg built up an imminent sense of threat over the first hour of the movie. In fact, Jurassic Park keeps its viewers on edge of their seats while leaving the real violence to the imagination. Besides, this film has the best jump scares ever, that I won't spoil if you didn't already see the movie (but if you don't I beg you to), because Spielberg didn't go for the numb cliché. He knows how to create legitimate tension in his film and it's not just the tension in the last half which is so fun and impressive but the sustain wonder through the entire first half of the film. Two set pieces ares especially effective: the first one is a scene where a T-Rex mauls a car with screaming children inside, and the other one is when the children play hide and seek with two velociraptors in the park's kitchen. Everybody can stage a fight, but it takes Mr Steven Spielberg to show just how the plots and pans might go flying at the stroke of a velociraptor's tail. This scene also helps to look at the bigger picture. Who but Steven Spielberg could convince an audience that there are dinosaurs loose in a kitchen at all? Jurassic Park smacks everyone in the face with awe, imagination, and all the things that are the reasons why movies are made. Tastes in movies are subjective but in my opinion the answer to: why movies are made? Definitely is movies such as Jurassic Park, Star Wars or even recently Marvel Guardians of the Galaxy. Overall Steven Spielberg, the man who invented the summer event movie took Michael Crichton's book and transformed it into an awe-inspiring legendary blockbuster, using every inch of the screen he was given with cool characters, impressive cgi, wonder and danger. Jurassic Park changed entertainment at a genetic level.",10,2,2,1 June 2015
The Martian," Movie Vs. Book: The Martian
","During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meagre supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive.Andy Weir started writing a book about an astronaut stranded on Mars. He hadn't had any success with publishers in the past, so he begun posting chapters to his website. That was 2011. People really liked it - so much that Crown Publishing made it become a best-seller. Weir tells this story through largely detailed work logs. The Martian is impressively geeky. Smart science-fiction is such a rarity these days. Our parents witnessed the first man in the Moon decades ago and we witnessed the landing of curiosity on Mars: WE are the Mars generation. That's the inspiration. Astronauts really are the real pioneers. They do something incredibly heroic, brave and risky but also incredibly necessary. This book is adapted by Ridley Scott, who transformed science-fiction cinema with Blade Runner and Alien. Once again, Scott goes back to the future, which is a familiar destination for him. Andy Weir and screenplay writers wrote us a love letter to science. They obviously skipped a lot of complications in the film, there's so much in the book but they decide to pick out some bits and leave others which is natural and not a problem at all. You definitely don't need to have read the book to enjoy the movie but you definitely SHOULD read the book because it's fantastic! Mr Weir, from online serial to book to screen, has brought a little appreciated genre into the mainstream: the nerd thriller. This hyper-technical genre, deeply developed by novelists does something that classic thrillers do not: it puts the nerd (female or male) in the centre of the action. The intellectual is the hero. Imagine that instead of Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg was the star of Mission: Impossible. This is an adventure for those of us who believe, deep in our hearts, that the heroes of Star Trek are Spock and Scotty: the science officer and the engineer. And writing about The Martian seems to be bringing out the geekiness even more in your humble correspondent. Still its heart, humour and rousing story of perseverance and global collaboration promise to broaden the film's appeal well beyond nerds. A lot of people - including myself - responded to the characters in the book. The humour and the way he keeps his logical, practical spirit in order to solve one problem at a time; is what makes this character compelling and super duper interesting. Andy Weir admits freely that his character has little inner life. Watney simply pushes forward, putting crises into a mental lock box and figuring out how to survive. 'It could have been a deep psychological thing', he said 'but that's not the kind of book I like to read and it's not the kind of book I wanted to write'. Engineer at NASA - who are hoping to get people to Mars someday - said Mr Weir has captured something important about what make Humans want to explore. Mark Watney character represents the very cutting edge of humanity and what's possible and what we know we all need someday; which is move some of the species off the planet to ensure the species survival. Nowadays still, there are people working toward that goal. 'Watney's everybody's favourite' because he's the brave, resourceful American optimist. We all know a smart ass nerd just like him. Moreover, if you're going to be stuck alone with an actor, who guides you through a story with nothing but video diaries, you need someone who can exude the right amount of humour and confidence. In significant measure due to his character's mordant humour, Matt Damon provides a very good company during the long stretches when he's on screen alone. Plus the actor's physicality makes Mark's capability entirely credible. Matt Damon has the charm and wit to land the tricky one-liners. You try making 'Fuck you, Mars!' sound cool. From there Watney must not only come to grips with the most dire situation any astronaut has ever faced, but also mends his own gory abdominal wound in a scene that is Prometheus-level in its guts wrenching body horror. Watney is supposedly a symbol of hope for all humanity in the final act. Creating at the same time a new Manifest Destiny. This movie is the Die Hard of space film. Matt Damon gets stab, he gets frozen, he gets exploded and even burnt. Scenes back on Earth provide a hectic, densely populated counterweight to the Martian aridity. The rest of the cast is diverse in a way that feels genuinely authentic. In the story the rest of us on Earth have this understanding of what this man sacrificed and the beauty of that. They do everything they can to bring him back because he represents the best of us all. However (...) > Head over to my blog to read more about The Martian",10,17,30,24 October 2015
Furious 7," Furious 7
","Deckard Shaw seeks revenge against Dominic Toretto and his family for the death of his brother.You know what's more surprising than there's seven of these? The fact that they got better! Especially the last two movies, which are both very well directed action movies. Here James Wan - well known for The Conjuring and the Insidious films - is taking over the direction. I was truly excited for Furious 7 and it is actually a lot of fun: it is a big unrealistic good time with cars flying out of air planes using parachutes, explosions, fist fights and there are all great things! However a part of me has to sit back but I came to the conclusion that some movies aren't meant for that, some films are just meant to be awesomely dumb. This film knows it doesn't make sense at all, we watch it just to have a good time and not to be the most realistic movie in a franchise and it does that very well because every time something happened I was like 'that's not possible', while simultaneously I stepped aside and was like 'who cares, that's so cool!'. I was so pleased with the car chase scenes in particular. James Wan was able to get some more intense camera angles. Moreover, the production had to face a major problem when Paul Walker tragically past away, everyone was really sadden by that, myself included; which may explain why the plots seem very confused and different. It's almost like two very different movies in one. And YES! It is painfully obvious when cgi Paul Walker is around, you can just tell and it makes it a little bit awkward. Still I can't, in good conscience, say too many negative things about that because it's unfortunate but unavoidable. Most of the fans are going to be satisfied with this film. It is a fitting send off for Paul Walker character. In fact the final scenes, when Paul Walker longtime colleagues say their farewells while he still appears on screen with them, is genuinely moving. Once again they handled that the best way they could. They really think through it, found the best way to do this movie in a respectful way while dealing with this tragedy.Furious 7 incorporates a lot of the things that people liked about the franchise before it was taken to a whole new direction: particularly showing these drag races that they did in the first movie. Fans come to see a red sport car (one so expensive only seven were made) be stolen from a billionaire penthouse in Abu Dhabi; to watch it burst through his windows, fly through the air and crash into not one but two skyscrapers. Anyone who can buy that bit of computer-generated thing should have no trouble believing Paul Walker is in this movie from the start to finish. There are a little too much heavy weaponry for my taste. Like Dom, I prefer fist-cuffs and car chasing, to apocalyptic explosions. It's a typical 90's action movie, not only because of the action in it but the dialogues! If the movie was actually made in the 90's, where it belongs Arnold Schwarzenegger would be in this film. Finally, this film is not as well formed as the physique of Dwayne Johnson, who gave this ensemble a much needed charisma boost when he signed on in episode 5. He has a likable presence as an actor and he made them way better than they could have been; but I was disappointed because he's barely in this one. He's got a short but cool scene at the beginning and at the end but that's it. Plus, Jason Statham as a villain is a fantastic idea, but he's too underutilised in this movie as well. He shows up only to cause problems while the bigger picture is happening and then he's gone. Apparently it's no longer enough that turbo-boosted muscle cars drive really, really fast. Now they also have to fly. Overall Furious 7 is both a stupidly entertaining and amazingly ridiculous movie. But most importantly it is a perfectly fitting send off for Paul Walker character",9,1,4,4 April 2015
