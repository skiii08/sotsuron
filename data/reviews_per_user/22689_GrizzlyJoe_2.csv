The Hangover," Sorry - a fizzer
","It raised a smile once or twice but the rest of it was predictable high-school humour about a bunch of unlikeable men being ridiculously irresponsible.One stupid mistake leads to a series of stupid mistakes and it goes on and on and on ad nauseum. You don't need me to explain the plot - it's all there in the trailers.No-one in the cast was particularly good except maybe for Heather Graham (given the limited scope of the script). She, at least, was kind of likable even if she veered into stereotype 40% of her screen time.Now I can understand why young people would like this: unable to summon up the courage or the cash to pull this sort of crap themselves they would enjoy living through this farce vicariously. I am fairly sure it will only serve to embarrass them in 10 years time the same way Porkys did for my generation.It is unfortunate that this low level of creativity and poor humour can pull big audiences but maybe this is the net result of the dumbing-down of mainstream cinema over the last 20 years. Bums-on-seats can please the shareholders and accountants but it's a lousy motivation for any sort of art-form.",1,11,23,8 August 2010
Kick-Ass," Make up your own minds...
","I'm not usually a fan of violent films. I found Sin City, while artistically and stylistically interesting, kinda nauseating with the violence and the gore. Oddly enough not so with Kick-Ass. For some reason I was not only OK with it - I appreciated it. Kick-Ass is a fantasy film. It examines power, corruption, lies, deception, honour and love. It speaks of the pain of powerlessness and the hidden desires many of us have to simply fight back against those who would intimidate and possibly destroy us. I won't go into the plot. There are many reviews here that will explain that to you. Nor will I bother to moralize about HitGirl's language or violence. Like I said, this is a fantasy film. She is a fictional character and to equate her with any 11yo living is simply ridiculous.I've read reviews here that would place all sorts of filters on the film - sociological, political, moral - but they're ALL missing the point. It's a fantasy. A dream. It's make-believe and it's a hell of a lot of fun. See it and make up your own mind.",9,1,8,25 May 2010
