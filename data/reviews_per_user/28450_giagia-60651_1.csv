Hereditary," I want my money back! I want my time back!
","Deceitful, stupid marketing. See, if they had said this is a family drama/ thriller two things would have happened. A. I wouldn't have paid good money to go to the cinema to watch it and B. I wouldn't be complaining about it now and giving it such a bad review. 
It opened in the summertime and was promoted as scary so obviously it attracted teenagers just off from school looking for a good time and lighthearted horror lovers who wanted to enjoy themselves. i.d me and my daughter. Well we left the theater. We up and left at intermission. And yes Toni Collette is an excellent actress and yes Gabriel Burn is a legend BUT the trailer promised one thing and the movie delivered quite another. They cheated both the viewers and the film with the deceitful marketing.",1,0,5,22 August 2018
