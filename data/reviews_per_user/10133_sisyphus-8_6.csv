The Blair Witch Project," One of the creepiest movies I've seen in a while
","The only real complaint I have about this movie is that there wasn't enough background. On the web site, in various specials, etc., an entire history of the Blair Witch is given that is left out of the movie. I think it would've helped if they built up the background story a little more.That said, this isn't the scariest movie I've ever seen, but it ranks pretty high up there. And when I say 'scary,' I mean that in the sense that a very tense, uneasy atmosphere is maintained throughout the whole film (well, once they get lost, at least). You know you're never going to see the 'monster' like in most horror movies, but the mystery just adds to the chills. If you think movies like 'The Exorcist,' 'Alien,' or 'The Shining' are good, you should like this. If you have no imagination, then this isn't for you.In the words of H.P. Lovecraft, 'The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.' The Blair Witch Project capitalizes on this.",7,1,1,30 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not as good or as bad as the hype
","Everyone knows about the hype surrounding the 'Fandom Menace.' Most people who actually have the time to read these reviews have probably already seen it once or twice (or seven times). So I figured I'd just throw in my two cents.Visually, of course, this movie's a feast. The special effects are epic in scale and state of the art. Along with the sound and John Williams' score, the visuals are enough to see this on the big screen.As for the actual content, some people say that the characters needed to be developed more or that the acting was often stiff (especially in young Jake Lloyd). I agree. Hey, I know I was upset when Darth Maul died without saying the whole '...fear is my ally' line that I heard in the trailers. However, the characters in the first (err...last) 3 installments weren't all that original or in-depth, either. Think about it. 'I am your father' isn't exactly poetic. And we all know how ridiculous it was to find out that Leia was also Luke's sister; I was expecting to find out that Boba Fett was a second cousin or something at that rate.Now, what didn't I like about this? First of all, Jar-Jar has to go. All racial connotations aside, this is one of the most annoying characters ever devised. Jar-Jar, you're no Chewbacca. Also, just a few minutes could've been cut out of the pod race scene and all of Tattooine. I'd rather see less of quasi-Aryan poster boy Anakin and more of Darth Maul. I'm hung up on this because I think DM had a lot of 'supervillain' potential...but he acted more like a lackey for Darth Sideous. And, as I mentioned before, if they spent a little more time on 'cheese-proofing' the dialogue and developing the characters, it would've been far more satisfying.Lucas himself said that he directed a lot of this to younger children (hence Jar-Jar). This was a wise marketing decision, as he attracted a new generation of fans to his franchise, which already features a faithful legion of Ã¼ber-nerds willing to die by the light saber for the man. Thus, the movie is pretty much all bells and whistles; but it does it well. I was personally expecting more, but I definitely got enough entertainment for my money.",7,0,0,29 June 1999
Fight Club," First rule of Fight Club...
","...Go see this movie. While 'AlienÂ³' and 'The Game' were merely above average, Fincher did impress me considerably with 'Seven,' which I consider to be a masterpiece in its own right. 'Fight Club' is every bit as good as 'Seven,' perhaps better. On the surface, it seems pretentious and adolescent (which it is to an extent...but that's to be expected in a movie about guys beating the c**p out of each other). But once you get beyond the shocks his is a movie with a lot to say that pulls out all the stops in saying it.Although I haven't read the novel (yet), I must say that Uhls' script is amazingly well-crafted, considering the convoluted nature of the story. As the angry, enigmatic Tyler Durden, Pitt once again proves that he's at his best as a psycho (like in another favorite of mine, '12 Monkeys'), and the chameleon-like Norton delivers another charged, convincing performance. Even though Carter also gives a good performance  the entire character seems to disrupt the flow of the story in parts, which is the only real weak point in the movie.When the smoke clears, 'Fight Club' functions as a scathing satire on pretty much everything status quo. This is more than Kafka for the (post-)MTV generation, though...it's a genuinely thought-provoking film that is as darkly funny as it is disturbing.",10,0,1,24 October 1999
Pi," A movie about a number theorist, not number theory
","As Max Cohen's mentor Sol Robeson hinted at, we, as humans, simply can't understand some things. We're supposed to believe that a single man, even as ingenious as Max, can find one number that essentially unlocks the secrets of the universe? This is the most obvious flaw in this movie: it is logically implausible. At first, this bothered me because I thought, 'This movie is about math, so why isn't it more accurate?' However, I realized that if I wanted a lesson on number theory, I wouldn't be watching an indie flick, so I sat back and enjoyed the ride. The acting wasn't the best, of course, and the plot had its share of holes. But when all is said and done, this was a unique and enjoyable film with interesting visuals and one of the best soundtracks to come out in a long time.",8,0,0,5 July 1999
The Sixth Sense," Predictable, but still worth catching
","This could've been a really good movie, except I predicted the ending after the first scene! Unfortunately, knowing the ending kind of negates the rest of the film. Either way, this is a decent flick, with a surprisingly superb performance put in by young Osment (who's better than Willis!). There are some pretty creepy parts, but this movie's still at its best with Willis and Osment on screen together.All told, it's a decent (and, for Hollywood, maybe even original) idea and story that's ruined by what I thought was a very revealing beginning. You might be better off walking in 5 minutes into it....",6,0,0,22 August 1999
The Matrix," Action movie trying to be deep
","What's there to say that hasn't been said? The effects are spectacular, the visuals are very stylish, and the premise might even be considered original (in Hollywood terms, at least).I had a few problems with this, though. Keanu Reeves, as usual, was terribly unconvincing as the hacker Neo (see lines, 'Whoa!' and 'I know kung fu!'), and Hugo Weaving was laughably bad as Agent Smith. Parts such as the fight between Neo and Morpheus (Fishburne) are amusing, but don't need to be there, and they ruin the feel of the rest of the movie. I was also disappointed as it became a total action flick in the last few minutes. In these scenes, it seemed as though the concept of the Matrix was just a vehicle to allow Keanu Reeves to look slick and shoot things. Granted, it was fun, but it seemed as though they didn't know where they wanted the movie to go, and decided to throw in some random action sequences.Despite these flaws, I think this was a strong movie with great visuals and a fascinating premise. I wasn't exactly blown away by the idea of false reality like some other people (probably because I've considered it before), and I don't think it was as deep as some people say, but it was still interesting, original, and (above all) stylish.",8,0,0,5 July 1999
