Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," This is Messed Up
","A very entertaining, and very disturbing picture. Is he poking fun at the U.S. or at Kazakhstan? Well, at first glance, one might think Kazakhstan. However, he makes no attempt to actually portray Kazakhstan. It could have just as easily been Uzbekhistan (I probably misspelled that, that's why he is making fun of U.S.) You see, he wanted to show how ignorant Americans are of the world, and indeed he is right.So he goes on a road trip, starting from New York, going through the South, and finally ending up in California. All the way through, it is one shocking, bazaar scene after another. Despite showing our ignorance, as a Southerner, I actually wasn't offended at how he portrayed us. OK, so we know so little about the world that we think Kazakhstan is so primitive that they don't know how to use toilet paper, and use a sack to wrap their droppings and don't know where to dispose of it. But, you have to admit, the people throughout the South were very polite, very hospitable. The Southern Jews seemed like very nice people. It took bringing a prostitute to get him kicked out of the dinner party, and even when he kissed a man at the rodeo, the man politely explained to him that that sort of thing isn't done here, unless, well, you know. Wait until you see how the black rappers treat him.I should warn you though, there is a very disturbing scene with two naked guys fighting and crawling all over each other. You can imagine what they can do with that, but its best not to. Yeah, that about made me vomit.After laughing and being disgusted, I can't deny how brilliant and unique this is. Very over the top though. Also I don't think he accomplished everything he wanted to, as, like I said, the South didn't come out that bad after all, compared to the rest I suppose. So, I gave it 8 out of 10. It will upset you, but see it. You've never seen anything like it, I guarantee.",8,0,5,4 December 2006
Spartacus," I'm Spartacus!
","If you have ever stood in the face of tyranny, perhaps standing for the Union contract in a place of work, or a schoolboy defending another against a bully, than you are Spartacus. Spartacus is a man who'd rather die on his feet, than live on his knees. You gotta fight the power, man!!! I like to believe there is a little Spartacus in all of us.Seriously though, great classic. Good acting all around, especially Spartacus of course. And Sir Lawrence Olivier (Crassus) is always great. The love scenes with Spartacus were very genuine, good chemistry. And though this movie is long, it is well worth it.4/5 stars.",9,3,5,17 December 2006
Rosemary's Baby," Brilliant, scary, imaginative, and controversial
","We can see how horror movies were evolving in the late 60s. Even so, this movie was ahead of its time. At the same time, the movie has a slow plot that gradually unfolds throughout very smoothly.The acting of Mia Farrow was half the movie right there. She is a naive Catholic girl unaware of how she is being betrayed. Nothing like watching a pretty young Catholic girl being taken advantage of. (I'm really not like that in real life. Horror movies are my outlet.) This movie is definitely worth watching for those who love imagination and a somewhat drawn-out story line. It is not for slasher fans and gore hounds, however. Sure, there are a few good sex scenes, but they tie into the intellectual quality of this movie. Not much for gore at all.The only weakness I see in this film is in the ending. (Don't worry, this isn't a spoiler.) Maybe Polanski bit off more than he could chew. I see what he was going for, but he was holding back I think. It was a little weak. It probably could have used some gore.I gave it 9 of 10. The ending, though controversial and dark, was somewhat weak and cost it a perfect 10 from me, which I reserve for the very best.",9,2,3,10 February 2005
