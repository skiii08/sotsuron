The Legend of Bagger Vance," A great film, with a nostalgic touch.
","One of the persons that made a review on this film complains because of a movie that works golf more than the characters. Is it necessary always to follow the same patterns? I think it is the director choice how to manage a story and present it to us. In Robert Redford case, he did it elegantly, convincingly, and knowingly. He is telling us in images, what the book says in words. When you play a game like golf, it is yourself, the ball and the course. There's no one to blame for those bad shots; it is you and only you. It's a selfish game that will always test you. If you have your ears open, you will hear the Golfing Gods and learn the lesson. If not, you are nothing but a weekend hacker, having a good time with no brain in it. Yes it's true, it is not a masterpiece, and there are moments when you think the story could be worked a little bit more, but at the end the message is delivered, and you must be there to acknowledge receipt.",Null,0,1,16 February 2001
