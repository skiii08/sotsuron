Iron Man 3," Disengaging ,bad screenplay & plot
","I am a big fan of Iron man series. Because i believe this is the only super hero which is possible in reality. As its made out of technology. And you all know the power of technology. I went with pretty high expectations. But .....Plot was week. The build up of Mandarin was good. But the way it was revealed it took the interest out of screenplay. Also the true action sequence was only in last 20 minutes, except that it was a joke. Maya's (one stand of RDJ) sudden empathy towards Tony stark's situation wasn't justified, just after listening a 2 min speech from Tony Stark. Also there were many loop holes, The way he got the info about Mandarin's where abouts was too simple & why he hasn't used his force earlier in the movie ... And he use to jump places without making things more clear ... Though it seems to be the end of Iron Man .. I wish to see him in future .8 out of 10 rating doesn't justify this movie. Its around 7 out of 10.",7,5,10,28 April 2013
