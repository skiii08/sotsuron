It," Wow it was actually scary! Like a good old horror movie from the 90s!
","I read the book and saw the first movie, but I don't remember much, except that I haven't been this impressed! The remake might have surpassed the original.I was only interested to see how the actor would play the clown... at some point I thought 'damn, how scarier can he get!?' He'd make a good joker replacement to the grandiose Heath Ledger.I expected the kids to just be a screeching annoyance, but wow they can act! I was especially impressed by the very young brother. They looked genuinely terrified in a contagious way, which made the movie credible.It's deeper than just a monster movie. Each kid has dark social issues that may be worse than the demon. Some scenes were brutal. The children's courage was inspiring.Stephen King is truly the master of horror, and I am happy that someone made a movie to show 'it'.It takes talent to turn something fun and silly into something terrifying.I also enjoyed the movie: Clown (2014)",8,1,3,29 October 2017
Justice League," Not the best superhero movie, but it's nice to have more
","I wish we had an origin movie for Cyborg and Aquaman before this one. They're cooler than expected but it felt rushed.The Flash was adorable with his quirks! He's the first geeky super hero since Spiderman. He's my favorite.It's nice to have a strong female role model for a change.Batman was nice, but I prefer Superman. I liked to see him angry, his upper lip seemed twisted with a disgusted growl... but that's actually CGI to hide his mustache!!!?I'm poor enough to have a limited food budget, but I actually paid to go see this movie in theaters to encourage the industry. But they wasted millions editing his mustache instead to shave him and glue a fake one for the movie M:I 6. Shameful.I regret paying for it (stop using your bright phones in theaters!!!) but I'm happy I saw it. The villain wasn't memorable... so the plot was dull... But I enjoyed meeting new superheroes, I guess it's better than nothing.",7,0,3,21 November 2017
Deadpool," Pay for it to demand more of this cool s***
","When they shut him up in 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine', I was outraged! But that movie is what I hoped to get and more. I was laughing in the opening credits... That takes genius... and madness~I suggest that you pay to see it in IMAX, you'll see more blood in bigger details, and with the added bonus of doing a big FU to the people who denied us this juicy pleasure for years!!! Because they thought it wouldn't be profitable, so let's prove them wrong to get more. They thought that people would be too narrow minded and boring to be able to enjoy crazy originality.I know I did~ And many others too, it became an instant classic. I thought that it rated in the best movies released lately, but it was in a list of the best movies of all times!!!I just adore his WTF humor. But the vulgarity might be trying to hide a sensitive heart~ Murderers and w***** can love too, you know!!!Ryan Reynolds, thank you for fighting to have this movie come to life, and the way it should be this time. You're totally awesome, even disfigured.I'm a prude and I totally approve of this f****** movie, even the sex scene was cool for once.",10,43,92,17 February 2016
