Initially, the Avengers movie has some incredible special effects. Furthermore, the producer of the movie did a great a outstanding job in the form that he made the movie. However, the movie did have one or two scenes hear and their that were not so great, but later would insert scenes that made the watchers of the movie jump out of their seat at the movie theater. Nevertheless, you can not forget the actors who did an outstanding job to.Initially, the Movie Avengers has some outrageous special effects just like for example, the scene where hulk smashes the huge snake with ugly creatures ready to fight inside of it.
