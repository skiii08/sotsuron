54," Sexy and Cool... ;)
","This film from ´98 is a great production. Lot's of stars here, Neve Campbell, Salma Hayek, Ryan Phillippe and Mike Myers. This film is based on the real studio 54, in New York in the 70's. The film's got lot's of cool and sexy scenes...and not to forget; Neve Campbell is brilliant (as usual) in this movie. The music here is great! The classic songs from the 70's and the 80's. 'I would..baby...ooohhh..ohh..!' -A Classic! For you who's born and grew up at this time..you will really enjoy this film. I was born in 1984...so I don't have any memory of this world-famous club...54! =( Too bad..Mike Myers caracter is gay..and he's play the role excellent! He looks, talks and he's behavior couldn't be more gay... Neve Campbell is so sexy and cool, while Ryan Phillippe and Salma Hayek plays inicent roles, both of them, very good!Now to the rating; I love this film, cu's it has a cool, tough and a sexy story. The actors is great and so are the music. While i'm in the the rating I just have to say that the soundtrack to this film, is Great!! 5 stars / 5 stars... And I'll give the movie ***** / ***** <-It's very well worth it! -yes it is.. :)Watch it now..you will love it...!",Null,1,2,28 June 2002

Schindler's List," Wonderful
","This film is a beauty in itself. All this happend during the second world-war. The poor Jews were killed and brutally murdered in the most places of Europe by the Nazi-people. This film is located round a German man by the name Oscar Schindler who tried for 110% to save as many jews as possible. You follow his vision about this, and lot's of disgusting things happens on his way to the Jewish freedom. Schindler's list is a film that everybody Should see, even though you like or dislike films like this one. ALL of these sequences is based on TRUE story, and has got some reflections in the Middle-east situation today. That the jews always has been a hunted people.You really Should see this film. Shalom, Goodbye, Hej DÃ¥, Aurevoir, Auf Wiedersehn.",Null,9,13,11 May 2004

Pocahontas," A beautiful animated film
","This is a cute animated film by Walt Disney. It was the 1995 year Disney-film. It's lot's of music in the film, and I like that! I think that it should be more music-scenes in the Disney movies. This is one of the best modern Disney-films, along with 'Beauty and the Beast' (1991) and 'The Lion King' from 1994. If you liked those films, U will love Pocahontas! I promise.. ;)",Null,1,3,6 February 2002
