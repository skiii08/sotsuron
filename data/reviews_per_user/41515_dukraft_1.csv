Scarface," One of the greatest movies made
","Scarface, can be viewed with one of two attitudes.  It can be seen as a simple shootem up action movie, or a drama that shows the rise and fall of a great drug lord, the corruption of money and power, the american dream, and where it leads tony montana.I understand why some users gave this movie low votes, but I think that is because they never considered the underlying themes.  When close attention is paid to scarface, there are more and more ideas that are expressed. One could even study how tony speaks, because the carefully chosen words express much more than you think.  One of my favorite quotes is 'i always tell the truth, even when I lie.'  I can see here where one user might call it an oxymoron and a stupid line.  I however think it means allot.  Tony was always raw, always told the truth.....just watch the movie with an open mind, i think you'll like it.",10,1,2,28 February 2001
