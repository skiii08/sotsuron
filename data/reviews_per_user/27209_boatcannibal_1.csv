Requiem for a Dream," Hard-hitting, heartbreaking.
","I first heard about this film through it's soundtrack. When I saw the ratings for this film, and also I had seen 'Pi' I had very high expectations for this film. I had to admit, I was not disappointed.This film is a story of four drug addicts, and how it devastates their lives. It's a hard hitting drama with amazing performances from all the actors. None of my friends have ever seen this film, but I hope that one day the do, as this shows the horrible consequences of drugs. At first, I could not cope with this film. It was to real and had a very different affect on me than most films I had ever seen. This movie had some of the most thrilling, the most beautiful, the most devastating scenes I have ever seen, and they lingered in my mind long after viewing.If you like films that live happily ever after then, I think 'Requiem For A Dream' is not the film for you. This film is truly real, and very devastating.",10,0,0,22 April 2008
