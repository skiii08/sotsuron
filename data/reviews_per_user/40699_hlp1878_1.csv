The New World," Long and boring
","I am so glad I didn't go to the premier, we were told by email about it coming out and I was excited to see it but instead ended up waiting and buying the DVD. Very disappointed, the pacing is really slow, the music doesn't fit at all (romantic piano) in the Virginia woods, is just hooky. The movie spends as much time if not more on dialog-less, long tracking shots of walks in the woods as it does on Pocahontos children being born or on her dying on the way back to America. In other words it wasted a lot of time on stuff that didn't matter. There were also jump cuts something I rarely see in any movie like a scene would suddenly go back then jump into another scene like a drop frame of something very disrupted to the flow of most movies but with this one it just a devise to wake you up. Not one of my favorite movies. My recommendation is don't waste your time on this one.",3,1,4,19 June 2006
