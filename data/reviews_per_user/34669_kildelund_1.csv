The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Good movie with a few elements that are rare in movies.
","What a movie, eh? This particular movie, in The Hunger Games series, has received criticism for being kind of a drag and not a lot of action shows in the movie. However, I LOVE this movie because it shows a different element in war... Propaganda. It's a topic that not many 'war movies' show. It's true that there isn't a lot of action, but who needs action, when a movie is blessed with such wonderful actors as Jennifer Lawrence, Elizabeth Banks, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland and many other talented actors and actresses. My only real criticism is the constant three way love story, which I'm getting tired of but, hey, that's one mans opinion.",8,1,4,16 April 2016
