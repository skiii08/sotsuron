Requiem for a Dream," One of the worst stories
","The good: Actors did a splendid job. So did the director. Scenes were wonderfully filmed. In fact, the whole movie is a masterpiece when it comes to visuals. It kind of reminded me movies by Guy Ritchie. It is filmed in a similar manner. Also, I think this movie is great for teenagers. It contains nudity in some scenes, but I think that in the context this movie is presenting it, the whole message would be a good one for the kids. After all, they've seen nudity all over the internet. One little movie won't hurt their innocence, however it will build up an emotion inside which I think will help them renounce the wish to try drugs.That's it. What about the movie itself? What about the story? The conflict? Well, I am afraid, there is NONE. The whole movie was extremely predictable, just like a teenage horror movie. It was incredibly hard not to know what was going to happen. A little drama then *sniff*. A bit more drama and again *sniff*. And the drama escalates as the *sniff* escalates. Which is all so obvious, that it became very boring to watch. I've read a few reviews, that this movie is about addictive dreams and stuff. Yeah, I guess it is. But all dreams are addictive. There's nothing special about this movie. All I saw was seriously weak people. Their weakness combined with their stupidity made me predict the ending right from the beginning. Of course not in details, but in general it happened like it should have happened. Actually there is no drama (in a good sense) here. Drama is when Al Pacino becomes the Godfather and he swears not to kill, while his men kill every opponent. That's drama. Nothing even close is seen here. My brain was corroding into jelly while watching this movie. It's pure nonsense. It's a world outside my world. One which I don't really wanna see in details. One which is boring, ugly, full of despair and stupidity. The whole movie was about this world. Nothing else.I want my 2 hours back.",2,2,3,22 September 2011
Gravity," Total disappointment and probably the worst movie I recently saw
","Double warning: this does contain MAJOR spoilers.A movie has to have a good general idea and a detailed plot. As a general rule, good movies are good in all of them. However, not this one. The idea of the movie is that Russians (who else?) blew up one of their satellites, which brought havoc among every other object in orbit. I mean WHAT? Blowing up a satellite? You need a HUGE missile, and it would probably miss. And it would generate huge amounts of space junk, which is bad for everyone. Nobody is THAT stupid. But whatever, what happens if an object explodes in space? Well, most of the debris forms a ring resembling the orbit of the original object. In its initial stage, it's just a small cloud of debris, traveling at enormous speeds relative to the earth. In order to hit that debris however, you need to be VERY unlucky. And if you get that unlucky - you won't get to see it. Any of it. Because of its sheer speed. Unless its on the same orbit as you are, in which case the speed will be virtually the same, and that astronaut wouldn't have a hole through its head, and you wouldn't meet up with the debris again for at least a few months. So the idea is utter nonsense. But that's not all. So you're adrift in space. Somehow an astronaut has enough fuel to go get you, and drag you back to the shuttle, then find a convenient INTACT space station nearby and decides to move there. It's like you can take a walk calmly in space to any space station, and astronauts are waving flashlights at each other as pranks. Yeah, totally, every object in space is there, except for satellite debris, which comes like a wave and hits ONLY the station that you are on, and ONLY when you're just about to do something important, like get in or get out.So OK, the idea is total nonsense, that only a 3yr old would believe, what about the plot? Yeah, astronauts in space, working, and one is joy- flying his jetpack, listening to the radio, joking... Yeah, this is how it's done. And when Clooney's character is about to let go of the rope, it's like someone is pulling him. It's like he's not a subject of microgravity. Yeah, he's going DOWN. And she? Even if they had the same speed, the same direction, and virtually the same position, she was just left there, floating. Yeah, totally legit. That really made me angry at whoever made this plot. That, and the stupid heroic action of Clooney's character. I was like 'Ok, now all you need to do is pull just a bit, and he'll come to you gently', then I was like 'WHAT? What do you mean let go? Pull him! WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?!'. It's an appalling way to kill a character. Worse than Tasha Yar in Star Trek TNG. And what about that re-entry angle? Without ANY input from the pilot, when the whole thing explodes, the capsule just HAPPENS to stabilize in the right position, and just HAPPENS to go in at just the right angle? And what's that wind at the beginning of re-entry? There is no pressure (wind) at those altitudes. First there is just impact by particles, that make stuff burn. Yeah, like you see in shooting stars. And the ship is being destroyed by this wind, while the astronaut outside is just floating carelessly around it. Yeah, sure. And filmmakers, if you want to draw stuff moving at ten miles per second, DON'T draw it. That's it. It's too fast to see it. And you should know from ballistics, that when an object THAT size hits a water melon, the water melon explodes because of the pressure wave inside it. There, we have an intact, but perforated head. Like it was surgically cut with a laser. This is insane! And that fire inside the ISS? First of all, fire is just plasma from the combining of gasses. So if something burns, it constantly needs a supply of gas. If you don't have it - all you get is a ball of smoke, and not a ball of fire. And if something burns inside the station, oxygen gets consumed within just a few seconds. There is giant pressure, no oxygen. So even if the fire is legit, she would've suffocated within 2-3 seconds or after the first explosion. And the pressure inside should've made the whole station explode to bits. Yet she managed to stay alive. And what about that radio contact with that dude with a dog and kid? Surely they could've made contact with someone at ESA, NASA, or the space programs that I don't know the names of, from countries like Russian, India, China, Japan. Oh, yeah, I forgot. Russia is the bad guys who caused this in the first place. Everybody hates Russia. The bottom line: The accuracy of physics here is worse than in 'Quantum Apocalypse'; acting is either very bad (I felt no emotions), or the script for them was incredibly bad; the event succession is as credible as a fairy tale. Don't watch it if you have a functioning brain. You'll regret it.",5,1,3,16 March 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," As good as the original
","It will be hard not to give spoilers.The good: The movie does pack some realistic mini-scenarios. Almost no magic or unknown science. Almost everything about the methods and gadgets is well within non-fiction science. The whole scenario of the movie is also pretty realistic, with no superheroes or any sign of non-human superiority. Which does make the movie extremely fun to watch, because you know that at any moment things might go the wrong way. Actors also have done a pretty good job (it seems to me, but I'm bad at recognizing bad acting). They have even spoken foreign languages pretty realistically, almost without accent.The bad: Some unlikely events in the movie were happening over and over and over again. They are unlikely, but till the end it became kind of obvious that it will happen again. Hard to explain without spoilers. Watch it, it's absolutely worth it, and you'll see what I'm talking about. In the scenario, some conflicts would be easier to solve by negotiating instead of risking everything and fighting. Kind of a disappointment from the characters.",8,1,2,10 June 2012
