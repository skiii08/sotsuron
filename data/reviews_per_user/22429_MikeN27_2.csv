Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A few less special effects
","I liked the movie, but I wish George Lucas would stop worshipping special effects so much.  What made the first two installments great was that we knew the characters.  The original starts off with a bang, but we then get to know the main characters for the rest of the movie.  Lucas was able to blend the action with an actual story.  Here, it appears that he bought into his own hype.  Star Wars is no religion, no matter how much some people want to believe.  He takes a little bit from each major religion and comes up with the force.  The Senate scenes are wonderful and could be so interesting, but Lucas seems to be too anxious to get back to the war. It's a truly fun movie to see, but it could be more.  A little more humanity and less computerization would enhance the future efforts.",2,0,1,14 June 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Shocking
",Shocking only because I thought the creators of South Park incapable of making a movie that provokes any type of thought.  I loved this movie.  It was hilarious and intelligent.  They showed how many Americans claim to be protecting our children when they are only interested in pushing their beliefs upon us. An impressive effort by the creators of SOuth Park.,9,0,0,17 January 2000
