Blade Runner 2049," Movie, I wanted to like you, but you did not make it easy
","Summary above is just a paraphrase of one of movies dialog part - in pretty much unnecessary and too long arguing (with fists, guns, words) scene chain. So, it started reasonably good, although was obvious that will be slow walk. 2h49min. All it could fit in 90 minutes, if not less. There was something new - scenes at his home with holographic Anna de Armas were best part of movie - at least something refreshing.
I thought: finally a good Denis VIlleneuve movie. Well, I was too optimistic, because things started to be just boring, predictable and not much sense in dialogs, bad pace, editing - too slow one moment, then just quick scene change.
What is wrong with today's filmmakers ? Although, I can ask it in middle of review - what was wrong with old way of review displaying here ? Now, if your review is not at top, so on first 1-2 pages, nobody will see it. Additionally, 'order by usefulness' - come on - who judges that ? Is some review with rating 1 for this movie really useful ? I mean, I'm not happy with it, but it has some good, mediocre parts, so deserves more than 2-3 at least. 
And to say here: some reviewers really don't get that it happens in another reality, not our. There is still Soviet Union alive in 2049, you may see large Atari advert, building (yep, they were strong in 1982).
Back to review. After some 40 mins it became quite predictable. I said at one moment - Harrison Ford will appear in 1 minute. I was wrong - he appeared after some 4 minutes - but that was just because so slow pace, stretched scenes. Reminded me on Heaven's Gate - another high budget failure. 
Dialogs: very sparse word usage, often just hard to get what they mean, what talk about. Worst was probably at the end, when Ryan Gosling said to old man something like 'I did, but you were dead out there' - that just did not make sense considering happenings before - concrete he was not able to let him die out there, because was not aware at all about him. 
There was lot of unnecessary and boring fight scene, some unnecessary 'F' words - typical for bad dialogs - if I can't write something smart, let it be f-dramatized :-) 
150 m. budget, and CGI was not bad, but far from impressive. Now, I need to watch original to have some comparison. They will earn some + money even with that :-) 
For the end, movie was shot in Hungary. There was some old lady yelling in Hungarian on stairs - OK. But why Edward James Olmos retired in Hungarian language ? :-)))) Is there Hunger Town in LA in 2049 ? :-)))",5,0,2,26 December 2017
Molly's Game," Why should I care for egoist ?
","It looked as good on paper - Alan Sorkin, Jessica Chastain, biography ...
So, I went into local theater to watch it. And that was really bad idea. Bad idea was too, to get some sympathy by saying 'f* you' right at beginning. Now I think that Sorkin should stay at writing. Storytelling was almost not present, there was narration of her (Molly) instead, but it was rather irritating than helping. Why ? Because all it was so egoistic. Right, that's proper word, and I just added it to summary of review. One scene too slow, other too fast, with barely followable dialogs ... And I knew that it will be almost 2.5 hours, so did what probably never before - went out for drink. 'Beer will be good to calm self down, and yes, will give me excuse for another 'vacation' from this mess'. Basically, all what kept me from leaving it was that wanted to see ending. That was not done well, especially very last part, and another egoistic talk. But verdict was interesting. Actually, it could be much better subject for some much better movie. As it was, most of movie focused on less relevant things, and all was just superficial.Somehow I remembered one short scene from my life, more than 40 years ago. It was in bar, where most of people were more-less drunk. So, a prostitute, not so young anymore, not that attractive, stand in front of mirror on wall, and said 'Beauty matters not, what matters is how you mixing in bed' (mixing maybe sounds not best in English, but I'm sure you got it) . Well, that short scene and monologue says much more about life than this 140 minutes of 'I will survive' bragfest . I'm sure she will. But why should I care more for her than for some working man, mother, who making not money and fame, just complete 'irrelevant' things for life - like food, cleanness, future of kind ...
In bigger part I just had feeling that it is not realistic. Forget money, get real life. Then maybe will make better movies too.",3,10,17,22 May 2018
Ocean's Twelve," Very educative
","Last evening I watched 'Ocean's Twelve'. Couple years after it arrived. It was just because of 'not much left in DVD rental'. First hour was extremely boring mess. Second half was something better, even started to look as movie. Anyway, I learned some things about how to pass laser guarding system and went into night to gain something from it... I managed to reach desk with top secret plans for future movies. And guess what I found? Rough script for 'Ocean's Twenty-two'. What a nice presence for movie fans! I will post here some parts - considering limit of length, I can not posting whole.Ocean's Twenty-two:Danny sits on plane and flies away from his wife, town, child. When Tess arrives home she sees instead her son message: 'Pay 2 billion bucks or never see him alive'. She calls Danny with coded message: 'The rats eaten tomato'. Danny was shocked, but only for moment. He went into cockpit and asked them to turn back - 'My son's life is in danger!'. They said 'OK. After all we are humans.'. So, he is back. Following actions aren't developed in script, but some basements are made: he will have rescue team of 22 man, every race and for the first time every sex. They will lift whole building to rescue their son. All it will be after collecting informations in Rio, Casablana, Singapur and Napoli. Or maybe just good old Europe will be better?In one of many relaxed social scenes George Clooney's character will ask 'Do I really look as 70 year old?'. - 'No, for Christ sake, Danny'. And when we are at ages: Julia Robert's character will be asked/forced to act daughter of movie star Julia Roberts - because she is almost like her.At the end they will get 2 billions (and son back) because admitted that Bill Gates is better businessman than Danny.",3,0,0,1 March 2007
Interstellar," Review after second watch, 4 years later
","High rated movie, expected with big hype in it's time, as it was (and is) usual with Christopher Nolan movies.
Indeed, it is visual masterpiece, with stellar casting, but I did not see much from title - Interstellar travel was marginalized, actually all it was some half minute wormhole crawling. Scientific part was marginal too, but that was to expect. Instead it, we has some high emotional family drama, combined with heavy 'time dilatation', fifth dimension again, combined with gravity. All it with some goal, but will not go into it to not spoil it.
Sad thing is that all it did not make much sense. There were spectacular shots, landscapes, but our heroes, at least scientist ones made mostly bad decisions. Exception was main character Cooper, just a pilot/engineer. Well, that's what people likes to see, I guess.
Worst part was last 10 minutes. Rushed after about 2.5 hours not always fast paced happenings.
The good: robot was cool.Now, I'm on very strong opinion that only right way is to take more care about our Planet and to keep it habitable, to make it better as is at moment - and that is possible - while interstellar travel is still wild fiction. Even travel to Mars is pretty much it, and just not option for transferring millions - even 5 is too much, really. Why so much movies about moving on places which are far worse than some desert or Antarctic ?",7,1,1,21 October 2018
The Theory of Everything," The picture with many missing parts
","It was obvious that this will be mostly about their romance, marriage, and not about Stephen Hawking's work, ideas. And that was good for me. Beginning was good, not great. What irritated me was that almost constant yellow shine, blurred picture - it should increase idealistic atmosphere, or what ? Anyway, they felt in love, then came horrible news about disease, and Jane proved saying: 'after every successful man, there is a woman' . It was in fast pace, marriage, children came fast, but that was basically a must - when you want to present almost whole life of someone.
Thing became bad after that: 'That was most English thing ...' I don't know how it came - there are choirs in other countries, with plenty of women in . But it sounded well, indeed. So, some other people jumped in their lives, and that was just presented poorly. I was not aware until end text, that they divorced. Whole alienation of couple was not presented well. I guess, they just avoided that unpleasant part. Then was that celebration interview in USA, not really good climax. 
Why he refused knighthood ? - And that was very last text of movie (refusement). Maybe that was because he felt not deserving it because of broken marriage ?
Anyway, this is overrated by me. Acting was fine, camera not, direction OK. But script could do many things better. Only 1 day after, I forgot most of it.",5,2,3,15 May 2018
2012," Usual Emerich stuff with some interesting details
","Well, it was slightly better than I expected. First thing to laud: there was no New York 'attacked' in movie ! I say it because that city is almost mandatory in US (and other) disaster movies. Some more serious things: movie had a message, and I'm little surprised that no one wrote about it here. Of course, message is little shallow, but I really don't see it as bad, as whole movie is such. So, without spoiling it up, just some clues: there were some references about World (Earth, Humankind) today. About greed, rich people (countries) disregarding poor ones. Certainly that China is not chosen just randomly as place for 'ships'. Of course, there was a lot of more-less stupid, overdone scenes. Plane escape was interesting first time in Independence Day, but here almost same was repeated twice. A lot of predictable events, some cliché, etc.Watch carefully final shot of Africa from space - middle of East part.",6,0,0,1 February 2010
Jurassic World," Started well, then got mediocre, ending was just remake
","When I saw that there are 4 scenario writers I was even in dilemma about watching it at all. That's always a bad sign, and means usually inconsistent, at times messy plot and other not good things. While I'm sucker for dinosaur movies. Later prevailed, so I went to watch it. It was better than expected in first 30 minutes. Not that whole family picture and departure was even close to something original, but was decent, and idea and explanation of need for creating new, more spectacular dinos because 'classic' ones became boring is actually pretty realistic description of today situation in entertainment industry.Idea about training raptors is a bit of extreme, but don't forget that raptors were shown in Crichton's book (where all this started) as super intelligent, fast, cooperative specie. At least in movie they gave more realistic top speed for them than in book (80 instead 100 km/h) . Talking about 2 leg ones, just to add. But here ends short list in what this could be better than book, or first two Jurassic movies. Character development is just poor, 2 main character relation development was what made me laugh couple times - kiss in first place, then wise words at end :-) a CGI was not bad, but could be better in 2015. For a World, there should be really more dino species shown.Now the bad, and very bad part(s): lot of it was just replica of first Jurassic movie, and little from second: the kids on Islar, stupid park (Island/World) control ... Ending should be some climax, but it was just lame. There was no sense in that attacking of I-Rex by raptors after what happened before. And all it was in first movie, almost same. I hope that everyone saw it, so this is not spoiler. It seems, that writers went out of ideas completely at end. Military subplot was also pretty lame, and really unrealistic - not that I think about them as some very smart people, but this was way too low.Rating is still 6 after all bad words about, because good start, some good (for pure fun) scenes, like attacking by pterodactyls. Good for warm summer afternoon/evening. Only in theaters with air-condition :-)",6,2,7,11 July 2015
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Weapon fetishist destruction of viewer's time
","I really don't understand people who think that Doug Liman is good (great ?) director. Just because of couple quick quasi camera movements and lot of act/destruction scene. Beginning is dull - Mr. & Mrs. sitting ahead camera and answers marriage adviser. Then we can see (minor spoiler ahead) how they met & how are armed in any situation. Should it be action, parody, comedy or what? Dialogs are poor, too shallow, one liners too, Brad's voice is often not clear... All about weapons in this movie is pure fetishism: huge and shiny guns, rocket launchers etc. They are some kind of super mans, equipped and employed in expensive high-tech surrounding. Killing business looks very attractive here: nice young girls around, big rewards... Directing is far from great - sometimes is not clear what happening. Instead smart we have here: big, many, shiny, expensive etc. I'm disappointed that Angelina Jolie took this role, I used to see her in better movies. Even Tomb Raider was cleverer. Rating: 3/10, just because of couple jokes.",3,0,2,29 September 2005
Inception," Brilliantly executed ... fooling of viewers
","This is indeed C. Nolan's movie which I liked least among all I watched. And I watched all his Batman movies, and was not impressed, except with Begins.
Surely very high budget, impressive cast, and I actually like all them, but this was simply too pretentious, and full with scenes which actually had nothing with story flow.I even could not call this sci-fi, because whole idea of multiplied time-flow speed in dreams in dream(s) is simply impossible, and is too much even for Hollywood, who does not care much for some scientific accuracy.Add to it length of some 2.5 hours, while whole story is not complex at all. After some years, I basically don't remember almost anything except main part of plot, and that silly scene of shooting on street, what was so utterly pointless.Still, I will not rate it with 1-2, as many did here, because visually it looks very well, direction is good most part. Acting too.Could be most overrated movie ever ...",5,1,1,6 February 2019
Arrival," It arrived finally here in cinemas, but did not deliver
","I really expected this will be some masterpiece after seeing trailers, reading some announcements. And I really like intelligent Sci-Fi. Only that it is very rare achievement, and sadly this one is just not Sci-Fi at all in fact. There is nothing from Sci in it. Could write here long list of nonsense, may say even lazy writing. Will just discuss few: that invitation of Louise by Colonel was total non realistic, even for Hollywood standards. Then, that climbing up in alien (apropo - why was it big thing when Louise called them first 'aliens' ?) ship and whole solution to welcome humans there was pathetic. Of course, all it was just setup for later explosion scene - practically only action part of movie, but left me total cold, because it was so unreal and forced.They should explain, give background for many things - at least give 1-2 minutes about people who placed explosive there. And no way that Louise and Donnelly did not notice in 4 minutes those big red LED downcounters. Then came that 'use weapons' nonsense part, what should be some climax - but it was too early, and my first thought was that Louise would not say it to military people (in real World, events) - especially not because was not sure that it is proper translation. That is indeed the weakest part of movie - just forced, not good written. And whole idea about different sense of time, seeing the future is utter crap. I'm sorry, but that is not possible, and more important, they should not go in whole dying child thing there - which mother would not try anything to save her child ? This was just too extreme case. Was the point in that even she knew the outcome, she went in 'let's make child' thing ? - my God, this was even so primitive ...Much better movie could be made with just this as main theme: Girl can see the future and dying kid, abandoning husband, just meets him on work, and they make family, but then the classic question: is future determined ahead (fate) or we can do something to change it ? And of course, normal mother would do everything to save her child. Now, that would be something, even if maybe seen already. This was just attempt to make something new - new type of encounter, aliens. Most of things were just to impress viewer on emotional base, but it just worked not in my case, and may say not by most of viewers. Too bad for director and really good main actors.",4,24,50,27 January 2017
Lucy," Mindless is only proper word for this cerebral capacity nonsense romp
","Doing movie about cerebral capacity usage without any logic, with heavy pseudo science - that's what Luc Besson (writer and director) did here. I can think only that he was high during whole time when made it. Too bad, because he really has gift for film making. Only good thing about this was pace, that's why I gave 2 stars. Actors: Morgan Freeman in another typical role of 'scientist', throwing another pile of crap to audiences - like that cell will choose immortality in environment without life support :-). Indeed, movie would be much better without that whole pseudo science crap - but it tried to be serious - what is biggest flaw. Scarlett Johansson: probably best cast for this. Cool bitch most of time. Possible that some did not accept role after reading script. Overdone violence, without any sense in most cases: probably worst moment was killing of taxi driver just because he did not speak English. But that driving during Paris, causing death of minimum 20 people was also plain mindless. Couple words about superpowers: how can increasing cerebral capacity bring telekinetic, time travel and other things ? Author seriously lacks some elementary knowledge. But he likes blood on screen. No thanx, no Luc. We don't need such person, who kills brainlessly, lacks any empathy totally to be someone who shows us the new path. You are just lost, and sequel (what I just saw that is announced) can be only even bigger pile of nonsense.",2,4,10,20 February 2017
The Matrix," Alternate reality
","This movie introduced some real new ideas, solutions, and is probably most successful cult film. Because it is really cult one. I guess especially younger people was/is fascinated, much more than some older, who read, seen something of/about alternate reality, forged reality.For me, most interesting and moving part was early scene with Morpheus, when he introduced Neo with reality. I would rate it more than 8 if there was more such scene instead for my taste too much fight scenes. Even if they were pretty much innovative.Now, some days ago, I was shocked seeing that authors of this movie are Wachowski sisters - and I knew that Larry went thru gender change somewhere in 2003. But other one ... Now it is little corrected, but still - what matters: their names and gender when movie was made, or what is today ? Yeah, this is probably something new, but I really tend to keep record with original names, condition. Imagine now that instead John Houston and his pic. we see now something like 'former John Houston' and picture of his grave. But maybe I'm just an old fashioned old grumpy man, who can not accept new things, habits in society. Or this new, pushed by some circles PC behavior, even if it resulted already in lot of nonsense and absurdness. I guess, they really are in some kind of alternate reality. And when realize how wrong it is, it will be to late. Worst thing is that there is already lot of it, seen in Matrix present - tracking, watching, hearing people via computers, smart phones (GPS) etc.And unlike in movie Matrix, good fighting skills, slow motion (time freeze) will not help in this. I was on that will watch it again from time to time, but sorry, things in our reality are more shocking and scary. As say: life writes best stories. Pardon, wrong word. Not best, most interesting. Not good. Where is Neo, when we need him ?",8,1,1,21 January 2020
Annihilation," Is there hope for human race with scientists like this ?
","This would be 3rd movie where scientists in main role act like idiots most time, what I had misfortune to see in last year. Other 2: Life, Alien Covenant.
Beginning was not bad, and it promised some interesting voyage into unknown.
But, when I seen how 5 females walk toward 'Shimmer', with riffles in hand, I started to not like it. And it just got worse. Going to certain bio-hazard area without protection ? And main actress even knew that is 'infected' little later.
On top of stupid things it became very slow in many scenes. And so on ...Now, this movie made me thinking, no, not because good movies make people thinking (criteria failed), it is just me, who was reminded on some other recent movies. So, I think that if time will come to abandon this planet, and go to some other one (to destroy it too ???), we should exclude all those with Dr. before name , except medical doctors. And I will say now: I'm not going to Titan. I prefer global warming to -200 C. 
What is life ? Destroy, or be destroyed. With scientists we have high risk to not only destroy own home, but being destroyed by single entity. In one movie (don't remember now which), human race was compared with viruses - as only species which destroy environment what gives them conditions for life. So, we have a lot to learn from most of animals. They are indeed smarter. Why ? I guess because they don't watch 'Sci-Fi' movies :-)",3,0,1,3 May 2018
Mad Max: Fury Road," In some way it is true sequel of Road Warrior
","For start to say that I watched all Mad Max movies in past, right as they started to show in cinemas. Most memorable was part 2 - theater was full, with people standing at sides. So, I watched Fury Road 2 days ago, and wrote review here, but now I feel need to edit it, add some thoughts. Because some things are more clear now, after some digesting and rewatching of Mad Max 2. I was surprised about that final tanker chase took only some 11-12 minutes. Funny is how human memory distorting things - as that chase was most impressive part, I thought that it was some half of movie time ..Fury Road involves tanker almost at very beginning, and it is present during whole movie/journey. So, my theory is that Miller wanted to develop (to say so) that part to the max. , with help of modern CGI, and of course much higher budget.Even title is confirming it - Fury Road suits perfectly.So focus is on road action scenes, which make about 70% of running time. At begin is some car-less action too, and we have some slower and shower parts too, for allowing audience to take breath and see something lovely among all that destruction. The plot is nothing deep, but that was not to expect. Basically, all happens around huge tanker vehicle, - as it was in Mad Max 2 finish. Actually, all before it was just some shallow story, all in purpose to lead to road action. Did not like that Max wearing that ridiculous TDKR mask too long time. Don't know was it just Miller's weird humor. Now, about what happens most time: action on road: absolutely spectacular and mad. Lot of kamikaze moves, over top huge vehicles, and inventive, spectacular stunts. Surely there is lot of CGI, and that's good, because no other way to achieve such level of destruction on screen. Although almost everything is over top, I never had feeling that some scene is unrealistic (as it was in many Die Hard, Fast and F. movies). Furious is maybe word what describes it best. Speed is not of essence, but matters a bit. This movie just made what most of action movies failed: managed to make some really original action scenes. What some ? A lot of them ! More than in 10 other action movies.I think that it is result of smart approach. Instead going by scenario, they gone on thinkering out scenes on location self. According to main actress, shooting in Namibia took months, and they were instructed to be on shooting all time, even if scene with them was not planned. Maybe there will be interesting to see dropped scenes on Blue Ray ... (if it can fit on single disk :-) ).For action blockbuster this is pure 10. But there are some weaker parts. like plot, some ridiculous things, fluids. Would say that this was first 'road movie' in this road action franshize - they were basically on journey all time.Sequel is inevitable. I hope that money hunger will not prevail, and that will not rush with it, even if director is in dino age. Good ideas need time.",9,2,8,24 May 2015
Alien: Covenant," Lifeless just as much Life is
","This little play with words in review title is of course about another, recent, very similar movie: Life . I don't think that any was inspired by other, it is just how poor is today mainstream, high budget production. Honestly. I did not expect much from later R. Scott. It was just that there was nothing decent in offer, so I went in watching this. Whole neutrino outburst was pretty messy, unrealistic - as it was shown by CGI, nobody and nothing would survive it. That capsule fire was typical overdone scene, with shock as only purpose. And then, they landed on that 'to good to be true' (probably only wise sentence in movie), did quick air rest, and out from lander without any biological protection, just with weapons (ah, I forgot, it's action movie). And of course ... Then made another stupidity - followed some creature in his horror land. Just like that. I should stop at that point. But it was too hot, and I could not sleep. So, there came some alien gore scenes, and some deep as spoon philosophy by android. And crew members died like flies, until inevitable and predictable retreat. Even more predictable was the end 'twist' - hey writers, if you want to make some real twist, what will not guess 98% of viewers, and what on top of it has some sense, please make some effort and use your gray matter. So, I rate it 4, only because visuals. Script self is 0. Ah, ratings: average here is 6.6 . But in first 2 pages of reviews it is about 1.2 :-)",4,2,4,4 August 2017
V for Vendetta," Remember... remember those ideas.
","I went to first projection of this movie in my city. I usually don't like movies made by comics, but here I had big expectations, because of good reviews, Wachowsky bros and Natalie. It was early afternoon, and surprisingly only 3 people in theater. Oother 2 was 2 young English speaking man, who first asked is it dubbed - fortunatelly for them (and me) was not.Beginning of film is impressive - visually, atmospheric and acting. We can hear some great thoughts from lips behind mask. Hugo made it really fantastic. Other 2 main actor is also great - I can't imagine actress who could play it better than Natalie. Almost forgotten Stephen Rea made it well. All in all, casting is superb (except John Hurt, who overplayed it, with lack of involvement, by me). I was pulled in story, and despite empty theater really enjoyed it... First half only, unfortunately. Second part was not so good, I started to notice script failures. Some things looked pretty forced, maybe even nonsense - I will not list them here. Also, for such big budget movie, I expected to see some innovative TV-s, monitors, but I saw only commercial LCD TV-s/monitors everywhere. If they wanted present nowadays state, they should put also standard (CRT) TV-s too on locations. I wish that final encounter was better developed - I mean, instead of bloody slash of guard mens, something more about Creedy's actions.Summary: great ideas, developed not est, but film probably does what planned - make you think. Some ideas will remain in people certainly, more than effects - I think that ideas are 'responsible' for great acting too. 8/10",8,0,2,21 April 2006
