Blade Runner 2049," Meh, it was OK -- seemed long and disjointed like watching GHOST IN SHELL
","I never really bought into all the hype from the original BLADE RUNNER. It was a good sci-fi, explored different views than were done before. You did believe you were in that place -- built that alternate reality to life. This was more of the same but seemed to drag, there were people talking and checking email on their phones in the theater. About 90 minutes in, we all started checking out watches and talking about where we were going for dinner after. It was good, I won't be buying the DVD. Some of the violence seemed very forced, like the scene with the naked woman -- just out of place. I'd recommend this as a rental.",6,6,11,3 November 2017
Rocketman," appauled when people compare it to BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY .. not even close
","BR was a documentary style film that delved into the creation of one of the greatest bands in history. It all went south when Freddie left his wife and started on a path of death and destruction. ROCKETMAN is a film where Elton John plays the victim of his own insanity. A musical (that wasn't in the previews) about his addictions to sex, drugs, alcohol and food. He blames his parents and the government and bad relationships and .... but the music is the magic. He explains he is a bit of a autistic savant, able to sit down at the piano with lyrics from his writing partner and bang out a tune in under an hour. HIs music is where this movie shines. Unfortunately, it isn't loud enough to overcome the pity and self-indulgence and porn quality lifestyle that makes you wanna go home and shower after the film has ended.",2,33,63,28 June 2019
Wind River," A slow smolder with a great payoff at the end: good film
","A well made thriller that starts slow and builds to a raging bonfire. Mom and I enjoyed this one very much. Great acting and direction made this a must see! The lead was good in Bourne and Avengers as was the female lead in Avengers. I wanted more closure for him at the end and was unimpressed with the physicality of the female FBI agent but overall well done. I like his line throughout the film, 'I am a hunter, that's what I do.' We enjoyed this one. Check it out!",8,1,4,7 September 2017
Captain Marvel," Lots of drama for a C movie, good but not great
","Brie can't act, shocker. There was a lot of drama around this one because RT decided to delete negative reviews but keep fake positive reviews. Disney got involved and bought tickets when there was backlash over the sad feminist stance of the lead. Fanboy websites were warzones. Then it came out and meh. It is OK. She is a board with lines, Sammy plays the same character he does in every movie. They stomped all over canon and had no respect for the original comics. The soundtrack was the best thing about the movie. I liked it, it was better than Batman Vs. Superman but not as good as Aquaman or Shazam. Most sites have it at 6 or 7 stars (except RT which is a Disney marketing tool now). I will watch it again on TV but not buy the DVD.",6,2,5,13 April 2019
Last Flag Flying," Meh - we laughed a few times at this hippie anti-war drama
","This movie was sold as a comedy. It had a much, much darker theme than that. There were a few funny scenes and some buddy moments but overall it was an anti-war movie pushing that government was not your friend and a troop killed in a war zone but not in face-to-face combat is not a hero. Bologna",4,13,39,12 January 2018
Us," First big bomb of the summer, third for Jordon Peele
","Too bad, I kind of liked GET OUT once you get passed the racism. KEANU and ABRUPTO make this another in a chain of disasters. Movie tries to hard but even scary movies have rules and need some logic to their flow. This movie has none. First movie this year I couldn't finish because it was just silly. The audience was walking out like it was a fire drill. Those that stayed were laughing at the silliness instead of cringing in fear. Could be the end to a promising career. To review, this is the director/writer who said 'I will never put a white man in any of my movies as a lead. Boring.' Boring and silly nicely sum up this effort.",2,0,0,4 June 2019
Knives Out," great movie well made
","Except for some unnecessary language, this was a masterpiece. Funny, thinker, well acted and well shot. We all enjoyed it.",8,1,4,3 December 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Top Marvel movie to date! SOOO GOOD!
","OK, as an old fan-boy who owns every superhero movie ever made and a stack of comics in my closet, I have always thought the first IRON MAN movie was sheer perfection. This THOR: RAGNAROK comes close to that -- it was so good from opening scene to closing credits that I was blown away. I saw this in IMAX-3D with a packed house of fellow fans on opening night and we were blown away. There was hooping and hollering and clapping. It was an experience that I will not soon forget. They finally figured out that fans don't want a serious, political superhero -- we want fun! WELL DONE, Marvel! I'll be buying the DVD for more deleted scenes and fun.",10,1,9,3 November 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," More cussing than a season of BAND OF BROTHERS. Disgusting
","This film wins for most over-rated movie of the year. In the first 5 minutes there were more cuss-words with emphasis on the most shocking ones, than in a season of the hardest war TV shows or movies. The writing was just bad -- moving from disjointed plot point to disjointed plot point like a drunk man lost in a maze. The acting was good in that the characters present themselves in one way and then all switch to the other by the end of the film. Sam is the shining star here as a mentally retarded cop who can't decide if he's a good guy or a bad guy -- totally unpredictable. While I did not enjoy the movie, I am on board with his award as best actor for this roll. Overall, definitely not the best movie of the year (did nobody see ZOOKEEPER'S WIFE)? I wouldn't recommend paying for a ticket for this one. Maybe a rental or just wait for it on TV with the 10000 cuss words deleted. Painful to watch",2,3,8,18 January 2018
Justice League," Great ride! Saw on opening night with a happy crowd
","This one delivers! We were afraid with rumors of re-shoots and a dark tone, plus they changed directors for the last act. The original cut was deemed 'unwatchable' so they went for re-shoots and added a bunch of comedy. Thank goodness because we couldn't have sat through another BVS! This one has laughs but moves right along with the plot. There is a lot from the comics in there. Overall, it was pretty awesome. I'll buy the DVD for the extras.",8,3,8,17 November 2017
Mamma Mia!," great music drug down by Meryl Streep 'acting'
","ABBA is the star of this show. The dancing and singing is fine. Meryl is a distraction with her 'half the country is too stupid to understand my art, entertained by MMA and football' baggage she brings with her. You go home singing MAMA MIA and smiling. That is the most any movie can hope to achieve.",5,0,0,12 August 2018
A Quiet Place," I don't like scary movies but this was a lot of fun!
",This one caught my interest because I like the star who wrote and directed and starred in it from his 13 HOURS work. I was not disappointed. The theater was mostly full on a Thursday night. We hooped and screamed and jumped. It was a silent movie with aliens and we loved it. No cussing. No nudity. Just some scares and a tear for the lost. RENT THIS,8,4,9,6 April 2018
Joker," Most painful 2 hours of 2019
",Depressing mess. I should have known when the art snobs gave it a standing ovation that it was going to be awful. Just sad and self-absorbed. Phoenix has always been a strange one with his 'rap career' and past performances. His last movie BEFORE THEY KNOW was just abysmal. This is that with a little more depression.,1,75,310,4 October 2019
Black Panther," Good movie, definitly not the best film of all time like the hype, but solid effort
","I saw it last night with a fellow comic book nerd in a theater with about 30 folks. Unfortunately, 20 of them were little kids who came on a church bus and talked loudly through the whole movie. The plot was solid and the action was great. The CGI was pretty bad in a few places, (a missing arm that you can kind of see). We liked the tech and there were a couple of laughs. The bad guy was believable with motivation that was on track. There was a romance that played well. Overall a great effort from Marvel. The politics kept us away and when I said it was 4/5 stars on FB it only took a few minutes before someone called me racist. Like Wonder Woman (which was also a 4/5 star film for me), they don't get the absurd statement. If you like a movie because it has a woman you are sexist just as if you dislike a movie because it has a woman. Same thing here with race. Race did not play into my enjoyment of the film. It was good. It wasn't in my top 5 superhero movies. Maybe my top 10. I'd recommend it. One of the best things about it is they kept it PG13, no cussing or nudity or over the top violence. I really liked that.",7,4,12,21 February 2018
Da 5 Bloods," Unwatchable Lee twist on reality
","Good music. Lots of propaganda from a little man who has no feel for history. Uneven plot. Friends from war justify theft. Watch THREE KINGS, does same thing much better without political BS.",1,5,15,14 June 2020
