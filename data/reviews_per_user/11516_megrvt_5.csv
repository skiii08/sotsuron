Mission: Impossible III," Good action, but typical M:I
","Don't get me wrong, I love the action sequences in this movie. It's not realistic, but let's face it, it's Mission: Impossible. The story is a little weak, but just enough is there to keep it flowing. The only thing I wasn't keen on was looking at Tom Cruise for that long, but only because the media is just so saturated with him right now. He doesn't do a bad job, but he doesn't stretch himself either. Regardless of that, he's got GREAT hair in this movie. Ving Rhames is some decent comic relief, but they could have easily kicked his role up a notch and kept it light and fun. For me, it was kind of predictable. They tried to throw in a twist, but if you know M:I, you'll see it coming about one third to half way through the film. Again, even the twist is typical. If you're looking for a good big screen distraction with high budget action sequences, it's worth the look. If you're looking for an intelligent, 'make you think' thriller/action...this might not be it for you.",6,0,1,9 May 2006
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Funny. And I don't do comedies
","It's not often I go to the theatre to see a comedy. I'm glad I did with this one. I didn't feel ripped off at all. It uses all the clichés you can think of for 40 year old virgins and plays them up. The main character is well done and as much as you laugh at him and with him, you have to respect him for being who he is. The buddies and co-workers are a hoot too. At first you can tell it's a game to them but they end up truly wanting to help and of course it just gets worse then. The part in the trailers you see with the waxing is better in full length. The little gags and subtle things are what make this comedy work. The script is funny too, but the whole package is what does it for me. The only downside was the ending. It gets a little hokey, but it's a comedy and they have to sum it up somehow. Overall, it's fun. Even 40 year old virgins will laugh.",8,1,4,3 September 2005
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," The older Harry gets, the darker life becomes
","Goblet of Fire is of course, well done and beautifully shot. Not having read any of the Potter series, I wasn't disappointed in the movie at all. From what I have heard, many underlying plots and characters may have been skipped to streamline the movie and keep its focus, so the readers might be disappointed, I don't know. 'Fire' is darker than the rest of the movies. Seemed to lack some of the humor that gave the previous films some levity. Great storyline, fabulous effects. LONG though. It's about 2.5 hours long, so make time for it. It's worth it to watch and goes quickly. Throughly enjoyed it, but not my favorite of the bunch so far.",7,2,3,6 December 2005
The Happening," What happened?.....Nothing
","That's the whole problem. The opening scenes pull you in from the start. However, there isn't much to back that up. It just keeps on the same vein through the rest of the movie: 'The wind is coming. It's the plants. Run away!!!!' I don't usually put spoilers in my comments, but I'm not worried about it on this one, because I'm not recommending you spend the money to see it. We sat in the centre of our row in the theatre. The entire row to our left walked out and they weren't all together. I haven't witnessed that before in a movie. It was strange.The Happening reminded me of The Birds. Nature is attacking man and we don't know why. Instead of crows, it's maples and grass. The cast is okay, really the only one you'll recognize is Wahlberg and that girl that you just know you've seen her somewhere. I've seen him do better in other movies. I read another user comment that compared it to the Twilight Zone. If you're a fan of that, you might like this. He's made the characters realistic, because really, if there was a terrible natural disaster, one mane doesn't stand up and say, 'Let's kick butt' and every one just blindly follow. Wahlberg is reluctant, but real, if not a very deep character.It looked good, it started good, it just never really got off the ground. Shyamalan said to go looking for a fun B-movie. Talk about a bait-and-switch. When I'm paying over $10 per person to see it, plus expensive snacks and drinks, I don't want to see a B-movie. Especially when it's dressed up as an 'A' title. Get with it, Night. I even liked Lady in the Water and The Village. I probably would have been just as disappointed if I'd spent $5 to rent it.",4,3,7,6 July 2008
WALL·E," Adorable - good enough that you don't realize no one is talking at first.
","Like you didn't know WALL-E was going to be adorable. Pixar has taken a simple idea and built on it. As one crew member put it, 'what would happen if everyone left Earth and forgot to turn off the last robot?' It's cute, it's fun. It also has some messages to it that you start to realize as it goes on. Consumption, lack of interaction, the importance of social bonding and interaction, environmental issues, etc. If you want to, you can read so much more into this movie. If you don't want to, you can sit back and enjoy a nice little family film. The animation is great. The team at Pixar has done a great job with the nuances of Wall-E's character. For those of you that know your personality quizzes, he's probably a Beaver. Hard-working, curious, organized, cautious. I was torn between a 7 and an 8 on this one. Why would I bust it down to a 7? Because it works off the same old story of lonely guy meeting hot chick and trying to win her love. Combine that with a rehash of love-the-robot Short Circuit-style and it could have been a mediocre to really bad movie. But Wall-E sells it. He raises the bar to an 8. You root for him. They've made him very likable and I'm gullible, so it works on me. The simple comic relief inside this cautionary tale keeps you chuckling at the very least. In fact, he's the only likable character in the movie. The reason I can't give it higher than an 8 is that they seem to have sunk all their energy into creating Wall-E. They didn't do anything to further develop supporting characters. There are other robots and people, but they don't cut it. If a robot can have depth, Wall-E has it. The rest are just cardboard cutouts.",8,1,4,5 July 2008
