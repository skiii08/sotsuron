50 First Dates," Great film.
","I dragged my mum 2c this film & it was great.We laughed alot, even parts that may not have been intentionally funny.But we also got into the story-line and felt for the characters. Adam sandler was very good in the film much better than some other films his been in(like going over board),Drew Barrymore was excellent SPOILER It was as if she truley did have an impared part of her brain that made it unable for her to process STM into LTM.As you could almost see the pain in her face realising that she lives the same day ...everyday and doesnt realise over a year has passed.Great go see it",9,0,0,26 April 2004
A Walk to Remember," Excellent, didnt expect it to be so good!
","From the opening scene until the final ending you are glued to your seat and are woundering how it is going to end.  Ok, so there are a few bits that you think to yourself 'been there-seen that', but the way the film comes together will leave you fully entertained. Trust me watch it!",10,0,0,8 July 2003
