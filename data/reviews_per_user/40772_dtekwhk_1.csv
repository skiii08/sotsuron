United 93," Unbiased, Extraordinary, Remarkable
","This movie is amazing in its construction. The people get on the plane. The air traffic controllers receive a suspicious transmission. Two planes hit the Twin Towers, and one hits the pentagon. Frantically, these people attempt to track thousands of flights and figure out which ones are hijacked. Then on United 93 the terrorists take control of the plane. During the final 15 minutes or so, the crew and passengers attempt to take back control of the plane. They take down the terrorist with the bomb, then the one guarding the cockpit. They bash open the door. The plane is flying low. The terrorist flying the plane looks scared and frightened. One of the passengers trys to wrestle the controls out of his hands. The camera work is frantic, the sound the music and the imagery all builds. There is one final shot, out the cockpit window that shows the ground fast approaching. Everything stops and the screen cuts to black. This is when I started to cry, because no matter how the movie portrays this event, the event was real. It happened. And no matter how sad and powerful this movie is, the real event was ten times more horrific. This movie gives nothing but facts, nothing but what happened. No motives, no bias, no Hollywood. I was so glad I saw this movie, and if your mind hasn't been polluted by politics and conspiracy you will find this movie to be one of the saddest, and ultimately, one of the most uplifting movies ever made. It is uplifting because of what I took from the film, not what the film gave to me.",10,0,1,16 September 2006
