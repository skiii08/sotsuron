Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Cute
",Borat is a funny film no denying that. The plot the camera-work and of course the character make some of the funniest one liners one has heard in a movie in a long time however the film offers very few new things that you haven't seen before. The plot itself and everything has been done gazillion times before and we see very few new things - the character does not go beyond his tiny little world of kakhastan and never shocks me once due to the fact that he does everything we expect him to do but nothing beyond that. Overall a funny film but no masterpieceMy grade 7/10Gee EdwardsIceland,7,1,6,22 November 2006
Home Alone," Highly enjoyable Christmas classic
","Scream your lungs out, eat Maccoronies and cheese on Christmas ever Watch R-rated movies while eating rubbish when you're parents are not home and show them who is the boss of the house. Perhaps one of the most enjoyable and memorable Christmas movie in history with great performances, memorable scenes and screams plus plenty of good Christmas music and nice scene of actual people eating pizza and drinking milk with it. In the Christmas spirit I give Home Alone a nine and hope everyone will watch this one over the holidays. Hey I have reserved the day before Christmas eve. Merry Christmas Everyone and a happy new year",9,0,1,22 November 2006
A Nightmare on Elm Street," It is only a dream or is it
","Nightmare On Elm Street is a classic horror film in every sense of the word. It includes bad acting, weird music, cool killer, lots of blood, bright cute leading lady and action from beginning to an end. Wes Craven's script is despite somewhat over the top storyline is incredible and the film manages to keep you excited for the 90 minutes running time. Sure some people might complain about few things - some of the special effects are yes downright awful even for 1984 standards and the goofs cannot be overlooked yet for some people it makes the film even more hip and cooler. I also liked the character of Freddie in this feature where he has less than 10 minute screen time and is surely creepy and believable as an ex murderer and child molester.",10,0,0,22 November 2006
