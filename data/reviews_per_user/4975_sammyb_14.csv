Moneyball," I was bored
","This movie was seriously over-rated. Oscar nominations? Nothing about this film is worthy of that honour. Brad Pitt cannot act, is not likable or engaging.I don't think I've ever been impressed with him in anything.Jonah Hill is Jonah Hill.Again. That's getting old.There is a lot of talking- which is a nice change from the constant cgi in most big budget films- but its all passionless.I don't think that anyone involved in the movie cared about what they were doing or saying. If they can't be bothered why should the audience care?The movie was pure pablum.",Null,2,4,28 January 2012
Mission: Impossible III," out bonds Bond
","this is an excellent adventure movie with some spectacular stunts and pyrotechnics.Cruise acquits himself better than expected and Hoffman is on top form as the villain.However there are no weak links in the cast.In amidst the pyrotechnics there is a convoluted spy plot with a very dark edge...certainly the squeaky clean IMF organisation of the TV series is long gone.The locations are excellent and unusual, photographed with confidence and aplomb.Simon Pegg provides some welcome humour as a technician.This film makes the forthcoming Casino Royale seem irrelevant.Mission Unmissable",Null,3,6,5 May 2006
The Expendables 2," wait for it on TV
","This movie is a complete waste of time and money. The script is non existent and the action scenes are idiotically simplistic. It was filmed as a PG 13 and had crappy CGI blood added in post production to make it seem hardcore.The acting is , as you would expect, lousy. None of these people were really ever actors. Even if they were they wouldn't be able to do anything with this awful script. Charisma Carpenter appears so briefly that she is unmemorable..a pity since she is the only member of the cast with any talent. Talented fighters like Jet Li and Scott Adkins are underused and get no chance to show off their skills.The final fight between Stallone and van Damme is a joke.How stupid is this movie? the villain is played by Jean Claud Van Damme. The character's name is Jean Villain.The appearances by Arnie and Willis are just cameos and consist of them reliving crappy past catchphrases over and over again. When Stallone appeared with the other two my thoughts were 1) all these guys are bald but only Willis admits it 2) how many phone books is Stallone stood on to be the same height as Willis?Wait for it on TV is my advice..and pray they don't make a third.",Null,2,4,17 September 2012
World War Z," resident evil lite
","Allegedly based on Max Brooks' innovative book this film throws all intelligent thought in the bin during its failed pursuit of thrills.Even if one is prepared to ignore the fact that they've turned one of the most intelligent books of recent years into one of the most idiotic films, the entire movie is an abject failure on almost every level. The sense of global devastation was realised much more effectively ( and much more cheaply) in the Resident Evil films. Resident Evil also worked far better as action movies with a zombie theme.The script is full of gaping examples of stupidity that make it impossible to identify with the characters, especially Pitt's who is supposed to be a well educated experienced UN investigator. He makes absolutely moronic decisions time and time again.The acting is generally substandard, the direction woeful ( its almost impossible to see what is happening in the action sequences)and the audience I saw it with laughed several times at things weren't meant to be funny.Also, for the most expensive zombie movie ever, its hard to see where the money was spent. Many scenes supposedly set in the USA were obviously shot in Glasgow and look nothing like Philadelphia.Watch Resident Evil or 28 days later on DVD instead.",Null,0,1,4 July 2013
The Adventures of Tintin," not impressed
","I am unfamiliar with Tintin ( or more accurately have never had any interest in him) but I was dragged to this to accompany a child.What a long movie it seemed to be. The animation is good- in parts very good- but the script is a mess. There's just running around and utterly stupid set pieces. The humour is just poorly done slapstick. I won't go into the plot further as I don't want to give spoilers but its predictable and lightweight.None of the characters are memorable, Tintin is a bore. To be honest the dog is the only likable one in it.The kid I was with thought it was okay but that's all. His parents and I hated it.",Null,1,5,17 November 2011
Pacific Rim," too stupid to watch
","This is a very stupid movie. Its based on a stupid idea that a stupid director stole and tried to sell to a stupid audience. Thankfully, the majority of the audience is not stupid enough to pay to watch it, so there won't be a sequel.This is one of those movies where actors spout garbage while standing in front of green screens. There is no character, no plot, no suspense and no humour.Of the element that was supposed to sell the movie- the fight scenes- they seem to take place in bad visibility, suggesting that the special effects weren't up to snuff.this is a movie for people who thought that the Green Lantern didn't have enough cgi and that the Seth Rogen version of the Green Hornet was too intellectual. Steer well clear.",Null,2,5,25 September 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," wait for it on TV
","There is nothing about this that needs to be seen on the big screen. I was unaware of the content, knowing only that it was based on a best seller.The movie is incredibly long and slow paced. The lead female is unattractive and unlikable. At times the movie really dragged, then something unpleasant would happen. It seems that some people think that being cynical, controversial and bitter equals some higher artistry. Not in my opinion. Its not exactly a thriller..in fact its painfully slow. The final twenty minutes are very tough going.There is apparently some debate as to whether the following films in the franchise will be made as the movie didn't make much money. I personally don't care if they are made or not but I hope the makers realise that some who saw this will flatly refuse to watch a sequel.",Null,7,14,8 January 2012
Quantum of Solace," the mindless action is not enough
","I was not fond of either TWINE, DAD or Casino Royale so I went to see QOS with some trepidation.I had some slight hope that we might get something with a Fleming feel as Craig apparently ' became' Bond at the end of CR. No such luck, QOS is a generic action movie with nothing memorable about it.There is a great deal of action but its all somewhat derivative of Bourne.I didn't feel there was any originality in the action or the script.There is surprising little romance either, although for those females that find Craig deeply unattractive ( like me) that is perhaps not so surprising.Olga Kurenyo is competent but not very distinctive and Gemma Arterton steals the movie..unfortunately she isn't around for long.Dame Judi Dench is very good. Title song is excruciating and the score is mixed..at times good at others too high tech and tinny.Villain is pretty weak and scarcely a formidable enough opponent for 007.not impressed",Null,66,111,30 October 2008
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," perfect popcorn film
","I'm writing this review because I'm tired of seeing self-styled 'reviewers' who clearly haven't been paying attention ask questions that were clearly explained in the film itself. MI4 is a beautifully made action adventure thriller that ramps up the tension and showcases some stunning action sequences. All of the performances are fine, there is not one weak member of the cast. The humour is enjoyable and evolves naturally from the character dynamics within the team.To set the record straight (spoilers beyond this point ) the opponent in the climax of the film is a formidable fighter because he's a Swedish former special forces commando. Not Russian. Swedish.Watch the movie if you're trying to pretend your reviews are worth a damn.",Null,1,3,11 January 2012
The Bourne Legacy," better than i thought it would be
","I wasn't sure about this film when I saw the trailer. I'd only see Renner in MI4 so I didn't know what to expect. I hadn't been a huge Bourne fan but I'd caught them all on DVD. This was the first film in the series I'd seen on the big screen.Its not perfect, but then neither were the Matt Damon ones. It was pretty good though. Things really improved with Rachel's involvement. The scene where Renner and Rachel meet, after Renner kills 4 or 5 assassins in a stunning sequence)is fantastic and its high octane all the way after that. There are some reflective moments which give the talented leads a chance to shine and the two have fantastic screen chemistry together- ironically better presence than Weisz has with her real life husband in the disappointing Dream House. The big action scene in Manila is jaw dropping. The tag scene sets things up for another film that I really want to happen. So what's not perfect?The problem is that all the flashbacks to Ultimatum are not needed and slow down the opening of the film. Bourne is gone and the film should concentrate 100% on the new characters. STILL WANT THAT SEQUEL THOUGH",Null,22,28,13 September 2012
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," This is the Star Wars movie that should have flopped
","I literally struggle to believe that this movie is so utterly terrible.
 Rian Johnson clearly has no idea of how a trilogy works. The second movie in the trilogy needs to build upon what has gone before, or it renders both pointless. It is easy to subvert expectations but not so easy to subvert them in a satisfying manner.
 The cast do their best with what they have but the script is terrible, badly paced and has plot holes that you can fly a star destroyer through. The decades of Star Wars history are ignored in favour of lame jokes and muddled mysticism.
 It appears the Rian Johnson Effect has done for Solo but this is the movie to blame",Null,16,22,6 June 2018
Casino Royale," don't believe the hype..its far too long
","after all the controversy surrounding the reboot and the casting of Daniel Craig it comes as a surprise that Casino Royale is such an unmemorable movie.It begins well with a very nice black and white and( after a woeful title song)has a spirited free running chase.Unfortunately after this it all goes wrong. The pacing is slow, the action non-existent and Mads Mikkelson is the blandest Bond villain ever..in fact a couple of times I couldn't understand what he was saying.Eva Green should have been a good Bond girl but is merely a repetitive damsel in distress,the photography is mediocre and it all looks like a Sony commercial.To those like myself who don't play poker the poker scenes are slow torture and the torture scene is unintentionally hilarious.David Arnold's score is his best yet but that is enough to save this bomb.",Null,25,47,27 November 2006
Looper," A mess
","well this stinker certainly didn't live up to the hype. I was expecting a smart science fiction story with a clever twist. What I got was a badly paced action movie with plot holes that you could drive through. Resident Evil: Retribution was smarter than this.Gordon-Levitt looked bizarre in his make up and it seems that Willis will do anything as long as its paid. Quality control is not an issue for him any more.The pacing is very weak and several sections drag on forever. The actual idea of Loopers is one of those things that a film student says, will be clever but it doesn't stand up to scrutiny. How does the premise work? how does the career of a looper work? who would be a looper in the first place? PASS",Null,20,46,2 October 2012
Kingsman: The Secret Service," very enjoyable
","I was genuinely surprised by how entertaining this movie was. I don't share most people's apparent surprise by how effective Colin Firth was in the role of Harry Hart, a well spoken , immaculately dressed but utterly committed secret operative of The Kingsman. Harry has a conscience and a mistake made several years ago prompts the selection of a seemingly unlikely wannabe recruit to the Kingsman's ranks.The cast are all excellent, with young Taron Egerton seeming to be a star in the making. Only Mark Hamill is weak in his cameo.Production quality is excellent, the script is funny and there are some fantastic set pieces, with good pacing and a genuine sense of danger at the end.Films like Kingsman , The Man From UNCLE and Mission Impossible Rogue Nation merely serve to illustrate what a lazy uninspired cash grab Spectre was.",Null,2,6,15 April 2016
