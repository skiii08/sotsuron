The Ring," Nothing comparing to the original 'Ringu'
","'The Ring' is a re-make of a popular Japanese horror movie, 'Ringu.'  I watched 'Ringu' first, and I still find it scary after watching it more than ten times.  So I went to watch the American version with high hope, and unfortunately, though predictably, it turned out to be a complete let down. The atmosphere of the original version, which was what made the movie oh-so scary, was almost completely wiped out in the American version by all the visual and sound effects.  In fact, the quietness in the Japanese version creates the atmosphere and gives you an extra level of horror because you just don't know what to expect next.  (SPOILER) I just can't stand the fact that in 'The Ring', the TV chases Naomi Watts and pushes her into the well.(END SPOILER)I'll recommend 'The Ring' to those of you who haven't watched either version.  If you've watched 'The Ring', I strongly recommend you to watch 'Ringu' as well.  If you've watched 'Ringu' but not 'The Ring,' don't bother.  It's nothing comparing to the original one.",6,0,1,15 July 2003
