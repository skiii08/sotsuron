Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Critics Walked into another theatre
","All I can figure is: the critics must've all got mixed up and walked into a screening of Howard the Duck.  This was a great movie!  Well thought out, good character development, and, of course, great special effects.The only problem I had with it was this:  The first three movies followed a plot along two or more separate storylines which all came together in the end.  This one, however, follows more of a connect-the-dots, linear storyline which slows the story just a little.  In the end, though, a great movie!  Definitely worth the wait.",9,0,0,27 May 1999
