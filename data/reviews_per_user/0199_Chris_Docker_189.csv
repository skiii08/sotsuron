"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Enjoyable silliness
","Occasionally when editors send reviewers a list of new and upcoming films, a kind a war-weariness can set in: even more so when one's gut feeling suggests an obvious divide between worthwhile cinema and the barrage of rather missable comedy. Even more so when a film in question has not risked journalistic censure by having an advance press screening. I am not one of the many people who thrilled excitedly to Simon Pegg's efforts in Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz. And I was even less impressed the last time he joined forces with David Schwimmer in Big Nothing. So it was with a feeling almost of self-sacrifice that I volunteered to sit through Run, Fat Boy, Run. Which doesn't even have car chases or zombies to recommend it.The surprise was that it is actually quite good.Simon Pegg studied drama at university but earned his spurs in working life as a stand-up comedian. Which perhaps explains why his timing is so split-second perfect. The gags in Run, Fat Boy, Run are not that remarkable. At times you can even see them coming. But the performance and skillful delivery is so polished that they are entertaining anyway.Run, Fat Boy, Run uses a formula that has served Pegg and his growing fan base well: he is the nerd who eventually turns hero. We feel sorry for him, irritated by him, repelled by him. He's the well-meaning hopeless case we just want to 'fix'. So the audience is relieved and rooting for him by the time he makes good. We are fully behind him by the time he makes his resolve that he is 'sick of being a 'nearly-man'.' In this present incarnation, Pegg (Dennis) has an attack of nerves just before getting married. He runs out on his gorgeous wife-to-be Libby (played by Thandie Newton) - literally - running off as she stands in the road in full bridal dress. And pregnant.Five years later, Dennis is working as a security guard at a women's clothing store. The predictable jokes are spoon-fed us faultlessly. Pegg rescues any situation that threatens to become too silly by a look of open sincerity (rather like Ricky Gervais does with political humour). But Pegg seems to have an instinctual grasp of cinema that enables him to extract the best results from his material. On a hot Saturday afternoon, and with strong competition from much publicised movies, the auditorium was fairly packed.The second theme from the film's title comes from Dennis' decision to run the London marathon. This is mostly to 'prove' something to Libby (for whom he has now discovered undying love) but also to win a bet for his mates and to prove himself equal to Libby's super-fit, super-rich, super-handsome suitor, Whit. His five-year old son provides the magic glue to pull all the elements of the story together.In a wise choice, the filmmakers avoid anything that might belittle the Marathon (given that many UK viewers may have a deep respect for the institution). But they also bring in much underused and very photogenic shots of London en-route - particularly the Docklands area.With such a vanilla story line, Run, Fat Boy, Run is relying on Pegg's reputation to pull in audiences. I suspect that many of his fans may be occasional movie-goers who simply demand something light and untaxing. He has the ability to make a futile chase after stolen women's underwear amusing. When he seems to be rubbing himself off against a shop mannequin it could be a pathetic or tacky sketch in any other hands, but his wide-eyed expression and fast pacing move us from one joke to the next before we have time to analyse.I wasn't bored. And I had expected to be. In fact I was laughing loudly. It reminded me of when JM Barrie had planted children in the audience of his first performance of Peter Pan. It helps to be in the company of people who see the joke. Run, Fat Boy, Run has not made me a convert to Pegg's brand of humour even if I enjoyed the film, but I have to admit that he is good at his job. Sometimes it is the difference between a sterile press screening and an audience of fans. On this occasion, marketing gets the benefit of the doubt.",7,111,145,8 September 2007
The Blair Witch Project," Scary little low budget movie, exceptionally well-made
","Scary little low budget film, very well made, about a group of people who go out into the woods and get lost and very scared. Documentary style and brilliant acting carry it through as the various 'happenings' take them on the ever-descending spiral towards the sophisticatedly mind-crunching ending. Curiously, those who like mainstream horror should maybe forget it. The spin offs are becoming apocryphal. There is already a big-budget American comedy take-off ready for release.Scariest bit for me was the fact that by the time I found the cinema (whilst abroad in the USA) I was totally lost. Somewhere in the outback where I paid two dollars for a seat and the usher adjusted the curtains at the side of the screen by hand. When I came out (around midnight, with a full moon shining between the trees) I realised that the difference between being lost and lost-and-scared is refusing to give in to sheer panic (ho, ho, thought he, as he drove through a red light) . . .",Null,0,1,28 October 1999
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Classic Tarantino
","Tarantino movies are almost a genre in themselves. Stylised violence, trendy sequences, all delivered with great panache and storylines that are original enough to be noticed. Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction set a high standard to follow, even though they were acclaimed by audiences more than serious critics. Dusk till Dawn was something of a flop as vampire and gangster stories failed to gel, whilst the understated Jackie Brown seemed little more than an aberration from established Tarantino style. With Kill Bill and Kill Bill II, Tarantino is back on form with a vengeance. Part One demonstrated extreme and polished action scenes into which much thought had gone - for instance a martial arts stand off that contrasts genre wirework fighting some of the most realistic fighting on film since Bruce Lee; the overall effect was a surfeit of stunning action where viewers would probably have been content with the simplest of explanatory codas to justify the visual experience. Kill Bill II, on the other hand, rather than just filling in these holes, presents us with some fantastic characterisation and an underlying plot for Parts I and II that is as gut wrenching as it is believable. As we follow elite killer Uma Thurman in her quest to hunt down and kill Bill we are given insight into her physical prowess (learnt at the hand of a legendary and unique teacher), and dragged through the emotional turmoil that has sparked off the whole raison d'etre. Complex relationships between the members of the elite group of killers spiral into an insoluble dilemma for the two main players: one that can only be resolved by taking a heartbreaking decision. Kill Bill is a major triumph for director Quinten Tarantino and worth every minute.",9,0,1,5 May 2004
Frost_Nixon," Watch out for the Nixon in all of us - and pray your lucky stars there's a Frost
","I'm old enough vaguely to remember the televised Frost/Nixon interviews. Even the presidency. And the U.S./Vietnam war. I shared the popular sense of moral outrage. But I'm not an American citizen, and I couldn't get worked up about, 'giving Nixon the trial he never had.' What difference did that make to me?Something halfway through this movie changed my mind. Mid-interview, attempting to get a reaction from Nixon, Frost's team run footage of carnage in Cambodia caused by American carpet-bombing. I guess perhaps because I was in Cambodia only a few months ago. It made more of an impact. For all my intellectual appreciation of events, I hadn't been prepared for such devastation of a nation's psyche. An NGO worker looked into my eyes one day at a truck stop. She said, 'And when I got here, I just cried every day for weeks.' I think she knew, as our eyes met, that I, a grown man, had been crying in helplessness towards these people trying to hide my tears for days. Visiting the ancient temples and aid workers, but meeting villagers too, it was hard not to cry. I have never seen a people so psychologically annihilated. The first thing that had struck me was, here is a nation for whom the very idea of hope has been long ago discarded. I wanted Nixon to pay.The horrific footage doesn't move Mr President, the way it moves me. I want him to have that trial. But Nixon is a heavyweight in every way, just as the actor portraying him. Frost, on the other hand, is almost a bit of a joke. Hardly a man to bet on. Yet from that moment I was rooting for him. The only person with a chance of bringing light into Nixon's disingenuous stonewalling. From that moment, I was emotionally hooked. I would happily overlook all but the most egregious of flaws.Fortunately, like the real interview series, the film only gets better. As if it has been playing with us for an eternity before packing its punches.I've never been much taken with Martin Sheen (Frost). I kept thinking of his performance as Tony Blair in The Queen and how, here as in The Queen, it seems too much like an impersonation. Rory Bremner on a good day. But it is almost Sheen's fallibility that allows the rest of the film to shine. Taking us off guard, just as Nixon was taken off guard. A cheap punk on the street who you walk past disparagingly, only to realise he's the mafia boss and you're surrounded. Then there's Kevin Bacon. Haven't I seen that suit in one too many movies? So when he hits me with real emotion towards the end (he's a very good actor) it has a profound shock. Both these men know how to play supporting actor in the true sense, supporting the lead role and the whole production Â– rather than constantly making us notice their own lapels. But it's Frank Langella's towering interpretation of Nixon that eventually makes every other character real. Low-angle camera shots emphasise his power and he looms over us. The most powerful man in the world. And once we buy into that, everything we see in his 'world,' by definition, has to be 'real.'Frost/Nixon is about as watertight as you get. Adapted by the man who wrote the play (and also wrote The Queen and Last King of Scotland); then an Oscar-winning director who only agrees to do it if he can have the two lead actors from his polished stage version. Remember how Ron Howard pulled it out of the bag with the equally dry-seeming, A Beautiful Mind? Well, he's done it again.But for all the triumphant battle cries as Frost walks him into a trap, in the end it is Nixon that gets my sympathies. Even more than Frost gets my admiration. As I watch Nixon face his inner hell, I recall every speck of darkness in my own soul. How I never managed to make my father proud before he died. How I risked my career once when I stole a long international phone call in the office. How I cheated on the one woman I loved more than any woman in my whole life. Some sins just don't go away. Nixon becomes the Nemesis within Everyman.Nixon, like a Judas Iscariot or Lady Macbeth, has no way of ever coming completely clean. But, through the ironic good fortune of an interviewer who outwits him, Nixon receives the gift of being able to say sorry. Sorry to the Americans he betrayed. His legacy, the symbol of ultimate duplicity Â– the '-gate' tagged on to any word so to indicate scandal. See him fall Â– is it then possible (for some perhaps) to open hearts and forgive?The second biggest thing that is striking about Cambodians is their lack of ill-will. To the one who destroyed their country. Having never hated, they have no thing to forgive. A senior monk instructed me, while I was there, on a Buddhist method of mindfulness. One of the results of this mediation is that one focuses everything back on one's own action, and hence one's own moment-to-moment responsibility. It strikes me that for Nixon, Frost was like the senior monk. The guy who showed him how to face who and what he was. His catharsis. Not that anyone will ever say thank you (to Nixon, that is.)And coming full circle, that's what cinema can do. It can take something that is intellectually discernible and make it real Â– through an emotional investment. And it does it by means of fiction.",10,6,10,5 January 2009
Walk the Line," An achievement on and off the screen
","I guess I'd never listened to more than a couple of Johnny Cash songs before seeing this movie - and even then only with half an ear. A lovingly-crafted film, Walk the Line not only got me listening to his music and seeing qualities in it not at first obvious, but impressed me with the way it carries off a difficult undertaking and delivers remarkable performances (especially that of Reese Witherspoon).The image of Johnny Cash seen in the first two thirds of Walk the Line is that of an unredeemed and not awfully likable man, ignoring his wife and child, recording songs with questionable lyrics, and getting involved in drink and drugs with all the attendant ills. He meets fellow singer June Carter (who is also married) and is instantly attracted. Cash's behaviour continues to worsen and he narrowly avoids jail or worse.Many of Cash's songs are written from the depths of despair, by a man with no self-esteem. He dresses in black and seems to succeed against all best advice. Sometimes he is too drunk or drugged to perform. But at one point he recovers enough to read fan mail - much of it from prison inmates. His songs, it seems, have given them hope, a sense that someone understands them. For Cash, there are people who appreciate and love him when it seems no-one else does. He dedicates his efforts.Walk the Line is a film of bad examples and prejudice, but also the possibility that there is a light at the end of the darkest tunnel. Cash's strict father blames him for the death of the other sibling and nothing Cash does can win a single word of praise from his father. Society condemns June Carter for being a divorcÃ©e. The whole film is redolent of the evils of straight-laced righteousness and arrogance (ironically, the Christianity that has spawned such attitudes is later embraced). But each individual has their own path to find. Cash's descent into hell was (without his intention) his means of reaching out to others. The legacy is one of which the music scene is appropriately proud.All the songs in the movie are sung live, which might not suit die-hard fans (Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant and convincing though - I had to compare his renderings with the originals afterwards to see the leap in voice quality). But the real discovery is Reese Witherspoon (June Carter) who has found the most charismatic role of her career. When she enters, the screen lights up, and the expressiveness of her face, her perfect characterisation, and the sheer devotion and joy that she brings to the role kept me glued to the end.",8,2,4,14 February 2006
Requiem for a Dream," Innovative techniques but lacking in more basic movie construction essentials
","This offering about the downward spiral of a couple of drug addicts has the critics effusing wildly, but that's basically because it uses innovative film techniques to tell what would otherwise be a boring and depressing tale. Unfortunately, unless the techniques alone ring your bell, it's still a sad, boring and depressing tale of two drug addicts because the director relies on fast editing and other similar gizmos to make you 'feel' what the druggies are going through. This is all very well and good one day, when he's learnt the basics of movie making and can perhaps add such ingredients with subtlety and restraint, we'll have a good film. What we have just now is a repertoire of gimmicks mainly for those interested in the craft, although many will rave about it's strong 'anti-drug message.'",Null,3,6,22 January 2001
The Longest Yard," Is there really any mileage in American football movies for non-US audiences?
","With an all star cast including Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Burt Reynolds and ex-convict Edward Bunker, this re-make of legendary Robert Aldrich's film about a football match by convicts, The Longest Yard would seem a sure-fire winner. For fans of American Football who can never get enough, it probably is, but how well does it translate to audiences unfamiliar with the sport? Non-Americans barely understand or recognise the game, so for them there needs to be something else with which to engage (unless we were given a proper briefing, which we're not). American Football bears little relation to Soccer, the mainstream game of the rest of the world. In Britain, we are beset with the unfortunate association of hooliganism with British football, we might be forgiven for looking across the Atlantic to America, where sports heroes are often role models (not just in the U.S., but in Latin America as well).Our hero, Adam Sandler, has been dropped from the professional game for fixing a result. He goes out and crashes his girlfriend's car spectacularly (while drunk) and lands up in prison. After various rounds of blackmail and counter-blackmail, he is persuaded to lead the prison football team against the prison guards team. The film straddles sports and comedy uneasily.When someone makes a movie about our favourite hobby, we tend to find jokes much funnier simply because we allow ourselves to be carried away on a sympathetic wave of feelgood enjoyment. For others, the jokes need to stand up on their own merit. Adam Sandler and Chris Rock, both brilliant comedians in their own right, are out of their familiar territory with this movie. Many opportunities for belly laughs are missed by inept timing and lack of pacing. The cross-dresser cheerleaders should have been riotous, but they are badly introduced and then overplayed. A constant stream of jokes about MacDonalds and Coca-Cola become monotonous to all but the thickest-skinned, beer-bellied macho men. There are the occasional lame attempts to portray Sandler as a sex-icon, whether as the prey of the prison chief's wife or rolling around (in slow-motion) in the mud. Is he really that gorgeous? For more serious movie goers, this film may simply represent a grandstanding of all the bad things America has to offer the world Â– sadistic, overcrowded prisons, steroid-chomping would-be athletes, and prison guards who are effectively the worst type of role model. The sad thing is that the real situation is probably much worse. The Longest Yard accepts all this with utter bravado Â– perhaps just how George W Bush would like to see prisons run.The U.S. has overtaken Russia as the world's most aggressive jailer. When local jails are included in the American tally, the U.S. locks up nearly 700 people per 100,000, compared with 102 for Canada, 132 for England and Wales, 85 for France and a paltry 48 in Japan. Roughly 2m Americans are currently behind bars, with some 4.5m on parole or on probation. At least 3m Americans are ex-convicts who have served their sentences and are no longer under the control of the justice system, and one estimate says that some 13m Americans Â— 7% of the adult population Â— have been found guilty of a serious crime. Roughly one in five black men has been incarcerated at some point in his life; one in three has been convicted of a felony.If this wasn't bad enough, there is a small hitch with America's policy of imprisoning more people than any other country on the planet: most have to be released at some point, even if mass incarceration makes a very temporary reduction in crime levels. America's homicide rate is still five to seven times higher than most industrialised countries. The 'correctional facilities' singularly fail to correct: three in four prisoners will be convicted of another crime within three yearsÂ—and three out of five will be back in prison. This keenness to lock people up is matched by a complete lack of interest in them when they get out. Britain seems to follow the U.S. lead: 'Prison works', declared Michael Howard, addressing his first party conference as home secretary. Really? Ten years later, the prison population increased by 60% to but overall levels of serious crime recorded by the police doubled.There is no incentive for prisons, whether privately or state run, to invest in reform. Their benefits need to be linked to re-offending rates Â– exactly the opposite to the current situation (where jobs are ensured by high offending). In America, the political agenda is even stronger. The guards unions make large donations to political parties, and their salaries and benefits have been suitably looked after in return. Offenders, on the other hand, are usually barred from voting and from many jobs, something which is generally seen as helping Republican votes. In Virginia and Kentucky, one in six black men cannot vote.Edward Bunker (who played himself in Reservoir Dogs and died some time before the release of Longest Yard) made a movie called Animal Factory that was a tough and convincing look at prison life. The Longest Yard is not tough, convincing, or even that funny except for die-hard American Football fans. Adam Sandler is known to be a big Yankees fan Â– one wonders if there isn't a modicum of fantasy-fulfilment in this Big-Mac, Quarter-Pounder-With-Cheese no-brainer of a movie.",4,1,2,6 September 2005
Catch Me If You Can," Polished, highly entertaining - and cleverer than it seems
","Which of us hasn't dreamed of succeeding in lots of fabulously high-profile careers? Doctor? Lawyer? Airline Pilot? For the past generation, the role model of escapist high achievement was given full power in the shape of James Bond, an ordinary looking upper class Englishman that achieved the impossible through fantastic gadgets and penetrating responses to life-threatening situations. But in the present day, the believability of a Bond-like secret agent is wearing thin. Similarly, the vicarious glamour of Hollywood stars is no longer a panacea to the wish-fulfilment dreams of working class drudgery. Enter stage left, appealing to everyone's slightly less than moral urges, Mr Frank Abagnale Jnr. And just to reinforce how it was possible to fake being a pilot, doctor and public prosecutor, we are reliably informed that it is all based on a true story.(Minor plot spoilers): A sudden victim of a broken home, the adolescent Frank Abagnale Jnr (Leonardo DiCaprio) hightails to New York, blagging a pilot's uniform to get a bit of respect, and brilliantly forging increasingly large cheques. He also fools the airlines. Tiring of parading and cocking his pilot hat to the infuriated airlines, he poses as a doctor, learning the lingo from the TV show Dr Kildare, before moving on to become an assistant public prosecutor. To evade escape, he recruits a bevy of eye-candy Â‘airline stewardesses', and leaves the country under the noses of dozens of FBI agents. Capture and prison sentences follow, but he gets off lightly and becomes a respected, megabucks-earning hero at the same time.Leonardo DiCaprio has tackled this real-life spoof with a professionalism that helps to make the film one that will possibly spawn look-alikes. His attention to detail included face to face research with the real life Abagnale and, even if the part does not demand the range of acting talent that instantly cries `Oscar', the skill with which he has executed his role marks him out as a very polished actor. Likewise Christopher Walken (as Abagnale Snr) turns in a first class performance and brings a range of emotion to his part (the beleaguered father) that is rare in Walken characters. Tom Hanks' performance, as the befuddled FBI agent trying to chase low-life Abagnale Jnr (who is patently of much higher intelligence than his pursuer), has restored my confidence in him as a Grade A actor Â– especially after his rather wooden `Road to Perdition'. In the Director's chair, Spielberg has tackled something outside his usual stomping ground: Catch Me If You Can is a light-hearted romp at heart, but delivered with such panache that it wins as an action thriller and psychological drama at the same time. For all its apparently lightweight pretensions, Catch Me If You Can is a fine achievement in popular filmmaking.",8,1,2,30 January 2003
Marie Antoinette," An original aesthetic - hats off to Coppola!
","If we believe the feminist viewpoint of one of Alan Bennett's characters (from The History Boys), history is the story of men's inadequate responses told from the point of view of other men. So how would a woman's woman auteur, Sofia Coppola, approach a film about one of the most vibrant and controversial of women in French history? Not in a way that is to everyone's liking, that's for sure.Austrian Marie Antoinette was married off to Louis XVI of France, in part to ratify a treaty between the two countries. She lived with him until the Revolution did away with both of them. There is more than enough tabloid character, scandal and turning-points-in-history in her life to make a colourful epic, or sufficient salaciousness for a hearty romp; and while both of these might be stock-in-trade justifiable, the initial scenes suggest we are in for nothing of the sort.Bright pink opening credits catapult us into 1768 Austria with an intrusive girliness reminiscent of a retro pop-video. They soon give way to nice pastels (even the horses gallop through woods in soft focus) and a feminine intellectual assertiveness that somehow says this will be no re-telling of a man's take on history. The facts, while not exactly misrepresented, are definitely going to be subordinate to the artist's vision.For the talented Kirsten Dunst, it is the most challenging role of her career to date. As the leading actress she delivers Sofia Coppola's interiorised vision with charisma and remarkable aplomb. We see her taken into a foreign world and completely isolated (everything, her last shred of clothing and even her dog is taken from her, so that she has only that which is 'completely French'). We see her suffer the glare of publicity even around her marriage bed, and witness the guilt she feels at not becoming pregnant soon enough. We see her searching inside for something to cling to while surrounded vast opulence; and the requisite public persona can admit no unhappiness. British audiences may even see a reminder of Princess Diana, but the significant achievement is perhaps how we inevitably view the possibility of any woman-living-in-a-man's-world feeling for her condition and, through Antoinette's eyes, we also witness history enacted around her in a way almost distanced from her inner turmoil. Antoinette is envenomed at the openness with which a prostitute is allowed to flirt in court; yet at times she feels she herself is little more than a 'piece of meat' traded for politics and progeny. This queen-elect is bereft of privacy and not allowed to be herself, on top of which she doesn't even have a whore's tricks-of-the-trade to get her inexperienced man making babies inside her.Marie Antoinette soon withdraws to the countryside, getting in touch with nature, her artistic sensibilities, and the rearing of a child. This second phase of the movie allows a warmth and simple intimacy in the human condition that was lacking at the Palace of Versailles.Her young husband, meanwhile, continues his wargames, lending soldiers to the American Revolution even though the French peasants are starving. Through Dunst's humility before the things which her character doesn't understand, we glimpse both the true magnificence of the pre-revolution French court and the seeds of its destruction.With unparalleled access to the Palace of Versailles, Coppola has spared little to convey an authentic artistic vision; but it is an aesthetic which owes more to Warhol than Rembrandt. Pop art is employed almost throughout; from a masked ball overlaid with Siouxie and the Banshee's 'Hong Kong Garden' ('an old custom to sell your daughter'), to posters overlaid with slogans vilifying her supposed excesses; or the swift reintroduction of paintings from which successive infants disappear to indicate early deaths. There is no attempt to disguise accents Â– why bother? - Coppola's point goes beyond undemanding historical verisimilitude. At one point, Antoinette's outer happiness becomes real and she sweeps the crowd along, breaking with tradition to applaud an opera. In another scene, we see her on a balcony alone, the darkness of the room at her back. The camera pans back to show the vastness of the beautiful Palace around her, empty of all other signs of life. Here, she is like a captured bird in an over-gilded cage.No-one does rich-little-misunderstood-girl quite like Coppola . . .Building through two first acts of eye-candy superficiality, the coda comes as a slap in the face. Gone are pop music and Mozart - say hello, stark reality. It is not too difficult to find analogies to modern top-heavy nations, whether they be Iran or the USA. How many people have to starve before the boys at the top stop playing war and self-satisfaction? Is the vision of the artist (or even of a child and its mother) really a less viable view of the world? Marie Antoinette can be seen as a cutting feminist diatribe or simply the work of a director who views the universe, the established facts from which she culls only what she deems appropriate for the opus, and even the feelings of the nation in question, as nothing more than her artist's palette. There is a similarity to De Palma's Black Dahlia that thumbs its nose at what an audience expects and simply ploughs on with the ingenious lighting and idiosyncratic revelations; but Coppola's quirky, sugary and sympathetic tone may well upset traditionalists. Some people may just find it flippant. A film that relegates the French Revolution, incarceration and guillotines in favour of subtle emotional resonances and gender imbalances will make a lot of people ask if Sofia Coppola has simply missed the plot. But for someone who pits herself against a male-orientated view of the world, she acquits herself quite admirably - and not just with girlish charm. Marie Antoinette goes beyond its individual example in French history: it is the hope of a nation, hidden in that which is most despised.",10,8,15,26 October 2006
Stop-Loss," Not just another war film . . .
","Can you think of a time when the light at the end of the tunnel is what keeps you going? But just imagine, you get to the end, and the tunnel gets longer . . .Let's not talk about the war - the war in Iraq must be one of the most divisive topics around. But you maybe have to talk to the people involved. And if it is your brother, your sister, your son or sweetheart serving, what's most important then? Come home. Know that I love you. Know that I'm proud of you. And for the guy serving? Do my job as well as I can. Hold my head up. Stop my buddies getting killed.Sgt. Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe) is completing his last tour of duty. When he gets home he is celebrated as a hero. Happy and relieved. Then, together with several other men, he is 'stop-lossed.' A legal clause that can force a soldier to perform extra active service beyond his initial terms. A Catch-22.Director Kimberly Peirce (best known for Boys Don't Cry) is expert at teasing out heavy emotional subject matter. 'This movie is definitely pro-soldier,' she says. 'It may not be pro the Stop-Loss policy. But we have tried to honour and to show with great compassion and understanding the unique experience of these brave men and women and the effect that war has, not only on them, but on their families, friends and everyone around them.' Written into the contracts, stop-loss still comes as an emotional six-ball. And it's the story of over 80,000 troops since 9/11. The difficulty of adapting to civilian life is compounded by life-and-death duty tours just when you thought it was all over. A girl waiting to marry. Parents praying every night for the safe return of their sons - and having their hopes realised only to be dashed.Stop-Loss is the most pro-troops Iraq war-film I have yet witnessed. You will shed tears for the bravery and commitment even if you are a total pacifist. But the real heartbreaker is for the people who suffer with such uncertainty back home. Iraq action scenes are horrific, bloody and full of complex challenges. But I sat and cried for the waiting women. Their emotional journeys are nightmarish rides into an unsure future.'I see it as a unique set of circumstances, not a sweeping indictment of any group, or of the military, or the Administration,' says Phillippe (some of the criticisms have even been that it portrays the Army too leniently.) 'Although it does say something about the situation we're in, what's at the heart of the drama is what happens to these guys when they come back home and can't cope.'Many films about Iraq have poor attendance seemingly because of low emotional momentum. Not so here. Powerful acting and superb characterisation is coupled with an emotional pile-driver that punches the story-layers with heart-rending intensity. Peirce's soldiers are no sad stereotypes. Based on many interviews, we see how different mentalities cope Â– or fail to cope Â– with the pressure. Nothing feels staged (except, perhaps, when Brandon's scar miraculously heals). Abbie Cornish is superb as the fiancÃ©e of Brandon's childhood buddy, and her glamorous looks conceal a thoughtful and resourceful young woman. She is determined to do what is right for her and the people in her life. But what anyone can 'do' always faces a balance-sheet of reality. Stop-Loss is a film where ideals take second place to human love, but without being sacrificed in the process.Scenes in Tikrit (filmed in Morocco) seemed to me as convincing and colourful as those in Texas. Both of them opened my mind. Problems of psychological adjustment that many people have to go through are eloquently portrayed and succeeded in humbling me. War has been romanticised in every age. And we block out the seriousness of post-battle syndromes. Knowing the reality might or might not change our beliefs or make us stop. But sometimes we have to focus on the choices we can take rather than a world we would ideally make.",8,6,12,23 April 2008
Deja Vu," Have you experienced this before? Quite probably . . .
","Have you ever had the feeling that you've seen something before? Like when you're in a cinema and it all starts looking sickeningly familiar. Tony Scott's new movie starts with a hectic mix of shots of people having a good time but the discordant editing or whatever made me say to myself, 'Any minute now, there will be an explosion or a similar disaster.' I waited another full minute of meaningless collage. If this was TV I need that explosion about now to stop me changing channels. And then, sure enough, Whooooomph! Big explosion. DÃ©jÃ  vu!Denzil Washington is a law enforcement officer (Doug) who cannily discovers, after the explosion, a woman burned to death. Except that closer examination reveals to him that she died beforehand, so her death is probably a clue to the terrorist. He joins an elite force with the technology to see four days into the past. They give him an unbelievable explanation as to how this is done, and eventually a 'real' explanation (which is not done very convincingly either). Doug, being the sad, sensitive type, has fallen in love with the dead woman and offers to be flung back in time to save her Â– just so he can prevent the devastation of course.About this time you will be getting DÃ©jÃ  yoohoos along the lines of, 'I think I've seen this before Â– was it in Terminator II or The Prestige?' At least by this point the explosions-per-minute ratio has ratcheted up a bit, so you may grudgingly feel you're getting your money's worth. But when you realise the two best scenes were in the trailer, it's easier to accept you've been had and just spend the rest of the movie waiting for them to appear.On the plus side, the action does eventually kick in, making it at least better than a bad episode of CSI, and a car chase conducted simultaneously in two time frames stretches the brain momentarily. Against this is a sci-fi element that will be clumsy and unconvincing to the most credulous of sci-fi fans and it bit too daft for those who hate such things. I was touched by the fact that it was made in post-Katrina New Orleans, although they probably needed the tax breaks just to break even.DÃ©jÃ  vu is neither pleasantly mind-numbing entertainment nor intellectually stimulating sci-fi, but is a tolerable action movie with a sweet enough twist. Some of the sets are cleverly constructed and the plot is a bit different to the average cops and robbers movie. Ironically, it is not likely to be a film you will remember.",5,28,57,25 December 2006
Finding Neverland," Touching the soul of inspiration
","How do you capture that suspension of disbelief that not only makes a great movie or a great play, but is at the heart of every playful notion that has captivated a child at play, every romantic phrase that has enchanted a woman towards her dreams, every word of love that a woman has blanked everything from the mind of the man she adores, every uplifting speech of every great leader that has given hope and fortitude to the populace . . . where is the seat of that creative vision, that sees beyond the world as it is, reaches out towards the world as it could be, and communicates the joy of that vision?Finding Neverland traces key events of a great writer, JM Barrie, whose childless and less than perfectly happy life not only found joy and fulfilment in creating such a dream, but whose story, Peter Pan, while on the surface a children's story, also examined the very ways that we exercise creativity or 'make-believe'.Johnny Depp produces another of his perfectly-believable-and-utterly-memorable characters in the form of the troubled author and playwright. Kate Winslet, as the Sylvia whose children provide the inspiration for Peter Pan, does not yet seem to have the acting range to provide exquisitely formed new personas with every film, but her charisma nevertheless screams out from every scene (and, in accordance with every non-skeletal woman's fantasy, she looks totally ravishing). Julie Christie (who plays her mother) and Dustin Hoffman (who plays the producer of Barrie's play) are barely recognisable, giving great dignity to their supporting roles by not hogging the limelight. Kelly Macdonald, the token Scots person, provides a wonderful stage Peter Pan, covering her Scots accent almost as well as Depp contrives his (JM Barrie was from Kirriemuir in Forfar, Scotland). Perhaps the most ironic thing about Finding Neverland is that it is a film not for children (or even teenagers) but for adults. The deep (and largely unspoken) emotion between Depp and Winslet, the process of reaching out and communicating through poetic language, the way children *do* grow up (and the way adults remain children), and where fantasy and reality begin and end - these are themes more easily recognised by those who have (or maybe always wanted to have) brought up children, rather than those children themselves. Unrequited love, the things that move an audience (and when, why and how it will move them to bring critical acclaim and their cheque books), the importance of artistic and personal legacies -all these topics are treated in a responsible way that Barrie, if he indeed fully understood the importance of what he wrote, would have been proud.Finding Neverland cradles a lasting inspiration - perhaps one that will last into eternity.",10,1,2,5 November 2004
Training Day," Unremarkable but well-acted
","A `bad cop' movie where the saving grace is a couple of excellent performances by Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke. Otherwise entertaining enough but utterly unremarkable. The plot, a rookie who discovers his boss is not all he seems to be, is too well worn unless given a new handle. Having said that, it's got plenty of action and certianly not a flop.",5,2,13,26 February 2002
Meet the Parents," All-round entertainment comedy
","This is great comedy that always keeps you guessing and holding your breath for the next gag. Robert De Niro slips into a humorous role of an ex-CIA man who is overbearingly suspicious of his daughter's intended (Ben Stiller) and does so with dignity and savoire faire. The outrageous story line as Stiller tries to impress his future father-in-law and digs himself in deeper and deeper is so well acted and well-told that it is easy to forgive the glitches (like, why would a sophisticated young woman with an impeccable background want to marry a total dick-head) and enjoy the film. One to laugh all the way through to from start to end.",Null,0,1,22 January 2001
Unbreakable," A slow attempt at formula
","The fact that this film is reasonably well-made stops me calling it pretentious rubbish, but really all we have is a director who had a major hit (Sixth Sense) trying to turn that into a formula. The result is a movie that is slow, tedious, and rather full of its own importance. The acting is great. Willis plays a man who is the only survivor of an accident and seemingly has had little or nothing wrong with him all his life. Against his better judgment, he starts to believe that there may be something rather special about him, that comic heroes are based on a spark of truth and that maybe he embodies it. The surprise at the end is quite good but hardly worth the wait.",5,0,0,8 January 2001
Star Trek," Still living long and prosperously
","Cocktail party chat on Mission Impossible III might, at very worst, label you mainstream. But mention 'trekkie' interests and the ghetto of a solitary corner awaits, as you vainly gaze across the watered-down punch for a glimmer of like-minded weirdos.Unless pointy ears and anoraks are your thing, admitting you go to the latest Star Trek movie was generally a mistake. This, the studios, in the name of all that is financially Good and Great, wish to save us from. Star Trek must be lifted from its intergalactic backwater and placed squarely in the multi-million dollar sound-bite. Now, suitably high-concept, this eleventh incarnation from the media franchise becomes the respectable selection from a dizzying array of multiplex excess.What Christopher Nolan (and then Heath Ledger) did for Batman, surely a blank cheque and a few good actors can do for Captain Kirk and his motley crew. That, at least, seems the intention. How well does it pan out?Our new Star Trek has a less cult muppets and more action heroes. Chris Pine almost morphs the face of William Shatner's original and the captain of the 4th TV series. Leonard Nimoy cameos as aging Spock as we are introduced to the newer model. Simon Pegg (Scotty), Winona Ryder (Spock's mum) and Zoe Saldana (Uhuru) are all a joy to watch. To establish itself as authoritative (a la Batman Begins), this movie is the prequel, long ago envisaged by creator Gene Roddenberry, and cancelled after its premature birth in the ham-fisted TV 'Enterprise' series. We follow Kirk from his earliest days, and also see young Spock grow up. It is an enormous balancing act, executed with a tremendous price tag (more than any previous Star Trek film) and has to tick many boxes for die-hard fans as well as reaching out to new audiences.Our film opens a few minutes before Kirk is born. During a massive battle, he is shuttled out of harm's way, a cacophony of explosions submerged by sympathetic orchestra strains. He grows up the pretty boy-next-door with a wild streak. A sort of James Dean with a brain. Or, 'the only genius repeat-offender in the Mid-West.' After the most taxing training that Hollywood can devise, he becomes a hardened fighter still in touch with his humanity.There are nice touches to look out for. Spock becomes 'emotionally compromised.' We see passion and a moist eye from the lovely Uhuru; and futurescapes glimpsed all too briefly in an average shot length of under five seconds.As summer blockbusters go, Star Trek deserves to do well. But I would like to have seen some of the groundbreaking moral subtlety for which the original series â€“ famed for the first on screen inter-racial kiss â€“ garnered high regard among many. One has to search for any underlying dynamic at all. At best, it is the story of brave and fearless white Americans â€“ with the addition of a Russian, a Scot, and a token black woman â€“ facing a terrorist-style enemy (rogue Romulans) that has an unfounded grudge, formidable strike power, and no logical way of being defeated. (Wow! That's not too hard to follow!) Add familiar tropes about saving mankind, and western 'compassion' (before blowing someone up). Then fights between representatives of good and evil on a high ledge somewhere, and it starts looking depressingly derivative. Star Trek here relies on action scenes styled to Tom Cruise completing another impossible mission. But, sadly, Pine lacks Cruise charisma â€“ or anyone else's for that matter. And, while MI-III director Abrams was probably a wise choice, the result is more a step in the right direction than a satisfying overall product.We can unashamedly leave our pointy bits at home to watch this film in the company of regular cinema-goers. But, rather than ground-breaking fare, it only takes us to the happy-land of unthinking entertainment. Its catchline: 'The Future Begins' came up on the screen only moments after the trailer for the new Terminator, for which I am assured, 'The End Begins.' Seems all you need these days to defeat an undefeatable assassin is a good starter line. May the White House take note. Though not, perhaps, feeling impelled to boldly go too boldly.",6,11,22,7 May 2009
Citizen Kane," a masterpiece by the standards of its day
","Whilst Citizen Kane represented a masterpiece in innovative technique and the consummate skills of one person (Orson Welles), it stands up less well by today's standards. The story of a newspaper magnate who rides roughshod over everyone in an effort to prove that he helps the underclasses is riddled with sexism and class values that the film makes little or no attempt to dispel. There is hardly a lovable character in the whole film, the final revelation is too obscure to fathom unless you can re-wind the video, and the pacing is such that it can make tiring viewing.On the other hand it contains superb acting, a brilliant script, and enough lighting and camera techniques to keep film students in homework for years. A critics' delight it may be, but for the filmgoer, whilst well above the average, it hardly ranks the 'best film of all-time' appellation that has become its fashionable accolade.",7,1,3,1 December 2002
Monster," Heavy drama
","A gripping, gruelling, story of a highway prostitute who becomes a serial killer and one of the most powerful films of the year. The performance by the heavily transformed (normally gorgeous) Charlize Theron into the rather scary overweight Aileen is an all-time great. Christina Ricci also adds notches to her promising career, this time as a convincing teenage lesbian, enthralled by the older woman, and deeply in love until she realises she's run off with a mentally unbalanced murderer. Theron's character is based on a true life story (the subject of two separate film documentaries) - perhaps the emotional power lies in the sympathy the audience feels for her for quite a long time - a sort of, 'if only something good could happen once in her miserable life, just one ray of light, surely she deserves a chance . ..'. Be warned, it contains very disturbing scenes, including extreme sexual violence. It's a pretty depressing tale, convincingly seen from the point of view of someone who's life has little or no hope.",8,3,3,7 April 2004
Memento," A compelling mystery that maps unknown territory with a terrifying feeling of absolute certainty
","Tightly acted and directed, and brilliantly adapted from a short story that used an unusual idea for a mystery thriller: supposing the central figure can only remember things that happened a long time ago or within the last 15 minutes? The psychological condition where someone, after a trauma, cannot create new memories, is vividly recreated as we are introduced to 15 minute segments one at a time, in reverse chronological order.
To pull this off and maintain smooth continuity is quite a feat, which is why this movie is such a remarkable accomplishment. We are as bewildered as Leonard (played by Guy Pearce) as he searches for the man who brutally raped and killed his wife. He leaves himself clues in the form of tattooed notes and Polaroid pictures to substitute for memory.The tension towards the climax and gut-wrenching revelations reminded me of the Usual Suspects as I came out of the cinema dazzled by the inventiveness and mental pace which this film achieves.",8,1,3,22 October 2000
Inglourious Basterds," Hillbilly Brad
","Motor-mouth director, Quentin Tarantino is rather good at killing people. Fast. Slow. Or slo-mo. But always inventively. Death may be delayed with deviously droll asides or a bit of creative torture. An ear deliciously sliced off in Reservoir Dogs. An all-girl singalong with action replays of our fatal car-smash for Deathproof. Wedding massacre in Kill Bill. Or death requiring an internal carwash in Pulp Fiction. Inglourious Basterds is no exception. Death is nasty, funny, almost operatic. But never boring. One could almost write an outline based on who dies and how.Brad Pitt (Aldo Raine) leads an unconventional group of Jewish Americans behind enemy lines in World War II. Their fighting style includes Apache Indian tactics to terrorize the Nazis. Graphic violence is mixed with tongue-twisting wittiness in Tarantino's peerless signature style. The dialogue is developed to delay inevitable slaughter with ingenious irreverence. Stock characters are engineered with comic book gusto - and are so colourfully convincing that departures from historical fact seem mere details. A mesmerisingly multilingual special officer, Hans 'The Jew Hunter' Lands (with an award-winning performance from Christoph Waltz) is main antagonist to Brad's 'Basterds', as well as two other camps (French Jew Shosanna, and Churchill's Brits plus Diane Kruger) who similarly plot to blow up Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels and the big bad guys. All in a giant conflagration of dynamite, double-agents, guns and plenty of old nitrate film. This happens at an old cinema which is showing a triumphant Nazi propaganda movie-within-the-movie, coincidentally directed by (Jewish) Eli Roth. Who coincidentally plays baseball-bat-bearing Donny Donnowitz, 'Bear Jew,' and who dispatches Nazis by beating them bloodthirstily to a pulp.When you expect violence, you get just sardonic wink. When you don't, you get full-on, glorious, extended, blood-and-guts. Femme Fatales meanwhile deconstruct stereotypes and inject fashion into daring mise-en-scene and plot-devices. Shosanna (Melanie Laurent)'s enviable red dress kicks off a climactic chapter with feminine visual splendour and predictably subverts the traditional macho of war films. Obscure soundtrack references are abandoned for Bowie's more visceral Cat People which explodes into our eardrums, and the fire of the Fuhrer is threatened with a heavy dose of gasoline. Zoe Bell leaps invisibly from Deathproof leading lady to stunt-double for Laurent and Kruger and the action finale delivers pay-off for a rather wordy middle section.There are more historical and cult film references (of varying levels of difficulty) than you could shake from a shibboleth of war movies. It is very clever. It is very Tarantino. It is very art-house. But is it good entertainment? Stylistically, it recalls Pulp Fiction more than any of the director's other work. But the extended inter-action dialogues sometimes flag more than in his earlier glories. It still has great commercial appeal - fortunately for Mr Weinstein, whose flagging production company needs shekels to offset 500 million dollars of debts. But is it Tarantino's masterpiece that has been ten years in the making? For some, Inglourious Basterds could seem like Tarantino-lite. Perhaps more blood-letting and less word-games would have better satisfied our lust for passive cinema, big stars, three-second cuts and more explosions than obscure eponyms. And for serious cinema-goers, while acknowledging Tarantino's nod to French New Wave, are we not entitled to ask if his films are going to have a point? 'We're French. We respect directors in our country,' Shosanna quips. Yes, but should they not also demonstrate substance to deserve it? Godard shot a lot of film just to question film-making styles. Only later did he seek to make films of depth. Each of Tarantino's films is like the arrival of a new voice in cinema. Yet having found his voice, what exactly does he want to say? Any new ground with Inglourious Basterds is firmly in the realm of genre manipulation. I didn't feel it said anything new about Jews and Germans. And questions of race or language seem necessary conceits within the film rather than earth-shaking profundities. Tarantino can justify every aspect of the film to anyone who listens. Maybe I'm making ungrateful quibbles. Maybe our children's children will speak of him with reverence. And if you are a Tarantino fan like I am, you will probably watch it twice anyway, whatever it's faults. Does a film need any further justification?",8,5,16,16 August 2009
Underworld," Beautiful execution more than compensates for derivativeness
","'Underworld' is follows a trend of female action-hero movies, borrowing heavily from the Matrix, Blade and X-Men. What I particularly liked about this one, apart from Kate Beckinsale's fine performance (which shows that female action heroes can still be feminine), is the detailed attention given to the trappings of plot, scenery and costume. Beckinsale does most of the stunts herself, whether in tight black PVC and leather (with or without the de rigueur long black coat) or in high fashion Gothic ballgown outfits. In this world of an age-old battle between vampires and werewolves, Underworld makes up by means of great settings, scenes, respect for legend and openness to metaphor, whatever it lacks in originality, and the two species that are portrayed can easily represent any number of political or religious conflicts, though they are perhaps best explained by a clue in the website's historical 'timeline' which documents cases from Gilles de Reis right up to modern ones of schizophrenia.",8,2,4,20 September 2003
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Bland and syrupy
","Not having read past the first chapter of the book I was happy to judge this film entirely on its own merits rather than comparing it with the well-known novel. Almost, anyway - the first chapter I remember was hilarious - yet the momentum is sadly lacking in the opening scene which dismisses the humour within seconds. World War II approaches and Germany and Mussolini invade Greece. Nicolas Cage, as the unconvincing Italian captain who is more attuned to singing than warfare, demonstrates quite admirably that this is the sort of film he should leave well alone. Penelope Cruz, as the Greek girl betrothed to another but who falls in love with Cage is slightly better, but not enough to lift this bland and syrupy film above mediocrity. The rest of acting is fairly wooden, most of the script quite predictable, and the moral ambiguities of fighting for the 'right' side barely touched. The ending is unsatisfactory,as if we are expected to wait a couple of years and part with more money for part two. Part one didn't hold enough promise - the tedium and self-adoration in the photography and music failed to justify a film of over two hours that could have risen (but fell) on its own merits and lack of them, but it will most surely disappoint the many fans of what is reputedly an excellent novel.",4,9,18,6 May 2001
Dawn of the Dead," Standard fare
","Standard horror fare than transmutes Night of the Living Dead into a kind of big budget 28 Days Later as the zombies head for the mall with shopping the last thing on their minds. There are a reasonable amount of shocks, most of them in the first few minutes before the credits have finished, and then repeated in formulaic fashion with predictable regularity. Needless to say, if you have to pop out for more popcorn, you won't miss much you couldn't guess.Standard horror fare, but fills the midnight movie gap well enough.Takes itself a bit too seriously considering it has little new to offer other than reviving some snappy editing . . .",5,1,2,19 March 2004
Shaun of the Dead," Tacky but entertaining English comedy horror
","Described as a 'British' comedy-horror, this is a very 'English' film, complete with English-style pubs, English silly humour, a generous splattering of gore, and the sort of fish-and-chips romance that goes with English sitcoms. Shaun is caught amidst a growing epidemic of zombies - presumably sparked of by genetically modified crops. Attempts to save his girlfriend and mum (and various others) result in an ill-conceived plan to hole up in the local pub. Humorous references to people with 'dead-end jobs' abound, and also to the attempts by Shaun's girlfriend to get him to 'live a little' rather than hanging out down the pub with his dead-loss mates. The joke is carried even further when the group have to impersonate zombies so as not to be noticed, even to the point of practice auditions. Cerebral stuff it ain't, but Shaun of the Dead, although its joke goes on for a little too long, makes a reasonable stab at breathing new life into a dying brand of horror movie.",6,1,2,14 April 2004
Hostel," Not exactly a trip through Disneyland . . .
","With a firm eye on the box-office, Hostel is a mixed bag of gore goodies with plenty of inspiration but a shortage of creative originality.Like a no-brainer version of Saw, Hostel starts off in a dark torture room. There then follows 45 minutes of non-violent action with three male backpackers as they wend there way through a tedious sequence of bouncing bosoms and hashish bongs. Starting in Amsterdam (portrayed none too realistically, with a marked absence of Dutch), they follow a trail given them by dodgy fellow travellers to find a hostel in Bratislavia promising to be brim-full with sex-starved women and a post-war shortage of men. When they get there, they are lured one by one to a neglected building that shows 'art exhibits', such exhibits being people gratuitously tortured and killed by perverts paying a high fee.Although much blood is used to drench the set, writer-director Eli Roth (Cabin Fever) makes the mistake of descending into black humour and then winding up with a suitably crowd-pleasing good-guy-wins ending. One rather wishes he had learnt from his brief brush with anti-Hollywood studio Troma (where he had small acting parts in the low-budget but very effective Toxic Avenger IV and Terror Firmer) and chosen either seriously nasty horror or gruesome Troma-style camp. Although there is no shortage of nauseating images, from chainsaws to surgical instruments, Hostel rather looks as if it used the British Board of Film Censors guidelines as its handbook. The camera jumps away at the crucial moment (except when violence is perpetrated by the hero), and Roth fails to stylise the brutality with either slow motion, detailed close-ups or snappy editing. The pedestrian acting is competent for the limited demands placed on it, but the script is trite and full of the sort of macho posturing American cinema would sadly have us associate with U.S. undergraduates.Such amateurishness of technique fails on two counts. Firstly, horror is defined in terms of emotional impact. Such lightweight treatment means the shock value of the ideas and images themselves have to take the full burden. Since Hostel is no better or worse than any reasonable gore flick, yet was well marketed, it at least might succeed simply by attracting audiences that are either undemanding of the genre or are shocked because of lack of exposure to good horror films.Secondly, given the story line, there are ample opportunities for creative effectiveness missed largely because, as the film has low artistic merit, it must conform to the lowest criteria of the censors. For instance, modern CGI is capable of very realistic simulation of violence (as evidenced in the scene in Irreversible where a man's head is caved in with a fire extinguisher but without the camera flinching away); good editing can also extend the emotional effect of violence to a very uncomfortable level (in Audition, the build up is so subtle, and the first movement of a person tied up in a bag so sudden, that the audience skips a collective heartbeat Â– and later, in the same film, sadism is extended in time until it is difficult to watch the screen). Both Irreversible and Audition are such cinematic masterpieces that the censor treats the violence more leniently Â– Hostel is trapped by its own mediocrity into the level of shocks it can deliver.Ironically, Roth had plenty of talent to hand, including the director of Audition, and Quentin Tarantino (both of whom have cameo parts). Yet the most artistic moments are those derived from better films: as a sadist surgeon approaches his victim and gasps for air beneath his mask it recalls the similar scene in Blue Velvet when Hopper struggles for breath in his asthma mask as he is about to attack. Another highpoint, when a torturer loses control, is effectively emphasised by the identical discordant bursts of background music that were used by Bernard Herrmann in the famous Psycho shower scene (where the short, stabbing bursts were even more appropriate). Many other scenes (such as the partly dissected Asian girl) are glimpsed only briefly and not used to their full dramatic potential.In its favour, there is some genuine tension in the car chase sequences, and the marauding gangs of children seem not only authentic but realistically threatening. A girl's suicide borrows effectively from Japanese horror as she is frozen momentarily in the camera before death. For all its superficiality, the main story is almost like a modern day vampire movie with buxom Eastern European wenches luring westerners to their doom before the main hero nails the bad guy. Its token believability (there are no mutants, ghouls, supernatural forces) Â– heavily supported in the official website by oblique references to horrific happenings Â– gives it a slightly darker twist than the modern monster movie (Hills Have Eyes) or the overworked (and so less believable) slasher series.Shot in a few months for just over four million, Hostel covered its cost more than fourfold in its first weekend. That it will shock quite a few large audiences and entertain others makes it unfair to categorise the film as worthless, but also makes it likely to be overrated.The three thrill-seeking, homophobic, racist backpackers (two American, one notably Icelandic) are so unlovable that one really doesn't care whether they are tortured and killed or not Â– it might make for better movies if such characters were permanently exterminated rather than going on to repopulate the more standard fare teen-slasher movie or umpteenth American Pie. In an interview, Roth claims he apologised (jokingly) to the Icelandic President for the irreparable damage he was doing to Iceland. Maybe he should just have apologised for making a bad film.",6,1,1,24 March 2006
Coffee and Cigarettes," mostly appeal to those who love Jim Jarmusch's quirky work
","Jim Jarmusch's loving look at situations involving cigarettes and coffee. Imagine Paul Merton's improve program where that was the theme and add a succession of top actors in assorted coffee bars. The series of humorous vignettes, all shot in black and white and over a 17 year period, is an affectionate homage to two social drugs and the situations that can be derived around them. Will mostly appeal to those who love Jim Jarmusch's quirky work. The cameos are appealing and well crafted, but the overall feel is one of art for artists. Interesting cinema rather than an entertaining nights out, Coffee and Cigarettes is an experiment in humour and perhaps audience tolerance.",7,2,4,20 November 2004
Oldboy," Before the opening titles, a few nice gut-thumping adrenalin hits - and that's just for starters . . .
","(minor spoilers inasmuch as I mention some violent highlights) Park Chan-wook continues his individual style of extreme (and extremely creative) violence that he displayed to us in Sympathy for Mr Vengeance. For instance, there is removal of teeth without anaesthetic, self-mutilation, single-handed destruction of a gang of thugs by one man using a claw-tooth hammer. Odd bit of sexual violence and nakedness just in case we thought this was a movie suitable for the kids.The plot is reasonably inventive - a man who is incarcerated for 15 years and isn't told why. When he gets out he creates a path of mayhem trying to escape the web of his enemies. then the plot thickens. One thing that Chan-wook is good at is twisting the audience's emotional sympathies after showing how thoroughly nasty all the characters are. Suddenly we are shown things in a different light. Even the opening scene where a man is being dangled off a rooftop held by another man simply by his necktie is not what it seems. The inventive ending reveals some of the twisted underpinning that is vaguely reminiscent of Kill Bill. Unlike Tarantino however, Park Chan-wook's violence isn't stylised - it's stomach-churningly realistic. Add lots of nice artistic touches on the camera work, get your audience to accept (in true Oriental film-making style) that not all the logical developments need necessarily be explained, and you have another masterly thriller that stands head and shoulders above mainstream Oriental thrillers.",8,11,83,20 August 2004
Spider-Man 2," suffers only from being a sequel
","The opening credits of Spider-Man 2 show comic-strip like scenes from the story, leading us gradually into the idea that this movie is a comic strip brought to life. This small device helps set the stage and the viewer can easily bypass any questions of Â‘how real' the subsequent action appears Â– it has only to live up to the comic strip rather than live up to Â‘reality'. To the makers' credit, the special effects however are incredibly life-like Â– we can concentrate on the story and action without being distracted by them. As an extension of the comic strip, Spider-Man 2 works extremely well. What is the appeal and purpose (if any) of comic strips? Surely it is to define, without the restraints of the real world, the action hero Â– the person whose moral standards and efforts to do good, to resist evil, to respect the individual and uphold justice inspire us to similar qualities within ourselves (a function of all heroes and super-heroes Â– real or imaginary, religious and non-religious). Spider-Man 2's self-examination of the role of the hero, his internal dialogue shared with the audience, make this function more apparent than it is in many similar movies: the character becomes conscious of his purpose and, by articulating it, provides a comment on his own character that draws our attention to his symbolic function rather than simply engaging us by example. For entertainment value Spider-Man 2 also outstrips its predecessor, and the love story between Peter Parker / Spider-Man and Mary Jane has a classic quality to it. This is also one of the movie's greatest weaknesses perhaps Â– the female figure, as in many hero stories, is subjugated to one of a weak woman rescued by the male (in this case it is also the male's adventures that bring her into danger). We have yet to see fairy tales, religious mythologies, or comic strips where the heroine asserts her identity and capabilities on an equal footing with the hero (and without becoming masculinised). But Spider-Man 2 is a triumph of adaptation Â– a new generation of comic book writers is perhaps needed before the power of feminine principles is glorified alongside the masculine.",8,0,2,8 August 2004
The Secret in Their Eyes," A long time in the unravelling
","The Secret in their Eyes is a tale of undeclared love, laced in a complex murder mystery that spans 25 years. The details are so densely packed that I almost would have nodded off had its beauty and skill in the telling not kept me shocked in wakefulness. It is a story of remembering. And how that act of remembering can change the present. What is that timeless quality that we sometimes see in a person's eyes? A look that can hold maybe more than anything, and how it can arrest our thought as they travel a sea of faces; a torrent of years. If they 'express the inexpressible,' is there a reason that stops the lips from forming the words? And if that barrier could be removed?Beating such notable competition as Haneke's White Ribbon for the coveted Foreign Language Film Oscar was no small task. That the Secret in Their Eyes fathoms profound emotions (for want of a better word!) perhaps goes some way to explain its appeal.BenjamÃ­n EspÃ³sito has been employed by the criminal court all working his life. Now entering retirement, he begins writing a novel. The story will be that of a tragic case he once investigated, the brutal rape and murder of a beautiful woman. The legal system in Argentina is not free of corruption but still a highly developed one. The court secretary, Irene MenÃ©ndez Hastings, is Benjamin's immediate superior. He is secretly in love with her, but she is far above his social station and he has no hope of being together with her. As he writes the novel, he goes back over events. Including his unfulfilled relationship with the woman he is still in love with after all this time. A love of justice propels the movie forward but at a pace that accepts some things can take a lifetime. Or a single moment.The murder case is far from simple, even with Benjamin and Irene's pooled determination. Benjamin looks back on his life seeking meaning. Both in his own relationships and lack of them, and in the small successes (but greater failures) that accompanied the investigation. As he replays his memories will he be able to re-write his future? Or are there things to which his eyes will forever remain closed? Juan JosÃ© Campanella's two hour film can occasionally seem affected. But as anyone who has visited can confess, that is true of life in Buenos Aires today anyway. It is still the bastion of European manners from a bygone age and The Secret in Their Eyes sometimes feels like a period piece (even though the film is set in 1974 to 2000). The subtleties of gentlemanly flirtation, the delicacies of social interaction, they present a careful, often unhurried formality through which we must finesse our way with perseverance and appreciation of good taste. We delicately unpick the knotted past so that it does not reap problems for our futures. Does the real life we have lead reflect our inner life and turmoils? The other way round? Or are they not connected? Memory is a powerful thing and can knit together more than just our imagination, our hopes, dreams, and insights. There are clues we have maybe failed to acknowledge. Through stupidity or 'blindness.' And what are the secrets? How do we see them as they really are; spot the clues before our eyes? One secret it's cracked is box-office success. The Secrets of Their Eyes is already a blockbuster in Argentina and enjoying huge triumphs at international festivals. It will probably be one of those 'timeless classics,' as they say.",9,5,6,28 June 2010
Billy Elliot," Dancing into your heart and soul
","For me, easily the most enjoyable film of the Edinburgh International Film Festival (though there might have been others as good which I couldn't get tickets for). It is the story of a young boy's struggle to become a ballet dancer against a working class background (set against the Miners' Strike, a single parent family and a violent father who initially reacts to his son's aspirations with accusations of homosexuality). Whatever the critical analysis, this film is a sheer joy to watch from beginning to end. It's audience appeal may even turn out to be as great as the Full Monty. This is modern, popular British cinema at its best!",7,0,0,29 August 2000
Black Book," Verhoeven on top form
","Director Paul Verhoeven's self-confessed aim is to combine art and business, appeal to a broad audience, and yet still have some endurance. The fame of films like Basic Instinct and Total Recall is lasting, yet they court criticism with their use of sexuality or by playing to the (easily dismissible) sci-fi genre. Graphic sex and violence are common in his movies and, when you add the occasional major flop such as Showgirls, the work of Verhoeven often fails to be taken seriously. Yet Black Book deserves respect. It is a wartime resistance movie on an epic scale, freed of the conventions of British and American war movies, yet bringing their typically high production values to a uniquely Dutch film.Israel 1956. A Holy Land Tours bus stops off at a Kibbutz. One of the passengers recognises a teacher there, Rachel, from times they had shared during the war. As her friend leaves, Rachel thinks back to Holland in 1944. She was an accomplished cabaret singer but also Jewish. She was in hiding, waiting for the war to end. But chance misfortune means she has to try to make a getaway with some other Jewish people. They are ambushed, and she is almost shot. A little later she starts working for the resistance ('terrorists' as the Nazis call them) and infiltrates the Gestapo, seducing a high ranking officer called Muntze.What follows is a frantic game of cat and mouse, espionage and counter-espionage. Rachel (now called Ellis) is torn between the horrors inflicted on her friends close-by and the elaborate deceits she tries to play to save them. Gradually it becomes clear that Muntze, anticipating the end of the war, is risking his neck to try to minimize death and suffering on both sides, and one or more of the resistance fighters is selling out to the Nazis to reap rich profits. Muntze, like Rachel, has had to overcome great losses. Their humanity is a bridge that brings them closer.Rachel/Ellis is played by Carice van Houten, a leading actress of the Dutch screen. Her presence is luminous and charismatic (for British/American audiences, there is the curious sensation of watching someone unknown who radiates star quality with every breath). Her character has to adapt to many contrasting situations yet there is an underlying determination and fast thinking that shines through and makes such changes seem in character and unscripted. We share her emotional struggle and watch her pit her wits against the Gestapo (who are not exactly stupid). The movie is worth seeing for her performance alone.On the one hand, the film has been minutely researched, based on actual events and characters; on the other it still has the slightly larger than life gloss we might associate, say, with a James Bond film. The escapes are in the nick of time, the sex scenes are steamy, and the plot twists increase exponentially as we get closer to the end.Not content to portray the unique conditions of Holland during the occupation, Black Book goes on to catalogue post war atrocities and Rachel's eventual journey to Israel. The style and delivery will not appeal to everyone, but Black Book is Verhoeven on top form, delivering grand entertainment that shows his talents (and those of the remarkable Carice van Houten) at their finest.",8,33,40,30 January 2007
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Light hearted chick flick
","I found this light-hearted romp reminiscent of situational comedies but Shakespeare or Oscar Wilde, although it lacked the depth of, say, My Best Friend's Wedding. But as a Saturday night low-brainer you could do a lot worse. Gorgeous bubbly blonde women's magazine writer gets off with successful advertising hunk. That's the slightly cheesy ending, but you've been entertained thoroughly by the time it gets to the predictable bit, so why not just gulp down the standard fruit-and-ice-cream finale as you move on to the nightclub after the cinema or whatever you're doing next. The bubbly blonde is Kate Hudson (from Almost Famous) and the hunk is Matthew McConaughey (from Wedding Planner). Watching her friend and colleague lose every date by doing all the wrong things, she offers to help out by writing a column on all the wrong things to do when dating a guy - things guaranteed to put him off. McConaughey, meanwhile, is pitching for a lucrative deal with a diamonds firm and boasts he can advertise anything, just like he can make 'any woman fall in love with him'. They call his bluff and offer him the contract if he can make any woman fall in love with him by the time of the presentation (his competitors subtly nudging him towards Hudson, who they know is writing the 'How to Get Dumped' article. The two devote themselves to each other for purely financial reasons but (surprise, surprise lol) fall in love anyway. A tight script for the most part and lots of great chemistry between the lead stars make for a fun film.",7,1,2,5 May 2003
Constantine," Goth comic-book thriller that eventually picks up steam
","The mix of comic book action and palpitating priests hardly led me to expect the sort of film I might enjoy and I had to restrain myself for the first half hour of Constantine from walking out. It's like X-Men meet the Exorcist. Keanu Reeves wanders in as if he's still in The Matrix, this time calmly exorcising heavy-duty CGI demons from hapless muggles. The slim (very slim) basis of all this is that he who holds the Spear of Destiny (that, according to the gospels, killed Jesus) rules the world. Spear has been found (shades of Tolkien's Ring) and sets off all sorts of strange goings on. There is a wafer thin line between heaven and hell, which is reality as we know it. God and the Devil have fun playing at keeping a perfect balance and it takes a strange event (such as the reappearance of the Spear after it had been hidden at the end of World War II) to allow any creature from either 'side' to manifest in the real world.The trick to enjoying Constantine I discovered is not to treat it as a horror film but as some updated goth battle of good and evil. Perhaps for Roman Catholics (who probably believe in that particular version of heaven, hell, the power of the church etc), films like Constantine - and the Exorcist for that matter - hold more terror. After all, if we think we might go to Roman Catholic purgatory, a story about it is more scary than if we don't, right? The other side of the coin can be seen if we watch early Japanese horror movies that rely on their (to us, equally innocuous) mythology and ghostworld bogeymen.But once you buy into the genre (think Spiderman, Blade, The Crow) it becomes reasonably entertaining. The appearance of Tilda Swinton as the Archangel Gabriel adds a somewhat novel touch and prevents the otherwise fairly predictable action from getting staid. Constantine is enjoyable enough at a push - or push it to one side for the much better offerings that are available in its genre.",6,2,5,1 April 2005
The Others," Classy ghost story
","Classy ghost story that goes on a rather long time in what seems to be an over-acted, theatrical style. The denouement justifies the plot, but the feeling is more like seeing a west end play than a supernatural thriller. It scores where trashy horror films fail: it takes itself seriously and has a well thought-out storyline aimed at the intelligent viewer.",7,0,0,11 November 2001
Troy," Ancient Greece? No, but here's the sexy playstation version
","Thank goodness movies are fiction. This idea works well for much of the American film industry Â– after all events outside of the U.S. are either Not Important or Never Really Happened. Add big battles, sex, special effects and a notional wave at reality and you can find the downpayment on a few more Roads to Glory.This approach to film making can be justified in that it can raise the spirits of the masses. Not just in the U.S. Â– Bollywood, for instance, puts a smile on the faces of millions of Indians living in poverty. Back in the U.S. of A., it rallied spirit of troops for WWII and gave hope to the worried families back home that there was hope somewhere Over the Rainbow.For today's fattened (if artistically impoverished) viewers, movies such as Troy feel like a too-good-to-miss extra large helping of Death by Chocolate when we're already too sated to move. We already know the sensorama ingredients give nothing of value to us but they're nice anyway. Brad Pitt's immaculately oiled body is nearly every woman's fantasy hero as the valiant, sensitive, warrior-supremo Archilles. Orlando Bloom is Paris, tender but useless, adorable (if morally bankrupt) and with a make-love-not-war brigade expression (ie don't fight wars, you big pussy, just cause them by stupid, hedonistic indifference.) His Â‘love' of (dumb blonde) Helen is the nominal excuse for the war that launches a thousand ships and results in the sacking of Troy when she is swept off her feet by Trojan Paris from her nasty Greek husband. Helen, after a few nothing-to-do-with-me moral disclaimers, becomes the role model fro every female that aspires to an over-inflated ego.The credits mention the story is related to Homer's Iliad, but apart from name dropping and iconised events from general mythology such as the Wooden Horse, there is little of Homer's genius or subtlety, just as there is little that is identifiably Greek. There are many American and British actors prancing about with swords and overblown histrionics, making little or no attempt to disguise their accents, mannerisms or the fact that they are film stars. Within these parameters however, there are some enjoyable performances, particularly Peter O'Toole as the worthy King Priam, struggling to do the right thing for both his subjects and his offspring, and whom Achilles respects more than his own power-hungry king.
Excellent use of computer generated graphics means we can have convincingly enormous armies in epic battle scenes, and the pacing a story are sufficiently well constructed to entertain us for nearly three hours.
For anyone who found Lord of the Rings too fantasy-laden or Gladiator too bloody, Troy may well be the ideal Saturday afternoon family entertainment. Nothing wrong with a bit of harmless fiction after all . . .",7,1,3,24 May 2004
Brokeback Mountain," The mountain of our fears and dreams
","There's something about mountains Â– the way they inspire us, fill us with hopes and dreams. Is there anyone who hasn't stood at the foot of a mountain as a child and not imagined climbing it? Lush green valleys seem to promise happiness, and the hills beyond are aspirations, symbols of a soaring spirit and also the challenges by which we measure ourselves.Set in the verdant pastures and breathtaking mountains of Wyoming, Brokeback Mountain is a symbol of an enduring dream, a happiness that might be out of reach, of lakes and sunsets, of campfires and sheep farming, of flickering flames and a life away from the hustle bustle, where a can of beans and fresh coffee span a deeper range of existence than the materialism of the city, and where a person can get in touch with their soul . . .Our story starts with two men taken on as sheep herders in 1963, regular guys that need a job. One of them is planning to be married soon. They become fast friends but soon discover more about themselves than they were prepared for Â– and far more than the local community can live with.Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) divide the work up between them, one of them sleeping on the land to protect the sheep overnight and the other riding back and forth with supplies. So far the film has blended the idyllic lifestyle of westerns with a slightly more modern setting Â– reminiscent of early Marlboro cigarette advertising. What follows is a brief scene that explodes and causes many people to either be shocked (especially fundamentalist Americans apparently) or simply say 'not the sort of subject matter that interests me'. As there's no way of avoiding the information by way of the advance publicity, it makes no sense not to tell you that the two men have sex with each other Â– but simply that for once do believe the reports that have given this movie outstanding acclaim worldwide, and go to see it not because it happens to include a couple of gay cowboys but because it is a monumental film in itself.The Romeo and Juliet plot (two starstruck lovers from different social groups kept apart by family prejudice) has been almost exhausted; the not dissimilar starstruck couple here though are kept apart by social prejudice alone (extreme homophobia that includes gruesome torture and murder - although these details, thankfully, are hinted at rather than conveyed too graphically).What is fascinating (to a mainstream audience) is the way the people in their lives deal with it. The wife who knows but pretends it isn't happening, the other wife who lies, the children who grow up presumably in the dark but still attached to their loving father, and finally the parents, whose tender acceptance, in spite of the upset they probably feel at the knowledge, quietly puts their son's happiness first. While covering the extreme stereotypes of prejudice, director Ang Lee (Sense and Sensibility; Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) has wisely avoided simplistic reactions in the supporting characters. The finely nuances performances allow us to see many sides of the moral dilemma without once making judgement.Breaking stereotypes is also the order of the day for the two lead characters, who enjoy much of the macho rough and tumble associated with the heterosexual male (especially the whip-cracking Texan, or full-bloodied Australian: European, Asian and Latin American men seem to find less need for such demonstrations to assert their sexuality, perhaps because homosexuality is better integrated and respected in these cultures). Neither of them are particularly camp, and would both be identified as straight on a casual glance. ('You know, I'm not queer!' says one, the morning after Â– 'Me neither!' the other replies.) This must be particularly annoying to American cultures that cling to such outdoor archetypes as 'heterosexual'. But Ang Lee, an outsider in America, has bravely represented a minority that still carries more social stigma than colour, much to the shame of a country that claims to be the greatest country in the world. An even bigger achievement is that he has achieved it as a mainstream movie, and one that may well go down in history.When the sheep season ends the two men continue with their separate lives, but meet up again four years later (the phrase 'just going fishing' may never be the same again). They realise the hopelessness of their situation but cannot bring themselves to discard it either. When one of the wives spots them in a brief and covert embrace outside, we know that disaster looms Â– the only mystery is what form it will take. The movie unfolds with incredible grandeur amidst the torn-apart emotions of all those involved, condensing a story of a considerable number of years without ever rushing it. Perhaps the one weakness is that it never tries to advance our understanding directly Â– and none of the characters are particularly blameless role models Â– but in confining itself to telling a story it perhaps reaches out for understanding better than any claim to moral high ground. The cinematography is remarkable, never flagging, and juxtaposing awe-inspiring images in a way that conveys a deep sincerity for the subject matter. There are mountains to climb. and mountains that represent ideals to work towards, or simply molehills that seem like mountains until we can open our eyes and conquer our fears about different lifestyles. The small journey to see Brokeback Mountain could be the small step to better understand our humanity to others.",8,20,23,16 January 2006
Juno," If I make a mistake, I'll damn well try not to make any more . . .
","Juno (named after a jealous Roman goddess of heaven and earth) is 16 and pregnant. She had a one-off thing with Paulie Bleeker, a similarly geeky type in golden running shorts. After being frightened off the abortion clinic by a tactless receptionist and placard-waving fellow-student, Juno opts for adoption. 'Can't we just kick it old school?,' she says, interviewing rather posh prospective parents. 'I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.' What sets the film apart is its intense performance by the lead star and a sparklingly offbeat and witty script. Juno is one of those teenagers who is thinking faster than everyone around her and extremely articulate. Like her heating-and-ventilation father, we hesitate before thinking we could know better.In mythology, Juno's deepest desire was for a happy union and proactive partnership. Our heroine having sought out the perfect couple is distraught when, surprise, surprise, they're not perfect. Her father might be on his second marriage, but he is devoted to her in a solid and sincere, role-model sort of way. Their humble, apparently dysfunctional family, is a more solid unit than the high-flying childless materialists who seem to lack for nothing (except a baby).Our film, with 'Indie' written all over its sleeve, has quirks like hand-scrawled chapters announcing the seasons (the Roman Juno was mistress of them). Juno and her best-friend/inseminator play folksy guitar and listen to suitably recondite pop music. She affects a Sherlock Holmes pipe. We have frequent reminders of its low-budget status - as if we should congratulate it on its miraculous existence. But skillful delivery rescues it from pretentiousness every time. And the heady momentum is kept up to the end.If acting and script save it from being high school cheese, they also save it from being a pro-life drum-banger. While hitting all the right notes to show that intelligent kids value abstinence and babies over promiscuity and termination, it is simply telling a story and telling it well. There are many excellent films demonstrating the need to allow choice the other way, and both types should rise or fall on their merits as films rather than the examples they extol.The visual palette of Juno is seductive, rich tones reflecting each season. Cinematography also includes beautiful touches: as Juno sits at the edge of the road, crying for a moment in her car, a slow freight train passes her by. She must do something with her life (and the life inside her), before it, too, passes her by. The story allows all her decisions, of course, to turn out spot on.We are constantly entranced to see what Juno will do or say next. As a standout film, it has the surprise and freshness of a Little Miss Sunshine. The soundtrack is full of whimsical pseudo-intellectual tracks by little-known bands, oozing the appeal of, say, Garden State.One might cavil that such a bright, educated and quick-witted young woman is hardly likely to have bypassed condom use in her underage adventure. Or that the ending is unbelievably pat. But this is still probably the cleverest, funniest, and most lovable bittersweet ode to teenage pregnancy you will ever witness.",9,2,6,2 February 2008
Match Point," Effortless direction
","Something of a turning point in the career of the director perhaps. After being ignored in his home country for many years, this new film by Woody Allen is already (on release in Britain) nominated at the Golden Globes for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Actress (Scarlett Johansson).It's a big change for Allen. Gone is the familiar Manhattan skyline, Allan doesn't appear once, there are none of his stuttering lines, NY is exchanged for London's South Bank, and the even the comedy is very between the lines, with nods to Dostoevsky and La Traviata.Jonathan Rhys-Meyers plays an ex tennis star now making a living as a coach at an exclusive club. There he becomes friends with wealthy socialite Tom and ends up marrying Tom's sister (played by the lovely Emily Mortimer). Except he has become smitten with Tom's fiancÃ©, played by Scarlett Johansson, a failing American actress. Helped into the English upper classes, he is loathe to relinquish his lifestyle, even when he becomes bored with his wife. This is comedy in the Shakespearean sense, the whole story revolving around the importance of luck, yet it soon escalates into equally compelling tragedy.There are few recognisable Woody Allen characteristics - possibly the author's detachment from his subject matter - and he makes the mistake of letting one of the characters call her father 'Papa' (which I doubt if anyone in the English upper classes does these days) - but it does not quite descend to the out-and-out thriller we might have anticipated from the trailer. It retains its aloofness to become a meditation on the importance luck plays in the lives of everyone and whether it is more important to be 'lucky' than 'good.' The sexual eroticism - between Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Scarlett Johansson (who turns in yet another outstanding performance)- is unusual for Allen but, like the ensuing violence, is never allowed to detract from the cerebral content. It's a thought provoking study, but the question it poses is not exactly earth shattering.",7,2,4,8 January 2006
Zodiac," A constellation of clues that may leave you bored with the puzzle
","The movie covers a period of over 30 years and the difficult quest to identify Zodiac, a serial killer. Early on in the film, the Lynchian (Blue Velvet) device of contrasting violence with gentle music erupts with Donovan's hippie ballad, Hurdy Gurdy Man. Only this Hurdy Gurdy man isn't singing songs of love. He is shooting, stabbing, playing catch-me-if-you can, and generally wearing the police down.The lack of a logical progression towards solving the crimes evokes a reality that the cinematography is also aiming at, sepia hues suggesting noir of an indeterminate era. It's claim to be based on actual case files rings reasonably true. There are echoes of Director David Fincher's earlier work, Seven, but without the luridness. The central character, Robert Graysmith, is based on a real person who wrote a number of books about the real serial killer.Graysmith (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) is a cartoonist at the San Francisco Chronicle. His hobby is solving puzzles. Zodiac, who sends cryptic clues to the newspapers, is his dream come true. Following the trail over more years than the police have patience for, Graysmith labours unrelentingly to find the identity of the killer.Gyllenhall is a strength and weakness. He has screen charisma, but maybe not enough to carry the whole movie. His character lacks the depth or maturity displayed by Mark Ruffalo as the weary Colombo-esquire cop or the top lawyer played by Brian Cox. The realism of the film is questioned by his home-boy appeal, even if we warm to it.Occasional special effects (such as a speeded up construction of a building) also jar. The symbolism seems too weak. Fans of double meanings may work many psychological references into the interplay of terrorizer and terrorized, but the film is overly long. I found myself eventually not really caring who the killer was. Only two or three scenes (a murder, a woman driving with her baby, and Graysmith coming out of the rain into a uncannily threatening house to dig up clues) have any tension. The rest left me less than gripped. Endless details, false leads, tenuous clues and waffling plot.Â¨Nobody has more Zodiac crap than you do,Â¨ exclaims Graysmith's long-suffering partner. And it seems the producers spared no expense cramming every drop of it into the film.",6,2,4,2 June 2007
Milk," Not to be missed, whatever your persuasion
","I very nearly gave this movie a miss. I'm pleased I didn't.As with the gay-themed Brokeback Mountain, many might have stayed away till they realised it was more of a movie than that. Milk is a biopic of the murdered gay rights activist, Harvey Milk. But it connects to the audience by being symbolically about everyone, every minority, anybody who has ever been bullied or ashamed to admit their beliefs. It's about the human spirit. The rights of man enshrined in the American Constitution. And it's about the compassion that lets us see our enemies as human beings.Part of this is down to an outstanding script. But much is down to Sean Penn (at times almost unrecognisable in a beard), who handles the role with a winning combination of grit and sensitivity. He becomes the master orator standing for political office. There are characters in his life that have committed suicide because of the shame of being gay. He is the first openly gay man to hold public office and he gives people hope (in much the same way, it may be said, that the similarly charismatic Barak Obama is doing for black people). We see poignant comparisons with Nazi pogroms against anyone who was 'different'. We see the fervent religious right, claiming God on their side, as they preach a message of hate.Righteous hatred is not dead in America. A few hours before seeing Milk, I had watched a horrific documentary about a family of preachers who picket not only 'faggots' but anyone they believe tacitly supports homosexuality (the footage included picketing a dead serviceman's funeral). We have laws against inciting racial hatred. How can they get away with inciting such homophobia? Milk goes back to the 70's. Politicians opposing him label homosexuals with prostitutes and thieves. Deny them any rights. An argument worth pursuing philosophically perhaps, especially as Gordon Brown's UK government is currently trying to demonise prostitution. A thief breaks the laws of property. But homosexuals Â– and prostitutes for that matter Â– offend only those whose totalitarian view of the world wish to discriminate against those who, privately and without hurting others, have the audacity to live differently. Common tactics include linking crime by association. And with prostitution there is some evidence of links to crime, although it may be linked more to marginalisation Â– and prostitutes could always, at least theoretically, become non-prostitutes. Homosexuality, like being black or Jewish, cannot be 'treated.' Gays can rarely, if ever, 'become straight.' And neither is sexual preference an indicator of criminal tendency.Milk takes his arguments to the most hostile of audiences. He debates with remarkable skill. But, although people warm to him for his courage and kindness, his personal life frequently sinks into tatters. Being second fiddle to a political crusader is no joyride. Even if you were straight. Campaign-trail Harvey might be fighting for your life in broad terms, but it won't help you through that long night of dinners for one.Milk admirably avoids the mistake of glossing over common faults of the gay community Â– notably male aversion (at the time) to lesbians. In a hilarious scene where Harvey hires a lesbian campaign manager, the all-male entourage dissolves into ridiculous girly twittering against her Â– until, with a few well-chosen words, she proves she's got, 'bigger balls than anyone in the room'. Harvey slowly expands his cause. He realises it can't be just about gay rights. It has to be about everyone's rights. If elected, he has to show genuine concern for everyone's troubles Â– not just gays. And, after a few political near-slips where he is tempted to cut a deal, he welds himself to a virtuousness in public office that his opponents can only hypocritically claim but not deliver.We know in the first few moments that he is going to die. The rest of the film is told in flashback. Penn, an actor that is occasionally too intense for my liking, has found a film where he can throw every muscle twitch, every watery eye, every shade of emotion, into a character and cause where intensity is called for. In one of the finest performances of his career, he is understated to convey finer feeling, yet passionate on the soap box to an inspirational degree.I was also very pleased to see this praiseworthy development from director Gus Van Sant. Many 'indie' directors start off with great 'artistic' work, only to be eaten up by Hollywood glitz. Van Sant's career is almost the opposite. Having proved his metal with crowd-pleasers like To Die For and Good Will Hunting, he seems gradually to have abandoned all pretensions to mainstream. His Paranoid Park was a masterstroke of subtle evocation in the thriller genre. With Milk, he has applied his skills like a great craftsman, reclaiming self-respect for the serious yet accessible artist.The one nagging criticism of course is, where are all the gay actors? I cannot fault Sean Penn's acting. He is undoubtedly the best actor for the part. But the very message of equality proclaimed so loudly by Hollywood's darling liberal left is still unheeded within their own industry. How many openly gay actors can you name? I thought so . . . And how far have we really got, really, or has apathy set in? As California bans gay marriage, one commentator noted, 'Where were today's Harvey Milks when Proposition 8 was on the ballot?'",9,15,24,19 December 2008
The Prestige," Sinister sleight of hand
","Cinema and stage magicians share a common secret about us, the viewers: we don't want to believe the reality - we enjoy the sensation of being transported to a world where we can gasp at the magic. 'The secret impresses no-one: the trick you use it for is everything.' Exploiting this parallel in a darkly sinister period piece, The Prestige weaves a tense and gripping tale of a fatal feud between two rival magicians.In the skilfully recreated Victorian London, Director Christopher Nolan performs another sinister and chilling sleight of hand that forces us to look closely at every frame, just as we did in his backwards-moving masterpiece Memento (about a desperate man trying to avenge his wife's murder while suffering from the loss of all short-term memory). The two magicians (played by Bale and Jackman) are poised somewhere between being scientists and conmen and risk all for the secret of the greatest stage trick - and the two women in their lives weave in and out trying to discover the inner secrets of these men with whom they are involved. Seeing the story from several angles, the viewer shifts perspectives to work out what is real.Almost like another conjuring trick, David Bowie, and to an extent all the actors except Michael Caine, are subsumed in their characters and barely recognisable at first glance. Caine, as the magician's ingeneur (the person who designs illusions behind the scenes) is a lynchpin, giving a powerful and convincing performance he can believe in. Scarlett Johansson, as the inexperienced but devoted magician's assistant, creeps up on us subtly and, thrown between the two main characters, is another one who might not be all she seems.Cutter, (Michael Caine) explains the format: 'Every great magic trick consists of three acts. The first act is called The Pledge: the magician shows you something ordinary, but of course, it probably isn't. The second act is called The Turn. The magician makes his ordinary something do something extraordinary. Now, if you're looking for the secretÃ‚â€¦you won't find it. That's why there's a third act, called The Prestige. This is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before.' Gone is the image of the jolly magician. This is no Paul Daniels era of hocus pocus. If it goes wrong, things might get nasty. If it goes right, you are left with that gasp of amazement on your face that every magician craves and every filmmaker seeks. Perhaps the feeling is more important than deciding whether you actually want to find out or be fooled. Whodunnit or thriller, The Prestige is a rather clever piece of entertainment.",8,4,8,6 November 2006
Sleepy Hollow," A lovely fairly-tale horror story in the Hammer Horror tradition
","A lovely fairly-tale horror story in the Hammer Horror tradition - mostly appeals to those who find this strange Tim Burton genre a satisfying art form.

Hotel Rwanda," Making a film and a contribution to humanity
","I usually say my criteria for assessing a film are asking myself if it inspired, educated or entertained me. I somehow don't seem to have a category for 'it totally devastated me'.Nearly all the main characters are based on real life people Â– very real. One of the problems we have in coming to terms with the ethnic destruction of a peoples we have no knowledge of, have little culturally in common with, have little to identify them as 'people' other than a biological acknowledgement is that, for us, they are not very 'real'. So is the point of a film about the Rwandan genocide that left a million dead that they become more real? Does that make any difference? One of the results of going to see this very powerful, very harrowing (and in terms of the personal integrity and bravery of some central characters, very beautiful) film is that part of the proceeds go towards helping the people who are left. Another, perhaps, is that by becoming more aware of suffering our desire to find a way to avoid or alleviate it increases. The film shows a divide between - on one hand - the Rwandan people who, rich or poor, had sensibilities much like you or I, - and on the other hand - the troglodytes that wanted to kill each other and (with a logic reminiscent of President Bush's 'if you're not with us you're against us' simplistic attitude) anyone who didn't join them. The inclusiveness of the carnage and the inability (or unwillingness) of the West to help meant there was no get out along the lines of 'if they want to kill each other let them'.The performances are so spellbinding that it is hard to watch the film without feeling the suffering of those involved. Although it points the finger at a reluctance of the West to get involved, we also have to ask ourselves that, even if the powerful governments or the UN were willing to get involved, could the carnage have been prevented? The lack of any well-structured hint at a potential solution is perhaps one of the (very few) flaws of the film. Similarly, the swiftness of some of the events makes historic sense but there is not always enough detail to explain why things happened the way they did. But it seems clear that some intervention could have at least reduced a large amount of the carnage, so in a way Hotel Rwanda is a protest against international apathy.The official website of the movie provides much in the way of reference material, links and analysis. This helped to confirm my view while watching the film that those involved felt that there was something more at stake than being film stars. In doing so they have become true stars, irrespective of what awards were won or not.",8,8,12,2 March 2005
Once," Pleased that so many people liked it. But totally puzzled . . .
","I could never quite understand why Once got an Oscar for its music. But having missed it first time round, I thought it would be a nice relaxing Sunday night movie. Now although it has a certain magic if you don't find the music irritating, it's a big 'if.' As the music plays almost throughout.Bearded busker-of-no-name (incredibly talented), meets sweet little Big Issue babe-of-no-name (also incredibly talented). They bond incredibly over his incredibly mournful songs lamenting the incredible departure of his last incredible girlfriend. Can I tell you a secret? The film lies. She left to get some peace and quiet.Our opening few minutes has busker boy singing his heart out. You can predict the moment she will arrive almost to the second. The rest of the movie is fairly unpredictable (largely because nothing happens.) When you've seen the junkie try to steal his guitar case, you've seen the best bit. From there on, it's gooey painting-by-numbers that never gets properly started, much less finished.We fast-segue into urban folk-tale mode, the penniless pair putting together a band of street musicians and get a recording studio for a mere two thousand Euros. The acting is OK. But if it beat Enchanted on song, it sure loses out on fairy-tale. Script is appalling (The story is unbelievable and most dialogue is replaced with music. Or else Issue-babe staring dreamily at busker-boy, asking adoringly about his dismal past relationship.) The songs nearly put me off my tea, even if the couple are indeed quite talented. Mournful, melancholy brooding folksy is not my bag. Some short a capella and more relaxing songs in a Dublin folk club provide a more pleasurable interlude. But too short. Then there's some nice shots of the countryside near Dublin. And a believable chemistry between these upmarket bottom-of-the-heapers. If only she might snog him, I think, just to shut him up. But then his songs keep going in the background even when his mouth is occupied. Relentlessly. So such plot development seems pointless.As films of improbable musician meet-ups go, Once had me longing for the unpretentiously cheesy (and under-rated) Music and Lyrics (Hugh Grant). Which at least had the decency not to take itself so damn seriously.Busker boy is played by Glen Hansard of The Frames , so if you are fan, this is good value. If you're not, it's maybe worth downloading a track from the film before deciding. There's an awful lot of the same. The film could almost be called the cheapo album video. His voice has lots of gusto. Passing him on the subway, it would be refreshing. Stuck waiting for a bus with him in the background might be wearing.I am supposed to say it is sweet and tender and stuff like that. It's not. It's about two pathologically messed-up people who don't have the courage to move on. There's a nice bit of Irish charm that plays especially well in the States (From a budget of $150,000, it grossed almost $17 million). For me, I'm sad to say there was not enough charm for to dispel the queasiness.A brilliant low-budget effort, but the repetitive songs are not charismatic enough to warrant more than a 20 minute short. Once is cheesy love-on-the-poverty-line. Cut-price cheese, the sort with lots of milk and fat. Passing itself off as indie-made, quality pizza. As much as you can eat for 85 minutes. Please don't choke. I admit that many people must have enjoyed it, which I don't understand. Unless you like being sucked in by such mush, it doesn't seem worth leaving the pub for. You could be enjoying a nice pint of Guinness instead. Or two . . .",4,9,17,6 July 2008
Ocean's Twelve," Videos of Brad Pitt, George Clooney etc just smiling for the cameras might be money better spent . . .
","I had low expectations of this film and it didn't exceed them. It has a nice roll call of talent - Brad Pitt, Catherine Zeta-Jones, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, and the award winning director Steven Soderbergh all turning up - and lining up - to churn out a movie with as much pizzaz as a millionaire buying a new car cos the ashtrays in the old one were full.The story Â– for want of a poorer word Â– follows the heist team of Oceans 11 as they try to outwit fellow thieves (and the efforts of international detectives) pulling off unbelievably difficult and lucrative robberies. It teems with one-liners that are meant to be amusing and aren't, actors who look like they are reprising cameos from earlier Â– and better Â– movies, and a story that would be interesting if it wasn't so silly, and directed so unconvincingly.Director Steven Soderbergh has come a long way since such indie bursts of creativity such as Sex, Lies, and Videotape, the tongue in cheek charm of Out of Sight (which is in a similar vein to Oceans 12, but with the exception that it is a Good Film), or the powerful social statements of Erin Brockovich and Traffic. Here, it seems, he wants to rake in some cash without doing much work Â– nothing wrong with that if you can get away with it, but don't expect film fans to thank you Mr Soderbergh.On a positive side, there's a few nice locations around Europe even if they are underused, and the lighting and print quality was excellent. References to other movies are perhaps intentional rather than merely derivative, but they are probably more entertaining to those working on the film than the audience.In the interests of space, I will only suggest two reasons to avoid going to see this film. One is that it is not worth seeing. The other is to convince people with talent and money that being superstars and knowing how to work a camera is not a license to insult the film-going public. Sadly this film has already recouped its $100,000,000+ investment, due no doubt to a considerable sum being spent on advertising and cashing in on names. But for those who like any excuse to see their movie heroes, maybe you will find it pleasant to watch.",5,0,0,5 February 2005
Crash," Oscar bait with broad appeal - yet a remarkably thought-provoking film and one of the most interesting portraits of L.A. to date
","Writing, directing and producing Crash, even through a heart attack, suggests that Paul Haggis is perhaps a remarkable individual, though not necessarily remarkable at any or all three. The result, however, suggests that he is. Crash is remarkable and noteworthy for a number of reasons, and could repeat some of the success of Million Dollar Baby (which he wrote and produced although, perhaps unfortunately in the opinion of this reviewer, allowed Eastwood to direct).The start of the movie shows the scene immediately after a car crash. A number of people start arguing, racist remarks are made. It is set in L.A. - a challenging city in many ways, not least for its complex racial mix.Crash goes on to look beneath the surface of such destructive attitudes by examining a number of incidents the day before the crash in question. In doing so it achieves not only challenging self-reflection but maintains the dramatic pace in a way that many such movies fail to accomplish.In many ways, American society (ie US society) has got itself into problems that are nigh impossible to fix (and often not for want of trying). With race relations, Haggis looks at deeply embedded attitudes and failings that are not only common to many ethnic groups (including white American) but where people are in a 'damned if you do, damned if you don't,' situation.Sandra Bullock (in a relatively small part but one of the best she has tackled) has relatively few pressures in her life. She is married to a D.A., has a housekeeper and a gardener, but finds she is waking up angry every day. An intelligent individual, she goes as far as seeing it is something within herself rather than just blaming everyone else. Her questioning goes further when she has a small accident (that lands her in hospital) and her 'best friend' is having a massage and hence too busy to help.Earlier in the film, Bullock asks herself: if she sees a black man in a white neighbourhood and (instinctively) knows that he means to harm her, she will be dubbed 'racist' if she takes steps to protect herself yet come to harm if she ignores her well-seated gut feeling. (Her gut feelings are not always right, but how often do you want to gamble when it's your life at stake?)We see similar dilemmas (also often over-exaggerated, misconstrued, or interpreted with tragic lack of streetwise, from the point of view of Blacks, Hispanics, Chinese and Iraqis).The subplots of various characters keep us glued to the screen; any simple value-judgements are confounded. We see the love and (sometimes counter-stereotypical) bravery of the most 'unlovable, 'racist' characters. We see the real people behind what others (ie others of different ethnic origins) see. We question the obvious 'answers'.The USA is imbued with ideologies that, whilst survivalist, are not self-healing (transferring the government of, say, New Zealand for 25 years might help). Traditional Christian virtues alone are insufficient to deal with such problems (the 'Good Samaritan cop not only gets himself in deep water but ends up doing more harm than good.) But so is populist psycho-savvy: ' . . . if we can't duck this thing, we're gonna have to neutralize it.' (D.A. faced with a politically problematic prosecution of a black man who's given him problems.) 'What we need is a picture of me pinning a medal on a black man. The fire-fighter - the one that saved the camp or something - Northridge... what's his name?' It didn't matter that the hero was an Iraqi - but it mattered that he happened to have the common first name of 'Saddam' - no good for P.R. that one . . .The principled approach of Don Cheadle's character has similarly little effect. He tries to be an upright Detective in a politically corrupt system and so gets caught between the devil and the deep blue sea. There are very few winners in Crash.Yet the overall formula is a winner. It lacks answers, just as America probably lacks the ability to use applied philosophy to solve problems in its own back yard - at least in the foreseeable future on this issue. But it's integrity as art, its ability to move us - to laughter, to tears, to compassion, to shock - to enable us to look within ourselves, that integrity and independence of thought is quite strong and all the more remarkable for an American movie these days. It even lacks the self-congratulatory tone of Million Dollar Baby (which may be invisible to many Americans, especially those not extensively exposed to European and other cinema that is more art-based than big-business based). If you've had six pints of lager and want lots of explosions, Crash may not rock your boat but, for mainstream quality cinema-lovers, it is a breath of fresh air.",9,2,9,12 August 2005

Scary Movie 2," Nice opening credits - shame about the rest
","Don't worry if you need to dash out the cinema to see a better movie after the opening credits: the best sequence is in the first few minutes - a hilarious send-up of 'The Exorcist' where all the elements of the head-twisting sick-spewing child and the pervy priest are brilliantly caricatured and manage to be shocking and funny at the same time. From there on we get a series of sketches based on various horror films, but none of them up to the same standard - in most cases much poorer in entertainment value than the original. The plot is so flimsy I had forgotten it by the time I left the cinema - sorry!",4,1,3,26 September 2001
Pan's Labyrinth," A masterpiece
","1944. Franco's authoritarian fascist regime is a horrid world for a child, barely into her teens. Ofelia retreats into herself, finding in her fantasy world the lessons of courage, self-discipline and integrity she will need. With her, we travel beyond outward appearances, through a labyrinth of fears and uncertainties, from which Spain will not escape for several decades.A dark, brutal fairytale, chillingly set in the real world but full of hope and warmth, Pan's Labyrinth accomplishes a masterpiece.Our film opens with a momentary shot of Ofelia, blood from a nosebleed disappearing as the frames are introduced in reverse. A voice-over takes us back to the time of the Spanish Civil War. Ofelia arrives (with her pregnant mother) at a nationalist military base in the woods and is introduced to her stepfather, a vicious commanding officer. CapitÃ¡n Vidal dispenses arbitrary justice to anyone he suspects is against him. Two suspected rebels caught by his men are summarily executed. Only afterwards is a rabbit discovered in their bag, proving their claim that they are just woodsmen (and maybe also a throwaway reference to Alice in Wonderland). Ofelia is unwilling to accept this harsh adult world. She retreats into a labyrinth where she meets a strange Pan-like creatures, Fauno, who gives her a set of tasks where she has to face some of her darkest fears, winning a key for her next task. The story becomes more intense, both outside the labyrinth (where Vidal is busy torturing people) and inside, where Ofelia has to face the Pale Man - a creature that has plucked out its eyes and can only see by placing them in the stigmata on its hands. Around the walls of the room are pictures of people being cast into hell by the Pale Man (From inference or the director's comments, it is apparent that the Pale Man represents authoritarianism, whether that of the Fascists or the Church). In Pan's Labyrinth we have a parable about the journey of Spanish society from the 1940s to post-Franco, a magical fairytale of stunning beauty, a story of the struggle and character development of a child on the edge of puberty, and a tense story of battles between Nationalists and Republicans. That they are all welded together seamlessly and precisely in a multi-level narrative is a remarkable achievement and thrilling experience. The sheer artistry recalls Cocteau's La Belle at la BÃªte. Del Toro sweeps us into a dreamlike, poetic vision, with a minimum of CGI and a grasp of dialogue that seems almost transcendental. In a brave decision, an actor (Ivana Baquero) who is only as old as her character has been used to play the young Ofelia. But as the ethereal figure between two worlds, she is also there to cast the earthy characters involved in material battles into more visceral contrast. Editing is crisp throughout, without a single frame wasted. Rich colours and unflinching camera-work keep us rooted in the experience, whether it is Ofelia crawling face-down in the mud and covered with insects, or a hapless victim having his nose smashed in by the CapitÃ¡n. Yet scenes of tenderness and beauty are equally as moving - Ofelia retreating into her mother's arms, a nursemaid powerless to help her republican lover, or a doctor performing an act of mercy.The movies, like our dreams, folklore and imagination, are rich with symbols and images that can strike a chord in our deepest being. Artists, as well as creators of myths and religion, have long employed such symbols to guide and inspire, knowing that the conscious mind may accept a sign more easily than rational argument alone.In watching a movie, we combine ideas of the real, the imaginary and the symbolic to find an inner affinity. And, if the filmmaker has done his job properly, will feel truly moved.One of the things that can make or break a movie that makes extensive use of symbols is whether those symbols echo in the collective unconscious, often through time honoured association, or not. Knowledge of mythology or Jungian psychology can make all the difference. Much has been made of the title. Originally 'El Laberinto del Fauno', the translation at first appears sloppy, but Del Toro has done his research well. While quipping that it 'just sounded better', a little investigation of classical authorities shows Faunus as a form of the ancient god Pan (Lempriere). Pan, the goat-like god that represents a totality of possibilities, together with goat-like stubbornness and independence of thought, is the perfect symbol. In the film he says, 'I've had so many names... I am the mountain, the forest and the earth. . . . I am a faun. Your most humble servant, Your Highness.' In Greek Mythology, Pan also won the affections of a princess under the form of a goat. The freedom of thought (and sexuality) he advocated, with the rise of Christianity, caused him to be portrayed as the Devil; but we learn his intentions are good, whereas the holy-looking Pale Man offers temptation only as an excuse to rip his victims apart. As an aspect of the creative power, fauns in mythology also symbolise firm aspiration and human intelligence.The one symbol that Del Torro is less adept in using is that of dying. He tends to use the valid, if flawed connotation of redemption-through-death promoted by the religions he disavows, but it is a small point that in no way spoils the story.Pan's Labyrinth leads us through parallel stories and themes without once losing its internal consistency. Some audiences may be put off by the idea of using flights of fancy in such a blatant way or, sadly, by the fact that it is subtitled. Such minor monsters should not get in the way of enjoying the film on a simple entertainment level. Cinephiles, on the other hand, will not want to miss such a rare treat of talent.",10,205,279,22 November 2006
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," You wouldn't (I hope) watch a movie on a 3' screen - why watch musical theatre in the cinema, sung by people who can't
","Tim Burton and Johnny Depp make a lot of good films together. 'Edward Scissorhands,' 'Ed Wood,' 'Sleepy Hollow,' 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' Â– I loved them all. Sweeney Todd displays another impressive blend of their talents. And I hated it. Let me tell you why.Don't get me wrong Â– it's a very good movie. Very cleverly done. But for all the hundreds of thousands that enjoy it, there will be some that find it nauseous, pointless, superficial, and much better left undone. In case you are likely to be one of those people, let me tell you enough about it to save wasting your money and a couple of hours you could better spend doing something else. Like watching the rain or staring into space.Firstly, Sweeney Todd is a musical. This is very important, because the trailer makes a hash of telling you what it is. Is it a fairy tale? A horror story? Something weird with a song or two? No, it's a full blown stage musical Â– one of those where they sing nearly all the words rather than having dialogue and songs.There's nothing more I enjoy than a good trip to the West End of London or New York's Broadway. There's the excitement of the legendary venue, and they will have the cream of the crop of performers who can sing extremely well, act enough to project stage presence, and dance as well if required. By the time the show gets to the provinces, the good singers have usually been replaced with people who can yell. Not a massive problem perhaps if you are doing Rocky Horror or Sound of Music Â– shows with good singalong ditties. But if I have to focus on the raucous attempts of a second rate 'singer' for over two hours, invest a second rate plot with meaning it barely deserves, and feel my wallet suffer for something that is neither art nor entertainment: then I get fidgety.Like the similar travesty, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Sweeney Todd forces me to endure something that could be palatable in a top theatre and is execrable on film. And it gets worse: Hunchback used people who had good singing experience Â– Sweeney has a failed pop singer who can act. Let's add the director's girlfriend/spouse. She can't sing either, but close-ups of her expressive face will help to take the heat off Johnny. Watch out for the Depp kiss. 'I was being paid by my boyfriend to kiss his best friend,' she told reporters.As it's a 'musical', let's add a couple of people who really can sing and stick them in minor roles. With all the big names, we won't see or hear them very much. It's a minor love story while Bonham Carter slavishly follows Demon Barber Johnny so he can work out his frustration at losing his first love. Johnny works out his frustration very well Â– by slitting throats. Not just his intended, but many others, for practice and pies. It's all done to more ridiculous warbling, so is more about adding colour than horror.The one bit I enjoyed was Sacha Baron Cohen as Signor Adolfo Pirelli, a competitor barber. He was doing what he is best at Â– being funny. Now if they had left Depp and Carter to do what they are best at, decided whether the sets and lighting were meant to be realistic or fantasy, and left the venerable Mr Sondheim writing musicals for the stage . . .It could have been good. I could have enjoyed it instead of wishing it would hurry up and end.Of course, I can't give it one star because I recognise that both existing fans of the stage show and would be fans are going to love it. It appeals to the people who want a stage show with a bit of an adult theme, dressed up with top stars (Depp's performance is stellar). And to many more who no doubt see something I don't. So now you know what it is, you've probably read all the glowing reports, and you can decide whether you might like it or not.",6,1,3,5 February 2008
Closer," Not for everyone's taste, but a superb tour de force for those can digest serious theatre
","Closer is a deceptively innocuous film about four young singletons in contemporary London that has divided critics fiercely.Set casually and unpretentiously across such fabulous locations as the South Bank, the London Aquarium, the National Portrait Gallery and the Theatre Royal, this intelligent, biting and (at times) shocking film will thrill as much as it will appal.I liked the four virtuoso performances, tightly scripted action, psychological dilemmas of sexual politics set against a modern lifestyle, constant surprises, and the soul searching it offers on the importance of truth in relationships, the meaning of love and the things that are needed to make a relationship work (or ensure it will flounder).It's director Mike Nichols most powerful tour-de-force since the classic Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, easily surpassing the more commercial fare of Graduate or Working Girl, the minor anti-nuclear film Silkwood, or the flawed and over-ambitious Catch 22. It's a film that works on many levels and matures from repeated viewing.The four lead characters are newspaper (obituary) writer played by Jude Law, Natalie Portman as a new woman who comes into his life, commercial photographer admirably understated by Julia Roberts, and finally Clive Owen as a dermatologist. The actual action is incidental. The main point is the way they interact and form relationships.Closer has been adapted for screen by award winning playwright Patrick Marber from his stage play of the same name. This may give a clue as to the nature of the film - what is marketed deceptively as an almost light-hearted romp (which is what it starts out as), has an acerbic and even vitriolic core that is more suited to serious viewers than those looking for straightforward entertainment. This is also the movie's main flaw: it is not everyone's cup of tea. Additionally, there will be large groups of people who will be shocked or disappointed. There is not much graphic sex, but there are very explicit verbal battles of a sexual nature, and persons who might be offended or turned off by jealousy arguments about who put what where and what their bodily fluids tasted like might as well save themselves the price of admission.There are, however, some excellent comic moments, such as when Dan asks Anna 'Do you want babies?' and she quips back, 'Yes, but not today.' Similarly, the scene where Dan cons Larry in a sexually explicit internet chat room is almost unbearably funny in an excruciating sort of way. But the meat of the movie is reserved for big questions about how we view relationships and 'edit out' bits we don't like when we remember them fragmentally, or through the keyhole of our single, personalised viewpoint.Happily married people who have never had to sail the tempestuous seas of dating and trial relationships may find it harder to identify with the characters, but many others will be able to project themselves into these intelligent, strikingly attractive and trendy would-be relationshippers. People can put their better selves forward as honestly as possible but then get mired in situations that are of their own making but not of their own ultimate choosing or living up to their own ideals, and in various ways this is what we see happen in the film. For some, the process of getting 'closer' may be painful, or the closeness may come with the realisation that it wasn't the marriage made in heaven you thought it might be.In the opening (slow motion) scene, Jude Law and Natalie Portman move towards each other with sizzling self-confidence and oozing devastating sexuality. If they are cocky, it is in the suaveness that affects many eligible young adults, that self-effacing sureness that is designed to elicit the attention of the opposite sex in an almost accidental way. Natalie Portman shines through several remarkably different 'real selves' until the stunning denouement where we can come to know her and understand the difference between her honesty in the sense of trueness to oneself and honesty in the more literal sense. Clive Owen, as Larry, the realistic doctor who combines intellect and a certain amount of breeding with a sometimes vicious honesty, achieves a performance that will jump start his career to greater things. Julia Roberts, sadly too often known more for her star appeal than her acting, gives probably her best performance since Erin Brockovich as a successful and self-sufficient photographer. Instead of stealing the limelight by making her character stage centre, she underplays it, giving conviction to her part rather than reminding us she is a superstar. Finally, the talented Jude Law as Dan, who aspires to be more decisive and successful than he maybe has the stamina for, captures our imagination with his all too human failings, his attempts to prove his sincerity, and his good looks.Closer features a charismatic soundtrack starting with Damien Rice's haunting 'Blower's Daughter' and continues with frequent excerpts from Mozart's similarly themed Cosi fan Tutti. Like many things in the film, the Rice track, where he sings, 'Can't take my eyes off you' has more than one meaning. For anyone unfamiliar with Mozart's opera, I can say it asks the age-old question: how much can you really trust your lover? with earth-shattering consequences for everyone concerned. In our movie, for those who are seeking some answers from what on the surface is a very cynical view of modern adult liaisons, some clues may be picked up from the throw-away comment, 'You don't know the first thing about love because you don't understand compromise.' Oh yes - and watch out for who finally makes it through to the end, and ask why!I've seen Closer twice already and can't recommend it strongly enough - although I also hope my comments have put off those people who won't enjoy it and might have gone to see it in the mistaken belief that they would find it digestible.",8,1,5,25 January 2005
Capote," A brilliantly multilayered, sophisticated and understated melodrama about an incredibly complex character
","In 2002 Nicole Kidman played one of the most memorable portraits of an author ever committed to the screen. Her introspective rendering of the troubled genius that was Virginia Woolf gave us an insight into the thought and literature of that great woman. We saw, through Kidman and the ensemble cast, the effect of one of Woolf's books, and a token of the rarefied insight she had made into human relationships.Woolf, like Truman Capote, changed the course of literature by developing a new way of writing: with Woolf, it was 'stream-of-consciousness' Â– and with Capote it was the 'non-fiction novel'. Like Capote, Woolf remained isolated within her world, but in her case the isolation was created by mental instability and a society that was unready or unwilling to embrace her ideas (such as women's liberation). Capote's isolation was maybe due more to his own unresolved personality issues, to being badly treated as a child, and then finding that he did not 'fit' in the socialite world he inhabited; but mostly it was due to the conscious way that he approached his writing.Capote is a slow, multilayered, sophisticated and understated melodrama about an incredibly complex character, and is brilliantly accomplished. It avoids the pitfall of trying to sensationalise the visually uninspiring action of typing or writing, but equally circumvents placing the 'creative process' into some stereotypical niche. The film is less of a biopic than an exploration of a mind, and the commonality between the mind of Capote and that of the convicted criminal he is writing about. On another level, it is about moral dilemmas of journalistic research and, on yet another, the psychology of the killer.While glancing through a newspaper looking for ideas for a short story or article, Capote happens upon a report of a good, decent family in Kansas that have been cold-bloodedly murdered. He gains access to police reports and eventually the murderers as they are apprehended. One of them, Perry Smith, is literate and intelligent. Moreover he had a difficult childhood. Whereas Capote was fairly well-to-do, Smith had fell in with a bad crowd Â– he was from the 'dark underbelly' of America Â– people that respectable folk knew little of and cared even less. Capote spots details the police miss Â– why was a pillow placed under the head of the victim before being shot? Capote realises there is enough information for a major novel. He works Perry for details, examines the corpses, studies police photographs, and even achieves a delay in the sentence while he finishes researching. We start to see his methods and his remarkable mind. One of his party tricks is to demonstrate that he has '94% recall of any conversation', observing and recalling the minutest detail. He studies people, he sees their motivations, he asks himself why, and often he automatically knows by logical inference. He does all this in a professional capacity as an author, accurately researching, but on the way it gives him immense power, of which he is also aware and doesn't hesitate to use.When Capote receives a standing ovation for a preview reading of his book we see him barely able to contain his emotion Â– he wants to be acknowledged Â– needs to be acknowledged Â– and it is a driving force that is also an overriding obsession: he will write the book of the decade, it will be a literary masterpiece (modesty is not something that troubles him), but he also needs to write it to feel wanted. It mirrors the need felt by Perry in a diary entry where has written an acceptance speech 'just in case' anyone ever recognised and thanked him for something.Capote uncovers a beautiful human side to Perry, one that is at direct odds with the murderer mentality. We can see 'there but for fortune' (or if nurtured) Perry might have become a writer or artist. Should such information have been used to commute the sentence? Was the murder really 'in cold blood'? How such contradictions exist and their implications are realised too late.But Capote is especially susceptible to his own discipline, as he has ignored his own need for friendship. Even at the greatest triumphs of fellow authors who support him, he is oblivious to their success, unable to join in their celebrations, just getting drunk and wallowing in his own self-torture because the stars of his book have not been executed. Why fuss about the trivial achievements of others? (including some not-so-trivial successes, such as To Kill a Mockingbird). Capote's self-obsession and fixation with writing the novel of the decade is total. In ignoring his need for friendship, Capote is at the mercy of the fact that he professionally wants, or wanted, someone who was close to him executed. He has missed out on the joy of giving that is at the core of friendship Â– genius is not enough.Philip Seymour Hoffman as Truman Capote has pulled off a triumph of acting that goes beyond a simple life story. He has brought the genius and the misery of Capote to the screen in a way that is more transparent than one could hope for in the depiction of such a multifaceted and unusual person. Catherine Keener, as the ever-supportive Harper Lee (To Kill a Mockingbird), is a superb balancing act. Her character is the opposite of Capote, empathetic, warm, and endlessly forgiving of his faults. Keener does an admirable job Â– and as self-effacing a one as her character might.Like 'The Hours', Capote comes across as a labour of love and one eminently worth the trouble and several viewings. But the lessons we can take from it are less about the greatness of Capote and more about his shortcomings. As he was later to recall (in the midst of the terminal decline that set in after the novel was published) more tears are shed over answered than unanswered prayers.",9,3,4,27 February 2006
Lost in Translation," There's more than one way to find yourself . . .
","There's more than one way to Â‘find oneself', but many of them involve taking oneself away from the slipstream of daily life, the never-ending succession of familiar things, faces, events and corresponding thoughts Â– the sum total of which we often, for shorthand, think of as Â‘our life'.Crossing the desert alone, quite literally, or spending hours in meditation, are two ways of going to a place where one becomes intensely aware of one's own limitations, one's own Â‘self.' Another is immersing oneself in a traumatically alien culture.This is exactly what director Sofia Coppola's characters do in Lost in Translation Â– although hardly with that intention.Bob (Bill Murray) is a film star who has been paid a huge sum to go to Japan to endorse a whisky. Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is a young philosophy graduate who is accompanying her photographer husband. Both are fish out water, isolated by their own sincerity and the barely intelligible culture gap, and trying to make sense of their lives.The film is adept at avoiding clichÃ©s. Much is left unsaid. The inner struggles of the characters are portrayed more in what they don't do/say than what they do do/say (although some suitably deep ideas penetrate the silences and underline the substance of what is going on). Moreover this is a rare glimpse of modern day Japan Â– from the high-tech intensity of Tokyo to the more tranquil beauty of Kyoto. Instead of being thrown into a mythical past or mad kung-fu scenes, we are confronted with the incomprehensibility of institutionalised karaoke, picture menus in restaurants that convey little about the food (often the photos are photos not of the food but of plastic mock-ups of the food), hectic TV that seems almost a caricature of itself, vigorous but ill-informed attempts at Western politeness, and very wordy sentences that somehow get condensed into a single phrase when Â‘translated'.The characters reactions to all this are very much like my own were on my two or three trips to Japan. In spite of its attempts to learn western ways, it is one of the most culturally isolated countries in the world. If anything, the alienness of Japanese life is toned down in the film, not exaggerated. After a while, you just feel like crying out for something, anything, that is vaguely western, vaguely recognisable.This incongruous setting is the backdrop for a moving tale of a sensitive friendship between two strangers. Nothing is polished up to make it more entertaining: the realism of the engaging characters, who come to realise that less in their lives can be more, makes it a major cinematic achievement. It is not mainstream, but many audiences will be deeply moved, and rightly so.",9,0,1,20 January 2004
The Devil Wears Prada," When a 6 is the new 14
","Meryl Streep has complained that there are not enough deeply committed roles for women her age, and effectively she is reduced to playing heartless old women. But if The Devil Wears Prada is anything to go by, it is a refreshing opportunity for Streep to reinvent herself, in a style that has a light surety of touch without the embarrassing lingering 'Oscar-worthy' moments that had become almost a clichÃ© of her older films.Streep plays Miranda Priestly, the head of a fashion magazine called Runway which is the approximate equivalent to Vogue. Not only is the setting convincing (with several real life top models), but this witty, light-hearted comedy is casually decorated with everything from Prada and Galliano to an especially designed Valentino dress (Valentino has a small cameo as himself) and Chanel's 2006 couture collection made available exclusively for the film.Meet Anne Hathaway (Brokeback Mountain) as Andy, a bright young graduate and would-be journalist. Struggling to get a job in her chosen career, she applies to work at Runway Â– a magazine she doesn't read, run by a grande dame of the fashion world she's never heard of and who is guarded by career-minded Emily. She is, in the words of Runway's fashion director, a 'sad little person'. She has a job a million girls would kill for, doesn't realise it, and looks totally out of place. Her boyfriend jokes that it must have been a telephone interview.You could be forgiven for thinking this was going to be a re-working of Working Girl, where the brains and flair of a dumb junior win the day, yet The Devil Wears Prada is neither as slapstick nor as simplistic as the earlier hit. Streep is an ogre, but not a bad one, just supercharged, brilliant at her job, and something of a legend. Anne Hathaway, on the other hand, wears smart clothes from cheap shops Â– at least until she gets the predictable make-over Â– and her head and heart is lured by fashion rather than finding their life-goal knee deep in Jimmy Choo boots. Avoiding the devil is not so much about who and what but about being true to yourself. Possibly not since Funny Face, the Audrey Hepburn and Fred Astaire classic, have the irresistible dynamics of the fashion world been so glamorously, temptingly and captivatingly portrayed.Director David Frankel is better known for several episodes of Sex and the City, and here carries that show's flair for believability of New York's fast movers to new heights. The script has so many cuttingly funny one-liners that you never get a moment to notice it has very little depth. Acting and characterisation is first class, there's a great soundtrack that always seems in perfect keeping with the plot, and the page-perfect ending is neither cheesy nor trite. Streep's greatest moment is perhaps the time we see her without make-up, going through a difficult personal time, but it is still an ensemble performance with the other two leads, something that has served her well ever since her remarkable triple billing in The Hours.It is an image of power and materialism that has no bad guys Â– or women - only ones that want to get to the top. Director David Frankel comments that fashion 'is a constant pursuit for reinvention. It's both what's so great and so awful about fashion. For fashion to succeed, it has to make all of us feel that everything we have and wear is inadequate.' This battle of the glamazons takes no prisoners, and even Andy's scoffing friends are mesmerised when she hands out cast-off designer goods. Faust has never looked so good. As for Andy, we are kept guessing whether she sold her soul the day she put on her first pair of Jimmy Choos.",8,0,1,21 September 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Brilliant CGI's that go on long enough to send you to sleep aaahhhh . . .
","(3/10) Star Wars II was predictably bad. The special effects were up to the high standard of the original and it was visually very nice, but George Lucas can't write scripts for toffee. Looking at the bio for co-scriptwriter Jonathan Hales - a string of made-for-TV spin-offs and the Scorpion King - one gathers he wasn't much help either - sadly we are to be sentenced to more of this collaboration on SWIII. Perhaps Ewan McGregor will have invested some of his relatively new found wealth in acting lessons by the time shooting begins in 2003? (He left London's Guildhall School of Music and Drama before even graduating). McGregor's boy-next-door Scottish charm is ok to land some nice juicy parts but I would like to see him play someone other than McGregor now he's got them. I can barely distinguish the 'lovable' McGregor in Moulin Rouge from the vocally-challenged McGregor in Black Hawk Down or the now-I-get-to-play-a-super-hero McGregor in  Clones Attack. Maybe they are all clones. Maybe Lucas will ask the Wachowski (Matrix) brothers or James Cameron (Terminator, Aliens, Strange Days) or even Iain M Banks to help him write a script. May pigs will learn to fly like cgi's . . .",3,2,5,10 June 2002
Bridget Jones's Diary," Empty-headed but likeable
","Don't expect too much and you will probably be delighted. RenÃ©e Zellweger turns in an excellent performance as the single woman old enough to feel she should be seeking a life partner. Essentially perhaps a woman's movie (many jokes that a man might need explained) it is generally however an accessible, light-hearted comedy and a better (if not outstanding) as a film that the popular but overly-lightweight cult novel. Hugh Grant, as one of her suitors, turns in a predictable but amusing performance in his undemanding role and the movie manages to prattle on for over an hour and a half without once getting boring.",6,0,0,29 April 2001
The Bourne Ultimatum," Leaps across clichÃ©s as easily as buildings - but entertaining anyway
","Don't you just love a good action thriller? Maybe with Matt Damon as the unassuming CIA agent - again, in search of his lost memories. Earlier episodes showed us brainwashed Jason Bourne (Damon) in search of answers or exacting revenge. In Bourne Ultimatum, he wants answers with a capital 'A'. And the CIA want to kill him off. Director Paul Greengrass (United 93, The Bourne Supremacy) is to be applauded for keeping this series alive in the face of fresh James Bonds or smug Mission Impossibles. And although the Bourne Ultimatum is spy-thriller-by-numbers, it is still a polished production and does keep you on the edge of your seat for the length of the movie.All this comes at some cost. Bourne leaps from roof to roof of conveniently spaced buildings with the same ease that he traverses worn clichÃ©s and the well-established Bourne plot. A pretty world tour of photogenic hot spots will have an establishing shot of say, London Eye, followed by hectic chases captured by hand-held cameras. Generic shortcuts are acceptable as long as we are being entertained. If we get time to catch our breath, we can even enjoy spotting some.Â· Cars, even modern ones, and motorbikes, can invariably be started by touching two conveniently located wires. These also neutralise the steering column lock. But it's only a movie Â– we need such things.Â· As the high tech CIA computers locate their prey, they will make little chirping noises. This is in case we miss any plot development. The same computers explain what's happening in large type, in case any visually-challenged observers miss the point.Â· Jason Bourne accurately judges the space between two buildings when taking a running jump. This is acceptable as we expect the hero to survive.Â· Vast numbers of innocent bystanders' cars will be trashed in each location. The newspapers don't notice anything amiss until needed for our story.Â· Top journalists won't use shorthand (because then we couldn't follow their notes).Â· When a highly trained hit man appears, he will pause long enough to be talked out of it. Highly intelligent Jason Bourne will always witter long enough to bad bosses to gloat about his real location. So they can come back and look for him in their office. This provides enough wry humour to make him likable.As you can gather, The Bourne Ultimatum is one of those spy-flicks that looks great first time round and far too silly to ever watch again. It's point is to entertain you at the time. The CIA has been updated to look slightly out of control Â– Jason's hunters also handle borderline illegal stuff like renditions. Britain has more CCTV cameras than anywhere else and this is handy for the CIA that can instantly control all of them.Julia Stiles maintains a nice unrequited love interest without make up or low cleavages (the Bourne trilogy is aimed at 'intelligent' viewers). Paddy Considine, deprived of the larger roles he had in Summer of Love or Dead Man's Shoes, is swept along convincingly Â– his acting shining all the more when he doesn't say too much. Acclaimed veteran Albert Finney has one of the best scenes as he calmly stalls our enraged Jason. Cinematography uses effective contrasts between open spaces, close combat, and all the great locations that money can buy.'You start down this path and where does it end?' asks spy-boss with-a-conscience, Joan Allen. Paranoia aside, I fear it will be more movies of this ilk: definitely worth the price of popcorn but just as disposable.",7,0,1,4 September 2007
The Aviator," Scorsese is on form with this exciting biopic
","The Aviator traces the life of millionaire businessman, film producer, film director, and aviator, Howard Hughes, paying particular attention to his middle years as a record-breaking aviator and movie mogul.With nearly three hours of viewing time, The Aviator has quite a lot for your money's worth. Fortunately, most of it is gripping enough to keep you fascinated to the very last frame. Scorsese seems to have documented much of Hughes life very accurately, focussing on his exciting involvement in aeroplanes and film-making, rather than the murkier world of his behind the scenes involvement in politics, and stopping before he gets too bogged down with Howard Hughes the weird recluse.With a host of stars, Leonardo DiCaprio pulls off the title role admirably, the likes of Kate Beckinsale (as Ava Gardner), John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin, and Ian Holm all put in good work, and the delightful cameos of Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow and Jude Law as Errol Flynn keep things moving nicely; but the show-stealer for me was re-creation of screen legend Katharine Hepburn by Cate Blanchett, whose character comes as a vibrant breath of fresh air against a backdrop of fairly right-wing, power-seeking individuals.In The Aviator, Scorsese has found a subject who is nothing if not interesting. Howard Hughes set revolutions rippling through Hollywood, making - at the time - the most expensive movie ever produced, and his attention to detail is one that Scorsese perhaps admires and even successfully emulates. As an aviator, Hughes pioneered new engineering techniques with almost fanatical zeal, not only breaking most known airspeed records but introducing along the way countersunk rivets and retractable landing gear to reduce wind resistance and so make planes go faster. His own involvement was charismatic Â– he would fly the planes himself, often risking life and limb, whether to test new prototypes or, even in earlier years, to do dangerous stunts in his films. His brushes with the censors (he created the half-cup bra for his protÃ©gÃ© Jane Russell) add further colour to what was already an over-the-top lifestyle, and the fact that he often actually succeeded, even when taking on big business or the government, prevent him from being dismissed as a mere playboy.Howard Hughes also had some sort of mental aberration, expressing itself as phobias to obsessive behaviour, but the film manages to suggest, to me at least, that his illness may even have helped him towards greatness rather than making him accept and adapt to a more normal level of achievement. But as is often the case with Scorsese, there is no underlying philosophising, no artistic flights of fancy, no deep questions asked or answered. What we do have is good story-telling, and it would perhaps be a bit mean and overcritical to say the result is a bit flat or unimaginative.As traditional Big Picture movie making goes, The Aviator is a success, and will no doubt garner many awards and delight audiences for years to come.",7,1,3,8 January 2005
Watchmen," Mental, ethical and visual overload?
","I wouldn't easily believe that yet another movie could squeeze a tear from me to the tune of The Sounds of Silence. In The Watchmen, a coffin of a murdered, unloved anti-hero is lowered into the ground. But the scene is juxtaposed with images of the U.S. in Vietnam, bringing to mind the terrific human sacrifice of that war.What makes the song more poignant is the silent message. The film has rewritten history so that America achieves greater triumph in the war - with the aid of a super-being, Dr Manhattan. We are asked to mourn heroes victorious in death. But we know the reality to be much sadder.Music is used throughout The Watchmen sparingly but always to great effect. Comfortably seated in the cinema, I thought I was still watching trailers as the film started. As an extremely unrealistic fight unfolds I make a mental note to avoid whatever film is being touted. But as the credits gather pace I struggle to come to terms with whatever is about to begin. In rapid succession, JFK is assassinated, Warhol heralds the pointless as fashionable, someone lands on the moon, Bowie ambles along outside a gig in a Ziggy Stardust mask and . . .Masks. Always fashionable. In arts, literature and crime. Who can deny the lure of being anonymous? The flirtation for which you don't have to account. The character greater than yourself. For good or evil, masks are a liberation.Suddenly Dylan's gritty, Times They Are a-Changin' cuts across the confusing tableau of history and fiction and we realize a joke is being played. The mask slips. We don't have to take it all so seriously. A grotesque ensemble of police officers pose for the camera. They will develop into a new breed of crime fighters to carry on where the police leave off. Eventually, as our story gets into full flow, they have evolved into 'The Watchmen' and one or two have picked up superpowers along the way. Dylan's compositions feature again later in the film with Hendrix's blazing All Along the Watchtower cover and end with a barley recognizable punk cover of Desolation Row by My Chemical Romance.The film combines comic-strip with film noir. Â¨The streets are extended gutters and the gutters are full of blood.Â¨ It's almost a Sin City with real people. It's a city that, Â¨screams like an abattoir full of retarded children.Â¨ And the city is a pre- clean-up New York, though our tale will take us to Antarctica and Mars as the world hovers on the brink of nuclear war.The Watchmen excels at defying expectations. If director Zack Snyder's previous offering, 300, was a little one-dimensional, The Watchmen almost suffers from the opposite. The film squeezes (with a few alterations) a dozen apocalyptically awesome comic episodes into a mammoth story, preserving much of the original's intention to question our assumptions about superheroes or the black-and-white nature of good and bad. Intellectually and graphically, it is comic-strip for adults.But although Snyder has pulled off a remarkable achievement, The Watchmen almost suffers from the excess of its own success. The 'wow' factor is maintained for almost three hours and with little breathing space. Ham-acting is mirrored against genuine tear-jerking moments. Dialogue is edgy. Special effects are sheer brilliance. But after a couple of hours I was almost suffering from adrenalin overload. There were any number of moments when the credits could have rolled and I would have applauded an excellent ending. Not that any footage is gratuitous or wasted. Snyder hammers his points home as our sympathies are pulled by different arguments and different Watchmen. Can moral righteousness have a point if it doesn't work? Is there an alternative to a cynical view of man's animal nature? The questions are asked without once being patronizing or overly simplistic. But the experience may leave you somewhat exhausted.",8,1,9,8 March 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Star Wars eat your heart out
","If you don't know the story you obviously haven't done enough hash as a child. Go and see the movie instead - you are unlikely to be disappointed.

Cold Mountain," Another triumph for Nicole Kidman
","Another triumph for Nicole Kidman Â– in this one she plays the long suffering sweetheart of a man she knew for only moments (Jude Law) and who has gone off to fight in the Civil War. There are plenty of realistically bloody scenes tracing this troubled period of American history, but Cold Mountain is much more than a war film. Kidman is the daughter of a preacher Â– she can play piano and speak several languages but is poorly equipped to look after herself when times get hard. Zellwegger plays her down-to-earth companion and saving grace and as such is a revelation. Jude Law's character as a Â‘moral' soldier is an interesting one, as his long journey, physical and emotionally, against many difficulties. This epic tale tells not only of the torments of facing very alien scenarios unprepared, but of a love that spans several years of separation, based on next to nothing, and yet is the guiding light giving hope to the future. Kidman rises to the challenge and delivers another memorable performance. She is backed up by superb ensemble acting and fine storytelling, beautifully adapted to the screen.",8,1,1,18 January 2004
Little Miss Sunshine," Outstanding comedy that also asks serious social questions
","No-one talks about the more outrageous side of family life - we pretend it doesn't exist, as if families are somehow just 'naturally happy' together. Yet it is in the strains and stresses of family life, surrounded by a deep notion of tolerance and underlying love even when you can't stand each other, that the closenesses, the true values of family are born.'Instead of making a movie about family values, we wanted to make a film about the value of family.' Little Miss Sunshine Directors, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris say they are frustrated by the 'ridiculous notion of the nuclear family,' which has become so prevalent in the US and the UK.The family of Little Miss Sunshine (which is the pageant title of the youngest member, Olive) is pulling apart at the seams. Dad / Richard (Greg Kinnear) is a hopelessly optimistic motivational speaker, trying to market his 'Nine Steps to Success' and also forcing it on his family at every opportunity. His Nietzsche-reading son, Dwayne, has taken a vow of silence until he gets into Air Force Academy. 'Pro-honesty' mother (Toni Collette) is constantly harried by her families eccentricities and secrets, especially after her brother Frank comes to live with them, a Proust scholar straight out of hospital for attempting suicide after being jilted by his gay lover. Into the mix comes Granddad Alan Arkin, a foul-mouthed hedonist, kicked out of retirement home for snorting heroin.Olive, the speccy, unlikely-looking and eponymous would-be beauty-queen, throws the family into turmoil when suddenly awarded a default place in the competition as someone else drops out. In one of the most unusual road trips ever, the family travel to the pageant through tragedy and comedy and a finale that will change the way they see themselves and make us ask questions about our own values and ideals.Little Miss Sunshine is a hilarious comedy with a refreshing honesty and ability for self-examination rarely found in mainstream movies. As it began, I though, 'not my kind of movie - kids? Road trip? Light comedy? No way!' But soon I laughed till I cried, in spite of myself, and I also felt quite moved. Little Miss Sunshine works very well as a comedy, a side-splitting celebration of human eccentricities, but there are also deeper issues that can be explored through the film. The pacing is excellent (I waited many a scene to see the end of the slogan on Dwaye's T-shirt that begins, 'Jesus was . . . '). How are the ideas of Nietzsche (Man and Superman) going to coalesce with those of Proust (a loser that spent 20 years writing a book hardly anyone wanted to read, but is regarded as one of the greatest writers in the English language?) So many puzzles, so many excellently honed laughs.Director Valerie Faris helps me make sense of it: 'I have to credit the writer for putting all those things together. His (Michael Arndt's) brother is a literary scholar; so much of that character (Frank) came from him. But the thing I love about all these characters is that they all have a dream, a universe they've built, and it makes them bigger than the clichÃ©d characters. Frank has a life you can imagine reading Proust, he was very much in his head, it was an intellectual life, and his challenge is a family where there isn't much intellectual discussion going on. He's brought right down to earth, so it's that distance that he has to travel that is the major thing.'Nietzsche's idea of transcending, for the teenager, who feels trapped in the mundane existence of suburban family life - it just shows that he's longing for something more. All these characters, they were passionate, full of longing. Just that they are reading Nietzsche or Proust tells you something.' The individual aspirations of the characters - and how they are so far apart - are one of the charismatic things about the film. Co-director, Jonathan Dayton adds: 'It's their passion, their aspiration. That's what we loved about them. Whether you have an innate interest in Nietzsche or Proust, what's most important is the fact that you're engaged; you're seeking greater answers and reaching to understand life in a new way: then to see their hopes dashed in so many ways, and to understand what endures after failure or disappointment. They have a world that is bigger than the immediate story.' I asked if it helped that all the family were pretty intelligent people, quite articulate. 'These are all smart people, but I think it's that notion of emotional intelligence. They are all passionate, and in that passion they recognise fellow travellers, even though Frank and Richard are as far from one another as you could ever be, but they are both passionate about their pursuits.' Whether you see Little Miss Sunshine just with the adults in your family or group, or watch it on DVD with younger family, it is a valuable and hugely entertaining film that has some beautiful emotions under the shouting. Don't be put off by the trailer, which is not very well made and doesn't give an idea of the film.Little Miss Sunshine took five years to make and will be delighting audiences for much longer than that into the future. It may help America reconsider the slightly worrying practice of beauty pageants for tiny tots, but it is an awesome social comment on the value of families while we are being laughing uncontrollably into our popcorn.",8,2,5,29 August 2006
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Perhaps one of the best sequels ever.
","Can Arnie hack it a third time? You bet! - and in one of the best sequels ever. (minor spoilers follow).Whilst building on T1 & 2, Rise of the Machines is also a self-contained film in its own right.John Connor, now in his early twenties, is being pursued by a female terminatrix android from the future, determined that he will not live to defeat the machines in the post-apocalyptic endgame. He teams up with Kate Brewster (Clare Danes) who is also to have a key part in saving mankind's future, whilst Arnie comes back as a re-programmed terminator to defend them both.For fans of Episodes 1 and 2, Rise of the Machines fills in some necessary history, and does it well. For newcomers, this treat is no money-machine pap growing fat on the name of its predecessors: Terminator 3 is well scripted, well directed, and (as far as such one-dimensional characters require it) well acted. But the thing that really makes it is the excellent pacing and editing that keeps the suspense going through climax after climax. Of course it's still mainstream Hollywood - but, in the wake of so many brainless and nondescript CGI-overloads, this sequel stands and delivers",8,0,0,31 July 2003

","Traditional war movie, though a bit more PC than the old movies where the Germans were caricatures of psychotic monsters.

"I, Robot"," standard fare
","Given that the film is based on one of the major classics of science fiction literature, it perhaps needed a director who had more major achievement under his belt than The Crow (also by Alex Proyas). I, Robot is not as bad as it could have been: it is reasonable sci-fi fodder for the fans, but it lacks the intellectual ingenuity and artistic precision of Bladerunner, the vision of A.I., the cult status of The Matrix, or the originality of delivery of, say, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It has that money-spinning manufactured feel to it, the sort of thing you would expect from a former director of music videos (which Proyas is). There is enough substance there to keep the faithful glued but otherwise little distinguishing features. The story might have been a masterpiece - the film is very derivative and little more than a Saturday night entertainment feature.",7,0,0,8 August 2004
American Beauty," Ignore the hype to avoid disappointment
","Ignore the hype to avoid disappointment. A good movie, and a winner for Spacey. The characters are multi-layered, convincing, and full of surprises. It moves from human drama about dysfunctional families to a thriller and mystery over how the lead character dies (that's not spoiling it - the voiceover at the beginning announces that he only has a year to live). A bit less money spent on it and it would be the American equivalent of the European movie, acutely observed, natural-seeming characters as they go about their lives - a bit like The Ice Storm. But this movie develops beyond that - the character developments are clear cut and powerful - even unnerving. A film that seems destined for long-term greatness.",9,0,0,6 February 2000
The Patriot," Mel Gibson frees the world, part II
","Mel Gibson is just so patriotic - having no home of his own he vigorously defends everybody else's. Firstly he freed Scotland from the English in Braveheart, now it's the turn of the American colonies to be freed from the British yoke.'The Patriot' makes me realise how some English people might have been a bit offended at Braveheart (my heart being firmly in Scotland I couldn't see it at the time . . .) in WWII movies nowadays there's usually a few nice Germans. Unfortunately this political correctness doesn't extend to the lesser battles. One English officer feebly tries to have principles temporarily but gives up - anything more complex might have stood in the way of this grossly over-acted and underscripted little adventure epic.There's a few touching moments early on, but soon the audience wearies of the predictability of every scene, as rebel Gibson singlehandedly rallies the troops and drives the oppressors from American shores. There's even a few lines to show how, once the Brits are gone, slavery will probably be abolished as there will only be nice wholesome people left in this nice Little-House-on-the-Prairie country.In the follow-up, Mel Gibson is going to free Australia. This should be mostly a political sleight-of-hand, as I don't think there have been any battles, but no doubt if it becomes a problem they will rewrite history a bit. Then there will be Mel Gibson frees Hollywood. In this movie, he puts paid to independent cinema that has for so long stood in the way of decent capitalistic dominance. Children of the future will be able to buy 'Mel Gibson frees the world - the ten-volume DVD set.' Finally a genetically-modified Mel Gibson will free the world of Mel Gibson and cinema will be re-born.The Patriot: Popcorn fodder.",5,3,6,17 July 2000
The White Ribbon," Haneke produces his most timeless classic
","What do you do when you 'know' there is a very tangible threat but cannot point the finger? Recall, if you will, Jean. Julianne Moore's character in Crash: ' . . . and it was my fault because I knew it was gonna happen. But if a white person sees two black men walking towards her and she turns and walks in the other direction, she's a racist, right?' Or the dilemma of Islam in Europe. On the one hand, we are impelled to protect the rights of the vulnerable minority. Protect their beliefs. Their innocence. Everything decent within ourselves that we wish to respect and preserve in others. But on the other, we are terrified of the prospect creeping Islamic militancy. We teeter on the brink of racism. Islamophobia. If we risk the sacred humanity in others we attack it in ourselves. And what if all the indications are wrong? What if all our beliefs are wrong? What if all the words led us astray? Too late, we know we have to talk about paedophile priests. Too late, we know we should have talked about Hitler (in the days before, yes before, he was the Bad Guy). Or even World War One before it happened. There are times when we cannot accuse. Times when it will do no good. But still, as Lionel Shiver might say, there are times when we know, 'We need to talk about Kevin.' Haneke confronts the paradox of confronting the unimaginable. Not in the Hollywood sense of 'too scary to think about.' Just confronting something that is outside the ability of the imagination to foreshadow. In Hidden, the format was an intricate art house film that appealed more to the cinema geek. The cult viewer. A brilliant film â€“ but one you would probably need to watch at least twice before you could 'get it.' The White Ribbon is an altogether different genre. The mystery is laid out as carefully as any Hitchcock classic, albeit with the more restrained tones and iconography of Luis BuÃ±uel. There is not the surrealism of his Exterminating Angel, but the clearly delineated social restraints that refuse to acknowledge anything that does not fit, they are all there. A small village on the eve of World War One. A fierce Lutheran Protestantism that will admit no way of thinking unless it is true to the cornerstones of its faith. Ignorance poses as innocence. And the horrors that can spring from deeply ingrained discipline.Somehow, within a community where everyone knows and trusts each other, a series of very unpleasant incidents occur. A wire is strung to trip the doctor's horse. A disabled boy is brutally attacked. A woman commits suicide. Unexplained arson. The seeds of deadliest emotions are there in a society that allows for nothing except goodness.Haneke carefully details various forms of patriarchal enforcement of this goodness. It might be righteous anger or compassionate punishment. I recall my philosophy teacher at university saying how some things can be learnt but not taught. Then another professor's dismissal of Aristotle's virtue theory on the basis that it cannot be 'taught.' In this Haneke world of black-and-white moral righteousness, those characters who seek no more than a least worst option seem to come, quite logically, to an untriumphant end. A boy who wants to save a wounded bird. A schoolteacher who wants to reveal with gentleness that which force cannot uncover.With Funny Games, Haneke shocked with intruders. With Hidden, he forced us to confront a barely solvable mystery. With The White Ribbon, his greatest work yet, a simple story takes on universal proportions. No intruders. No outsiders. We can no longer take refuge in any system of 'universal truth.' Whether it be the science of our sense or the dictates of religion. We must learn as we grow. This White Ribbon is no fairy tale story. It has no fairy tale ending. All is logical. Just that you might never, ever, be able to prove it.",10,66,113,14 December 2009

There's some interesting performances, even if the editing is there to show the dancefloor moves to a perfection that might not have actually been achieved by Julia Stiles.

Two very powerful lead singers (Beyonce and Jennifer Hudson) to amaze you with their vocal ranges, and the sort of blockbuster publicity that makes going to see it almost an obligatory cultural event.Dreamgirls is intense, emotion-laden eye-candy, but will it satisfy your every wish? Curtis Taylor Jr (Jamie Foxx) is a car salesman bursting to get into the music business as a forward-looking manager at a time when the industry is about to change. At a local talent show, he hears the Dreamettes - young, full of ability, but not getting the breaks. He gets them a deal as backing singers for James 'Thunder' Early. Thunder's blend of soul and rock 'n' roll is at its height, but times are a-changin' and soon the girls are re-launched as The Dreams - at the same time as Thunder's career fades. A few jealousies and heave-hoes later, and they rocket to success.Dreamgirls relies on well-established techniques seen in MTV and director-writer Condon's earlier success, Chicago, to ratchet up emotional intensity. A song will start low key in an ordinary setting and modest musical backing, and then segue visually through more extravagant sets until it reaches an emotional climax with full orchestra and bright lights. At times it feels like watching a stage show. The devices are effective but formulaic to the point of being hackneyed. Many of the songs also feel like standard written-for-Broadway numbers, contorted lyrics being used to tell the story and the emotions that the players expect us to share.The story has little substance beyond the songs (and the posturing that goes with them), but this matters little if you want to be entertained in a way that demands no long/deep attention span, or if you want to nip out for more popcorn, or even turn away for a canoodle until the volume tells you to come up for air. The inclusion of many set stage productions as the girl-group tours enables ample opportunity for show-stopping dance sequences, fabulous lighting and costumes to die for.The film showcases two discoveries: one is that Eddie Murphy can work outside of comedy. The other is the remarkable talent of Jennifer Hudson (a competitor from the TV singing contest, American Idol) who demonstrates that she can stop you in your tracks as an actor as well as a singer.But having Hudson and Beyonce together has its problems as well as benefits. Both are remarkable singing divas. This has some relevance to the story since there is a certain rivalry between their characters, but in a movie about a girl-band that is meant to evoke images of groups like the Supremes, they are vocally two divas too many. The large proportion of songs show off their incredible individual vocal talents - but as leads rather than as harmonies. At times, it is maybe like having two high-intensity Aretha Franklins advertising the Dolby-Digital sound dynamics rather than having Ronettes, Stylistics or Supremes soothe the eardrums. The film is about a girl group, yet focuses almost entirely on its two strongest singers. In the absence of a story with depth, characters with substance, or a worthier tribute to an era that had more originality than this big budget production, I longed for a gentle, all-girl ballad.Dreamgirls contains all the talent that money can buy and more. It has more Academy nominations in its year than any other movie, but none of them in the major categories. So sad, but it lacks true greatness.",7,2,3,2 February 2007
Being John Malkovich," A cult classic, but don't take it too seriously!
","Quirky comedy about office workers who discover a secret passage that ends up somewhere inside John Malkovitch's head. They proceed to get into a hilarious gender-identity love triangle. Over-rated if taken as anything more deep, but entertaining. A cult hit.",6,1,2,27 March 2000
Spider-Man," If only all comic book heroes filmed this well . . .
","Spider-Man, the movie, knew what it needed to do and got on with it. As a sci-fi comic-strip action adventure adaptation this is one of the best. I am reminded of the tagline 'With great power comes great responsibility' when I see how vintage director has handled the special effects. They are colourful, emphasise the story rather than their own technical mastery and have a beauty to them that is almost choreographed in its appropriateness. Tobey Maguire, irresistibly cast as the young lad who grows up to discover he is 'Spider-Man' takes to the skies with all the joy of an adolescent with a new toy. Kirsten Dunst is melt-in-the-mouth as MJ. The transition from comic book to celluloid is effortless and an achievement within the genre, with the assistance of veteran writer David Koepp (Panic Room, Stir of Echoes, Mission Impossible, Jurassic Park to name just a few). Of course, Spider-Man, no matter how well done, is not everyone's cup of tea. Nevertheless, it leaves Batman, Superman and even X-Men standing.",7,1,2,10 June 2002
Jarhead," A rifle can be a possessive lover . . .
","Jarhead War movies and anti-war movies cover such a wide range that one can be forgiven for wondering what the latest offering will be. Left wing protest? All-American hero? Action-thriller? Historical? Often spanning several genres, our cinematic take on humanity's bloodiest of pastimes even throws up comedies and romances. Although the Gulf War film Jarhead can be taken as a critical comment on U.S. Marine core training (shades of Full Metal Jacket), a meditation on the pointlessness of war (humour akin to Catch 22), or one man's bird's-eye unexpurgated view (it's based on a real-life chronicle), its real focus (echoed at the beginning and the end of the film) is the psychological trauma of being a soldier, holding a rifle, living through a warzone and becoming, ultimately, so obsessed with that function that it never leaves you, even afterwards. 'Whatever else he may do with his life . . . he will always be a jarhead.' We've long known the terrible mental effects war can have Â– from the 'shell-shock' of World War One to the lingering horrors of Vietnam, but it was perhaps with the Gulf War that such concerns came so much to the fore and so openly - with the discussion of 'Gulf War Syndrome' and other effects. A 1996 Veterans Association study, for instance, reported that Gulf War vets were 50% more likely to die in a motor vehicle accident than military personnel not sent to the Gulf War. What Jarhead does, far more explicitly than, say, Full Metal Jacket or The Deerhunter, is make the link between training that might be likened to brainwashing, and the end result of a personality that is devoid of anything that can take back ownership after military duties end. 'Jarhead' refers to the marines having heads like empty jars that are filled with what they are told to be filled with. In psychological terms, the military gives a person a lot of skills that can be used outside, and a person signs up for it knowingly Â– these and many other features distinguish it from more 'evil' forms of 'brainwashing' - but the intentional breaking of the ego and re-building it in a manner to suit the military objective, whatever name we call the process, is a powerful and often permanent catharsis.Jake Gyllenhaal shines as the intelligent young recruit playing 'Swoff' (Anthony Swofford). He realises after a certain amount of mind-numbing humiliation that maybe he doesn't want to be a marine after all. His buddy (with a criminal record) is the opposite Â– and can't wait to 'kill something'. Many of the men are a rational 'in-between' and intellectually justify or genuinely love their job (although we wonder in the case of the staff sergeant, ably played by Jamie Foxx, if his glorying in the wonderful career and the unique opportunity of sights such as the oil fields on fire isn't reflected in the fact that he might not be fit to do very much else).The storyline is jumpy in parts, enlivened by escapades as the marines wait endlessly for action, but it is more than compensated by a brilliantly witty script and adaptation. The humour outshines the screen version of Catch 22 and captures some of the irony of Three Kings (scenes of burnt-out, fleeing Iraqi family cars) as well as the fact that the soldiers have little knowledge or interest in why they are fighting a war other than to 'kick some Iraqi ass.' Director Sam Mendes has scored another success that comments on dysfunctional almost as poignantly as his earlier American Beauty. As the returning troops ride a bus back home as part of a welcome brigade, a down-and-out Vietnam vet jumps onboard to congratulate them, peeling the veneer of success from scenes of banner-waving smiling girls. As the final credits fade, we hear the chant, 'All my life I've had this dream: to be a bad motherf*cker US Marine.' The film seems to say to us: 'Be careful what you wish for.'",8,0,1,16 January 2006
Collateral," Stylish film noir
","Over-used scenes on the subway and cat and mouse in a tall office block and comparatively minor flaws in what is otherwise a superb thriller from director Michael Mann (who made the similarly evocative 'Heat'). The story revolves around a taxi driver who is pulled into the tangled web of a trained assassin, much against his will. It is shot in DVD which enables Mann to produce very rich colours at nightime - not like the garish or washed out colours that are often what you get with celluloid night time shoots. It helps to produce a visually succulent but also very lovingly portrayed Los Angeles. The scene in the jazz club is so convincing you actually feel Miles Davis was there - and the subtext about jazz as a metaphor for life is one of the gems in what is generally a very tight script (about structure - but the important thing being the spontaneous melody that lies *behind* the tune). But the over-riding impact is from Tom Cruise, playing one of his memorable characters since his cameo in Magnolia. His performance is so convincing - he could be a role model for that type of bad guy.",8,57,97,3 October 2004
The Machinist," No doubt it will have its fans - even if just for Christian Bale
","A good film - just not one that I personally could feel strongly about. It's one of those 'what's it about??' movies - like Sixth Sense or Memento. It does a reasonably good job of keeping you guessing till the very end with Christian bale doing an excellent wasted, ribs-sticking-out, anorexic look. He works as a tool operator in a factory and believes everyone's out to get him as events seem to conspire against him. Shot in moody, bleached bluish tones and with some fabulously atmospheric scenes (such as when he takes a young boy on a '666 ride' ghost train at the local fair), Machinist will probably be a hit but by the time the explanation came I was personally no longer interested and didn't think it justified the story anyway.",6,9,18,27 August 2004
Control," Careers in a tightly controlled arc, where music biopic meets cinematic excellence
","Control, a biopic about a band from Manchester, is getting serious attention from around the world. Starting with an award in Cannes. That's maybe more than you might expect. Joy Division, a respected band of the 70s, are hardly a name on everyone's lips. And films made by ex music video directors about yet another load of rockers rarely raise eyebrows. So why is this different? Joy Division, for non-initiates, were a post-punk Manchester band of throbbing guitars and dark, doom-laden lyrics. Recognition in the music biz (especially by other musicians) was perhaps even greater after the death of lead singer, Ian Curtis. Control covers a period from his schooldays to his end in 1980 (aged 23). It is based on the biography of his widow.Control uses Curtis' love of poetry, as well as the more familiar songs-that-tell-a-story device, to provide at least scant insight into the music. 'I wish I were a Warhol silkscreen, hanging on the wall,' he muses. But what is dealt with in much more detail is his growing sense of isolation, coping with epilepsy as the pressures of touring build up, and the distraught domestic relations he is embroiled in with wife Debbie (Samantha Morton) and romantic-interest-from-afar Annik (Alexandra Maria Lara). 'It's like it's not happening to me but someone pretending to be me. Someone dressed in my skin,' he says.In a telling scene when he is under hypnosis, the camera revolves around his head as we hear voices speaking to him. 'Ian, let me in, love,' says his wife, 'there's room to talk.' Responsibilities as husband and father. A mistress who is also in love with him. A band and fan following who want more than he can give. From warholian, carefree screen-dream of youth, he has arrived at a place where he doesn't want to be. Drugs and their side-effects no longer a schoolboy's recreational laugh. Prescription bottles grip with morbid fascination. And the knowledge that doctors don't have a cure.The film carries viewers away with blistering intensity. Relative newcomer Sam Riley plays Curtis with alarming energy. With Samantha Morton, it's not what she says but what you see going through her mind. She contains her expressiveness for the camera to pick up (rather than thrusting it on us). We want to cry inside for her character. As a feat of interiorisation, Control puts her as a contender in the shoes of Meryl Streep.Supporting cast members come through with believability and sincerity, sparkling with well-honed contrasts. Toby Kebbell, fast-talking manager Rob, lifts us out of the depressive mood with wisecracks enough to make legless monkeys jump. 'Where's my Â£20?' asks a hapless stand-in as Rob deals with an emergency. 'In my f*ck-off pocket!' he barks back. Craig Parkinson is record producer and late TV presenter Tony Wilson (to whom the opening screening at the Edinburgh International Film Festival was dedicated). He demonstrates fine shades of teeth-gritting tolerance, explaining to the band, seconds before their first live TV show: yes, 'large dog's c*ck' counts as swearing, and would mean the broadcast is pulled. Established Romanian actress, Alexandra Maria Lara, succeeds in making Annik far more than the two-dimensional bit-of-fluff that would have been an easy course. As potential home-breaker, it is tempting to hate her, yet her character is shown with the intellectual appreciation and chemistry that Debbie can no longer offer.Morton, in the Q&A after the Edinburgh premiere, links the film to Saturday Night and Sunday Morning. It is the kitchen-sink, downtrodden existence that her Debbie inhabits. Cinematography is also reminiscent of this period, with its careful black-and-white observation of working class streets. I watched it a second time, enjoying careful compositions and suggestive mise-en-scene. But director Anton Corbijn is typically modest. 'I really wanted you to look at the actors on the screen and only afterwards at the look of the film.' While Ian, in Debbie's eyes, might be the licentious and 'angry young man' of social realism drama, the Control scenes from which she is tormentedly absent show another side: the world experienced by her husband (a reference in the film likens his isolation to Brando's character in Apocalypse Now).'And we would go on as though nothing was wrong. And hide from these days we remained all alone.'Riley takes on manic expressions as if marching away from an impending epileptic fit while singing Transmission. It is such a potent, almost frightening feat, that we have to shake ourselves to remember he only got the part when he was stuck for a job. 'Not a lot was going on in my life before this, so I was appreciative Â– for the work and the money,' he tells the opening night audience. 'I imagine this will have opened doors for you,' I had said to him earlier; he smiled like a man who still can't believe his good luck. But the 'luck' is very well deserved. His 'Ian' is physically and mentally complex. When I had managed to stop him on the Red Carpet long enough to congratulate him, Mr Riley explains that he had a friend who was an epileptic. 'I witnessed an attack often enough to be able to copy it.'Although the film has a driving energy that takes our breath away, it drifts a little towards the tragic conclusion. We know the ending and it is a case of waiting for it to happen. And although it features plenty of excellent Joy Division tracks, any music biopic will never be good enough or accurate enough for some fans.Fortunately this is not just for music fans but for serious film fans as well. It careers in a tightly controlled arc, where music biopic meets cinematic excellence. Why should you see it? 'Some people visit the past for sentimental reasons,' says Corbijn. 'Some people visit the past to understand the present better.' Control is not in the sentimental exercise category.",9,154,189,17 August 2007
Saw III," Not one of the best examples of the genre, but a bearable conclusion to the series for fans
","Most people who go to see Saw III will already know what they are letting themselves in for. A continuous helping of stylised gore, violence and torture where the only tongue in check will be one that is literally chained there in a macabre and psychotic trip that needs no justification other than an audience demand for video-nasty type scenes with the slightest pretence of psychological storyline to justify prolonged physical and mental cruelty that makes the Nazis look uninventive.The moral dilemmas seem pretentious in the extreme - a lovely doctor is forced to save a monster's life or be killed herself. A man bereaved of his son in a car accident has to 'forgive' all those vaguely involved to win his own redemption.As standard fare, Saw III delivers - no more and no less than Saw II (or The Hills Have Eyes or The Devil's Rejects and so on). Deranged serial killer, Jigsaw, devises complex games for his victims, often involving self-mutilation. Clues are left on cassette recorders, and the captives follow instructions to try and win a reprieve. Saw III reprises some of the themes and loose ends from the previous two movies, but stands up equally well on its own. Sadly, after so many films of this ilk have been made (particularly ones with the sophistication of say Hostel or Audition), Saw III loses much of its shock value and is little more than a late night gore-fest to wind up the series. The overuse of loud and jangling sound effects from the very beginning is distracting and unnecessarily sensationalist and I found myself weary within the first three minutes. You might want to concentrate hard as several lives are being tortured at once and separately, but all is joined up at the end by the bedridden mastermind (and if you were half asleep or drunk, he goes over the 'answer' more than once, slowly). This flesh ripping feast should not be attempted on a full stomach. Anyone tired of happy-slapping will doubtless get inspiration.",5,9,18,30 October 2006

Pearl Harbor," The Eat-As-Much-As-You-Like Movie
","At over three hours it's easy to see why the critics don't like it - they get bored - humdrum script, lousy acting for much of it, formulaic and predictable (and hey - they didn't pay for it!). For the rest of us, it's sort of good value for money if you like cheese, explosions, a nice love song, enough extras to repopulate China, and an indication that someone has spent an awful lot of dosh making a BIG movie to keep you awake long enough to work through one of those extra humungously big cartons of popcorn. Who cares if it's quality or not? Titanic won lots of Oscars and the critics didn't like that either. Pearl Harbor isn't up to Titanic standards, but it at least aims at that sort of scale. There's LOTS of big warships, LOTS of hunky naval officers, LOTS of beautifully made-up nurses-in-waiting, and OODLES of lovey-dovey triangular 'dilemma' stuff. Plus it's really easy to follow (quick synopsis - Japs bomb Pearl Harbour and bring Americans into World War II - geddit?) If you need to exercise your brain or artistic aspirations go and see Miss Saigon or read a book. Or you can always check out the Movie Gaffs websites to see some of the continuity errors and play spot-the-gaffe. (The bit where Ben Affleck makes his nose bleed with a champagne cork is cute - each time the camera cuts to his face the blood is there or has vanished or is back again!) If you want to go to the movees with a few friends who really aren't into films, go and see Pearl Harbor - they'll all think you're great for taking them to see a nice big blockbuster.",6,0,1,6 June 2001
Dirty Dancing," A cult milestone with substantial dance sequences elevating carefully delivered formula
","After the decline of ballrooms as a popular night out, partner dance enjoyed a revival with the rise of mambo and various forms of salsa in the USA. The eighties also saw an upsurge of partner dance in Britain with the development of 'modern jive', a simple dance that anyone could learn. Tapping into this enthusiasm comes Dirty Dancing (1987), a well-constructed if cheesy love story that has partner dance at its core. Fronted by the charismatic Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey, it also contains a note of rebelliousness that appeals to its teenage target audience.The opening credits (in luminous pink) set the tone with sepia shots of sexy dance routines, slowed down to emphasise sensuousness. The 60s Ronettes' song, Be My Baby, hearkens back to an era before the Beatles, before the death of Kennedy.'Baby' - the insultingly diminutive name for the heroine (played by Jennifer Grey) is a young girl ahead of her time. She can't wait to join the peace core. But for now, she is being whisked off to summer camp with her protective parents and her superficial sister, Lisa. 'Baby's going to change the world,' quips her father, whereas Lisa's going to decorate it.At the camp, glamorous female dance teacher Penny (Cynthia Rhodes) has the job of making staid dances (like line-dancing) look appealing to the masses. Baby however, chances upon the dance staff's private party, where a much raunchier dance is practiced. Johnny Castle (Swayze) is a downtrodden dance instructor from the streets. In contrast to the Harvard and Yale educated (and outwardly respectable) youngsters, he is labelled with an unfairly bad reputation, and with strict instructions not to flirt with guests. As Castle and Baby follow their hearts, each striving towards a moral high ground forsaken by society, they are drawn inevitably together.Why such a formulaic and much-copied movie has held such fascination is sometimes a mystery. Its strengths are the tightness of its construction and the first rate dancing abilities. With the gradual demise of mass of studio-based song-and-dance films associated with Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly, came a shortage of stars who could both dance well and act. Swayze not only had considerable acting experience but was born into a dance family and trained with the prestigious Joffrey Ballet School. As is evident from the companion (dance instruction) video, Swayze Dancing, he toned down his abilities as a dancer to play Johnny Castle, but still looks riveting.Mambo - which can be performed in a very erotic and sensual manner - is sometimes called 'diabolo' - the devil's dance. Unlike many dance-romance movies that followed, this film features many actual dance sequences, augmented by a spontaneous style of acting, but with the dancing obviously performed 'for real' rather than produced as a result of extensive fast editing cuts - as was the case, for instance, in films like Chicago (2002).The dirty dancing in the film is ultimately a mix of styles, principally mambo and showcase, and provided momentum for many of the popular dance schools of the time and in the years that followed. The film is part of the wave of 80s indie films that convinced the big studios to diversify and join forces with independents to capture teen audiences. Its sexiness, combines with a James Dean style defiance, appeals to male fantasies The sugary love, of strong girl nevertheless rescued-by-dashing-handsome-man, woos young women. While Dirty Dancing lacks greatness, its enduring strengths are too easily overlooked. If nothing else, it provided a template for dozens of lacklustre movies that emulated its song and storyline formula without emulating its strengths.",8,6,10,3 December 2000
The Butterfly Effect," Audacious blend and original storyline marred only slightly by clichÃ©d trappings
","We see Evan Treborn  as he grows up, from an early age suffering short black-outs during key traumatic events. It is a strange (and potentially dangerous) psychological condition that his father (now in a mental asylum) also suffered from. Tension, and mystification, grows - as we are also kept in the dark as to what happened during these pivotal moments. Evan's father, on reaching adulthood, learnt how to go back in his mind and actually recall events that had been previously blocked off. But what if you could not only go back and remember them but change what you did in those few moments? Those changes might well affect all those around you Â…
This fairly original and difficult premise is one that threatens to cross the genres - from psychological thriller to sci-fi to supernatural. For most of the film, poor Evan doesn't know what is happening and neither does the audience, but the tension and plot ingenuity are enough to keep you on your seat and guessing until some pieces start fitting - or erupting - into place. One of the most original of any 'alternative timeline' stories to come to the screen, the film's vision of what it wants to achieve almost seems too much to expect it to fulfil - but the increasing shocks, not to mention the emotional investment the main character achieves (in spite of fairly humdrum acting and a so-so script), keep the audience willing to put up with most things as long as there is going to be some sort of denouement. Whether that conclusion will completely satisfy you is another matter. Sci-fi fans will maybe accept it the way they accepted Donnie Darko. Psycho-Horror addicts that enjoyed Gothika may find this is a not dissimilar mix. Literary enthusiasts may even find it a lot more meaningful than, say, Sliding Doors, as it maybe has a lot to say about memories and how we deal with them. Changing one thing in our own reality has a ripple effect - a domino or 'butterfly' effect on everything else. We could take a moral from this and see how changing one thing inside us changes the rest of lives, especially how we perceive and shape the future and the lives of people we know and care about.Whilst a provocative piece of filmmaking, The Butterfly Effect is no masterpiece: writer/directors Bress and Gruber have some way to go before they can turn in such an ambitious project and satisfy both mainstream audiences and the critics. There are many who will write this film off as a gimmicky, clichÃ©-ridden example of supernatural nonsense that panders to the lowest denominator with violence, sudden shocks, animal and child abuse, mutilation, drugs and all the other fast-food ingredients so often demanded for a fun-filled evening at the cinema. Or you may, as I did, admire the sheer audacity of the story and give it some leeway. ***Spoilers*** The last two episodes of the film are the ones that, if any, give the film its more enduring relevance and meaning. They raise the question of what we do with memories, of how we 'close the door' on memories that haunt us - or face the ensuing psychological hell to which those memories can consign us. The film as a whole then also raises the question of responsibility for our actions.",7,1,4,14 April 2004
No Country for Old Men," Coens displaying their powers
","No Country For Old Men is almost like one of those Zen sayings. A frantic chase where nothing happens very quickly. A puzzle where the question is more meaningful than the answer. That sort of thing.As if to disprove the title, old man Tommy Lee Jones is very comfortable, thank you. He's Sheriff Bell. Takes everything in his stride. The rolling hills of the Texan border country. The challenges of living close to the land. The bad hombres. He's seen it all. He is the land Â– it can't get one up on him.Everyone one else has yet to reach this exalted state of initiation.Like Llewelyn Moss, who stumbles on a large number of banknotes, cocaine and people who have ceased living. The bodies died naturally Â– at least in the noir-ish vernacular of the movie. Natural to their line of work. As attested by the large number of bullet holes.Or Anton Chigurh, the most philosophical of our characters. He hunts down prey with less room for mistakes than The Terminator. He is completely at peace with what he does. And human too Â– sometimes he will give a victim a chance to life based on the flip of a coin.Now Carson Wells is above all this. He wears a nice suit and talks like a senator when he goes about his clean-up business. Messy details like Anton being his business.Carla, thankfully, is quite human. And quite worried Â– if not a little excited Â– when husband Llewelyn suggest they will be better off - with the two million dollars he happened to find when out hunting. But who is better at keeping promises Â– loving hubby or homicidal Anton?No Country for Old Men is the Coen Brothers at the height of their film-making powers. Although the story is superb, we are held in suspense for the end of each double entendre. Was it a true story? At one point the sheriff, to inspire Carla to help him, tells her an unlikely but rousing tale about some neighbours. Later on though, she begins to doubt and asks him if it was a true story. 'I couldn't swear to every detail,' he tells her kindly. Then, with a bit more of a glint in his eye, 'But it's certainly true that it is a story.' If the story and dialogue are arresting, the photography is even more so. We watch with fascination as Anton calmly and methodically does something with balls of cotton. What is he up to? The camera works in loving detail, framing each action in close-up. The result will probably be hilarious or horrific. We are dying to know which, but we have to wait for the camera to tell us in its own good time. Llewelyn is just as mysterious hunting down some tent poles. The hardware store kindly offers to order the correct ones for his tent, but we know he wants them now. Desperately. Realising he's not going to get any, he asks for a tent instead. What sort of tent? The one with the most tent poles of course . . .This Coen-esqe humour continues unabated throughout. It is supported by characterisation and acting that is little short of awesome. Javier Bardem (Anton) is the year's best psychopath. Woody Harrelson always brightens up a movie by the sheer force of his personality. But if there is a flaw it is maybe a lack of emotional substance. One comes out of the film dazzled by the technical perfection, trying to remember the jokes, recalling favourite scenes and the way everything was framed as if in a masterclass. But it could have benefited, I felt, by more warmth. The glow that Frances McDormand brought to Fargo. Or the lip-synching of George Clooney in O Brother Where Art Thou that made you want to jump out of your seat and join in.Non-cinephiles may feel it is a bit too self-consciously artistic for a crime story. Why can't they just tell the tale instead of breaking their backs to be witty? And what exactly happened at the end? Film fans will adore this movie. A few people will wonder why they spent two hours watching it.I hope I've helped you decide whether it's for you or not.",9,1,6,3 February 2008
Mamma Mia!," Here we go again ...
","Mamma Mia! Does the mention of anything Abba-ish send you cringing to a corner? Or are you already joining in and dancing on the tabletops? Maybe another few drinks . . .In short, if you are not allergic to Abba, book your tickets now. If you are, why would you be reading this? At a pinch, it is worth seeing for Meryl Streep alone, who not only throws herself headlong into every refrain with unashamed gusto, but adds a touch of class and nuance to what otherwise could be a one-dimensional adaptation. Streep vacillates engagingly between playing herself and not taking herself too seriously. Pierce Brosnan just about keeps up, and manages more expressions than he ever did as James Bond. Colin Firth and Julie Waters trail behind somewhat. Yet Mama Mia! is a roller coaster of emotion, careering colourfully from the blue waters of the Adriatic, bursting 'like Aphrodite's Fountain' into the lives of Donna (Meryl) , her lovers and friends, and her soon-to-be-wed daughter. It is the party spirit that says kick your shoes off and sing silly cheesy songs. Altogether now.And yes Â– there's a story. Donna's daughter Sophie is getting married. To the buff-looking Sky. Only Â– where's her dad? She's never met him. A sneak-peek at Mom's diary shows Mom had three lovers before Sophie was born and Sophie secretly invites all of them. This is a film of threesomes. Three past lovers (Sam, Bill and Harry). Three close friends (Donna and two best pals). And, not to be outdone, Sophie meets up with two other young girls at the start of the film.The breakneck pace still allows for brilliantly put together shots. Like Streep doing a 'Titanic' with drapes blowing in the wind. Or a pier-load of young hunky stag night crew doing a dance in trunks and deep-dive flippers. Moonlit boats and beaches to 'I Have a Dream.' Filmed on location, the views won't disappoint. And like a favourite song whose ending we know, the drama is in the details and execution.As with many adapted-from-stage musicals, two young leads are played by talented singers, and the older parts by serious actors can sing well enough. Streep manages extremely well. Her performance is so professional and assured it leaves others standing. Fortunately, it is perhaps easy to paper over any cracks in musical comedy. Sweeney Todd relied heavily on Depp's charisma and stunning cinematography. Across the Universe, too heavily on the songs. Mamma Mia!, on the other hand, simply tailors everything to its joyous headlong rush. The songs fit naturally to the action. Streep even manages to sing them with her tongue firmly in cheek. She confesses to having been a 'stupid reckless little slut' but then says she 'grew up'. (To which her pals chime in, 'Well grow back down again!') The film is not without faults. There is a notable lack of chemistry between the people that throw themselves rapturously against each others' faces. Even Streep looks less than convincing in a brief lips-mash. And the men are a bit croaky in the singing department (Hugh Grant might even have been a preferable casting choice). And some of the time-line is wobbly. For instance, strange as it may seem, music from more than twenty years ago does not all come from the same era. So reminiscing about flower power (early sixties) in the same breath as a Johnny Rotten t-shirt (Sex Pistols, mid-late seventies) is either anachronistic or wishful thinking.Sadly, I am of a generation that can remember Abba-mania. The records would shoot to number one. Yet even then few people would admit to buying them. I used to manage a night club, and Abba was great music to ask a girl up to dance. My entire chat-up repertoire at that time consisted of, 'Would you like to dance?' and 'Do you want to come back for a coffee?' But girls would be so happy dancing to Mamma Mia they'd say yes anyway. I'd fall in love with a new girl each week. Ah, those were the days! Now there's a new generation of Abba fans who have no need to 'come out of a closet'. Abba is retro-chique. Even Madonna segued an Abba riff into one of her songs. From karaoke to hen nights. From '70s' nights to gay dance-floors. Dress up. Camp it up. Sing it up. Get sassy and cheesy. Or, if you're old enough to remember, fly back in time to wonderful memories.Mamma Mia!, whatever detractors might say, has been one of the most successful stage shows of recent times. Supported by the same director and original band members, the movie may well reach the similar fan bases. Or just the party spirit in all of us.",7,215,365,1 July 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Time capsule (or closet) from a bygone age
","The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is a slow-moving western. This in itself is unusual Â– westerns tend to be action pieces. The denouement is given away in the title, so there is no waiting to see how it will end. Instead, we are invited to spend over two and half hours examining the whys and wherefores. These are fairly involved but not inscrutable: Jesse James is hero-worshipped (almost homoerotically) by the rather limp wristed Robert Ford. Robbie joins the big man's band of bad guys, eventually gets fed up, and ends up shooting him in the back. End of story.It is one of those films billed as 'a psychological study'. Indeed, apart from some very nice photography, there is little else to study. Fortunately, Casey Affleck is up to the job and managed to make me squirm with every softly-delivered phrase. Jesse (Brad Pitt), on the other hand is macho, tough and straight (at least as low-down dirty, thievin', murderin' crooks go). And Jesse is brave. Robbie isn't. But Robbie would like the fame and adulation that goes with being brave.It is films like this that make Warhol's Lonesome Cowboys so hilarious. What do men, with strong sexual urges, no women, and cooped up with each other for hours and months in the wild west, do? Well, they discover their inner gay and have sex. Simple. So write a love story where sex just isn't gonna happen and you get enough psychoses to spin a nice yarn, some highly dysfunctional lives (it's based on a true story), or nearly three hours in the cinema.Pitt calls the film an 'anatomy of an assassination.' On that level, it is quite effective and recalls many a film noir where we have to work out why the victim was really killed. It's also a good example of how a common criminal can get to be portrayed as a dashing rogue Â– a persona many murderers, from serial killers to perpetrators of high-school massacres, possibly buy into. If this is a plus point of the film, the documentary-like way it is shot adds much. Great effort has gone into making even small details as authentic as possible and we genuinely feel as if we are glimpsing through a window into history. But I suspect that not everyone will have the patience to sit at this particular window that long.I have been at pains to point out that there is much to admire in this movie. Great acting, wonderful cinematography, and an eye for realism. But frankly, I'm pleased he shot him. Another hour and I would want to shoot them both.",7,1,2,15 February 2008
Tigerland," Worthy but sadly forgettable
","A none-too-original story of soldiers in bootcamp training to go to Vietnam. There's all the usual characters - the psycho-killer-soldier, the misfit, the bombastic commanding officer. Yet there are several things that distinguish Tigerland above the run of the mill. Firstly it's made on a tiny budget, secondly the acting and script (within the limits of the slender plot) are well done. The characters are well-etched and this film has a gritty realism that is lacking sometimes in classics such as Platoon. Unfortunately the entertainment value is low and this is a movie to be forgotten again quickly, however worthy. As a ps to the ladies (or gay male filmgoers) there's lots of nudity - most of it in the form of bronzed male butts.",6,0,1,13 June 2001
Batman Begins," The Comic Book coming-of-age
","The comic strip hero turned into celluloid has long had a bad press. Line-drawn fantasy heroes, recreated with all the emptiness of fathers whose only knowledge of the comic strip and its characters is something that amuses their children, the cinematic contribution from this source has almost entirely been superficial, banal, aimed at the intelligence of cosseted pre-teens, underdeveloped, undervalued, and essentially patronising.Remarkably, Batman Begins release date was very close to the seminal movie Sin City, in which the original creator was a co-director and was able to imbue the finished film with the depth, understanding and artistic integrity that is lacking from a cursory examination of the comic strip genre. Batman Begins does not have the deep respect for provenance that Sin City evinces, does not rise to the same cinematic heights, and is frankly not in the same club; but it is nevertheless in a league way above most of the Marvel Comic adaptations that have beleaguered our screens with very few objectives other than holding the attention of the family brood (with sugar and artificial flavourings) on the one hand, and (more honestly) making movie moguls Very Rich without even a nod to artistic integrity on the other.The film presents two visions of Gotham City. The first, as young Bruce Wayne (who later becomes 'Batman') is still a boy, and the second during his adult, fighting-of-evil incarnation. The first, some time in the near future, shows us a beautiful metropolis where Bruces' father (one of the city's rich and famous) is an altruistic entrepreneur that has successfully completed projects such as a cheap transport system for the city to help its poorer inhabitants. Later, we see it in its more nightmarish vision, a natural progression from the greed of the wealthy (the 'haves' and the 'have-mores' as George Bush once put it, and without a hint of compassion), and a massive underclass - unified only by corruption, drug cartels and organised crime (The influence of Bladerunner is very apparent). If you take the contrasts of present day Los Angeles and ratchet them up a bit - use the horrific and almost uncontrollable differential seen in cities like Rio de Janeiro for example - this bleak future outcome seems quite logical. It has been the staple of many science fiction films for years and the reason for its popularity may lie with the instinctive reality it suggests to the underclasses.Batman Begins may attract many viewers who wouldn't dream of seeing the old Batman and Robin or Superman movies - and so it should. Although it is unashamedly a money making exercise by Warner Bros (and a re-creation of the franchise - it bears no connection to the other 'Batman' movies), it has been delivered with commensurate style and artistic aspiration. The strong cast and crew give some inkling of what to expect: director Christopher Nolan is known mostly for his critically acclaimed modern-art style film Memento (about a man with short term memory loss and told in episodes equivalent to the length of his memory); the supporting actors - Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, Tom Wilkinson - are largely known for their astute choice of acting roles rather than sell-out trash.Batman is essentially a realistic character. As a young boy, the deep trauma of witnessing his parents' murder motivates him to become half vigilante, half hero. He spends his early years in extreme and unusual forms of training, mastering his body and emotions. Falling back on his family fortune later on, he is able to avail himself of cutting edge scientific developments (developments rather than gadgetry - for all the discreet nod to James Bond, his equipment is an essential and carefully constructed element of his operating persona, not cutesy add-ons). Towards the end (and it is perhaps a slightly over-long film), we enter the more stereotypical good-versus-evil battle, but it is well constructed, blending original action scenes with the inner pain of needing to conceal his true identity.The film is not without its flaws. Like many lesser comic-book adaptations, the characters are imbued with little emotional depth, and the script is often more of the level of Blade (which the scriptwriter previously worked on) than Bladerunner. But there is a very restrained use of CGI effects, a clear departure from dumbing down throughout, and all in all a film that adds to and ennobles the original vision rather than downgrading it. Batman Begins is one of the best mainstream movies of the year so far and highly recommended.",8,0,0,18 June 2005
Blue Crush," more of a surfing that a chickybabe movie, but easy on the eye anyway
","Attempts to do for surfing what 8 Mile did for rap music. Probably not quite so successfully, but the fairly seamless integration of state of the art photography and special effects creates some breathtaking surf scenes. The background story of local-surf-girl-made-good is predictable but relies less on Baywatch-type eye-candy than one would expect.",6,4,7,5 May 2003
Meet the Fockers," A knockabout comedy for effortless Sunday afternoon viewing
","What might have been a less than engaging follow-up to the fairly shallow if entertaining Meet the Parents, turns out to be reasonable fare, in large part due to the wholehearted performances by Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro and Barbra Streisand. Ben Stiller trundles along as the rather dumb son in law to be, having put off his wedding for fear of introducing the two fearsomely mismatched sets of parents.Robert De Niro is on quite reasonable form as the ex-CIA man who wants everything perfectly under control, ordered and predictable, including a son in law. As a failed lawyer and enthusiastic middle-aged hippie, Hoffman is married to Streisand who is a sex-therapist for seniors. Whilst the run ins of the two sets of parents are entirely predictable, they are carried off with such enthusiastic charm that it is hard not to get into the spirit of it and enjoy a few laughs. Considerably better than the lacklustre trailer would suggest, Meet the Fockers is a relaxing comedy that will fill most people's requirements for effortless Sunday afternoon viewing.",7,0,1,2 February 2005
The Chorus," No substance, but quite delightful
","A new supervisor at a strict boys boarding school for difficult children gets remarkable love and respect by teaching them music and getting the boys to form a choir. Sugary, unbelievable, but the script is deft enough to keep us interested all the way through. Touches of 'Amelie', the French are learning how to make American style confectionery-cinema. This is box-office fodder - nothing wrong with that - just that we have always expected something more of French cinema. But commercial hits can also pave the way for art by providing the necessary cash flow, and we can only hope that French cinema will not entirely disown its great cultural heritage. Meanwhile, this is entertaining in a minor scale. No substance, but quite delightful (and wonderful singing!).",7,6,17,20 November 2004
The Pianist," A monument to the things that never die
","What does a country have when it has nothing? When it has been decimated, razed, conquered, humiliated? I remember the question being asked and answered once when I was in Poland. The answer was, its art. The poverty of a nation has been transformed into a love and respect for their great artists Â– a sincerity that is apparent everywhere you go in Warsaw, from the Opera House to the Old Town. Figures like Chopin represent something that cannot be destroyed by bombs, by external powers, by materialism.What sets The Pianist apart from other Â‘holocaust' movies is this ennobling of art, the spirituality of music especially, which has the power to live on, even to cross barriers of race and hatred. In its final analysis, it represents a triumph of the spirit rather than another bleak and horrific account of the Nazi incarceration and obliteration of Jews.(contains some minor plot spoilers): The film's authenticity is movingly enlightened by Director Polanski's own experiences, which included escaping from a Nazi concentration camp as a child in WW2. Comparisons with Schindler's List (a film he turned down the offer of directing) are inevitable Â– yet in the Piano we see not only European cinema's attention for detail, of lovingly crafted scenes that sweep us away with poetic beauty and simplicity, and characterisation that has us truly believing in the individuals and feeling with them, but also a touching lack of bitterness: it is a German officer, moved by the purity of the Jewish pianist's music, that saves him Â– a scene that in other hands could have been rendered overly simplistic is given depth and grandeur by the skill of Polanski and a remarkable performance by Adrien Brody Â– as well as a fantastic story that has been based fairly closely on actual events.Szpilman (Brody) is a Jewish pianist who is ghetto-ised when the Nazis invade Poland. A frail and delicate man, he is ill-equipped to cope with the rigours imposed, or the political shenanigans his colleagues use to try and gain favour. His music is his continual companion. Interestingly, the music featured on the soundtrack during his incarceration is all (if I remember correctly) German Â– Bach and Beethoven. It is only when, as a feeble, starving and barely human derelict, the threat is finally lifted from him and he plays the music of Chopin from his beloved Poland. Gentle, fragile music that, in all its fragility, rises phoenix-like to win the respect of the oppressor. The Pianist goes immediately onto my all-time list of greatest movies and I'm already eagerly looking forward to a second viewing.",9,0,1,30 January 2003
The Transporter," Superficial as a car advert and as entertaining as hell
","Very much a 'guy's' film - where cars, especially BMWs, are the Most Important Thing in creation. Explosions and cool scenes come a close second, and chicks somewhere way down around the evolutionary significance level near a can of coke (iced coke, of course, with beads of condensation dripping photogenically down the side). Ex-marine cool dude hot shot no questions asked 'Transporter' delivers goods only to discover one day that his package is a live Chinese chicky babe. After a suitably empty-headed start she blossoms into super intelligent female with hot and sensuous afterglow. Plus, of course, she has a story to move the hearts of the world (she pouts a few white lies as she's telling it but there again she has an image to keep up after all!) Cool dude and hot babe take it in turns rescuing each other, all amidst creatively choreographed kung-fu scenes and sun-drenched French land and sea scapes. Heart of gold wins the day etc. Stylish, superficial, entertaining. (Especially if you like car adverts.)",7,1,2,19 January 2003
Revolutionary Road," Up there with the greats
","Revolutionary Road is an exquisite piece of serious melodrama. Much of the emotional depth relies on what we don't see. Don't hear. And don't have explained. Characters control their feelings rather more than American cinema would usually like them to. That, will hopefully put off many a teenage cinemagoer who would be bored rigid by a lack of explosions. A lack of over-acting. A lack of subject matter one can relate to without at least one failed marriage, one relationship you get up for but would rather not, and a long period where the choice between emptiness and hopelessness stretches out like a life sentence. Di Caprio an Winslet are reunited. This time, it's not Titanic that fails to reach its destination, it's the American Dream.Take a moment to recall a time when you had something all figured out. How everything would be just perfect. If only people would do it your way? Trapped inside individual visions of perfection, Frank and April communicate at emotional cross-purposes. They are an idyllically good-looking young couple in 1950s Connecticut, buying their first house. Expecting their first child. The world is opening up to them. Have you been there perhaps? Just a few adjustments. Tweak each other's views.What do you do when you love someone and they won't see sense? Frank tries to disabuse April of her childish notions of being an actress, something she has trained for. She's awful at it anyway, he's right. Why can he not see that this is not the way to be supportive and loving? April slips jarringly from being the perfect wife to putting on perfection as a show. Then she has a bright idea. Let's start again. In Paris. Frank will have time to find what he really wants to do in life instead of an advertising job he hates. Deep down he loves her. If she can only just re-kindle that.The problem with pretending to be nice is just that. If you have to pretend, then deeper issues are not right. Sooner or later they will come to the surface. Stuff about the symbolic nature of the title (the street where Frank and April live is called Revolutionary Road) could fill pages. But the film's strength is that any deeper meanings are secondary. There is sometimes a great temptation (certainly by this writer) to interpret films within a social context, to analyse their moral agenda. While this provides intelligent gratification of consciousness, it can blind us to the power of film as autonomous art, the precise use of a dramatic device for its own sake, the carefully crafted harmony of costume, lighting, sets, inflection and intonation, and the many formal techniques unique to cinema among the arts.Winslet is here most diva-like, more self-assured than in many of her flamboyantly emotional parts. She delivers her lines with scalpel-like precision, and at last cuts the profile of an actress destined to become legend. Di Caprio is still underestimated as an actor in my opinion. Here, he plays off Winslet with the fire of a young Brando. As they throw emotional punches at each other, they are like two five-star boxers. A surgical jab to weeping wounds which hide tears. Pain inflicted without breaking rules. The cut and thrust of barbed words eliciting the worst. Is change possible without destruction? Bring on a neighbour's son, a mathematics Ph.D certifiably unsocial after repeated electric shock treatment to 'fix' him. Now a Village Fool like those of legend, who can speak the truth that no-one dares. Nowhere is such an occasionally theatrical device deployed more scathingly than with Michael Shannon's character, John Givings. A man who is past caring, towering over Frank and April physically and intellectually, he shreds any illusions we dare hold for their sake.Perhaps I am wrong about teenage audiences. Some did walk out. But I remember Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf. One of the first 'adult' themed films I saw as a young lad. Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, bickering incessantly, and pointlessly showing off encyclopaedic command of words just to needle each other. I had to make myself sit through it. But the film made a deep impression and I look back on it now as a classic. I hope some young viewers will have the same experience with this Revolutionary Road.",10,0,1,31 January 2009
28 Days Later...," Trainspotting Director, Danny Boyle, does what he does best - making a big-grossing movie for pennies - this time inflicting post-apocalyptic and pretty scary virus-victims on a few survivors in a Mad Max me
","(contains minor spoilers) Unashamedly derivative, but packs in the shocks for all that. The main disappointment for me is in the choice of format. Digital works fine for short range shots with focus on inner emotions and scenes that are not too highly reliant on visual authenticity for effect, but for an epic of action shots over broad landscapes the definition is sometimes so poor as to be laughable. 28 Days was made on a tiny Â– well relatively tiny ($15m) - budget and it shows Â– no doubt it will continue to uphold Danny Boyle's reputation for making small budget films that rake in millions and, like Trainspotting and Shallow Grave that went before it, the editing in 28 Days Later is sharp and punchy, the infected crazies that keep jumping out like Living Dead Zombies on speed are scary enough, and the Mad Max formula that winds up the near two hours post-apolocalyptic mayhem still works well enough if you throw in a few more crazies and an attempted rape. 28 Days Later delivers value-for-money in the shocks department, but ultimately sees you leaving the cinema feeling empty and cheated.",6,0,0,3 November 2002
City of God," Explores a world or violence and moral ambiguity rarely depicted on film
","The most moving moment in a trip I made to Brasil occurred when I visited a community school in the slums (favelas). These children were desperately trying to better themselves Â– the school (paid for from community and rotararian funds with no government help) was their *only* chance to get out of the cycle of hopelessness and crime. The awful dilemma was that the community and its inhabitants were protected and supported (with no strings attached) by the local drugs and gun running infrastructure. I was safer there than on the streets of Copacabana Â– no-one would harm a tourist as that might attract police attention (bad for business). One infraction to law and order would mean a warning Â– the second, death.City of God looks at the slum area (a slightly less criminalised one than the one I visited) some years not to long ago as it evolved towards this position. The honest struggles of a teenager to break the mould, and the enormous pressures on his less intelligent peers to enter the short lived occupation of  gangster. There are many moral challenges the audience is forced to confront, including the many shades of villains that accept a certain degree of criminality in order, at least in part, to do some good in an environment where the worst are very bad indeed and even the police are generally known to be more corrupt than some of the drug-runners.This is a monumental film ,bravely told and skilfully put together. It opens a world that is largely unseen by the developed West, telling a nail-biting story that accurately reflects generations of children and adults lost to a world we wouldn't wish on anyone. Queasiness at an opening scene where live chickens are beheaded for the cooking pot is soon put into insignificance as we realise the horrific cheapness of human life. This rollercoaster ride of a movie leaves you with very uncomfortable questions about the nature of goodness. Even thinking back to it now brings tears to the corners of my eyes.",8,9,14,30 January 2003
X-Men: The Last Stand," If all the X-Men films could be this good, I could watch one every week . . .
","When I was a kid, my parents used to give me a Big Carrot to look forward to all week, one that could only be realised on Saturday mornings. Every Saturday, I would troop down to the local cinema with my buddies for the kids matinÃƒÂ©e and, after the Pathe News and a cartoon, we would be treated to the Big Picture - usually a monster movie or superheroes spectacular. By standards of grown ups, the Big Picture wasn't that big or spectacular - usually a B-movie with awful special effects: but we would thrill to every leap of the hero, feel every whack as the monster or bad guy took a beating, and hide our boyish tears (or whoop and laugh manfully) as the heroine died in the arms of her lover.X-Men, the Last Stand, brought back that magic to me. If I could watch a Marvel-Comic-made-Celluloid this good every week I'd soon become an addict again. I caught the late night showing expected to be mildly entertained - and was awed. Comic book adaptations have advanced by leaps and bounds over the past few years - from the intellectual and emotional involvement of Spiderman 2 to the remarkable mixed media look of Sin City. So much so, comic book cinema no longer has to apologise for itself, play exclusively to children or appeal to a minority of fans. There are some people who will be turned off by the idea of mutant humans with super powers - you know who you are, and this movie is not for you; but for anyone wavering about going to see it, this represents a quality offering in what has now become an established and respectable genre. The story lines and moral dilemmas are well thought out, the acting on a par with any good mainstream film, and the special effects accurately delivered. I am no longer a pre-adolescent in short trousers, and yet felt my spine tingle to the magic of the X-Men's Last Stand the way I did years ago to those tearfully boyish Saturday matinees.This story revolves around a new 'cure' developed by a leading pharmaceutical company that can suppress the mutant gene of creatures like the X-Men. At first, the serum is offered only to mutants who want it, who long to be simply human, but the political battle over the rights and wrongs of the new discovery soon reach fever pitch. Of the two main groups of mutants, one, led by Patrick Stewart, seeks only peaceful coexistence for all - mutants and homo sapiens. The other, led by Ian McKellan, sees the battle as one between the two species. The lines are soon blurred as the new serum is misused by the government, and also as one very powerful mutant, known as Jean or Phoenix, awakens with part of her powers lodged with her subconscious and so beyond her control.For those that like reading meaning into science fiction and fantasy, many questions about evolution are raised, about democracy, freedom of the will and where (and how) individual freedom ends. Halle Berry's role (as Storm) has been slightly expanded, but it remains an excellent ensemble performance from all the main characters.This was not a film where I expected the audience to remain behind for the credits, so I was somewhat surprised to see so few people leaving their seats. Was I (as a non cult follower of X-Men) in the dark about something they all knew? Quite possibly - there is an extra scene kept back for dedicated fans . . .",9,0,3,29 May 2006
The Lives of Others," Can you dance as if there's no-one watching?
","Maybe you know the saying, 'Dance as if no-one were watching, sing as if no-one were listening'? I wonder why we say that? Is there something magical about privacy? Something that lets the spirit free? Our story starts before the fall of the Berlin Wall. The Stasi, East Germany's Secret Police, has refined its way of dealing with artists. No violence. Psychology. Persuasion. Surveillance. The lives of others are not their own. Most artists give up. Many commit suicide. Your best friend. Your lover. Georg Dreyman is lucky. He survives.The Lives of Others spans seven years - from 1984 to 1991. The first hour sets the scene so we are completely immersed in Communist Germany. Then Dreyman and his partner confront the fact that their lives are being compromised. The emotional intensity is in gut-wrenching contrast to the bland story so far. Finally, as the Stasi surveillance kicks in, they wonder if they can survive - or even if they want to.One of the film's strengths and weaknesses is that the characters are so believable. Dreyman is a sophisticated intellectual, a successful playwright. His partner, Christa-Maria, is an acclaimed actress. Then there's Stasi agent Gerd Wiesler, a heart-felt supporter of the communism, who is assigned to spy on them. Wiesler has a crisis of conscience and decides not to prosecute Dreyman. The Lives of Others has created debate and furore in Germany. Firstly, because the ex-Stasi now try to portray the regime as none too harmful. Secondly, because the facts show that, with the system of double-checks that were in place, no such character as Wiesler existed or could have existed. The film's director says it is about the ability of human beings to do the right thing, no matter how far they have gone down the wrong path. It seems like a good story (as long as we don't re-write history in the process).As I came out of a packed multiplex auditorium, I marvelled. People turning out in such numbers to see a subtitled movie. And so they should. But, its Oscar win (Best Foreign Language) apart, The Lives of Others is particularly poignant to British audiences. A poll published at the end of 2006 indicated almost 80% of us agree that Britain has become a 'surveillance society'.This is why The Lives of Others strikes such a chord. Thousands of new offences, limitations on freedom of assembly, on privacy, freedom of movement, the right to silence, and freedom of speech. Privacy International ranks the UK ahead of the US, Europe and most developing countries, as a 'world worst offender' for surveillance, and as 'an endemic surveillance society' (in the same category as Russia and China). We are by far the most-watched nation on earth, with a CCTV camera for every 14 people. Apart from such corrosive effects of surveillance (notably, in our film, on artists), new technology (including DNA and tracking of non-suspects) raises nightmarish possibilities of abuse. When disaster hits Dreyman's life, it is because a high-up official is abusing the system. Dreyman and Christa-Maria's lives are shattered, and he becomes determined to help expose the disease in their society.As I catch the bus home from the cinema (watched by more CCTV), I read a newspaper report of an Aberdeen University study finding tough government policies aimed at curbing Islamic radicalism are having the opposite effect. Since 9/11, Britain has eroded the principles it claims to be defending, and people fear (with some justification) that the Government's 'bottom-up accountability' is a blueprint for a 21st century version of a police state. A vicious circle? The Stasi had many more times the secret police that Nazi Germany had - but under a politer system. And modern technology even does away with the need for so many human operatives. The Lives of Others does not feature Gestapo tactics (and the Gestapo only had 30,000 secret police, against the Stasi's 200,000). This is the 1980s, and the Stasi are modern-looking officials, not hit-men. Most of them have been convinced that their work is for the public good.Dreyman is criticised for minor offences - possessing Western newspapers. It gives them a polite excuse to keep tabs. One perhaps thinks of the UK DNA database (the world's largest) that samples those who have committed very minor offences - or no offence at all. The official reason for diversifying surveillance on Dreyman is, 'lack of suspicious acts.' Our fictitious 'good man' in this multifaceted masterwork, (and to whom Dreyman eventually dedicates a novel) is in some aspects played by Ulrich Muhe. In a strange irony, Muhe has examined his own Stasi files - from the days when he was an actor in East Germany. He found his former wife had informed on him through the six years of their marriage. For Muhe, the Brechtian self-awareness that is referenced (but never directly used) in the film gives it a meaning beyond mere entertainment. The movie's style is mainstream - as if 'no-one was watching'. We just identify with what is happening on screen. But then we think about our own lives. Whether it is 'the grey men who ensure safety in our land' or the emotional ties, and how far would you go to protect a loved one, or how far someone could go to mess with your head.Watch and listen carefully: the Lives of Others is a film that can cut deep.",10,8,13,13 April 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Brilliant as ever, even after three hours (slight yawn!)
","What else can be said about this fairy-story for adults? Boromir and Frodo are two diminutive human-like creatures (hobbits) from a threatened region of fantasy world. They have been entrusted to return an evil Â‘ring of power' to its source and so destroy it. The Ring has a mind and personality of its own and tries to corrupt its bearer. Line up the good guys: Gandalf, (friendly magician), The Ents (tree-creatures that can walk and talk), various human and half-human species, and CGIs that generally are wont to inhabit such tales. Then there's the baddies: Saruman (corrupt wizard), the Dark Lord Sauron, and an army of custom-bred nasties (queue more fabulous CGIs). Finally, one of the most popular characters, Gollum (Smeagal) who has been twisted body and soul and tracks after the ring bearer in the belief he is its rightful owner. (Smeagal is such a remarkable feat of special effects that he has endeared himself to many audiences who come out pining for a pet one.) The Â‘Two Towers' of evil unite against the forces of good and slug it out for another three hours. (This synopsis for the benefit of anyone who hasn't spent many hours reading the book). The good things about the film are much the same as Part One (Fellowship of the Ring) or even better Â– great scenery, great battles, believable acting and judicious use of special effects in a movie that respects the intelligence of the adult cinema-goer without being too horrific for a young adolescent. On the down side, you have to like this sort of stuff in the first place, or be willing to be won over, and you have to put up with built in flaws like a dodgy and seemingly random mix of accents throughout. Part two of a remarkable, brilliant, and genre-making trilogy Â– but more or less what you would expect if you've seen part one.",8,0,0,30 January 2003
Across the Universe," A magical mystery faux pas, but pleasant enough until it strays beyond its superficial remit
","Rarely have I fallen in love with a picture so much in the first half, yet been utterly bored by the second. But every viewer is different. I will explain my reservations about Across the Universe in the hope that the information might help you decide to like it.It is a musical based entirely on songs by the Beatles. As it has a nominal story of its own, it would be unfair to call it an extended music video. Just be prepared for a story predicated on the songs, not vice versa.The first thing you notice is the songs are sung well. Exceedingly well. They even Â– dare I say Â– improve on the originals quite often. It reminds me of Eva Cassidy singing a classic like Somewhere Over the Rainbow. She found depths of beauty of her own and discovered the song in a whole new way. This is possible in Across the Universe because, instead of using actors that can sing a bit (a particular bugbear of mine), they use singers who can act a bit. Pretty young things with voices that could sweep to victory in any X-Factor sing-off.For anyone who loved the originals of I Want to Hold Your Hand and Hold Me Tight, this is the best homage imaginable. Simple boy-meets-girl kicks off a standard 3-part plot and your emotions can soar to the fullness of Lennon-McCartney lyrics.One of the best ever films to make use of popular songs in this way was Singing in the Rain. In those days, there was a ready stable of stars that could sing, dance and act Â– and usually all three at once. The film used a fairly topical story (the advent of sound in movies) and barrel-loads of charisma and humour. It is a formula that was easier for studios of old than ones of today.But Across the Universe falls down not because it doesn't have a good story. It falls down because of two major errors in plot development. Dock worker Jude travels to America to find estranged dad. A few subplots later he falls for Lucy. Lucy's brother is drafted into the (VietNam) war and this is where it all starts to go horribly wrong.The love songs have gone terribly well with attractive leads that make no great demands on their acting skills. But launch the film into extended tragedy and their inexperience sadly shows. The second mistake is the choice of plot focus. We are in the 'Summer of Love' Â– the 60s era of Flower Power, psychedelic drugs, and disillusionment with society (especially the war). The message was to turn on, tune in, drop out. (I know - I grew up in the tail end of flower power.) But to make a musical that focuses on the horrors of war is a very major undertaking, and well beyond the otherwise exemplary grasp of these filmmakers. They miss almost any reference to drugs (smoking hash and dropping LSD Â– acid Â– was a central part of the flower power era) and Jude and his friends seem to sidestep the philosophy completely. Which also seems a bit untrue to the Beatles. If they had to miss drugs for the censors, a few references to meditation, for instance, would not have gone amiss. Consequently, when Jude triumphs with All You Need is Love, it sounds hollow and unconvincing.The film is worth watching for the superb interpretation of most of the songs, especially in the first half. Surprisingly, the two well-known celebrities perform worst in terms of singing. They should have been omitted from the trailer. Bono is a great performer, but cannot compete vocally with more classically trained voices. Likewise Eddie Izzard might be a great comedian but his rendering of Mr Kite is at odds with the original tone of the song and his singing is variety show shouting. Producers would have done well to study the Beatles' 'Magical Mystery Tour' for this section.Across the Universe starts well but ends sanitised and unsatisfying. Excellent symbolism Â– for instance, soldiers tramping VietNamese jungle underfoot merely to carry a gigantic Statue of Liberty Â– is wasted by a story that stays in the mud rather than soars. The only turn on is fairly shallow. The only psychedelics are in the well-worn photo-effects. And the meticulous costumes fail to re-create an era that was more liberal than today.",6,1,3,12 February 2008
Stardust," A magic that isn't puerile . . .
","The power to dream is a wonderful thing. There's a saying, 'Not all dreamers achieve, but all achievers dream.' By exploring our imagination we shape our own futures. Or build empires. Perhaps overcome our fears, limitations and obstacles. Gain wisdom and benefit mankind. Or (put simply) just find our way to true love and happiness. Freud might express such things in symbols. The language of fantasy.Tristan ventures out of a rather twee English village called Wall. He goes through a break in the wall. A portal. In search of something that will prove his love to Victoria (Sienna Miller). Victoria doesn't take him very seriously. So he pledges to bring back a falling star.Stormhold is the world outside the wall. He discovers the fallen star has taken the form of a beautiful girl, Yvaine (Claire Danes). To complicate matters, three evil witches want to get hold of Yvaine. If they can eat her heart, it will replenish their youth. (One of the witches is played by Michelle Pfeiffer, who does fabulous young-old transformations of looks and manner.) The 'good guy' they meet on their way is Captain Shakespeare (Robert de Niro). He has a fierce, swashbuckling pirate exterior but is a sweetie closet queen underneath. Heirs of Stormhold meanwhile are engaged in a pitched battle over inheriting the Kingdom. Ricky Gervais is an added extras. A buffoon trader throwing in standard Gervais-type gags well. Tristan's purity of spirit arouses the love of Yvaine, so there is a nice little triangle going. Till he achieves the maturity to discern pedestal divas from real women.Stardust is a full-on, large scale fantasy that does credit to its myriad stars. Wholly positive, and written with a clarity that makes it more worthy of psychoanalysis that a coven full of Harry Potter romps. Production values rival Hollywood, and the storyline is free of the racial stereotyping, misogyny, religious or class agendas than shape and pervert so many large scale fantasies.That is not to say that Stardust is without its faults. Plot and dialogue have many predictable elements, and the fairytale quality may be too saccharine for some audiences. But if you want an excuse to let your heart fly, this film may well provide it.As a boy, I remember listening in wonder to albums by the Moody Blues (who practiced in a house not far from where I lived). They made records with names like 'In Search of the Lost Chord,' and wrote lyrics like, 'Thinking is the best way to travel.' I would fill my head with books on magic and mystery, from Timothy Leary to Aleister Crowley. Shaping dreams. Learning to make them real. Nowadays people might talk of NLP or positive thinking. Adults that remember how to dream with the force of youth but with the vision and application of maturity. Do you still enjoy that feeling?You are advised not to wait for Stardust on DVD. See it on the biggest cinema screen you can find. And Dolby Digital Surround Sound if you can get it. The actors look like they had a ball. Maybe you will too.",9,127,144,26 August 2007
School of Rock," Unbelievably - does what it says on the packet
","A quick glance at the story or trailer tells you that School of Rock is probably the cheesiest, gratuitous, airhead excuse for a movie in ages, but if you thought that was a good reason to avoid it you'd be wrong. Jack Black plays the slightly past it rocker, stuck in a groove of 70s heavy metal rock and roll and refusing to move on Â– until his (more up to date) band fire him. Struggling to pay the rent, he takes a phone call intended for his schoolteacher flatmate and accepts a job as supply teacher at a top school. Soon he has the kids not only studying the history of rock and roll, soundproofing the room and playing rock instruments, but actually competing in a major Â‘Battle of the Bands' competition.Unbelievable? Yes. What's more unbelievable is that somehow the whole thing works Â– Jack Black's over-the-top enthusiasm for his subject is contagious, the edge-of-disaster suspense is continued throughout the length of the movie, and by the end the audience is so desperate to see how the kids (who they all play their own instruments by the way) perform in the concert that seat wetting would probably go unnoticed. Joan Cusack, as the gobsmacked headmistress, delivers a performance that is worth the price of your cinema ticket in itself. Achieving such tears-down-the cheeks laughter and adrenalin-packed excitement for air guitar music is nothing short of miraculous.School of Rock is a movie that promises entertainment and delivers. Everything is as it says on the packet. For sheer feelgood factor, this movie is unbeatable Â– and you can even take the kids!",7,156,170,18 February 2004
Coyote Ugly," Straightforward entertainment - engaging braincells not needed!
","Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer who gave us Flashdance, Gone in 60 Seconds, Con Air and Dangerous Minds, this is entertainment that doesn't require you to engage too many brain cells to enjoy it (Is that bad??)The story of a would-be songwriter who goes to New York to find success, it is mostly about the red-hot bar where she starts working out of necessity. As it has the familiar music-video formula it is especially disappointing that the soundtrack is not more memorable, but visually the movie delivers what it advertises and is a great feel-good movie, popcorn movie or date movie. There's plenty of New York adrenalin, gutsy females that will tantalize the guys and a male lead that's not bad looking for the ladies, plus a few wish-fulfilment themes to also appeal to the girls. Out and out fun.",5,0,1,22 October 2000
Hero," A visual feast
","Perhaps the most visually beautiful movie of the year. This epic tale of moral dilemmas, heroism and the legendary and supernaturally gifted swordsmen of the warring states before the unification of China, leaves you gasping with the sheer audacity of the artistry. The only real connection with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (which I'm afraid I personally found a little tedious) is the use of stunning imagery and landscapes to make, I suppose, what was traditionally a male-dominated film market - boys doing battle - appeal to women as well. But the similarity stops there - Hero is about moral paradoxes, self-sacrifice, difficult questions of leadership - but all handled in a sublime panorama of visual extravagance. A nameless official challenges the evil ruler. His skill in swordsmanship has been aided by the study of human relations, of calligraphy, of numerous other arts. We travel across China - the Viet-nam-like tropics with strange mountains, barren plains, breathtaking mountains, colossal palaces. The characters dress in a way that gives further clues as we see the story from different sides - green, yellow and red all having different symbolism. The one jarring factor is the dubious political message which smacks of justification for totalitarianism - with not only a wink to modern China but also to the United States and its expansionist foreign policy and the sort of justifications that Bush type administrations use. The film has possibly meddled with history in terms of the main characters and their actual moral fibre or real motives. In what has become a legendary injustice, the Disney/Miramax empire did not released Hero in the USA until February 2004 - fourteen months after it was released in Hong Kong, and a full year after it received an Academy Award and Golden Globe Nomination for Best Foreign Language Film of 2002 (a fact not highlighted in the promotional trailers and posters very much).",9,2,3,3 October 2004
No Man's Land," Fiction, but at least it lets us make a stab at understanding the Bosnian war
","I suppose it deserved it's Oscar for Best Foreign Film although I reckon there was some sympathy voting going on as well. A Bosnian conflict story that exposes the `UN Peacekeeping Force' for the window-dressing that it may well be in real life. Convincing battle stuff with mines and gun wounds that are quite chilling in their close-to-home feel, and the main characters maintaining the senseless enmity that seems so hard to understand from a distance of a Western country that is not torn apart by war. The value of a film like this is perhaps it gives us a tool with which to try and visualise real and rather horrible recent events.",7,1,4,22 May 2002

Moulin Rouge!," By the original songs - they are better value
","After two brilliant movies (Strictly Ballroom and Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet), Baz Luhrmann falls prey to overconfidence and over-funding in this spectacular but empty re-working of the Moulin Rouge brothel-come-cabaret-club historical icon. The tale (what there is of it - lowly writer gets off with top-notch courtesan by being mistaken for a duke) is told using modern pop song lyrics, frequently taken out of the song and used as dialogue. 'It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside' quips Ewan McGregor as he woos Nicole Kidman - not surprising, mate, anyone would feel a bit funny trying to make a whole movie out of lines from pop songs. According to the Director, this is the 'contract with the audience', as was the dancing in Strictly Ballroom or the Shakespearean language in Romeo and Juliet. Unfortunately, unlike those two movies, we don't have the genuine article for one minute in Moulin Rouge. Although both McGregor and Kidman can sing passably (as well as act to a much higher level than this tosh deserves), they are not Elton John. So the 'Contract with the Audience' is fake from the start. Many will think this is quibbling. After all, you have Kidman looking stunning, Kylie Minogue thrown in for good measure, incredibly amazing sets (literally - suspense of disbelief vaporises in the first few minutes), some nice song and dance routines and, all in all, a couple of hours of nice, mindless, fluffy entertainment. Occasionally there lines of dialogue not blatantly taken from a song. These are instantly recognizable by the fact that they are badly written and would probably never have made the charts eg 'She is mine!' or 'Things aren't always as they seem.' The better lines are nicked from Madonna, Bowie, Elton John etc etc. and the only (apparently original) line that has the semblance of being produced by anyone with experience of writing is the one used for the publicity: 'The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.' Not bad. It seems Luhrmann and his co-writer, having relied on brilliant dancers and a brilliant play in their former efforts and feel that a scriptwriter is dispensable. Moulin Rouge, whilst demonstrating some wonderful cinematic techniques and looking like the actors had great fun making it, proves that it this isn't so. If you go and see Moulin Rouge, keep your expectations low, have several pints of beer first, and rave about how wonderful it's going to be beforehand - it won't be - but you might get through it by convincing yourself you've had a nice time.",5,0,0,26 September 2001
The Illusionist," Excellence as smooth as a conjurer's backhander
","The Illusionist (three and a half stars)Director: Neil Burger Writer: Neil Burger, based on a short story by Steven Millhauser Cast: Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti, Jessica Biel, Rufus Sewell, Edward Marsan, Jake Wood, Tom Fisher, Aaron Johnson, Eleanor Tomlinson, Karl Johnson Runtime: 110 minutes Certificate: PG Year: 2006 Country: Czech Republic/USAnother stage-magicians story so soon after The Prestige needs something to distinguish itself with, and The Illusionist fares quite well.In keeping with the theme, The Illusionist is visually impressive from the opening credits, sweeping us into intricate scrolls and patterns that lead us through soft focus shots of rich landscapes, book-lined offices and the delicately distinguished architecture of Vienna's streets from a hundred years ago. Browns, sepias and ochres suffuse the screen, seducing us into a world of chimaeras and fairy-tale reality masterminded by quiet and unassuming Eisenheim the Illusionist (Edward Norton).This is a romantic mystery around a brilliant stage magician of yesteryear, determined to win back his childhood sweetheart from a corrupt and dangerous Prince. Through flashback, we see Sophie, a child of the gentry. Eisenheim, on the other hand, is a lowly son of a cabinet-maker. Where The Prestige toyed with magicians seeking ultimate magic through fringe science of the day, The Illusionist has an air of fantasy where amazing powers are never questioned. The main protagonists have a Hansel-and-Gretel innocence against a big bad tyrant.Says director Neil Burger, 'Most of the tricks are based on real illusions,' but, even though based on tricks of the period, they are rather stunning on screen, due in no small part to the very powerful, almost hypnotic presence exerted by Edward Norton. But at one point early on, it seemed to be getting a bit too Harry Potter. Burger says, 'If you're going to exaggerate certain elements, to have it be dreamlike or surreal or uncanny, you have to make sure that the rest of it has a rock solid foundation in the period.' The film is so smoothly delivered that it seems pointless worrying about how exaggerated they were. 'My goal was to have the film completely inhabit that realm of dream and mystery,' he says, and succeeds.Jessica Biel, as Sophie, also gives a strong melt-in-the-mouth performance. Paul Giamatti, as the doggedly persevering police chief, torn between conscience and following crooked orders, shows a strength in his performance that contrasts well with bumbling characters of earlier films (such as Sideways). Norton is tender and caring - again a revelation testifying to a breadth of very considerable acting skills. The film competed against The Prestige for Best Cinematography Oscar, and has a very distinctive look, based on an early colour photography process called 'autochrome'. Philip Glass, one of the most important contemporary composers and well respected for his film scores, seamlessly maintained the flow of the movie (even if it did sound disturbingly similar to his score for The Hours). But the consummate production values and perfectly combined talent going into The Illusionist is also its weakest point. Where The Prestige hit an unsettling nerve by keeping the audience unsure of the plot development, The Illusionist, appealing to a wider market, is engaging but controlled. The surprise ending is icing on the cake of a sumptuously professional piece of entertainment. Elegant and mesmerising, skilfully saturated with stylish energy, a tale of forbidden love that will delight as an intelligent date movie or as family entertainment. Production line it might be, but top of the range. Or so we are meant to believe.",7,2,3,18 March 2007
Children of Men," Armageddon . . . again
","Imagine a few years from now, and the 'war on terror' has engulfed the whole world with Britain (haha!) as the last refuge from attacks. The economy is in tatters - possibly to pay for the almost omnipresent Homeland Security - but the really bad news is that the human race has become infertile years ago. Pregnant black woman, Kee, appears to Save the Day.Children of Men is a powerfully devised (if heavily flawed) movie. It uses a mish-mash of modern day fears, realistically projected 20yrs into the future, and a welter of populist, barely disguised religious metaphor to help audiences to identify with its miracle baby and mythical promised land themes.In 2027 the youngest person is only eighteen years old, and is killed after being asked for an autograph. Clive Owen (who is in every scene) is a disillusioned bureaucrat separated from his long-term partner Julianne Moore who now works for one of a number of resistance groups. She arranges his capture so he can help deliver Kee and her unborn baby to safety.The scenes of London mix familiarity with desolation, Homeland Security rounding up illegal immigrants into cages and shipping them through a Guantanamo-style holding centre to Bexhill, which has been turned into an enormous refugee camp. Bexhill itself looks more like war-torn Iraq, with various factions, some of them good and many of them not so good, vying for power.Owen gives a tolerably good performance even if the character looks and sounds like most of his previous roles. Moore, on the other hand, breaks away from her excellent screen personas where she expresses much without words and action, and throws herself into an excellent butt-kicking female militant character. The direction is taut throughout, maintaining tension and shocks as well as some crisply delivered laughs. The plot does meander as the group have numerous adventures to reach their goal, but the gradual and admirable escalation of violence and bloodshed shows a respect for pacing that keeps us on the edge of our seats. Michael Caine puts in a touching supporting performance as an aging hippy caring for his Alzheimer-stricken wife and the scene where Owen turns into a midwife is priceless.Given the deep issues at stake here, the odd scene suggesting Theodore Faron (Owen) does some soul searching would not have come amiss, but this is a movie crying out for a sequel: could we yet see a more mature approach to this undeniably interesting plot? Pigs do indeed fly, the pig in this episode being an inflatable one over art-enclave Battersea Power Station - Pink Floyd fans should be delighted. When George W Bush assumed power, I recall an American liberal saying they would now start a stopwatch to world war three. In the film, the British Government bomb hundreds of innocents to eliminate insurgents and we hardly notice, playing on our fears to give substance to any hope, no matter how improbable. The credits roll out with an old angst-filled Jarvis Cocker song, (c*nts are still) Running the World.",7,4,16,23 September 2006
Million Dollar Baby," Worthy - perhaps overly-so and very Americanised in its self conscious protesting of valuable issues
","Million Dollar BabyMillion Dollar Baby 7/10 Hilary Swank, as she did in Boys Don't Cry, has transformed herself physically for the part. Emotionally, intellectually, physically and - in terms of determination - spiritually, she *is* the character, and it's a stunning achievement. (She plays an underprivileged girl who wants to succeed as a boxer and eventually persuades Clint Eastwood to coach her.)Sadly, while it's an undoubtedly well (enough) made film, the directing, and acting elsewhere, is to my mind hardly of the calibre to justify the accolades the film is receiving generally. America, if not many other Western audiences, have become so inured to that self-congratulatory style where the camera zooms in for a close up and the actor holds an expression slightly longer than necessary for that 'Oscar moment'. These audiences, in my opinion, should get out more to some good traditional French cinema and see how lacking such Hollywoodized performances are compared to the European tradition of acting in a more 'natural' and believable way.Another reason for the over-hype on Million Dollar Baby, is probably because the themes towards the end of the film (without giving too much away) now firmly belong to the almost trendy political left wing liberalism that many like to embrace. Whilst possibly putting myself in that camp, I am not in this case convinced that the way it is dealt with here justifies the extravagant kudos the movie has acquired over its more cinematic merits. I can only give it 7/10, but if I were in America (USA) I'd probably give it more, simply because it may have some good socially effect in that morally moribund and religiously intolerant country.Million Dollar Baby is a very good film, but over-long and too full of it's own self-importance for my taste.",7,1,3,19 January 2005
Garden State," Whacky comedy that is strangely meaningful and relevant
","Garden State is little short of a revelation. Screwball, mindless comedy has been successfully twinned with original and intelligent script writing.Andrew Largeman has been in a lithium-induced haze since childhood. The heavy-duty antidepressants block out all emotions and leave him in a state where nothing bothers him very much. The opening sequences of the film are quite disorientating until we realise that we are seeing the world from Andrew's viewpoint. But then there is a series of events that involve Andrew travelling across states to his mother's funeral, a confrontation with his estranged father, and a chance meeting with a girl who is as zany as he is but in a totally different way. He decides to come off the lithium and experience life first hand.The basic bad-taste elements of Garden State would barely lift it above the status of an average to good goofball comedy. There's Andrew's much talked-about minor screen role where he played a retarded kid more convincingly than a kid who is really retarded; a dog that tries to hump him and another dog that can masturbate itself; Andrew's old school mate has become a cop and practices being convincing at it when screaming at motorists, and Andrew's girlfriend will invent a random noise to convince herself of her originality. But the movie's real strength is not just that these gags, which might not be to everyone's taste, are done surprisingly well. It's almost as if Garden State manages to reach us on levels we had forgotten were important. When Andrew (who doesn't like making time for his ungracious dad) goes to his mother's funeral, his father quips about how he managed to 'fit it in' and about how it's important to 'find time to say goodbye.' But the irony is that it is Andrew, screwed up as he is, who manages to really say goodbye to the past. Not only that, his sincerity reaches through the professional wall that his psychiatrist father has erected and helps the old man also come to terms with the past.Natalie Portman (as Sam) is equally dramatic in the unexpected impact her character has on us. She is a compulsive liar and not overly bright but, like Andrew, she comes to an acceptance of herself that is more truthful and revealing than the more successful characters in the film. While the visual jokes are standard off the wall - and quite good in that sort of way - the dialogue is scintillating and touches us on a much deeper level. There is a pathos in that these two characters, who have few qualities and little successes to write home about, manage to reach a harmony with life that we find not only intellectually satisfying but that most of us would perhaps want to strive to emulate. Suddenly the camel trying to pass through the eye of a needle refers not just to a material achievement that can blind us but to the mental and emotional garbage we carry around in our carefully constructed personas. Andrew, experiencing ordinary life as if from out of an emotional black hole, manages to analyse his situation simply and intelligently, unencumbered by the baggage that most of us have built up by the time we have reached his age. The effect is humbling.",8,1,2,5 January 2005
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," If I were born in the USA, this is a film that would make me feel proud to be an American
","Cinema can be entertainment, it can be art, it can be a popular voice. It can be eye-candy or sometimes it can be a force for good. Modern U.S. cinema and its audiences have long been primarily regarded (sometimes unfairly) as entertainment only. A few Independents have stood out, but works of significant art or important social comment have been largely seen as uncommercial.Leading filmmakers set out to challenge that with a company called Participant Productions. Their hypothesis was quite simple: there is a mainstream audience for well-made films that have the power to inspire on important issues. They believe 'in the power of media to create great social change.' Good Night, and Good Luck (like North Country and Syriana) succeeds in attracting critical and commercial success.Good Night, and Good Luck is about the struggle to protect democratic freedoms. It came on general release in the UK, the day after the United Nations called for the closure of Guantanamo Bay - a centre where people are detained without due process of law and for lengthy periods merely on suspicion of involvement with terrorism. It went on general release on the same day that Channel 4 Television aired a programme by Walter Wolfgang, the lifelong Labour Party activist ejected from last year's Labour Party Conference for speaking out against the Foreign Secretary on Iraq - a programme showing how the British Government has gradually reduced dissent within its own ranks and that new legislation designed to prevent terrorism is being used by the police in ways that are effectively eroding our civil liberties. (Footage included peaceful protesters who had been stopped under the Terrorism Act including an elderly man held in Brighton for wearing an anti-Blair t-shirt and the 11-year-old girl stopped and searched while participating in a peace march.)Good Night, and Good Luck is set in the 'McCarthy' era of American history, one of the blackest periods for U.S. civil liberties, when the merest hint that a person sympathised with 'communists' was enough to lose them their job. The Junior Senator, Joseph McCarthy, used people's fear of the communists (who were making real and frightening advances in Korea, Eastern Europe and China) to round up people with witch-hunt hysteria. Disagreeing with McCarthy was tantamount to being a 'dangerous communist' and could mean blacklisting for oneself and one's family or even imprisonment without proper trial. It took a long time for people to speak out. Broadcaster Edward Murrow (and his producer Fred Friendly) was one of those who lead the charge, using their own money when CBS and television sponsors refused to publicise their programme. The public was overwhelmingly supportive. Emboldened, televised Senate investigations led to McCarthy's downfall, even as he attacked Murrow.In only George Clooney's second experiment in the director's chair, he has scored both a palpable hit of a movie and also dug his feet in for integrity in film-making - both in content and style. Parallels between the McCarthy indictment-without-evidence and the U.S. detention-without-trial of Guantanamo Bay (or the UK's powers-of-detention under the Terrorism Act) are exceedingly (and intentionally) plain. If we sacrifice the freedoms that are the bedrock of what we claim to be protecting (whether it be from Communism or Terrorism) then the struggle ceases to lose much of its meaning. What makes Good Night, Good Luck so powerful however, is that it leaves viewers to make the connection themselves, by the careful telling of history, rather than the dubious rantings of left wing softies. The evils of McCarthyism are no longer disputed by many - nor was Murrow's patriotism ever in any doubt - he had a magnificent track record of upholding the liberties of which America is so proud, so the film stands first and foremost as a patriotic clarion call to freedom. Neither does it embroider - the only scenes of McCarthy used are archive footage (just as when Murrow attacked him, he only used actual footage of the Senator speaking). Murrow claimed that Americans were not only able to be strong militarily, but they were able to be strong in robust debate. This movie, 50 years later, is a tribute to that robust debate.Stylistically, the use of black and white throughout reminds us of the magic of that medium (especially on modern high quality 35mm film). The 50's are lovingly recreated, from the deep jazz soundtrack with Dianne Reeves and Rosemary Clooney's band, the hand-written prompts for announcers in TV's early days, to the (less acceptable today) world of ubiquitous cigarette smoke and a male-dominated business world. The mannerisms, haircuts, dress, and even the way the film is edited, all persuade us that we are watching a film made closer to that era and miraculously brought to us with digital sound and wide aspect ratio. Admittedly, the shots of McCarthy and the Senate are of noticeable poorer quality (and with poorer make-up), but the real and symbolic importance of using original footage outweigh the slight visual inconsistency. Clooney has not only directed admirably, but has excelled himself in co-producing a taut script as well as delivering an excellent performance as Fred Friendly. David Strathairn (as Ed Murrow) establishes himself as an actor of major strength: the indelible picture of Murrow he projects is one of towering humanity, moral probity, belief in self and a courageous judgement free of bias - an icon for any reporter to hold high.In the USA today, we see vigorous debate and the rule of law replaced by religious conviction and secret knowledge. In the UK, rigorously scrutinised laws and debate within Cabinet and political parties has been replaced by a mass of hasty legislation authoritarian politics. Safeguards in the political systems of both countries have failed. It was against such moral vacuity that the broadcast media defeated McCarthy and returned common sense and democracy to America. Films such as Good Night, Good Luck can be seen as a small step in a similar direction.",10,11,15,17 February 2006
Mulholland Drive," Original film making in a class of its own
","What is behind the curtain? Or just around that bend? Behind the door? Behind the words? Where will our hopes and dreams take us? If we succeed, they become part of who we are. But if Fate is unkind we face our own fallibility. In the multifaceted and unreal world of Los Angeles, a city of dreams and nightmares, being true to yourself can be as hard as discovering who you really are. The way can be littered with mobsters, hit men, and pressures that can drive you crazy. A great setting for a noirish thriller and a mystery within a mystery.In the glamorous and sometimes dangerous world on the fringes of Hollywood, two girls (played by Naomi Watts and Laura Harring) are drawn into a lesbian relationship that is unequal in more ways than one. A sense of foreboding is never far away. A top director, Adam Kesher (played by Justin Theroux) is having to re-audition a lead role, but if he doesn't do as he's told he will lose everything. Who knows what will happen when the road ahead is dark? As we piece together opening scenes, a woman is ambushed in the back of her car on Mulholland Drive. We watch an accident and a narrow escape. We see her drawn under the wing of wide-eyed Betty, whose idealistic vision of Hollywood seems almost too good to be true. Amnesia, a hit that goes wrong, strange occurrences around a Wendys Diner, and lots of media-mogul double-talk. We are assaulted with a barrage of clues to solve a puzzle which remains tantalisingly out of reach.Then there's a major twist.Mulholland Drive is not a mystery that you solve by the end of the film. You have to go away and think about it. The movie uses a broken chain of cause and effect that challenges and forces an audience in on itself. Remember Memento, where we realise the film is shot from the point of view of a man with short-term memory loss? Expect the unexpected. And once you work out the 'beginner's' or 'classical' interpretation, new avenues will open to explore, like a poem as it blossoms.One of the beguiling aspects of the film is that each scene is so captivating, so unusual, so colourful that we are tempted to enjoy it for its own sake. We race from horror to laughter to romance to mystery. A simple hit-and-run for an address book turns into Tarantinoesque mayhem as the clean-up operation gets hilariously out of control. Adam is prone to imaginative violence with golf clubs or pink paint when told who to cast or is cuckolded by the pool man.High production values and fabulous sets add to our visual enjoyment. Perfect editing brings every shot home hard. But the script increasingly tries to force a more Brechtian analysis upon us, making us stand back from the characters where we had suspended disbelief. When Naomi Watts' is auditioning for a part, the intensity of her performance moves us as if we had finally connected with her character. In a nightclub, when an act is pre-announced as lip-synched, we don't want to believe. Images are absorbed faster than logic, but they are so beautiful we may as well leave logic until later.Just as the characters in the film, if we do not explore different sides of our make-up consciously as an actor does, through creative channels, then our subconscious may do it for us. We all dream. Some of take us might take recreational drugs. Most of us indulge in wish-fulfilment and sexual fantasies. Mulholland Drive should be avoided by those who like straightforward stories without too much of a challenge. It is not just a passive viewing experience. But if you like exploring strange byways and have the patience to see what is around the corner, Mulholland Drive is one of those films to put on your all-time must-see list.Want a starter? Check out the director's 10 Official Clues.Editor Mary Sweeney says, 'Even the critics who wrote in their reviews that they hadn't understood a thing admitted three days later that the story was perfectly clear.' (If you're still stuck after that, it's been extensively analysed on the Internet, where there are dedicated sites.) Mulholland Drive is a film about identity. Your unconscious plays a part in coming up with answers. Don't worry if you have to sleep on it. After all the pieces have fit into place, you might decide just to enjoy it as poetry. The drive can be more enjoyable than where it leads.",10,2,3,26 February 2002
8 Mile," Barely taps the surface - the next Eminem movie will be better!
","After the fabulous trailer I waited the whole movie to see the number one hit explode into the story. It doesn't. Much to the film's credit (it only comes in with the closing credits) as the story follows the early, very small success of a down and out Detroit rap singer, so something of the level of a top Eminem song at a local club would be a bit over the top. Good points: the popstar of the moment in a non-cheesy film made round him, good intro to rap culture and music. Bad points: dialogue would be better if had been written by Eminem, weak storyline.",7,0,0,19 January 2003
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Perfectly created, perfectly realised fairytale
","I don't usually go big on kids movies. Animation, for instance, makes me grit my teeth. The Harry Potter movies left me exceptionally unimpressed. I went into Charlie and the Chocolate Factory half expecting to be bored after the first half an hour.OK, it's got quite a bit going for it - Tim Burton is not exactly a beginner, although his films have been a bit uneven. Johnny Depp's forte has long been fantasy, and the combination has yielded some of Burton's directorial best (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow). Finally though the team have come up with their most polished and flawless work yet. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory sweeps you away with a magic and poetry whilst keeping you on the edge of your seat for the next development. Roald Dahl's incredible, eccentric brand of children's' storytelling is a joy to experience, for young and old alike.",8,5,8,13 August 2005
World Trade Center," Shame about the title . . .
","Director Oliver Stone could have been a politician: his is the happy knack of saying one thing and doing another. He thinks of himself as a liberal yet seems to endorse right wing values by design or omission. Historical accuracy has never stood in his way of good drama. That, with a semi-documentary style and archival footage, has helped him become one of the great re-programmers of popular memory.It was with some ill-ease that I sat down to watch World Trade Center, knowing that the feelings of millions of Americans could be touched like a raw nerve. Producing a near-definitive account or 9/11 that would satisfy the traumatised emotions of widely differing sections of the public seems a mammoth task - producing an Oliver Stone account could end up worse than pouring petrol on a car crash.To Stone's, he has taken a novel approach - that of finding goodness in stories of courage and self-sacrifice. He avoids the blame-game, the politics fraught with potholes, and the unenviable task of giving an overall view of what happened. He also nearly - if not quite - manages to avoid political bias that could lower the tone of the film one way or the other. He focuses on the experiences and emotional journey of two Port Authority Policemen who are half-buried in the rubble and, most significantly, that of their families. Script is based largely on accounts from real-life counterparts. On that day, those people had no knowledge of who committed the atrocity leading to the collapse of the World Trade Center. They had no knowledge of the almost three thousand people that had been killed (although the statistics are mentioned in the closing credits). The women didn't even know which hospital their husbands would be taken to or if they had got out alive.Scenes of panic, chaos and emotional desperation are skilfully re-enacted. Nicholas Cage, who so often is woefully miscast, here shines at what he is good at - portraying desolation and near-hopelessness. Barely having begun the evacuation attempt, Cage and a volunteer policeman are caught up in the collapse and trapped. Maggie Gyllenhaal, as his colleague's wife, responds with a controlled hysteria that had me reaching for a handkerchief. Then begins the long slog to find dig the two men out.With such a slim story - people buried beneath a collapsed building who have to be burrowed out - Stone does an excellent job of maintaining tension and momentum throughout two hours plus. World Trade Center is a moving story told with an air of realism. So why has the film attracted considerable negative press? The first reason is the title. This film is not about the World Trade Center. It is not even about the terrorist attack that claimed so many lives that day. It is about the personal experience of two families whose husbands are trapped, and 9/11 is merely a backdrop against which the story is set. We see courage and dedication, and the bonds of love that, in different ways, are the most important things in life. Yet the title, coming as it does to herald the first major blockbuster set on that day, raises expectations of a definitive version of events, of the collapse of the World Trade Center, of the thousands killed. Such a title was a little short of lunacy. Stone makes us expect one thing and gives us another. In ten years time, it will be a better film: just now, very few people want to 'feel good' thinking about 9/11. The film goes beyond the horrors of that fateful day to the goodness at the core of individual hearts. But for a nation still in mourning, it hardly replaces a wake.The second problem with it is that if Stone almost managed to remain unpolitical the emphasis is on 'almost'. One of the symptoms of grief is anger. In the midst of the chaos, Bello rails against the desk sergeant who has first told her that her husband has walked out of the wreckage alive - only to correct it later and say he is still buried. We can see it was not the desk sergeant's fault. It is easy to connect that up later to a marine who says, 'We're gonna need some good men out there to avenge this.' Put that with the (later) knowledge that Iraq, for instance, had no part in the terrorist act. The early morning shots of New York, as Cage gets up for work, include a fleeting glimpse the Statue of Liberty, beautiful in the early morning light, and the sound of a radio presenter saying, 'the polls are now open.' More observation than bias, but such musings would have been better left out.As a non-American, I began to appreciate better the outpouring of emotion that has traumatised that nation. It was suddenly easier to see how America rallied around the President (even a bad one), because at times of stress you go with the leader you've got. Watching the wives have their guts ripped out with worry brought tears streaming down my face. I didn't think (as many Americans would) of all the people that 'weren't represented' in the film - I had already accepted that the film was only about these two individuals and their families - but I did imagine how every person in America would have been able to identify in a very traumatic way with the disaster. Telling the story from the women's point of view was a masterstroke.'It is about America in many ways, but ultimately it is a larger story about the human heart and survival that everyone should be able to relate to,' says Stone. In wanting to bring something good out of the tragedy, it is tragic that he only nearly succeeded.",8,2,5,15 November 2006
Black Hawk Down," Battle minus script or plot details
","Over-hyped, under-scripted and over in Somalia, this long, fairly anonymous 1993 battle scene has still picked up four Oscar nominations. Ewan McGregor and others slug it out as part of a U.S. peace-keeping force in Mogadishu. The locals rise up more or less en masse against them and reassure us that the episode was one of America's foreign policy `mistakes'. Quite why they are so unwanted is not really explained. A bit more convincing than, say, Pearl Harbor, but I personally am unable to share the enthusiasm that many feel for this noisy action piece.",6,1,1,26 February 2002
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," Brilliant toe-tapping stuff
","Already the winner of numerous awards including the Audience and Director awards at Sundance, this is the film of an original stage musical comedy that played off Broadway for over two years. It centres on Hedwig, whose only way of escaping from East Berlin is to undergo a sex-change and assume his mother's identity. Unfortunately the operation goes wrong and he is left with an `angry inch'. Escaping to America, he forms a rock band whilst seeking the soul partner that will fulfil his destiny. Loaded with songs that you will be humming all the way out of the cinema, Hedwig and the Angry Inch is the funniest, most outrageously entertaining movie of its kind since Rocky Horror. Unlike Rocky Horror, it does have some more serious philosophical reflections built into it (mostly via the songs), but it rocks, kicks ass and injects some seriously funny pizzaz into the transgender scene. I had the advantage not only of seeing the UK stage version a few days after the film, but also hearing the director speak about his work at the UK premiere. As a first time film effort it's quite an accomplishment, but as Cameron also played Hedwig in the stage version he had a starter for ten. On the down-side, the film is probably better on second or third viewing, when all the pieces would fit into place, and towards the end there is a tendency to tell the story only in songs and so at the expense of any serious script writing. But still it's a must-see movie.",8,29,31,27 August 2001
Big Fish," Quirky and lovable - Burton just about carries it off this time
","One of the quirkiest and lost lovable of films, Big Fish is about a grandfather who has perfected the art of telling bedtime stories. His stories are all made up, all feature fictionalised episodes from his own past life, and polished to a degree that make them in demand to children and adults alike (except to his own grown-up children, who have heard them once too often). The second most difficult thing about grandfather Ed Bloom is that he is constantly telling these stories. The most difficult thing is that, when it comes to his own life, he tells nothing else.Most of the film is devoted to putting these stories into pictures, just as he tells them. Fantastical, endlessly inventive and incredibly entertaining, they would be enough for a film itself if only aimed at children; but what makes Big Fish a joy for adults as well as kids is that Ed Bloom's life becomes more than that, it becomes an illustration of the fantastic within all of us and how valuable that it. He is a self-mythologizing man, a living example of the magic that can put a sparkle of wonder in a child's eye, and remind us that imagination is a wonderful thing, not just for storytelling, but to realise the greatness within each of us. It is also one of whimsical and visionary director Tim Burton's most rounded and mature films to date, and makes good use of a star studded cast that includes Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Jessica Lange, Helena Bonham Carter and Steve Buscemi. A film to leave you smiling all the way home.",7,0,0,2 February 2004
The Insider," Some modern day moral dilemmas responsibly addressed
","Long, worthy movie about an ex-tobacco scientist who speaks out and risks losing everything. Based on a true story and memorably told without watering down. The problem facing someone who 'goes public' over a medical-legal pothole is admirably brought to light. the film also manages to keep the viewer on the edge of his/her seat for nearly full three hours without once relying on a car chase or other standard scene - the excitement is all cerebral.",8,0,1,27 March 2000
The Dark Knight," An adult breed of batman (non-geeks welcome!)
","The enthusiasm which has greeted this film is for the large part so very well-deserved that nothing should be said to take the edge off it. The 'Batman' comic series has evolved into a adult-orientated crime thriller, pitching cops against crooks and the caped vigilante. The star turn of Heath Ledger (as the Joker) frighteningly transforms a once comical character into a sinister psychopath reminiscent of Silence of the Lambs.The technical scope of the film (using IMAX cameras for the opening scenes) is impressive, and the script is scintillatingly up-to-the-mark Â– far outperforming usual expectations for action films.The weak points are that it will be overly long for some viewers. Other than Ledger, the star cast of Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Maggie Gyllenhall is woefully underchallenged; whereas Christian Bale as Batman is less than convincing for someone who should have peak physical and mental alertness, even with a vast array of 007-like gadgets. It should be clear to anyone that director Christopher Nolan (of Memento fame) is more likely to make good blockbusters than original art-house movies such as his early promise showed. But at least they are good blockbusters!Dark Knight succeeds by reaching out to viewers that would not normally go to see a Batman movie Â– and satisfying them. There are many political and moral subtexts which some viewers will find challenging. This is a definite cut above the average Saturday night entertainment.",6,1,6,2 August 2008
Blood Diamond," Excellent thriller but sanctimoniously self-righteous
","Hands hacked off to prevent voting. Young children trained to machine gun villagers. Try to fight it or try to survive? Try to fight it by getting rich first?Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a Rhodesian-born diamond smuggler and ex-mercenary. He ferries ill-gotten gains from 1990s slave mines in Sierra Leone to fences in Liberia. The initial trade is diamonds for guns, but once in Liberia the stones have access to international markets. He meets Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) who has escaped from a slave mine after risking his life hiding an enormous pink diamond. Solomon's son, Dia, went to school every day and dreamed of becoming a doctor - until he was captured by the Revolutionary United Front and brainwashed into becoming a child soldier. For Solomon, recovering the diamond could save his family. For Danny, it could be a ticket out of the cycle of violence in which he has become a willing player.Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) is a journalist trying to expose the bloodshed and misery fuelled by diamonds. For her, Danny is a major potential story source. For Danny, she becomes a useful diplomatic player as they each try to use each other for their own agenda.Blood Diamond is a taut thriller, but how legitimate is its claim to be a vehicle for human rights?It made considerable furore. In the week of its British release, both The Economist and The New Statesman - leading influential newspapers - published related articles. DiCaprio was nominated for an Oscar. The US diamond industry announced it would donate $10,000 to African charities for each star raising a diamond-studded hand at the event - a gesture condemned by director Edward Zwick as distasteful.The film is supported by Amnesty International and also by Global Witness - an organisation highlighting links between environmental exploitation and human rights abuses. Our average audience, in between popcorn and supersized CocaCola, is quite likely to take onboard the message that diamonds should be treated as a pariah like fur. Who wants to be responsible for tying the knot with a gem soaked in blood?To be fair to the film, it goes to considerable lengths to point out that Sierra Leone is now at peace and that regulation of the industry covers all but a minute fraction of diamonds. This was due to a protocol called 'The Kimberley Process' which now regulates trade in rough diamonds. 99.8% of new diamonds are now from conflict-free sources. This doesn't mean that there are not still millions of dollars of blood money involved in the trade of a few diamonds. Or that slavery and child-militias have been wiped out. But the rhetoric of the movie is designed to make us angry rather than conveying precise information. It has a blockbuster style that spotlights the (excellent) performance of its star Leonardo DiCaprio and makes the villagers the supporting cast rather than the focus. Its target audience may enjoy a feeling of righteous moral outrage, but will they linger to absorb the factual information in the credits or on the official website? Will they ask sensible questions when buying diamonds (such as, 'In which country were they mined?' 'Were the stones traded under the auspices of the Kimberley Process?' 'Can I see the guarantees'), or will they simply join the director in his tirade against any industry scapegoat, beneficent or not?Acting and editing in Blood Diamond are superb. What could have been a very predictable film, keeps us on seat edge throughout its two-hours-plus running time. DiCaprio is amply rewarding the faith that early directors like James Cameron and Woody Allen expressed in him at a time when the public viewed him as just a pretty face. Djimon Hounsou contributes a towering performance. Only the beautiful Jennifer Connelly is woefully miscast. She is at her best in expressing the subtly ambiguous, restrained feelings she develops for DiCaprio's character, but her portrayal of a hardbitten reporter that goes it alone in Afghanistan and darkest Africa comes less easily.Battles throughout are vicious and realistic. The film does an excellent job of documenting little known areas of human misery and also provides occasional momentary relief with the touching reunions or the re-educating of brainwashed children.Although Blood Diamond raises worrying human rights issues, careful examination suggests there is more than a hint of jumping on a left-wing bandwagon by the film's producers. It covers important issues but audiences are best researching them independently and understanding both the good and the bad associated with the diamond trade. For instance, diamondfacts.org shows the diamond industry in a much better light than the global witness website, though both seem accurate and factual. Much of the human rights abuses over diamonds since 2003 relate to the abysmal conditions in which diamonds are mined; or the failure of some governments to use diamond wealth to benefit the communities concerned. Liberia is already under UN sanctions. Dealing in conflict diamonds is illegal in the UK. The film barely tackles India, one of the weakest links in the present chain. Worst of all, the unproductive misunderstanding over the industry's donation for 'Oscar waves' was down to the irony that, in Sierra Leone, raising of one's hand to vote used to be a signal for the Revolutionary United Front to chop off hands. One has to ask if the filmmakers' priorities are human rights or the financial success that can ride on the back of making a hullabaloo. As a thriller, Blood Diamond has a cutting edge; as a protest film, it has as much subtlety as a machete while being careful about offending present day culprits. Finding a diamond story in present day Guinea rather than Sierra Leone might have been more to the point.",7,1,2,30 January 2007
Singin' in the Rain," finest musical of all time
","What if you wanted a phrase to sum up elation in spite of difficulties? Then you illustrated it with songs, dance, a love story crossing different eras, you offered parallels in the business and personal world, and then underlined it all with a dig at a society that takes itself too seriously? Would it come become widely acknowledged as the finest musical of all time? Singin' in the Rain takes a lost art form, travelling back to the days of silent pictures. A matinÃ©e idol (played by Gene Kelly) is caught up in the transition, together with his buddy (Donald O'Connor), a co-star with a grating voice (Jean Hagen) and the girl of his dreams (Debbie Reynolds). Just as is often the case in real life, the lovers bond by accepting each other's worst side. She can't stand his pompousness but her image is shattered when she takes a lowly job and jumps out of a birthday cake. She seems the perfect 'star' but, apart from her whole opposition to the Hollywood industry, she has the jealousy of the real 'stars' to contend with.Singin' in the Rain successfully re-creates the roaring twenties. By placing much of the story within the film studios themselves, there is easy access to backdrops of wildest imagination, providing constant visual contrasts - music-hall, western, action stunts, as well as forays into black-and-white. The aural contrasts are no less scintillating. The opening scene has Kelly, Reynolds and O'Connor dancing to a jazzed-up title song, quickly cutting to the dreamy Lucky Star number for the opening credits, followed by the clamour and excitement of a red carpet interview. Parodies on silent film, dubbing for sound, and dialect coaches continue to grab attention from one moment to another.This effervescent, all-American movie (together with An American in Paris) heralded a revolution in the American musical. Part of a counter-trend against popular film noir of the day (like Double Indemnity and The Big Sleep), Singin' in the Rain has been described as a 'great amalgam of realized style and stylized realism'. Even the ending, for all its emotional fulfilment, exalts successful caricature over 'serious' film making.Although it had to overcome many difficulties in the making, it remains one of the most enduring, effervescent and exuberant of films. It spoofs not only the silent era but also many earlier movies from which most of its songs are taken. Finding true sincerity beneath such light-hearted irreverence is part of the task of the seemingly ill-matched lovers. Today, Singin' in the Rain may be bypassed by devotees of contemporary cinema, echoing O'Connor and Reynolds' characters quip: 'Why bother . . . You've seen one, you've seen them all.' Yet each year the film gains new converts.",10,1,4,17 December 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Fabulous and inventive storytelling
","The idiosyncratic pen of Charlie Kaufman, who brought us the quirky and inventive Being John Malkovitch, has excelled himself in this offering with a movie that not only boasts originality of plot but a tender love story that avoids all excesses of sentimentality with razor-edge script and magnetic performances from Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey. At the end of an unusual and loving relationship with Carrey, Winslet's character answers an ad to have the (now painful) memory 'erased'. Carrey, dumfounded, follows suit, only to become resistant half-way through the process. What sounds like a dedicated sci-fi story is presented in such a way as to be perfectly ordinary and acceptable to a mainstream audience, allowing us to focus on the real dynamics of relationships and memories rather than get caught up in some high tech idea. Lacuna, the company that does the 'erasing', is headed by Tom Wilkinson - a very homely type who has hit on a process that combines psychology with zapping pinpointed areas of the brain in a sort of limited intentional brain damage exercise. A love story this unusual that also flows like original poetry is a sufficiently unique event to entrance most cinema goers.",8,0,1,5 May 2004

The World's Fastest Indian," Comfort & speed
","Souping up his handmade speed racer motorbike, Anthony Hopkins (playing an aging Burt Munro) sets about making a land speed record in the 1960s. This gently-paced movie radiates charm throughout and picks up tension in the final race at Utah's Bonneville Salt Flats. Hopkins seems authentic as a New Zealander, and the script gives him plenty of room to crack typical Kiwi jokes. Sets have been lovingly re-created and the culture clash when he comes to America comes across well. Given the paucity of strong elderly icons in cinema, this one does well. It's a movie that, if it doesn't exactly blow your socks off, is one you can curl up for and enjoy with the whole family. Let me just get my cocoa . . .",7,1,1,28 February 2006
Saw," A story with lots of potential but lacking realisation by economies in the scripting, editing and acting departments
","lots of publicity on its release, an ingenious storyline about a psychopath serial killer who gets his victims to kill themselves or each other in insidious ways, awful acting, and over-reliance on a loud soundtrack / jerky cameras to make it scary when mostly what we want to see is limbs being removed with a hacksaw . . . Most US & UK horror is so incredibly formulaic that it lacks scariness. The best horror seems dominated by Japan with such masterpieces as Audition and The Eye, but the French are creeping up steadily with original films like Irreversible, In My Skin, Trouble Every Day and Switchblade Romance. Saw, whilst it has some gory moments for true horror fans, lacks the talent to make it a truly great movie.",6,0,4,4 October 2004
The Last Samurai," Good action flick
","A great action adventure in a setting that hasn't been too overworked by Hollwood before Â– the final days of the legendary Samurai Warriors. Cruise plays the American hero of General Custer's time, recruited to Japan to help the government defeat the Samurai, but he learns to value the values of the Samurai. There is nothing very Japanese about the feel of the movie Â– it seems firmly like a Hollywood recreation put together to glorify Cruise's strengths and set in historical Japan Â– but Cruise puts plenty of work into the part with a performance to be proud of. And historical tosh as might it be (the Samurai were not really as noble as they are portrayed) Â– it does present the legend quite well, and the legend and the values retrospectively attributed to the Samurai are in some ways more important and interesting perhaps than any reality.",7,0,3,20 January 2004
Sinister," above-average horror film
","The autumn chill hits, and it's a good time for horror movies...Sinister comes from the people who gave us Paranormal Activity and also The Exorcism Of Emily Rose. Only it's a little more... sinister. Found footage of snuff movies heralds its adult credentials before you've had time to choke on the nachos or splutter salsa over the person in front. Copy picture A family is murdered. Months later, comeback writer Ellison Osborne moves into the house with his family. In the attic, he discovers a box of tapes that includes footage of many murders. Unbeknown to his family, he has chosen the house in order to research a true-crime novel. Having only had one bestseller, he sees this as his lucky break, his chance to write his In Cold Blood. The children start to act strangely and his good wife freaks out on him when she discovers the real reason they are living there.Ethan Hawke, as Ellison, and lovely Shakespearean actress Juliet Rylance playing his wife, Tracy, immediately strike us as realistic characters worthy of belief and empathy. Their convincing personas have more depth than the average shock- flick, and we are sorely tempted to consider whether this at heart might be a psychological thriller of Hitchcockian nastiness. Yet if the trailer hasn't given everything away, we are transported into a dark world of malignant forces the minute Ellison discovers a strange symbol repeated on the death tapes. Strong supporting acts appear in the form of a local police deputy â€“ who changes from doting fanboy to calm, collected criminologist; and a little later Professor Jonas â€“ the expert on bizarre cults. The professor makes this Babylonian demon 'Bagul' sound so realistic that you could be forgiven for wondering if Sinister is based on a true story, with Mansonesque worshippers helping Bagul to find souls of children to feast on.More lost footage. More creaks and bumps in the Osborne family's almost endless night. Ellison is losing the plot, but we are barely a knife-edge ahead of him. Cue cute kids, cue creepy kids, cue dead kids. Sinister will shortly become shriek-out-loud horror. As well as creeping inside your head on the way home, insidious horror. Polished production values handle clichÃ©d camera jerks with admirable restraint. What we can see and know on-screen is nasty; what we don't know is even more unsettling. Perhaps pausing only to admire the exquisite backing tracks and diligently applied sound effects, we soon realise we are hooked on trying to solve the mystery: who was the killer? Sinister's dark humour is equally discreet. Rather than being played for quick laughs, it emphasises the fear experienced by our protagonists. When Ellison is threatened by a Cujo-sized dog, he speaks soothingly, gently, while muttering a desire for the baseball bat to smash its skull in. And during a row with his wife, he says he hasn't 'really' brought them to house where murder was committed, since our crime occurred 'in the garden' ('As if that makes any difference!' Tracy explodes.) Horror films sometimes work by challenging us to confront the things we abhor, and all from the safety of a cinema seat. Whether physical (mass murderers), mental (psychological threats) or psychical (supernatural happenings), horrors on a movie-screen do not have to be real â€“ just real enough to remind us of something that could be. Our inner demons. The things we fear most. It could be said the 'ghost' haunting Ellison Osborne, his creeping, sweating, drink-sozzled paranoia, is evoked by his frankly unsavoury and obsessive career, his life's dream, that is in reality destroying the family that he loves and frightening his children. As with Frankenstein before him, Ellison's monstrosities might be partly of his own making. It might be tempting to see the monster as a reflection of him. Yet the very visible on-screen ghosts are nevertheless small works of art that capture our senses. That, and the gut- churningly self-assured, unexpected and irresistibly compelling ending swiftly sweep aside mundane interpretations.Given the effort put into getting it right, a part of me would still have loved to see a police psychiatrist in the coda explaining how everything really happened. An ultimate reliance on the supernatural is fine for horror fans, but inevitably weakens mainstream impact. (Imagine Norman Bates had summoned his mother back from the dead instead of just putting a wig on.) Sinister is far too derivative to be accorded a big place in cinema history; but this souped-up, low-budget compendium of dread is still more satisfying than most horror films that graced our screens this summer.",7,3,7,8 October 2012
A Clockwork Orange," Brilliant - but why???
",Re-release of the sicko-psycho-cult movie that would have had people spitting on Kubrick's grave had he died then instead of years after withdrawing it.

From Hell," Unexpectedly cerebral

Add to that Johnny Depp playing the opium-addicted detective and you have a winning formula.",6,0,1,26 February 2002
The Descent," Formulaic, but expertly done
","I've never been one for adrenalin addiction action sports. If I had to pick one it probably wouldn't be pot-holing. One enthusiast explains the attraction: '. . . as much a psychological as well as a physical activity. You should be prepared to push the envelope as far as both your mind and body are concerned, but the rewards are endless. Try this exciting and challenging sport and you will see how it allows your imagination to run wild as it takes you to the brink of what is both challenging and mysterious.' I went to see this nasty little blood-soaked movie wondering whether I would thrill to find a genuinely new British horror innovation, or alternatively just enjoy a camp and less-than-scary diet of gore-fest. (Yes, sad as it is, I am a fan of horror movies.) The Descent turned out to be neither of the two main categories but, in its merciful 99 minutes, delivers a better share of shocks than most.Six strong, capable women (one of them recovering from a traumatic bereavement) set off into the Appalachian Mountains for a pot-holing experience. They seem like regular, good looking and intelligent women, mostly with some pot-holing experience. Even before we go underground (especially if you've seen the trailer) the litany of psychological challenges are promising, as the self-appointed leader of the group lists claustrophobia, paranoia, and a host of other hurdles to jump.The film has been expertly put together, however formulaically. There is the initial attention-grabbing horrific incident in the first few minutes, the type of female characters that are designed to appeal to women as well as men, skillful editing to make you drop your popcorn by letting you relax momentarily first (so the sudden shock is greater), a cutesy kid, very effective use of light and dark, monsters that have some 'reasonable' connection with their environment, and a reality factor from the interesting mechanics of climbing down into caves and how you cross seemingly impossible chasms. Once it gets under way, there is little or no pause for light relief. You make a prediction to yourself about how many if any will get out alive, then sit back and have the wits scared out of you.Comparisons to Creep are valid - the storyline and mutants have some similarity, as do the pacing and denouement. Those to Deliverance and Aliens less so - those two were outstanding movies involving deep character development and masterly pacing - in category way beyond this Saturday-night shocker.

You won't go home looking over your shoulder for monsters, but if you're easily unnerved you're probably better off not leaving home in the first place.",7,6,14,9 July 2005
Inside Man," Very polished heist movie
","Intelligent, professionally made, very polished, and still with the streak of independence that has made Spike Lee's movies so famous, Inside Man demonstrates how to have a commercial cops-and-robbers movie that still retains artistic integrity and the power to entertain, thrill, and engage an adult audience. It's fast moving and witty, keeps you guessing to the end, and is sufficiently mentally stimulating to inspire conversation on the way home without intruding on your apres-cinema meal.Clive Owen is the heist mastermind, relating his perfect crime to the camera at outset before going to flashback. Denzel Washington is the New York detective who specialises in hostage negotiation. Christopher Plummer is the chairman of the bank's board of directors and maybe has more to lose than just the money. He consults Jodie Foster, a mysterious and powerful top-notch 'fixer' Â– a power-broker who can deliver.As the bank robbers lock themselves in, NYPD swing into action with crowd control (heavy-handed of course), an array of impressive equipment, and radio transmitters in pizza boxes. It's a convincing and exciting picture of Manhattan in full flow. Interspersed throughout the movie, post-bank-break-in testimonials from the hostages offer tantalising clues, but Owen and Washington are extremely clever at second guessing each other so you have to work hard to outwit both of them. The official website has an eight-page 'Hostage Negotiator's Handbook' as well as test scenarios in case you want to practice your skills first, but you'll need to be very smart to figure out the bottom line and how it's being achieved until all is revealed.Spike Lee, normally more at home making hard-hitting social commentary films, shows he is more than capable of turning out a faultless thriller (though he doesn't miss the chance to have a dig at policy brutality, racism and a few of his other favourite topics in passing). At over two hours long, mostly spent on a state of siege inside and outside the bank, Lee performs an admirable job in maintaining tension in the absence of car chases, murders and explosions. The 'hostage debriefings' are shot with subdued, almost greenish light, and contrast with the bright colours of the main action. The script is cleverly written, both in the ingeniousness of its plot and with its occasional burst of welcome humour. Actors are well-cast and used to best advantage, from Owen's insidious genius and Washington's intelligent rage to Jodie Foster who is a bit like a latter day Mata Hari that can put either of them in their place and almost without pausing for breath.This is a film that isn't the mindless, run-off-the-mill bank-robbery movie that audiences could be forgiven for expecting in the first half-hour, so it may disappoint those who wanted something less challenging. Inside Man, with its all-American credentials, never patronises its audience. Although there are some moral dimensions worth pondering, it doesn't have the angst-ridden agendas or unevenness of Spike Lee's earlier movies and is undoubtedly the director's most mature movie to date.",8,2,4,26 March 2006
The Da Vinci Code," A conspiracy theorist's wet dream
","Like a conspiracy theorist's wet dream, The Da Vinci Code arrives on our screens claiming to be a work of fiction but enticing us to believe e semi-revealed and darkly hinted substructure of fact.Tom Hanks leads the fray in this passable but over-hyped thriller about one cult dedicated to exposing 'the truth'about Christianity (and the Roman Catholic Church in particular) and another cult (Opus Dei, one of the more extreme branches of the Vatican autocracy) dedicated to preserving the status quo.The plot gets going with a murder and the discovery of a blood line going back to a marriage between Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene. This central premise is fairly weak: the war between the protagonists is based on the idea that, if this central truth is revealed, then Christianity (and the 2000 years of oppression that goes with, specifically that of women and of science) will simply crumble. It is weak firstly because there is little to suggest that burying one part of a doctrine will cause loss of belief in the whole - where external proof is overpowering, religions generally just adapt. Secondly, to have any real weight, the blood line idea would need to include some suggestion that Jesus'powers could have been transmitted genetically - which is not developed in this film.Like many a heaven-and-hell film, the Da Vinci Code swells or deadens in the imagination according to whether we hold personal belief in the symbols (to be impressed or frightened by God or the Devil you have to have some suspension-of-disbelief that says they can exist). To some devout Christians, this film will seem heretical, as it questions articles of faith (at one cinema, I was picketed by a man distributing leaflets urging doctrinal belief). To the rationalist who thinks there is little historical evidence for the Jesus Christ of the Gospels anyway, it's a non-starter to quibble over whether the alleged central character did or didn't have sex with, or married, an alleged prostitute - it is just these religious folk arguing over details of their belief system.The wider importance, if any, of The Da Vinci Code is probably somewhere in the middle. As a movie, it would be forgettable, but the social furore has guaranteed box office and discussion. Those of us who are not overly bothered either way about the historical accuracy of the Gospels have been largely disinclined to research the basis of a belief system that has dominated western culture for two millennium. The film at least suggests one could ask questions. For those doing so, a tantalising mix of fact and fiction have been unravelled - not in any quest for the truth but just for the sake of telling a good yarn.'How do we penetrate historical distortion' asks the professor played by Hanks. Well, Tom, not by tripping out on psychedelic symbols that can be interpreted a million ways and one. The movie's assertion that the Council of Nicea 'fixed'what was, and what was not, to be believed is roughly correct, but historians may rightly question the extent of the cover up. There is no reason to suggest there wasn't an actual man called Jesus Christ - it was a common enough name - but it might raise eyebrows among the scientifically minded that the particular man of the Gospels went unnoticed by all his contemporaries and that all 'records'of him were compiled at a much later date. Or that much of the texts, including descriptions of attributed miracles, were lifted word for word from the accounts of lives of pre- Jesus Christ characters. None of this proves he didn't exist of course, but neither does it prove that he did. For our story, we have to believe that he did exist, so accounts of what the Nicean Council got up to have received some poetical licence. Whether the Christ of the Gospels existed or not, he is a remarkable figure that many might find inspiring - and it is this type of catch-all which Hanks ultimately finds useful.Predictably, the film ends just as messily, with a few nice warm fuzzy truisms and beautiful photography of Rosslyn Chapel. Hopefully it won't get overrun by tourists - last time I was there it was guarded by several goats.The film has made a spectacular amount of money (which hardly would have happened without the legends of Christianity to plagiarise), and the attendant publicity probably hasn't done the church nay harm financially either. Let us hope it will also encourage some people to develop their enquiring minds.",6,10,20,19 May 2006

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A children's classic
","Quite watchable but basically a children's classic that has adult audiences agog on the basis of the books. The book was exceptionally well-written and this is probably one of the things that draws in the adult reader. The film, on the other hand, whilst a reasonably faithful and engaging adaptation, adds little beyond putting amiable faces to the names of the characters. All very competent and a must see for any Potter fans, but hardly outstanding in its own right.",5,0,1,11 November 2001
The Fountain," Visual poetry
","In Requiem for a Dream, director Darren Aronofsky and cinematographer Matthew Libatique used innovative techniques to mimic the effects of drugs taken by the film's protagonists, fish eye lenses deforming the living space and fast motion distorting the conversation time-frame. In The Fountain, the same team attempt to convey more of a mystical experience, with story layers little more than props for elaborate and stunning visual metaphors.On a basic level, Hugh Jackman represents man's eternal struggle to save the woman he loves. In 16th Century Spain, he is a Conquistador searching for the Fountain of Youth in a Mayan Garden of Eden. When he succeeds, Queen Isabel of Spain will be his Eve. As a modern day scientist, he is trying to find a cure to save his wife, Izzi, who is dying of cancer and who is also writing a book called The Fountain. As a 26th Century astronaut, he is trying to grasp these mysteries that have always seemed just out of reach.The genre and style of the film, like its subject matter, is elusive. At first, it seems determinedly weird, like David Lynch with no clues. As it develops, there is more than a nod to the elaborate aesthetic of films like Cremaster or the favourite of psychedelic cinema-goers, 2001. You become wrapped up in a visual overload of spectacular beauty (but if you were thinking of casually popping some acid before going to see it, you should be aware that there are also many dark, menacing images). This is no sanitised flight of fancy - it has more in common with Pan's Labyrinth than Star Trek. The futuristic images have an almost Matthew Barney -like organic evolution to them, whereas those of the Spanish Inquisition create a mandala of horror that fascinates at the same time that it shocks. A sense of Pandorian menace is rarely far from the explosion of visual beauty that constantly assaults our senses.So what of the story? It is here that The Fountain is at its weakest. It creates intoxicating images of life, death, and re-birth but the theoretical connections are hazy at best. In the most developed of the tripartite, intertextual stories, Dr Tom Crio's experiments on monkeys will, he hopes, yield a method of shrinking the brain tumour affecting his wife. It is his love for her that motivates him to push beyond protocol. It also blinds him to the fact that he is making a remarkable scientific breakthrough - that of reversing the aging process. The film delicately weaves fringe science, Mayan myth, and symbols of the memories and inspirations that live forever when someone dies. We see the conflict of scientific and artistic temperaments - Tommy never, it seems, has enough time to explore the simple poetry of life with Izzi, with things like the first snow. She wants him to help her finish her book. 'Please, leave me alone - I don't know how it ends,' he says to her early on. The words haunt him later as they take on a different meaning.A haunting score and remarkable special effects support a movie that has more talent than there were perhaps dollars to support. The Fountain is avant-garde and so far from the mainstream that you shouldn't even consider it unless you are prepared for a serious challenge. But if you are, you may be amply rewarded. The feint-hearted will dismiss it as a pretentious mess while aficionados will extol its haunting beauty. Whatever you do, don't even think of watching it on DVD.",8,1,2,29 January 2007
Mystic River," A good film - but not the cinematic masterpiece or great moral challenge it maybe should have been
","Mystic River deals with three men, once boyhood friends, who all estrange the people closest to them. Their characters become flawed because of events, of how they choose to be, or their calling. It doesn't really say anything profound, but the acting and screenplay in the first half are quite good. Brian Helgeland, whose script writing seems to veer between brilliant (L.A. Confidential) and fairly abysmal (The Sin Eater), provides three quarters of sheer maestro, a story that unfolds with a growing sense of unease; characters that, as in real life, feel no need to state the obvious but let us piece together clues. But a gripping story of childhood bonds gone bad, murder, the frailty of human certainty and belief in flawed values Â– all wonderful elements that should offer a filmmaker so much Â– are stymied by flimsy resolutions and ultimately unlovable characters. An edge of the seat mystery builds to a limp climax that rather suggests they ran out of money, or film or ideas. There is no great moral dilemma as some critics have tried to suggest Â– all the characters try to do good in their own screwed up way, some with better intentions than others, and most of them fail. Mystic River has a stellar cast Â– Tim Robbins, Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon to name a few Â– and there are some excellent performances. Penn, in the lead role, is sadly perhaps the weakest of these three as he is seems far too conscious of those Â‘Oscar worthy moments', with the camera closing in for yet another close-up of his lingering, tortured, seemingly over-rehearsed expressions. Actors who go through this phase need a rapid infusion of French Cinema to correct their hyperbaric egos if they wish to ascend loftily and gracefully through stardom. Robbins and Bacon seem far more comfortable with their roles, without the need to be centre stage quite so much, and Marcia Gay Harden, who has already collected one Oscar for her role in Pollock, is quite superb, playing a long suffering wife with what seems like suppressed hysteria growing into panic. Mystic River is a good film and worth going to see - but such a shame it isn't another cinematic masterpiece we feel we can still hope for from director Clint Eastwood.",7,19,37,27 October 2003

The Holiday," Swiss Chocolate of Romantic Comedies
","Do you like chocolate? Do you know that moment, even before you put it in your mouth? You can imagine that taste. You can feel that rich sweetness on your tongue, the smoothness going around your mouth . . .The Holiday is a romantic comedy. You know what that means. And if you don't like romantic comedies, don't go and see it. If you do, you will know what to expect. The mushy feelings creeping up on you. All those 'If Only . . .' emotions telling you there is a lovely place somewhere in which people fall in love and everything works out kinda perfect. If only for a while . . . say, for the holiday period over Christmas and New Year . . . or for the 138 minutes which this film lasts.Two Women on the Verge of Emotional Breakdown do holiday house swap. They escape lovelorn predicaments and find 'unexpected' love on their opposite sides of the Atlantic. Cue picturesque English country house just the way Americans imagine it (with sheep out the back). Cue enormous L.A. mansion with swimming pool (just the way Brits imagine it).Cameron Diaz is Amanda, owner of a movie-trailers editing firm. Since she's played the same comedy character several times, there are few surprises; but an excellent script, written directly for her and the other three leading stars, projects it rather better than average. Kate Winslet as Iris, a successful writer on The Telegraph, is more nuanced: an actor with considerable range, we cannot but help admire the way she does 'pathetic girl' rather beautifully in a role that she could manage with one hand counting the ways to have fun and get paid simultaneously.Formulaic it is (wonderful women with scoundrelly fellas eventually get The Real Men They Deserve - meeting puppy dogs, children, and falling snowflakes on the way of course). But, well-done within a narrow genre, it still stands out. No-brainers like this tend to have dumb scripts and dumber acting, but The Holiday contains warm, natural dialogue and heartfelt chemistry. If this was the 40's, you'd want Jude Law and Cameron Diaz to get married off-screen afterwards. Charismatic and entertaining, unless you find Diaz, Law or Winslet personally irritating (some people do), they are a joy to watch, filling their parts with love and light. Excellent production values keep the rather trite story flowing. Everything is picture-perfect, long lenses flattering the features of the already handsome stars, filters and soft-focuses carefully delineating the mood.There is an overall honesty to the performances. 'You look like my Barbie!' delights a four-year-old excitedly to Diaz. Ironic? But said with so much affection it is self-deprecating rather than cutting. Jack Black struggles to get out of his music-and-silly-faces typecasting but just manages to look the part for an intellectual Iris who is not attracted to skin-deep. Jude Law, on the other hand, could be an advert for men's skin cream, and too rounded a character to be mere pin-up material.With more Christmas songs than you can shake a piece of tinsel at, The Holiday is a warm, snuggly romance to lose yourself in before coming firmly back down to planet earth. It might be shallow, but it's seasonal entertainment - and a Swiss chocolate of romantic comedies.",7,308,397,28 November 2006
Steve Jobs," A sad use of cinematic talent
","No-one can deny the superb acting or Boyle's talent in this film. Yet even if it is admittedly 'not a documentary' it seems a shameful use of someone's name, a vicious character assassination on one of the greatest minds of recent times and whose genius changed so much in the world. Almost any of the fact-checks now available demonstrate that the key emotional and historical events are untrue, untruths that characterise the film and try to redact the world of Steve Jobs. Boyle has done some great films, he did a great job as artistic director of the London Summer Olympics as well, but this movie is no gift to humanity. Vindictive, spiteful and an attempt to destroy the name of someone who was and will still be an inspiration to millions, Boyle can only hope that it will be forgotten, or written off as a rather sad, ill-judged attempt to cream publicity off a person who was much greater than he could ever be.It should be remembered as 'Ad Hominen Jobs.'",2,0,2,3 April 2016
War of the Worlds," Spielberg on good form
","If you like 'this sort of thing' then you will like this all bells-and-whistles Spielberg revamping of War of the Worlds. Spielberg's films tend to avoid deep meanings: they are true escapist story-telling. It's what he does best, and here he is well accompanied by Tom Cruise, an excellent actor who's calling is similarly 'unambitious' but who's reach doesn't exceed his grasp.Most people will know the basic story, so it needs an expert storyteller to make it fresh. It's set in the USA, in the present, and impressed me for its restrained use of special effects given the theme of invaders from outer space sterilising the earth of human 'bacteria' in order to settle. It starts off slowly enough, very laid back as we are eased into the characters of Ray Ferrier (Cruise), his estranged wife Mary Ann (Miranda Otto) and their two children, Justin and Dakota. The build up and invasion is almost secondary to the sense of rising panic, fear and ensuing desperation.Spielberg successfully manages the task of creating largescale film with a disaster convincingly global (see it on as large a screen as possible!) and there are plenty of opportunities for simple acts of heroism (adolescent Justin trying to save passengers on ferry), caring (a father doing his utmost for his rebellious children, even as he's scared out of his wits himself) and cutesiness (the young Dakota making every father's heart melt Â– and the acting of Dakota Fanning is one of the great child performances of the year).The actual aliens and their ships are impressive enough, but not ostentatiously so. Two thirds of the way through, Tim Robbins makes an appearance as an ambulance worker and his screen charisma makes an excellent balance to Cruise who could otherwise be too all-engulfing.Spielberg manages to wind it all up before it gets boring (running time is mercifully under two hours). As a fun ride, War of the Worlds is slick, thrilling, and worth every minute Â– but has little substance once you've left the theatre.",7,8,17,1 July 2005
Love Actually," Â‘Three Weddings and a Funeral' without the originality.
","Sometimes great movies aren't born Â– they're made. This is one of those. Lots of money, big names, and a well-tested formulaic script that is cleverly enough edited to be enjoyable (just). It's the perfect thing for a hangover when your brain is barely functioning. The loosely related love lives of eight couples, including a befuddled Hugh Grant as Prime Minister (who at least stands up to the American President Â– very topical) gallop into a hectic run-up to Christmas. Â‘Three Weddings and a Funeral' without the originality.",7,1,3,23 December 2003
There Will Be Blood," They don't make movies like they used to . . . except occasionally
","At a time when oil in movies is usually about modern day strife Â– Syriana, Total Denial, A Crude Awakening Â– cinema-goers are maybe ready for a good old fashioned epic about the pioneering days of the industry.There Will Be Blood follows Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis). A man of the earth in 1898. In a few years, he goes from precious metals to the black stuff. Plainview pits himself against the elements and always triumphs. And expects no less when people enter the equation.Plainview embodies the spirit of capitalism. Minus redeeming features. He digs. He conquers. He spits out blood and oil. And generally hates people. They have nothing that he can respect and God fares not much better. He can perfectly enunciate the necessary lip-service to appease either the Almighty or the Common Weal if business demands it, but only as a last resort.On the day that he opens a big new well, the local pastor (Abel) comes along to bless it. Plainview adapts the words and blesses it himself, leaving Abel speechless.Having bought up most of the land, or leases to drill oil, only one man Â– an old-timer named Bandy - stands in his way. Bandy will sell only on condition that Plainview is baptised. The humiliation at the hands of Abel is a grudge that will one day be settled.Various subplots involve a son who goes deaf and the seeming appearance of Plainview's brother. Both are beautifully woven into the story to examine the oil patriarch's human emotions - and lack of them.In some ways, There Will Be Blood recalls the 1956 James Dean film, Giant. Giant was based on the life of a Texas oilman, Glenn McCarthy. Daniel Day-Lewis' oil character reminds me somewhat of George W Bush. But I have to admit that the greedy win-at-any-cost picture is a little too black-and-white for me, even though I am no fan of profiteers who mix business with politics. Whatever human faults are triggered by the oil business, it is also the major enabler of our modern western society. Should the oil man not get some credit for the riches brought to the world, even if they were brought through selfish motives? In the demonization of Plainview, this is entirely ignored.There Will Be Blood is a superb achievement in film-making. A story from a traditional mould told with immense skill and gigantic performances. It grips from beginning to end and covers an important period of history. It is a great work easily accessible by every cinemagoer. Which puts it in a different category to director Paul Thomas Anderson's earlier works. I loved his Magnolia, but frogs falling from the sky are not everyone's idea of a good ending to an elaborate soap drama. There Will Be Blood is the film that will probably survive him and be looked back on with near universal respect.If I have one quibble, it is that the Christ and anti-Christ theme (or its Old Testament equivalent) is a little too simplistic, given too much emphasis, and submerges a plot that could easily raise the themes to a more nuanced and uplifting worldview. But don't let that put you off going to see it. This is a towering adventure not to be missed!",9,1,4,5 February 2008
Downfall," Possibly one of the most remarkable documentary dramas ever made
","Downfall is an achievement on a tremendous scale, and all the better for being a German film since it chronicles the final days of a Hitler, who not only devastated half the known world and a very large number of Jews, but also most of his own country and the people who had put their trust in him long before he ascended to a position where he could abuse it on such a massive scale. It is a fascinating story because although we feel we 'know' it, it has never really been told on film, and never so forcefully or by his own countrymen (who of course play Germans, good and bad, much better than American imitations in Hollywood!) The film also comes at a watershed where Germans are coming to accept their history, as is the rest of the world, without feeling they have to apologise for Hitler at every breath. German people of that time, it might be argued, were also (at least very many of them) victims of a madman who were forced to endure the destruction wrought by the Allied bombing. That is true of almost any horrific dictator, but the film is careful not to over-humanise him. We see those (some, not all) of those near to him secretly horrified at his views - both regarding the destruction of Jews and the destruction of his own people. But the credits also point out that, even among the populace, ignorance was no excuse. Downfall is no revisionist whitewash - it is perhaps as honest an attempt as any could be to portray the last days of a madman, still clinging ferociously to power. Everyone whose life or loved ones was badly affected by Hitler has the right to feel aggrieved, but it is not, for instance, limited to Jews or even non-Germans.As a documentary-style drama, Downfall is so convincing that we do feel we are watching the actual characters from history. We also see a range of German people, from equally fanatical, evil-minded officers, to those who were simply in the grip of his power, to the women in his life, to some of the ordinary German people who had little idea of what was happening or others that were simply strung up or treated as expendable for having put Hitler in power in the first place. Hitler's psychology is also interesting. We almost see his fatal flaws come to light, his disrespect for equality, his determination to put his own skewed philosophy before people (even the citizens of Berlin in the bunker above him). It asks if the one of the strengths of the Allies was a love of humanity, a desire to work for the common good. It reminded me that mankind as a species, however competitive, has achieved dominance over the animal kingdom and flourished largely through a sophisticated system of cooperation and the ability to build trust Easily one of the most memorable dramas about Hitler ever made, Downfall will burn into your brain notwithstanding the German subtitles.",8,2,5,1 April 2005
The Last King of Scotland," Missed opportunities
","It's Scotland 1970 and Nicholas is going semi- skinny-dipping in some chilly loch. With him are a bunch of other new medical graduates, Afterwards he goes home for a sherry with overly-traditional parents. Or at least until the opening credits. By then, desperate to get away, he spins the globe and ends up amid hot dusty colours and rich vibrant sounds in Uganda. (You will have to work very hard to divine any deep meaning to the title.) Nicholas is a blue-eyed boy with lots of testosterone. His hormones compete for attention with newly acquired medical skills. Out in the backwoods, he assists a lone doctor and tries to seduce the doctor's wife (played by Gillian Anderson). Yet a string of coincidences soon has Nicholas playing Personal Doctor to the new President, Idi Amin.As Amin's regime gets under way, young Nick realises he's sold his soul as it were. He's surrounded by a life of luxury - one that is paid for with the blood of hundreds of thousands of Ugandans. Worse still, 'Daddy' Amin is in no mood to let him leave.Expect strong performances, plenty of brutality, a tense ending, and a very nasty little scene in the airport duty free. Plus some convincingly mutilated bodies in the mortuary. A thriller 'inspired by true events', The Last King of Scotland is a competent if slightly raggedy film that sticks in the mind.On the down side, it's shot on grainy 16mm blown up to 35mm. The overall visual effect often lacks definition to the point of fuzziness. The bigger shortfall is that it has nothing to say beyond its own basic story. It could be called yet another white-conscience-in-Africa film. We hear how the Brits helped Amin to power: it would have been an ideal opportunity to suggest that countries cannot easily be 'helped' towards a better form of government until they are ready (or have earned it themselves, and so learning to appreciate and maintain it).The Last King of Scotland lacks the moral complexity it should have. It misses, for instance, any chance to say anything of importance about the wider world or its subject matter. Unlike Constant Gardener, Tsotsi or Shooting Dogs, it concentrates mostly on weak or corrupt characters, which can make for unsatisfying viewing. Even the moral dilemmas of the young doctor are undeveloped. We watch an action-driven plot where, unless we are totally ignorant of history, we know exactly what sort of atrocities Amin will eventually get up to. The horror has been diluted; the intellectual component edited out. For a thriller, it often leaves much to be desired and we might wonder if Director Kevin Macdonald is still too wedded to the documentary genre that his been his mainstay until now.Idi Amin had a fixation for Scotland. He gave himself many grandiose titles including 'Last King of Scotland'. One painter depicted him as Scotland's Bonnie Prince Charlie, the 'Young Pretender', who led the fight against the English army but was defeated at Culloden. Such a comparison is odious and appears to hold no deeper meaning than was capable of the disordered mind of Amin (who saw a comparison between two countries 'seeking to free themselves from the yoke of English imperialism'). It does however flesh out the almost mythical figure of Idi Amin. The character of Nicholas would hold our interest more if we did not have to credit a university mind with such stupidity in personal relations. While The Last King of Scotland has many good features, including performances that raise it well above the average, it surely deserved more. Early on in the film, the warmth and spirit of rural Uganda shines through. That humanity might have made a more moving bookend than the cold fact of numbers killed that appears before the closing credits.",6,7,9,13 January 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," Clever intellectual wizardry
","What if you only realised the importance of your life only days before you lost it? Even knowing when or how you will die (not such a fatuous idea with the completion of the Genome Project) raises difficult questions about how much we really want to know about ourselves.Such a theme is usually simplified and subsumed into religious-based tales such as It's a Wonderful Life, but taken as an idea in its own right it has considerable intellectual weight. Harold Crick finds himself the main character in a story as it unfolds, but his annoyance quickly shifts gear as he is aware of the author saying, 'Little did he know . . . it would lead to his imminent death.'Not the mindless comedy that the trailer suggests, Stranger Than Fiction is a precise and fairly cerebral story where the laughs stem more from individually appreciating certain aspects of its cleverness rather than any contrived humour. The surface story is of a man who lives a humdrum if 'successful' life and is awakened to a more three dimensional existence by falling in love. The additional elements will either delight or annoy. IRS auditor Crick (Will Ferrell) starts hearing a voice in his head. It is that of Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), a famous author. She describes exactly what he is doing but with a rather better vocabulary than he possesses. When she announces his imminent death, he takes drastic steps to meet her and persuade her to change the ending of her novel.The characterisation, casting and acting is spot-on. Thompson is at her most refreshingly deranged as the harassed and reclusive author. With a literary equivalence of method acting, Eiffel balances on the edge of her desk trying to imagine the thoughts of someone about to make a suicide jump. She sits in the freezing drizzle watching cars cross a bridge to imagine an accident. Her rants at her 'editorial assistant' (who uses more traditional methods of accessing imagination) give a convincing insight into the creative process. While the voice in Crick's head is stereotypical Thompson, the fuller, isolated character, when we meet her, is a minor revelation. 'I don't need a nicotine patch,' she declaims angrily to her assistant. 'I smoke cigarettes.'Maggie Gyllenhaal, as law drop-out turned baker Ana Pascal, sparkles, glows and is sexily alluring and radiant with passionate love of life - and she manages to light up the screen faster than, say, even Juliette Binoche in Chocolat. Dustin Hoffman has the least challenging of the main parts, but he endows his character (an eminent professor of literature) with the gravitas needed to take ideas of literary interconnectedness seriously. Will Ferrell gives a remarkable break-out performance in a straight role, reminiscent of Jim Carrey in The Truman Show. He is superbly suited to the part as audiences expect him to be a shallow comedy character and here he is trying the find the substantial person inside himself. Most of the audience are concentrating so much on the film's intricate hypothesis and how it is worked out, that only afterwards do we realise what a range of emotions Ferrell has to portray with complete seriousness.Novelist Kay Eiffel (Thompson) anthropomorphises things like Crick's watch (similarly the official website says, in real time, 'As the cursor waited anxiously for the site to load, it couldn't help but feel an overwhelming sense of elation.') We sense a life-imbuing process that might even be likened to what an actor does with his character; but the film goes a stage further by drawing a similarity with the essentially lifeless, clockwork existence of the IRS auditor whose only escape is discovering love with Pascal. His quest is aided by fictional plot analysis from Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman) and of course begs the question, what is fiction?Director Marc Forster showed consummate skill in portraying the positive escapism of JM Barrie's creative Peter-Pan-writing in Finding Neverland. With Stranger Than Fiction, he has teamed up with brilliant new dramatist Zach Helm. Helm is fascinated with the writing process in what he calls a larger Post-Modern movement. 'From Pirandello, to Brecht, to Wilder, to Stoppard, to Woody Allen to Wes Anderson, we can see the progression of a contemporary, self-aware, reality-bending and audience-involving wave in dramatic literature,' he says. 'I love to see Homer Simpson reacting to his creator, Matt Groenig, or the cast of 'Urinetown' complaining from the stage about their own title.'Even the street names, business names, and the characters' last names of Stranger Than Fiction are significant Â– Crick, Pascal, Eiffel, Escher, Banneker, Kronecker, Cayly, etc. are all puns on mathematicians who focused on the innate order of things. The invitation is to ask what is beyond the symmetry of things. Stranger Than Fiction meets even its most formidable challenge - making the ending nail-biting and moving after such surreal content. But the ultimate message of the film seems a little trite if it is supposedly coming from a groundbreaking author. Like the glimpses of Eiffel's book, we are given impressive mountains of style but little substance. As the film doesn't press the strengths forcefully by admitting in so many words what it is getting at, there is a chance you may not bother with the subtleties - in which case it adds up to very little.A superb testament to inventiveness and worthy of awards in many different categories, Stranger Than Fiction somehow falls short of being a masterpiece.",8,109,138,9 December 2006
The Reader," Thought-provoking, but not as philosophically penetrating as it needs to be
","Can you recall being read stories as a child? Warm and tucked up. In your bed. Feeling safe, secure, loved. And that wonderful, strong, all-knowing adult giving you undivided attention? You don't have to do anything. Wonderful tales race before your eyes. Lose yourself in the prince as he slays the dragon. Or the princess awoken with a kiss. When we awake as adults, we maybe re-create that security for ourselves. We read to get to sleep. We read to our own children. We enjoy worlds and emotions that give us respite from the hard business of living. Why not? I wondered if Hanna (Kate Winslet) had ever been read to as a child. A hard life shows on her face. She lives in a tiny apartment in Berlin. She gets by. But, more importantly, Hanna cannot rebuild her world through a half hour escape in a novel. Hanna cannot read.The Reader brings together familiar enough story lines Â– the seduction of a young boy by an older woman Â– the trial of a former SS guard Â– guilt Â– self-sacrifice Â– love found, then lost. But the emotional punch is delivered by mismatching our sympathies to the characters. The people we love turn out to be deeply flawed. But if we hold that against them, are we doing so to make ourselves feel better?Hanna has sex with young Michael, shortly before his sixteenth birthday. We are encouraged to just accept it. Any analysing over whether it was 'wrong' or screwed Michael up emotionally can be done by those diehards in the cafe after the film. More pertinent at the time is their genuine affection, the superb acting, and the imaginative love-making between an extremely buff Michael and a rather fit-looking Kate Winslet. Winslet/Hanna is the constant transformation throughout our film. She is harsh, convincingly Germanic, and ages convincingly from her thirties to her seventies. It's a make-up job that almost rivals Kidman's Virginia Woolf in director Stephen Daldry's earlier masterpiece, The Hours.Hanna is brutally honest with herself about almost everything. Except one thing. She is deeply ashamed of being illiterate. She hides it from Michael, who nevertheless senses it. He makes a habit of reading to her. Everything from Homer's Odyssey and Tolstoy to comic books and back again to Chekhov. We realise how important it is to her: she announces to him that he will read to her before making love, not afterwards.Michael continues schooling to become a lawyer. Hanna is offered a promotion from her bus conductor job Â– to work in an office. This is a disaster Â– as she can't read. She throws a hissy fit at puzzled Michael and breaks up their affair. Later, when we learn she had once accepted work as an SS guard instead of a step up in her old job, we can secretly suspect the same reason.Although Hanna is guilty of terrible crimes in the past, our sympathies are not so much with her victims. The one survivor has written a damning book and patently done rather well for herself. Elegant and tall in contrast to the haggard and drawn guards on trial. Those indicted are a handful out of tens of thousands. Symbolic sacrifices. Their incarceration allowing the silent others to feel sanctified. Germany righteously punishes its own. Jews are avenged. Justice is seen to be done. But we see Hanna's co-accused gang up on her. She confesses to something she could not have committed. A personal surrender, an over-redemption.Michael doesn't announce a truth that would mitigate her sentence. He is too ashamed to be connected to her. He disguises it as 'respecting her wishes.' Like Odysseus secretly observing Penelope, he stays incognito. Michael's 'respectable shame' becomes the shame of humanity, unable to forgive, whatever the cost.Ralph Fiennes, as the older Michael, is well-cast. Although the opening scene of The Reader recalls Constant Gardener (white collar chap with nude woman wandering around apartment), Michael is more of a throwback to the slimy characters that Fiennes specialises in.At this point I differed from my viewing companion on the film. She declared it one of the saddest films she had ever seen. While I could not get it out of my mind what a slimeball Michael was. We both agreed it was fundamentally a love story. But for me it was marred by an increasing sense of cynicism. Catharsis for whom? As the emotional valence ratchets up scene by scene, I feel sucked into a sick psychopathology of characters whose stunted development was hardly a matter for theatrical wallowing. And while Winslet ages forty years in the course of the movie, Michael simply has two ages played by two actors. At one point Â– amid the dizzying flashbacks and forwards Â– I had to believe Fiennes was twenty years younger as he was wearing a jumper instead of a tie.David Hare has done an admirable job with the screenplay. But the philosophical questioning of attitudes to people who helped the Nazis is hard to portray with cinema's broad brush. In The Hours, Hare (and Daldry) had both the genius of Virginia Woolf's ideas and Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer-winning modern take to work from. With The Reader, Bernhard Schlink's semi-autobiographical novel has generated a film that is thought-provoking rather than yielding insight. Hanna's illiteracy is his metaphor for modern understanding of the Holocaust. We weren't there. We can't understand. 'What would you do?' Hanna asks the judge, not rhetorically, but wanting an answer.And what would you do, if you couldn't live with what you've done? Even if you felt you'd had no choice? And if even the healing fantasy world of fiction is finally denied you? The Reader is a story that puts nothing to bed.",7,2,3,4 January 2009
Jaws," More than a fast-food lunch
","Do you love the water?Given director Steven Spielberg's predilection for calling his more sensational films 'fast-food movies', anyone approaching Jaws for the first time might feel an extra reason for combining horror and camp humour in their advance thoughts. There is always a fairground attraction element in revisiting old scary movies. Jumping out of our seats is combined with a know-all feeling that the special effects are somewhat dated. But as there is much more to Jaws than a rather unrealistic model shark, it still has plenty of power to thrill.The basic story is simple enough. A killer shark threatens a popular beach resort and people are slow to believe it for fear of lost revenue. Spielberg notches up the emotional tension with a range of equally iconic characters, deft camera work and an ominous music by John Williams. The memorable leitmotif - low thumping staccato notes like a heart pounding too quickly - announces the approach of the shark so effectively that the sound scares us half to death even before any visual sighting.The three main characters, Roy Scheider as Police Chief Martin Brody, Richard Dreyfuss as rational scientist Matt Hooper, and Robert Shaw's grizzled man-of-the-sea Quint, offer three very different personalities with different emotional trigger points. The deft editing produces constant mood switching that keeps us on the edge of our seats for all of them, plus some puppy dogs and a young-and-beautiful surf set to pull in anyone not moved by the more high-minded heroes. A severed arm is discovered on the beach in a warm community context. Our nerdy policeman is visibly upset.These superb performances are supported by inventive camera-work. Look out for the moment when Dreyfuss, getting a shoulder-rub from his wife, witnesses a shark attack on the beach. The camera tracks forward while zooming back so Dreyfuss' image stays constant but the perspective changes suddenly - it's as if the background closes behind him. This disorientating effect (famously used by Hitchcock in Vertigo) prepares us with stomach-churning anticipation for a glimpse of the shark.Together with The Exorcist and Star Wars, Jaws heralded the advent of the modern blockbuster. Released on multiple screens without the usual word-of-mouth advertising, going to see them became a cultural necessity. Jaws is a well-made, nuanced, gamble of a film that paid off handsomely and also assured Spielberg's future. The era it heralded also, unfortunately, opened the floodgates for much less worthy films.Many years on, Jaws still has the power to thrill - and perhaps make you think twice when going skinny-dipping.",9,0,1,22 December 2006
The Wrestler," artfully arranged, well-acted lump of low-life fare
","How low can you go Â– and still tart something up enough to interest people with good taste?The French make wonderful delicacies out of animal parts. Most people would grimace in the other direction while depositing such offal in the trash. Turner-Prize hopefuls have entered aesthetically arranged urinals Â– and convinced us it is art. In the world of film, Trainspotting plumbed the depths of vomit, excrement and drug-taking Â– yet it was hilarious. The Wrestler, on the other hand, is clever but just plain foul.It's clever because it features an outstanding performance by Mickey Rourke more or less playing himself. And because of some clever analogies between vicious wrestling and seedy lap-dancing Â– I kid you not. But it's still two hours of crowds lapping up grown men and women flogging their meat like animals. Rourke's character Randy cuts himself for the spectators, batters himself and opponents over the head with chairs and an artificial leg, and pumps his body with enough drugs to feed the whole of Colombia. Marisa Tomei as the lap-dancer with a heart of Â– whatever the hearts of trailer-trash single mothers are made out of Â– struts her stuff in front of abusive audiences. At one point she bends over and I am in serious doubt as to whether any dental floss still covers the space between her lower molars. I needn't have worried. The camera obligingly repeats the shot a few seconds later. Randy spam-for-brains has an emotional side. We are supposed to feel touched the way we might if an aunt with Alzheimer's lovingly made beef stew with dog-meat. So throw in a long-lost daughter who has had the good sense to tell Randy to f-off. Randy cries. He makes half-hearted attempts to win her back. Poor sod. A heart-attack momentarily jingle-jangles his single brain cell into thinking he should get a life. But a scene with him serving at a deli counter is woefully underdeveloped even if it's the best bit in the movie. Randy is, however, a believable individual. Tomei's storyline is a little less credible, even with superlative acting. Momentarily trying to transform herself into a Real Person and return the affection of Mr Meat-Paws runs counter to the background already created for her character. Both of them, having lived a life of falsehood, wonder what it would be like to come to terms with who they are.But don't expect any happy endings from Mr Requiem-for-a-Dream Aronofsky. This is a director who has 20/20 vision to see art in a lump of poo. He is so totally not going to let you off the hook. Since he has obvious talent, one wishfully wonders how he might broaden his horizons. Say, to something inspiring, entertaining or mildly informative. I have no objection to portraying violence, degradation, and even graphic sexuality more explicit than a coal-miner's w*nk-fantasy. Which is more than you get here. For instance, Hunger, a violent (and even more realistic) film about the Maze Prison, had uplifting themes of human courage. The gynaecological explicitness of Breillat's films questions our understanding of sex in real terms. Even Emmanuelle could break up a long night of boredom. But the Wrestler satisfies neither one camp nor the other. It doesn't, for instance, show us the mistakes he made for his slide into the Dumb Hulk. (A biopic of Mickey Rourke's real life would have been infinitely more interesting.)Arofnofsky has let go of his artistic pretensions that at least started so well in Requiem for a Dream. After people found his next movie, The Fountain, too obscure, I think he maybe just gave up. Instead of admitting that artistic freedom involves mistakes and close calls, he has tried to make a mainstream hit. Unfortunately, the Wrestler has none of the greatness that made Rocky so memorable. It has none of the entertainment flair that made even Flashdance so watchable. And if you take your significant other to watch it, you may feel seriously embarrassed in the process.The Wrestler will have its fans. People who rightly proclaim its realism (storyline excepted). Or are so swayed by Rourke's performance that they find the film more than bearable. And if you can no longer get your video of dog-fights with your under-the-counter porn, maybe this is just the movie for you.",4,7,15,19 January 2009
Hitch," Amiable romantic comedy
","Amiable romantic comedy starring Will Smith in one his better roles as the 'Date Doctor' Alex 'Hitch' Hitchens advising high flying business execs on how to date the girl of their dreams. A subplot follows Hitch battling against the odds to woo gossip columnist Sara (Eva Mendes) who is a career girl 'sworn off men'.I find my attention span for Will Smith's characters is usually pretty limited, but I managed to find him likable for the whole of this (slightly overlong) movie. Although the plot is fairly predictable, and the goons needing makeovers are pretty standard, the movie manages to be consistently amusing and a lot of the dating 'tips' are quite good common sense. Hitch is also a man with his heart in the right place - he wants to 'create opportunities' rather than teach men how to 'score'. He is almost the Dr Jekyll of the Dr Hyde character created by Tom Cruise's memorable performance in Magnolia as the dating guru who teaches men to get laid in the most cynical of fashion.There's also the odd gem under the mishmash of this fairly mindless entertainment such as 'Life is not measured by the breaths we take but by the moments that take our breath away' ( - not an original line, but quite a beautiful one). Hitch is mainstream, lightweight but thoroughly enjoyable date movie - don't expect too much and you may be pleasantly surprised.",7,0,0,20 March 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Not bad for a Star Wars movie - though that's not really saying much
","I had had a difficult day and needed some mindless entertainment. I wasn't disappointed. Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith has had some of the worst elements of the series pruned - gone are most of the irritating cuddly little creatures aimed at the spin-off toys market (there's no shortage of other spin-offs), and the disingenuous racist stereotypes suggested in other episodes seem to have been cleaned up. It even has a degree of political correctness with a throwaway jibe that recalls George (bad Jedi: 'If you're not with me, you are my enemy') Bush and the parallels with modern day dictators (whether they trumpet a corrupt democracy or a brutal regime behind their warmongering) are apparent. One of the flaws of other Star Wars episodes has been the simplistic 'ultimate good versus ultimate evil' debate - in this one, the two warring sides are seen as separated more by pain, fear, misunderstanding and miscommunication than anything else. There are slightly less overtly religious references, although 'The Force' still has an elitist hierarchy based on some poorly defined universal power. Probably the only character you'd trust to run anything might be the genuinely peace-loving and diplomatic Padme, a female icon played by Natalie Portman and love for whom sparks off more 'evil'.What of the film itself? As Star Wars films goes, it's not bad, but that isn't saying much. The dialogue is mostly trite, the acting wooden, and the cinematography could be aimed at a 12-year old with learning difficulties. Some of the special effects are quite nice - I particularly liked the cityscapes. If you've followed any of the other episodes and not been permanently turned off you'll probably go just to see what you're missing - and to get to see the genesis of the big bad Daath Vader. But it is a film that, without the marketing and money poured in to it, would still be firmly in the Saturday children's matinÃ©e slot if there still was one. The robots make funny, cutesy little squeaks (even in the vacuum of space or when trying not to be heard by other robots), affect gay walks, or (especially the baddie ones) sound a bit like they've strayed from a Mickey Mouse cartoon. In the old days, if you got confused as to who the good guys were, you could usually assume the black man was the bad guy. Nowadays that would lose too big a sector of the market so it's the ugly, deformed people who are bad guys (or bad robots): cute (or good-looking) equals goods guy. If good guys go bad they reassuringly become ugly or have funny eyes.Portman (who has a better stab at some real acting than any of the others) has a character that maintains or the traditional stereotypes of the subjugated woman - her main function in the film is to have babies. Remarkably, in a galaxy where the most unimaginably advanced medical techniques are routinely available in the blink of an eye, women, even quite important and well-placed women (ie important in relation to men) can die of childbirth. The fear that she will die in this way prompts superstitious Jedi warrior Anakin Skywalker not to seek out more reliable doctors and surgeons but to go a dangerous route to greater supernatural power to somehow 'protect' her. Women, being such weak creatures are (not unsurprisingly) largely noticeable by their absence in the important affairs of state where men decide how to blow each other up. It would be nice to think that George Lucas was suggesting this as irony - unfortunately he probably is not. His grasp of human rights is about as sturdy as any well-oiled social liberalite that, like the Republicans he lambastes, probably couldn't pronounce the names of half the places that America wages war on. Team America: World Police had a clearer take on such things. Unfortunately George Lucas is still on a galaxy far, far away, even if it will pump revenue back home to him, if not for light years, at least for a very long time to come.",6,9,15,22 May 2005
Ray," Informative biopic that entertains and inspires
","Most of us know that Ray Charles is something of a music legend. What this film does is show us the extent and range of his remarkable talent, the trials, tribulations and strength of character that got him there, and perhaps even shed some light on that most elusive of characteristics - the creative process itself.Born in poverty and going blind at an early age, Ray Charles honed his musical talents and sense of hearing partly from being shut out of the visual world and its many distractions, partly because music excited him so much, and partly, also I expect, because he was plain bored.His life story however is far from boring. He was what we would call a 'self-made man' and at a time when black people in America were the subject of much racial discrimination. His personal charisma and business sense were remarkable, as was his single-mindedness. Jamie Foxx delivers a career-high performance in an unshakably powerful lead role and the script sparkles with quips belying the ambiguous character of the star. For instance, we know that Ray Charles was to combine gospel music with something more up-tempo and cause an outcry. So it was quite in keeping with his character when he submits to his weakness for pretty women by telling his manager, 'Find me a church-trained woman without the church-trained attitude!'But the factor that got me hooked was watching how he made that x-factor leap from highly proficient singer-pianist to creative genius that is the stuff from which legends are born. Time and time again he would dumbfound critics by making unimagined musical leaps, directions, or combinations - and seemingly was always proved right. This is not the story of someone with a charmed life, but rather a biopic of the inner and outer life of a man who transformed music and himself in the process. He uses the good and the bad that life had to offer - and much of the bad, such as a period of drug addiction, was of his own making - and he used it to inform his music and push himself further and further to find expressions in music that hadn't been previously covered. In the process, we witness a gamut of human emotion, raw love, hate, jealousy, anger, betrayal, daring, all poured into his songs and performances and enriching them - and his audiences. The cooperation of Ray Charles himself in the making of the film before he dies, rather than glossing over any of his bad habits, seems to have authenticated the man and his all too human character and weaknesses.Ray is a long and unsycophantic movie that will nevertheless keep you glued to the edge of your seat for a full two and a half hours - after which, if you're anything like me, you'll want to go out and buy the soundtrack before you get home. In many ways, Ray is the all-round best film of the year, although parents might feel the drug references make it unsuitable for younger viewers.",8,1,3,25 January 2005
Bring It On," Flimsy stuff done rather well
","This is a movie where more talent than necessary has been invested in a film basically aimed at entertainment-seeking adolescents, people interested in dance routines, and a few older men who enjoy watching young girls jump about. It follows the fortunes of an award-winning cheerleader team and the hapless football team they support.A film about cheer leading, something that is, as far as I know, a uniquely American phenomenon, sounds pretty cheesy. The remarkable thing is that the acting and dialogue raise it a bit above the minimum required and the cheer leading dance sequences are a revelation for anyone who thought it was just about waving arms in the air and shouting support for the football team.Gabrielle Union (10 Things I Hate About You) and Kirsten Dunst (Drop Dead Gorgeous & Virgin Suicides) were both cheerleaders at school - did this help with the authenticity? The amazing routines are quite dazzling to watch - requiring a very high level of stamina, physical fitness, athletic ability and dance technique. The overhead panning brings them almost to the level some of the old song and dance movie scenes with synchronized dancing. Synchronized dance in itself is difficult stuff, but fast paced synchronized dancing (to a great soundtrack, by the way) involving major aerial throws, difficult jive moves and lots of personality thrown in, is quite an achievement.The film never takes itself too seriously, from the football announcer who says at the end of the match, 'our next defeat is scheduled for next Tuesday', to the out-takes while the credits roll, the attitude is firmly tongue in cheek.The script includes plenty of teenage bitching reminiscent of Clueless (adolescents often seem to show their intellectual prowess at clever, and often vicious repartee, that is all par for the course), but the acting is convincing and even the awkward issues of race and homosexuality are handled well. One cannot but help congratulate them for making a good film out of such a flimsy premise.",5,56,72,22 October 2000
The Good Shepherd," A magnificent backdrop but not compelling enough
","The 'Good Shepherd' has always struck me as a kind of strange symbol for Christianity. Shepherds look after their flocks so the sheep can be killed and eaten. What's good about that? Fortunately, sheep don't have the intelligence to be paranoid.With Bourne Identity movies under his belt, Matt Damon has a good pedigree to play spy movies. Is this one a killer or dead on arrival? With a budget of $85m, we've got Oscar-winning actors, writers, cinematographers, and more stars than flocks by night ever get to see. Pet project of actor-turning-director, Robert De Niro, The Good Shepherd tells a story of the CIA from its early days, weighing in at just under three hours.The scene before the opening credits is the one which the whole movie revolves around, so get your popcorn early. Woe-betide those people who straggled in ten minutes into the film, blocking my view, looking for a seat in the dark and then mumbling into their sweetie-wrappers. They won't get it. Which is a shame, because it's a tantalisingly mysterious and artistically remarkable shot.A couple are making love. We can't see them clearly and, as we know it's a spy film, you won't need a Pentagon computer to guess it's probably film from a hidden camera. 'You're safe here with me,' she whispers to him. Yeah right! Obviously they are key characters in a complex web of CIA chicanery, because Matt Damon and his team spend most of the movie trying to figure out who, when and where, and we have to wait till nearly the end to find out.But although The Good Shepherd is told from Damon's point of view, it's scope is epic, covering the years from 1939 before the CIA was even a speck in President Truman's eye, to 1961 and the Bay of Pigs. We see the founding years, the London Blitz, post-war reconstruction in Berlin, and increasingly intricate machinations as the Cold War gathers pace.Matt Damon (Edward Wilson) is recruited while still at Yale - and we see his face in one of the very few scenes where it holds anything but inscrutability. He camps it up in drag for a production of Gilbert& Sullivan. Later, he's initiated into a Yale secret society, the Skull and Bones. (This is a real society whose members include George W Bush and Bush Snr, as well as John Kerry.) He starts dating a deaf girl he feels genuine affection for, but she is slow off the mark and no competition for Clover (Angelina Jolie) who seduces him swiftly. Jolie doesn't feature in much of the movie, but when she does, she's as sexy as hell or acting her socks off. It's enough to make you wish she would put down her excellent humanitarian work long enough to take on more of the challenging parts for which is so eminently capable.Fast forward. A week after his dutiful wedding to a pregnant Clover, Edward is posted abroad for six years, during which time he learns to Trust No One. He also learns useful stuff like 'tying one's shoelaces' (code for 'bump them off please') and how to spot a German mistress telling porkies - and then tying one's shoelaces again. Every so often we flash forward to 1961 to an increasingly hemmed-in and worried Edward who's trying to figure out the pre-credits scene.This is not a whitewash film - most of the history has been painstakingly researched. People get bumped off or tortured, developing countries are subverted with economic dominance and espionage, and most of Edward's decisions are based on inaccurate or false information. But given what we know of CIA operations today, it feels a bit like a history of the United States that mentions, in passing, how terrible it was that we maybe killed some Indians. Instead of getting someone like John le CarrÃ© to write the script, or a CIA whistleblower like Philip Agee, we have polished performer and safe bet, Eric Roth. The Good Shepherd is a comprehensive collection of cinematic professionalism, but without the grit to make waves.Robert de Niro, in the director's chair, is sadly the weakest link. Although he handles it professionally, almost magisterially, he lacks the experience to slowly build momentum, convey gradual moral decay, or make this the Godfather standard-bearer of CIA films. He's done a fine job - just bitten off a bit more than he can chew. What he deserves credit for is attempting a classic depiction of one of the world's most important institutions and pulling it off with considerable dignity, if not quite the artistic flourish that he would have aspired to, given that his mentors are people like Francis Ford Coppola (who is executive producer). With sufficient dedication, it is easy to imagine De Niro pulling off an Oscar for direction in a future film: his grasp is very broad, and all it needs is tweaking.Of all the stellar names associated with this film, special mention should go to director of photography, Robert Richardson, whose beautiful lighting, compositions and framing give the Good Shepherd a very classy look. Using mise-en-scÃ¨ne rather than relentless action-effect, allows us time to soak up the atmosphere of lovingly reconstructed sets and adds to a feeling of historicity. Many of the English scenes are shot in subdued tones, reminiscent of The Godfather, and conveying a growing ominousness. Fades from archival footage to full colour are tastefully accomplished and maximise the effect of both. My one reservation is the over-use of unnecessary close-ups, which seems to suggest too keen an eye on the DVD market.The Good Shepherd is a slightly over-ambitious, over-long movie, but you should see it for Matt Damon's naked mud-wrestling and Angelina Jolie's hot vamp performance if nothing else. If you keep your expectations lower than the hype would suggest, you may well remember and enjoy the images of this beautifully portrayed if relatively storyless film.",6,1,2,21 February 2007
The Terminal," Quirky, but eminently entertaining if you allow it to be . . .
","The Terminal 8/10This is a movie you'll love or errr . . . feel left a bit cold by - so maybe a few notes to help you decide which . . . ?The story is of a man stranded at an airport, his papers invalid for entry or exit, and ending up living there for a while (all this is based on a true story). The difficulty is getting a handle on it. Is it serious drama? Light romantic comedy? Deliberate slapstick? Is it meant to be realistic or not? If these questions are likely to plague you and make you unable to settle and enjoy The Terminal, it's maybe not the movie for you. On the other hand, imagine it was a musical - you'd have all these elements and no-one would really care. Perhaps the film would have been more successful as a musical even - as audiences we have a happy acceptance that includes a very wide suspension of disbelief when the people we are watching suddenly feel the need to break into song and dance - we are there to be entertained after all; and if you avoid pigeon-holing the film you might find it a very enjoyable experience indeed.Tom Hanks is superbly cast in the lead role. His home country (somewhere in Eastern Europe probably) has undergone a coup whilst he has been in flight. Consequently all documentation (visas, passports) from the country have been suspended - his papers are not valid for entry to the USA and neither can he be forcibly sent home. The puzzlement and isolation of a man who speaks little or no English and has no idea what is happening to him is poignantly portrayed. But rather than lead us into consideration of serious issues that might be raised, director Steven Spielberg drops to a minor key to develop a romantic comedy between Hanks and air-hostess Catherine Zeta-Jones. As an audience we have to let go of the desire to see it as a serious drama and just have fun, though with serious issues in the background. Spielberg, not my favourite director, almost redeems himself from his habitually apologetic political correctness over an incident involving a Russian (Where Hanks is brought in as a translator) who is trying to bring medicines in for his dying parent without proper paperwork. Realising that no paperwork is needed if the medicines are needed for veterinary purposes, Hanks feigns a mistranslation to get the Russian to say they are for his goat. In the face the heartless chief of security, it looks like a swipe at bureaucracy, suggesting the system cares more about goats than people - but this is quickly dispelled when another staff person says that America is after all, built on compassion.The original story is much closer to home - an Iranian refugee, Merhan Nasseri, landed at Charles de Gaulle Airport France in 1988 after being denied entry into the UK because his passport and United Nations refugee card had been stolen. He was not allowed into France and he did not want to return to Iran (his home country) - he was fleeing as a political refugee. He ended up living in Terminal One of the airport for more than 16 years. (He's now been granted permission to either enter France or return to his own country but he instead chooses to carry on living in the terminal. The film is professionally made, deftly crafting schmaltz with top acting, and a theme that, if not original, at least hasn't been done to death. It's unusualness is probably its biggest downfall - it wants to be mainstream but doesn't conveniently fit into a category. It also goes on for rather a long time - at over two hours there creeps in a feeling that you've been stranded watching his (however interesting) plight long enough and it's about time he got the girl and went out to celebrate. Personally I didn't get bored - only a little sad - not just from the soppy tear-jerker aspects - but from the feeling that more people should enjoy this movie than probably will let themselves.",8,0,1,6 October 2004
Music and Lyrics," Cheesy and proud of it
","Let's face it, often we go to the cinema for a bit of inconsequential fun. In case you were in any doubt, Music and Lyrics kicks off with an 80s-style Wham-like video of a band called as 'PoP'. Firmly tongue in retro-chic, Hugh Grant is Alex Fletcher, the washed-up has-been now playing the nostalgia circuit for middle-aged housewives. He meets bubbly Sophie Fisher (Drew Barrymore) who waters the plants in his apartment but has a knack for writing lyrics. This saves his day when current pop-diva princess Cora asks him to write and record a duet with her.Chances are you are now reaching for the vomit bag or saying that maybe sounds like quite a giggle. If you can stomach the idea of Hugh Grant singing his own songs and staging a come back then rest assured, this is a very polished and unsubstantial rom-com. He and Drew Barrymore propel the movie with energy, wit and a warm, lovable enthusiasm. While perhaps doing little more than playing new aspects of themselves, it is a delightful performance, and one backed up with catchy songs, a fabulous debut by Haley Bennett (Cora) and a heartfelt, realistic script.Cora is a sort of teenage megastar, somewhere between Shakira, Britney Spears and a youthful Madonna. Her elaborate stage-shows have a 'Buddhism & thong'(mysticism and sex) philosophy. Here, as with Alex and Sophie, the echelons of the music world seem realistically portrayed. While the matches seem unbelievable at first, by the end of the film we want Hugh and Drew to continue their romance offstage, just as with classic romance films of the 30s, so by any mainstream yardstick, Music and Lyrics is a success. The film is as unpretentious as its two lead actors, makes no great claims, and satisfies Valentine's Day release requirements with a sincerity that takes it a notch above the average cheese. Casting is spot-on, even down to Sophie's older (and much larger) sister, who has similar characteristics and mannerisms. It's easy viewing, and even contains nothing unsuitable for older children. If you want more sophisticated and substantial fare, you probably don't need film reviews to find your way to the nearest art-house cinema or Oscar blockbuster. But for straight enjoyment, Music and Lyrics slides down like a very reasonable glass of rich chardonnay. Silly, formulaic, but rather well done.",8,226,253,12 February 2007
The Queen," Rare insights and an emotionally rewarding film
","Imagine for a moment you are newly elected landslide Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and your modernising beliefs don't really welcome obeisance to an outdated monarchy. Princess Diana dies, and the nation turns with venomous tooth and claw (aided perhaps by a certain spin doctor) against the Royals. A golden opportunity? But Blair feels there is something unseemly about tearing the Queen to bits and, in the middle of the crisis, kicks in some damage control.This is the dynamic of power that bounces back and forth, aided by shrewish asides from Cherie Blair ('Off to see the girlfriend, then?') and her hilarious curtsy that manages to be respectful while still taking the p*ss. Delivering a sparkly dialogue and an especially witty battle between monarch and minister, director Stephen Frears' central accomplishment still has to be casting Helen Mirren as the Queen. No hard-line royalist, Mirren has said she thought twice before accepting her honours as a Dame of the British Empire in 2003, but her portrait here is convincingly astute, supporting a remarkable physical transformation with a sensitive characterisation that endears the Queen to us and renders her majesty's charisma all the more apparent.In an early scene where the Queen is chatting to her portrait artist, she mentions the coming election and expresses a longing to vote, just once, for 'the sheer joy of being partial.' The artist reminds her that it is, after all, her government, and Queen Elizabeth retorts, 'Yes, I suppose that's some consolation.' Obviously there's some things money can't buy.The film examines her character, her stoical dignity born of years of tolerance not of her choosing, and is maybe so gripping because previous portraits have been little more than a regal cipher. At the end, we feel that we have been privy to the private life of a person who, like her or not, is a feature of everyone's life in the UK. It maybe lacks the grandeur that is traditionally associated with the Queen, but is nevertheless a fairly sympathetic portrait. When Blair tells her how her ratings have dropped to an all time low, she is genuinely upset that she has failed to read her public - to whom she has devoted her life. The film, with all its light-hearted touches, maybe even assists the process of 'modernisation' that the Monarchy now believes is inevitable.Much of the power in the performances is from unexpressed emotion. All the players are in such important positions that displays of feeling are usually taboo, publicly and sometimes privately as well. After her husband takes her grandchildren stag hunting to 'take their mind off things', the Queen is privately close to shedding a tear for the stag. A moment in the Balmoral countryside when she is alone with the creature reveals a sense of wonder in her that she cannot communicate to the human companions of her world, and she visits the body of the beast (when it is later killed by a neighbour) with more alacrity than she feels towards a dead daughter-in-law who has been her near ruin. Diana, in life, was perhaps also isolated, and we are reminded of her devotion to causes such as banning land-mines - causes to which she could unleash her emotion and, fortunately for her, to which the public could also identify.The film evokes strong feelings - not least in bringing back the sense of national mourning that followed Diana's death (actual footage is used and the moments leading to the car crash are movingly re-created) even if this goes on to an almost sugary excess. Add to that the crisis of feelings within the Royal Family itself, the sense of isolation felt by the Queen, and the release of the film near the end of Blair's career, and you have a movie that presents a whirlwind of emotion that will thrill public tastes.",8,14,24,18 September 2006
Blow," Better than expected
","Based on a true story of how the American cocaine market was founded, this is a lot more funky than I had expected. A thumpingly good soundtrack right from the start and Johnny Depp cruising in to be a convincingly laid-back big-shot - almost like a graduate from Boogie Nights. Penelope Cruz manages to be blisteringly erotic in a few well-crafted scenes and without removing a stitch of clothing. Later, instead of following the usual pattern of despair in the second half where most drug movies home in on drug dependency, Blow refreshingly focuses on the emotional losses suffered by the characters. A film that just about manages to be more than the sum of its parts, it would have made a nice sort of pre-quel to Traffic, but it stands alone in fine form. And it's moving rather than depressing.",6,50,80,13 June 2001
Step Up," Regular fare, competently delivered
","Step Up (three stars)Director Anne Fletcher Writers Duane Adler and Melissa Rosenberg Stars Jenna Dewan, Channing Tatum Certificate PG Running time 103 minutes Country USA Year 2006Nora is training to be a dancer at the fairly exclusive Maryland School of the Arts. Tyler is a rebel from the wrong side of the tracks doing community service at the school after getting caught breaking in and vandalising it for kicks. She is classically trained in ballet and contemporary dance. He can breakdance like there's no tomorrow and throw in body-popping and cool good looks (Tyler is played by ex-model Channing Tatum). She needs a dance partner and there's the usual storyline footsie of boy-gets-girl, breaks up with girl, aspires, is gonna dance, is not gonna dance, they make each other feel good in public together then kiss-kiss finale.This is the same formula used in every modern dance movie and Step Up has no surprises, but for an enjoyable slice of this type of cake it is no worse than average. It doesn't have the glossy editing/directing and punchy acting to make it stand out like a Fame, Dirty Dancing, or Flashdance, but it's fine on its own level, competent, and has some good dance sequences.From a dance point of view, classical ballet is very upright, geometrical, relatively emotionally unexpressive and danced in a precise manner. Breakdance, using different heights, opening and closing in fluid motion to express feeling, and working off the beat more like jazz, is a natural opposite. Mixing the two together gives an interesting and explosive combination. Nora finds that her dance routine is greatly enhanced by Tyler's style and gives him a crash course in ballet (which would be needed for posture and control).A good hip-hop soundtrack boosts these joining of opposites, adding violin to the funkier beats. A forgettable movie, but worth seeing by dance fans or teenagers after easy-viewing.",6,1,3,26 October 2006
Shrek," Self-referential fairy-tale - innovative animation
","Latest technology renders this animated feature more 'lifelike' than any previous efforts. On top of that, it takes a sly dig at fairy tale films, particularly Walt Disney. Shrek, the main character, is an ugly ogre who only wants to be left alone. Events lead him to a quest to rescue a princess. Tongue in cheek humour throughout raises this fairy tale way above the average. Unfortunately I'm not into fairy tales, even self-referential ones.",5,0,0,30 July 2001
Vanilla Sky," Dares to be different
","A wealthy playboy (Tom Cruise) suddenly finds himself in jail for the murder of the woman he loves. Flashbacks show how he ditches his former girlfriend or `f***-buddy' (played by Cameron Diaz) and falls for another woman (played by Penelope Cruz). He gets in the car with Diaz however and she deliberately drives off a bridge, killing herself and leaving Cruise terribly disfigured. He settles down with Cruz but starts to have what seem like psychotic episodes where he mistakes her for Diaz. The ending is well worth the wait and explains the mystery completely. It's not an incredibly tortuous affair either. Everything is explained, but you have to pay attention  sadly some critics who admit to being `puzzled' couldn't be bothered to do this and it shows painfully in the reviews. There are also some gem-like scenes  for instance when Cruise does a pencil drawing of Cruz early on and draws a wonderful likeness that is at the same time more beautiful than the girl has yet shown herself to be, or the moment when Diaz looks helplessly on as an epitome of sadness  the `girl with the martini'. There are many metaphors that can be drawn about stardom but it is a movie worth seeing for its own story. (Stay for the final credits  you not only get Paul McCartney's beautiful Oscar-nominated title-song, but the haunting melody that it seamlessly fades into and which is sung by Diaz.)",6,5,11,26 February 2002
Iron Man," A well re-mastered legend
","Since Marvel Comics and CGI started their mystical marriage in the late 1990s, we've had superheroes galore. Hulks, Surfers, Spidermen, not to mention constantly renewed Batmans and Supermans. So what does Iron Man have to offer that's different? A flawed character that becomes honourable is the answer, triumphing in the battle of Good over Evil in spite of being a bit of a prat.Add to that some of the best features of Robocop, Batman Begins and Terminator II, and you have one of the more satisfying comic-books-turned-blockbuster that we've seen for a while.Billionaire and genius Tony Stark Â– with a personality vaguely based on Howard Hughes Â– is a weapons inventor that gets captured by bad guys in Afghanistan. Forced to work for them, he has other plans. Stark, nicely played by Robert Downey Jr, fashions a hi-tech suit of armour - before going on to save the world in usual exemplary fashion.This long build-up Â– to explain how he becomes Iron Man Â– is arguably the best part of the film. Ingenious special effects give Stark's futuristic Malibu mansion a sci-fi rather than fantasy feel. And the subtle build-up makes us more forgiving as the story slips slowly into comic-book reality.There are, of course, compromises. It has to appeal to kids as well as adults, so there is none of the gutsiness of Terminator I (or similar adult-orientated sci-fi). And in spite of the heavy moral-political issues at stake, Iron Man stays politically bland Â– this being the only way to get D.O.D. approval and hence associated goodies like fighter jets and military hardware.One of the most interesting ideas for me in the film was the idea of 'zero accountability'. This takes the form of having all the wealth, brains and playboy attributes that fiction writers can imagine, but could also be a symbol for U.S. military might, for instance. Stark's first premise, of power being the ultimate deterrent (and hence a peace-keeping force) is undermined when the enemy gets hold of the same weapons and starts killing indiscriminately. Theologians might also muse how power itself has no moral authority. Good guys have to grudgingly beseech permission from whoever wields the biggest thunderbolt.Iron Man, essentially a symbol of power, abounds in biblical references, even if these come more from the comic book creators than any learning on the part of filmmakers. Jericho, the name given to Stark's finest military weapon, was the city that had to be destroyed, 'as an outward display of faith.' Which makes for great symbolism. Until you consider that modern-day Jericho is in the West Bank of the Palestinian territories, and then Stark's 'rockets' start to look a lot more loaded.Iron Man's technology has a special feature to avoid targeting civilians. Now this is one military development I would love to see.The second half of the movie is pure action, but with a well-delivered script and sufficient plot-twists to keep you engaged. Out-of-reach love-interest materialises as Gwyneth Paltrow, who I found very agreeable to watch, and the excellent supporting cast also includes Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard. This is a film that tries to please everyone and largely succeeds. It's a two-hour thrill-ride that offers a new action-hero for our CGI-sated palates.On a personal note, my big disappointment was the title track Â– or rather lack of it. Having heard one of the most famous heavy metal riffs of all time in the trailer, I couldn't wait to see Iron Man flying through the skies to the sound of Black Sabbath's rock anthem. Sadly, the riff is all you get (probably cos the words seem to be based on an altogether different story). But if you sit through the closing credits hoping for more, you do at least get a very important extra scene. So you've been warned: don't leave the cinema beforehand!",7,180,367,30 April 2008
Bruce Almighty," Carrey on form
","Now either you like Mr Carrey's humour or you don't. Me, Myself and Irene had audiences both walking out in droves and, on the other hand, cheering and collapsing in puddles of mirth. Bruce Almighty is a bit more mainstream, but you have been warned.If you're not sure, watch the trailer. I saw the trailer three times and still laughed at the same gags when I saw the film. If you don't find the sight of a dog putting the seat down after using the loo funny, don't bother with the movie.Carrey, a reporter stuck in a rut covering 'lighter news' berates God when the whole of his life seems to be going to pot. God takes up the challenge and asks Carrey if he can do better. Carrey gets into the swing of having all of God's powers by making his girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston)'s breasts bigger, getting himself promoted, and answering everyone's prayers by single stroke computer commands.This is not a highbrow movie or even that memorable, but it is very well made within it's very limited intent, provides almost continuous laughs to Carrey fans, and even any religious cheesiness is likely to be inoffensive to all but the most narrow-minded god-squadders and anti-god-squadders.On the more thoughtful level, the film tempts us to speculate about Carrey's own career - stuck in his 'comedy' typecasting he has largely failed to make an impression as a serious actor even after winning two Golden Globes. His most accomplished 'straight' role, the Man on the Moon, is less well known that his comedy romps - or The Truman Show (on which the Academy heaped three nominations whilst bypassing Carrey).",7,50,69,27 June 2003
Casino Royale," Shaken or stirred - can you tell the difference . . .
","Spy movies owe a lot to James Bond. If not inventing them, he helped make the genre what it is today. So does Casino Royale, adapted from the first of the original novels, breathe new life into spy movies or just give us more of the same?Before the opening credits, we see a new approach with a gritty, realistic fist fight shot entirely in black and white. Then cut to rain-sodden Uganda where some Large Amounts of Money are changing hands. Cut again to colourful Madagascar where Bond gets involved in a chase while locals bet on a snake-and-raccoon fight. A myriad of visual contrasts; a dizzying pace; and stunts that look like they hurt. It all holds much promise even before the plot enters to make sense of it all.The big change, of course, is the new Bond. Not only a new actor (Daniel Craig) but a whole new style. Gone is the debonair, slightly camp, 007. Welcome bruised and bashed, a man's man, an intelligent fighting machine. Love interest Vesper later calls him a 'former SAS type'. This is the Bond before qualifying to 00 status, more Marine than manicure.The original book was set in the Cold War era. Predictably, this has been updated to fighting a terrorist network and people who bankroll them. But the main story in a way is Bond's coming-of-age - how he lets go of his ego and learns not to trust anyone, even the most trustworthy. He prefers women who are married - to keep things simple - but in the lovely Vesper (Eva Green) he meets his match. Not only seductively alluring, she carries as much clout as he does (holding the purse-strings for the Treasury) and challenges him as an intellectual equal. Vesper has no intention of becoming his 'disposable asset'.Craig seems to do everything right. His personality seems close to the author's original concept, he has worked very hard to live up to the part, and his physique and sexual charisma exceed expectation. Likewise, Eva Green is a great improvement on the barbie-doll types usually inhabiting Bond movies. But they both suffer from a singular flaw: neither exude, for me, any memorable star appeal. While Connery, and to an extent Moore and Brosnan, lit up a stage and became the face you couldn't forget, Craig simply looks like an above-average crime actor. Green works the part and has some reputable lip-trembles, but most of the classic lines abounding in the script are simply recited. Mads Mikkelsen, as the evil Le Chiffre, has the most unforgettable features, yet even he does not achieve the power of, say, Philip Seymour Hoffman in the not dissimilar Mission Impossible III. The film is still worth seeing by fans, or anyone wanting standard entertainment of this kind. The plot is better than average and fairly faithful to the book. Judi Dench is convincing as M (a character she has played many times). We get to see the new Aston Martin DBS (in a special colour, Casino Ice, not available until 2007) alongside the Bond favourite Aston Martin DB5. Ivana Milicevic, who plays Le Chiffre's girlfriend, has stunning outfits by Versace and Roberto Cavalli; and there's an admirable attention to real stunts over CGI. But in terms of fresh life, Casino Royale is a safe $100M investment rather than anything radically new. In a scene near the end, Bond is giving artificial resuscitation - not very well apparently, as the drowning victim's chest doesn't move. The producers seem similarly not to have taken any chances on the well-preserved body of Bond stories other than adding superficial improvements. Bond is largely a fantasy character, but this attempt at 'realism' made me wonder, does anyone in 2006 really believe the Secret Service are that efficient any more?? After losing at cards, Bond orders a Vodka Martini. 'Shaken or stirred?' the bartender asks. Bond replies, 'Do I look like a give a damn?' Likewise, a shot of Bond at the box office is usually a pleasant experience, but this film left me past worrying whether it was shaken, stirred or simply made earlier.",6,6,13,16 November 2006
Sweet and Lowdown," Lovable jazz paean
","Lovable non-Woody-Allen-ish film from the great director - this time paying homage to one of his jazz heroes. Sean Penn plays the irascible, misogynist, and not-too-bright guitar virtuoso Emmet Ray seemingly to perfection. The film is a delight from start to finish. Sit back and enjoy this wonderful tale of a man who was arguably one of the best guitarists in the world.",6,1,2,18 June 2000
AmÃ©lie," Subtle, beautiful, and worth seeing more than once
","Occasionally a movie comes along that captures the heart and mind and this is one of them. Amelie is an introverted young French girl who learns the secret of changing people's lives for the better. Her shyness, however, is a stumbling block when it comes to changing her own life. From the first few minutes of the film, by a subtle use of special effects, an unusual script, and fairly innovative editing, the audience is completely captured. The ambience is that of a fairytale for grown ups. The imaginative stratagems Amelie uses to achieve her ends keep us engaged. The beautiful photography, wonderful acting, and unforgettable imagery combine into a masterpiece of understatement that is both impressive and uplifting. Altogether a joy to behold.",9,1,3,26 September 2001
The Sixth Sense," One of the year's outstanding mainstream movies
",Very scary movie about a child psychologist and one or two of his proteges. Very good acting (both Bruce Willis and the 11-yr-old Michael Conner Humphreys who made an early appearance as the young Forrest in Forrest Gump). Very tear-jerking without being cheesy. Excellent story with lots of believable twists. One of the finest mainstream movies of the year. Not to be missed at any cost.

Final Destination," Last Ditch Effort
","One of the posters suggests forget Scream, see this. My advice would be 'Forget Final Destination, see Scream 3.' Scream and its sequels might not be to everyone's taste, but they are cleverly made. Final Destination, by comparison, is unashamed nonsense. The ingeniousness of the actual deaths gives it a certain entertainment value but beyond that it's difficult to believe that even the actors are taking it seriously. The best bit of the film for me was a scene when a dead person's arm moved due to rigor mortis - six girls on a night out in a few rows behind me screamed in unison . ..",4,1,2,27 May 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A monumental film
","Feeling weary and battle-worn, I have just staggered out of the cinema after three and a half hours of special effects creatures fighting other special effects creatures. I had taken refreshments but barely touched them - probably because the film I had watched is one of the most mesmerising, evocative, inspiring, and awesome I have witnessed of any big adventure epic. Not to mention superb ensemble acting, moods that shift effortlessly between mediaeval battles of colossal proportions and convincing bloodshed, beauty and wonderment, fantastic natural and artificial landscapes and cityscapes, touches of humour, well-paced dramatic tension, and human bonding that is moving enough to just let you dry your eyes as the unassuming credits flash by.Return of the King is the greatest of the Tolkien trilogy by New Zealand director Peter Jackson. Although I've seen the other two and read the book, I felt it would also stand alone well enough for people who hadn't done either.The storytelling is much more professional that the first one - which maybe laboured to introduce so much information - or the second one - which has little let up from the tension of long battle scenes. In Return of the King, there is an emotional sting at the start, as we watch the transformation of Gollum from warm, fun-loving guy to murderous, mutated wretch. The movie then moves deftly between different segments of the story - the sadness of the lovely soft-focus Liv Tyler as fated Arwen whose travails and woman's love succeeds in having the Sword that was Broken mended, the comradeship of Sam and Frodo (Sean Astin & Elijah Wood) that is tested to the limits, the strong commanding presence of Gandalf (Ian McKellen) who keeps an eye on things whilst turning in an Oscar-worthy performance, the ingenious and very varied battle scenes, and the mythical cities of that rise out of the screen and provide key plot elements.This is a fairy story of human endeavour, the defeating of power cliques and the triumph of the human spirit that could almost be compared to Wagner's Gotterdammerung. It is a fairy story without any sugary sweetness, a fairy story the likes of which hasn't been told so well before, and is even unlikely to be done so well in the future. The haunting scream of the Nasgul stays with you, the physical attractions are not airbrushed, and the battles are about as far from pantomime characters waving wooden swords as you can get. The ingenious monsters keep you on the edge of your seat. The whole narrative maintains the spirit (if not archival, detailed accuracy) of the original and makes you want to read the book (or read the book again!)The worst I can say about it is that it is maybe a tad long - but not that you'd notice . . .",9,315,406,17 December 2003
Munich," Spielberg goes out his comfort zone - was it worth it?
","As someone with limited sympathy for the politics of either Israel or Palestine, I went to see this film with no little degree of trepidation. As the film got under way, I felt I might be pleasantly surprised. It was a thriller, based on a historical incident, and well-told. With the demise of the Cold War, stories about secret service plots, espionage and counter-intelligence seem too few on the ground, and criticising a Spielberg film for being pro-Jewish seems as silly as criticising James Bond for being pro-British.The film takes the 1972 terrorist attack on Israeli athletes at the Olympic games in Munich as its starting point and then follows one of the hit squads assigned to revenge the attack (it is based on a book that straddles fiction and non-fiction lists called 'Vengeance').As targets are identified - some of them a bit too old to have been the young Munich assassins - they are wiped out with varying degrees of skill, lack of skill, or bungling. The assassinations generally inflict unintended civilian casualties, and the assassinated are quickly replaced - often by better and more numerous terrorists.Avner, the leader of our hit-squad sent by Israel's intelligence service (Mossad), eventually starts to succumb to doubts about the legitimacy, effectiveness and morality of the operation, as well as general paranoia (some of which seems reasonable) about whether the mercenaries selling him information are also selling information about his own whereabouts to enemies, or whether Mossad will endanger him and his family if he chooses not to take further missions.This is where it all goes badly astray. Spielberg excels as a storyteller, not as a philosopher. With the remarkable Schindler's List, he told a story of bravery, of the non-violent and successful resistance and escape from the Nazis. The heroes were clearly defined and worthy of universal admiration. With Munich, he forces us to consider the current Middle East situation, where neither side is universally considered blameless. Avner's musings about the wrongness of violence are unconvincing and impotent. Although the film includes a few shots of Palestinian hardship, it nevertheless came across to me as a confused apologia for Israeli over-retaliation - in a similar ilk to Oliver Stone's cancellation of US guilt in Vietnam in 'Born on the Fourth of July' ('it was bad but necessary / well-intended, so let's move on').Spielberg said he wanted the athletes to be remembered - but the film hardly shows them - you would be hard pressed to remember their names or anything about them from watching Munich. The martyrdom process that both the terrorists and Israeli assassins engender however is dwelt on for over two hours. It has come in for criticism from the Israeli government and the author of the book on which it is based. Spielberg said he hoped the film would produce discussion - it probably has and will, but possibly not of a useful or constructive kind. This, however, is my very personal view. By raising questions it might conceivably arouse productive debate within the Jewish community. My low rating is because it left such a bad taste in my mouth.",2,1,4,14 February 2006
The Matrix," A modern sci-fi classic
","One of my all-time favourite sci-fi films. Like Bladerunner, it's refreshing to get a sci-fi movie that doesn't have all the spin-offs for kids (such as plague star wars movies). The plot is also sufficiently intellectually challenging to keep an adult audience riveted - and the special effects are not only state of the art but used to support the story rather than distract from it.",9,0,0,28 October 1999
300," One hell of a movie
","Gods and God, Heroes, Legends, Fables, Mentors - even Movie Stars. Figures we look up to, that inspire us. External, made in our own image, or just something that we latch onto. We escape from ourselves for a moment, become more like them. With comic-book heroes we explore broad brush-stroke ideas of heroism, romance. Cinema has been used throughout its history to raise morale or for more overt politics. Comic-book adaptations span many genres from Batman stories to examinations of existentialism (Ghost World) or reinventing neo-noir (Sin City). Based on a comic based on a film based on ancient history, 300 explodes onto screens with stark adult images of bare-chested warriors and overtly sexual Oracles. It sweeps us into a world of fantasy, but with intense bloody violence like Tarantino movies, and 'Freedom' battle-cries reminiscent of Braveheart. It tells of 300 heroic, highly trained warriors that pitch themselves against an army numbering one million. If they die, they don't die in vain. They will inspire. They will stand for liberty. They will be the catalyst for ultimate victory and the establishment of a far-reaching moral order.King Leonidas of Ancient Sparta receives an emissary from the Persian Empire. Earth and Water, if you please, the Spartans are told, else we'll kick you to a kingdom near you where you don't wanna go. Leonidas responds to this bit of diplomacy by unceremoniously kicking emissary and entourage down a big pit.Before Leonidas can whop these aliens from Asia for being so damn cheeky, he has to ask the Oracle, a beautiful, writhing, naked young blossom being letched over by particularly ugly, deformed mystics (called Ephors - think Orcs with sex drives). Xerxes, the Persian ruler, knows well the oracles will tell Leonidas to back off as there's a religious festival due, which they do. Guessing the cunning plan, but unable to go directly against holy Ephors, Leonidas 'goes for a walk' - together with his personal bodyguard of 300 crack soldiers.Leonidas' wife, Queen Gorgo, stays behind. Although women can open their mouths at formal events, she's still regarded as pretty second class by the all male politicians. Gorgo shows she's a Sparta woman through and through. Brave, intelligent, willing to sacrifice herself as forcefully as any male warrior, she gives a speech that would out-Maggie Thatcher. And unlike most women leaders, she's sexy and feminine.Leonidas' men, helped by woosey Athenians, acquit themselves in a manner that to put CGIs to shame (if they weren't so awesome). Like Mel Gibson in Braveheart, he has learnt to shout words like 'freedom' and 'democracy' until his men go into a hypnotic rage of murderous joy. And he has his wife to thank for it. What's a king to do, faced with the choice between religious law and a threat to his country? She tells him to ask, 'What should a free man do?' Gorgo made no mistake in taking his mind off the 18-year old slut down the temple.'A new age has come, an age of freedom!' echoes through the film. 'We rescue a world from mysticism and tyranny.' But although historians are already arguing over the historical accuracy or lack of it, it seems palpable that much was invented or changed to make the story, visuals, and moral imperatives 'more cool' than they ever were in ancient times. The shred of historicity seems a mere device to assist suspension of disbelief. Landscapes have the menacing simplicity of Sin City. Unlike Sin City, they are more seamlessly lifelike, yet still retain an air of fantasy. It's almost like Lord of the Rings for grown-ups.Acting is gritty throughout. Special effects could send you into Exorcist mode if you've just had lunch. Cinematography is consistently atmospheric. It feels like a two-hour descent into Mordor that makes Gladiator look gay. But if this movie can effectively get your rocks off, no review is entirely complete without acknowledging the political upheavals even as it is released.'Hollywood declares war on Iranians,' read a headline in Iran's independent Ayende-No newspaper. A Persian journalist (born of Iranian parents in Greece) wrote, 'There has been no agenda on the part of the original novelist, movie director, cast and crew to promote an anti-Iranian agenda. The movie however (no matter how sincerely it was intended as entertainment), is nevertheless purveying messages; messages most certainly unintended by Miller or the film producers.' Which is probably a bit closer to the truth. But is that wrong?Decent Americans, at the time of the movie's release, are going through a period of schism and intense self-doubt over their increasing losses in Iraq. Whatever the rights and wrongs of the war, the families and friends of those who have lost men and women there need sources of succour and belief in themselves. The film provides heroic stereotypes who die for their beliefs and find ways of justifying or coming to terms with the accompanying grief. In 300, reverence for race, religion and sexual preferences are given short shrift. If the movie claimed to represent history and the peoples in it accurately, it would be offensive to common sense. But it does not. It is, feels like, and looks like, a comic-strip simplification and glorification of a battle. It will make much of its target audience feel good about itself. As propaganda, it is no worse, or rather far less harmful, than the propaganda churned out on a smaller scale by many Islamic countries for internal consumption. I did not find the depiction of Persians at all belittling. They look as glorious in their majesty and technical achievements as the Spartans look ferocious. The main audiences understand it is light entertainment, however baffling it may be to eastern minds (just as Manga can be baffling or even offensive to Western minds).300 is, at a pinch, not a beacon of political correctness, but it is one hell of a movie.",8,6,17,19 March 2007
Honey," Make the world a better place with dancing?
","Review for non-dancersSilly formulaic rubbish - dance obsessed teen who has a fairly hollow life (outside of her desire to dance and be nice to kids) goes through predictable scenarios in her Flashdance/Save-The-Last-Dance-style 'rise to success'. She's a girl from the Bronx who makes good. About as original as a woolworths cover album, but maybe kinda nice as a nice, saccharine-coated hip-hop eulogy firmly aimed at the teen market, as long as you can accept its emptiness without wanting anything more.
Review for dancersFrom the first few minutes of this movie, the dancing and music starts pumping and hardly lets up till the end. Most dance movies have a fluffy story interspersed with some cool dancing, one or two have a fluffy story with overly drawn-out dancing, whereas this one hangs on a feelgood story that requires large amounts of snappy dancing in almost every scene.You know that emotion when you see a dancer spin, and from the flick of her hands and hair, sparks fly off and light up the room. Her enthusiasm is so high that just watching her makes you want to give up that day job and do anything that is vaguely music/dance/keep-fit related. You want to just let the light shine out of you every time you dance - for the thrill of it, for the joy it can bring to others, as an affirmation perhaps of life itself.Ballet-trained Honey Daniels (Jessica Alba) works hard just so she can dance - whether it's coaching local kids at hip-hop or bartending in a nightclub so she can dance for free after her shift. Her aim is to break into MTV-style dance videos.(plot spoilers - next para only - short synopsis)When she eventually gets the break, she not only dances but starts producing fabulous choreography for Missy Elliott style numbers for television. The big boss drunkenly tries to get her to sleep with him - and chucks her out when she refuses. She wants to found a dance school for the kids in the Bronx but with her wages cut she has to perform a benefit dance show to raise the cash. The video producer begs her to go back when the recording artists start demanding her but she sticks to her principles. The benefit fund-raiser dance is success, her parents are proud of her, former competitors and worried friends all bond with her, and the kids on the block get their dance school which keeps them off the street life of petty crime.Admittedly if you don't like hip-hop / streetdance / breakdance the film may do nothing for you. If you do, but only dance partner dance, you may feel inspired or even take some of the movements, and practice them to add to your current dance moves. There's plenty of funky moves and some cool choreography.The lead character's humanitarian spirit also brings out one of the highest aims of dancing - to make the world a better place in some small way. Dance should not be divisive - it might be the highest aspiration of the free spirit to communicate joy and bring others together using a language beyond words, beyond social class, age, gender or other things that divide people. Looking at it like this, for those who choose to do so, it gives some meaning to our 'obsession' with dance.I notice hip-hop is being increasingly taught Â– not an easy dance but fabulous for adding those split timing add-ons. It's also often taught as a work out (check out ads for Â‘streetdance'). Timing is tight Â– fashion is motion Â– movement is meaning Â– communication is flow Â– sex is attitude Â– feel the rush Â– Or just go and see Honey . . .",7,0,1,17 March 2004
Fantastic Four," Here we go again
","Another Marvel Comics adaptation. Comic adaptations are showing so much variation these days - there's the straightforward (and award winning) Spider Man 2, the thoughtful Batman Begins, or the strictly adult Sin City. The Fantastic Four goes straight for the intellectually-challenged adolescent - by packing in slapstick, amusing CGIs, moral vacuity, and the sort of plot development that doesn't require sustained attention. Apart from that, it's quite enjoyable. I could easily imagine a 24hr version that you just dipped into for a quick fix inbetween more serious pursuits. Fantastic Four is a straightforward and unashamed waste of talent, like happy hour cheap lager. The nominal story, of several scientists accidentally given super powers after a freak accident, is less important than smiling vacuously all the way through.",5,0,1,11 August 2005
Sin City," Seminal film noir and remarkable homage to the comic book genre
","There's a tradition in Edinburgh called 'Secret Cinema'. Each year, on of the art house cinemas hosts a season of seminal cult films after midnight, away from the main auditorium, in a private area that can only be entered via the back door. Cinephiles, appropriately garbed like French New Wave followers, crowd in to share the secrets. Watching selected surprise movies from yesteryear, there are 'oooohs' and 'aaaarhs' as the little known milestones in cinematic history and recognised, together with the palpable influence they have exerted in the years since their release. The audiences are always very discerning and appreciative.I can imagine seeing Sin City in such a setting. Packed rows marvelling at the aesthetic technological achievement, no less than the transmuting of distinctive comic strip characters into the speech, movements and situations of on-screen actors. I can imagine looking back over the intervening years since it had been released and seeing how filmmakers have learnt new approaches from this film, how in crasser hands each one of its tiny gems has been amplified into Oscar-winning blockbusters, how in film schools the methods have been critically observed and handed down.Except Sin City is not a blast from the past - it is out now, and with considerable fanfare.The buzz surrounding it should not persuade you to go out and see the film unless the content and methodology attract you - Sin City might be mainstream, but only just - and it would be better to describe it as adult art-house mainstream / thriller / crime with added big names.Firstly, the themes are as adult as the comic strip it is adapted from. Sin City, whether taken as a metaphor or an actual (if fictitious) place, is hardly a place for the feint-hearted. Basically it's a specialist movie in the heavy, mysterious film-noir mould, with almost constant voice overs and hard-boiled one-liners like some old Bogart films. Only it doesn't shrink from mutilation, castration, cannibalism or a host of other monstrosities. That we are aware of the mythological-like nature of the comic-strip characters doesn't completely detract from the stomach-churning inspired by such things, or from the genuinely moving scenes.Saying it contains heroes is maybe going too far. Some characters are just a bit more sympathetic than others. Like the exceedingly ugly Marv. He's been framed for murder and the cops are in on it. He spends most of the film semi-deranged, searching for the one woman he loves, a whore who showed him a few moments of kindness and for whom he would do anything, including laying down his life. Or Hartigan. He's a cop, one of the ones with a shred of decency left in him. He risks his life to rescue a child from being raped and mutilated. Or Dwight. He dispenses some rough justice to a rather nasty and well connected gangster. Then there's Gail. She heads a women's prostitute cooperative that includes silent martial arts expert Miho and several Amazonian types kitted out in leather and carrying Exceedingly Powerful Guns. That's just the good guys. On the other side there's Yellow Bastard, deformed by treatment to try and restore the manhood, and who uses his victims for sexual titillation before framing their heads in the wall like sophisticated African trophies. A filthy minded Priest (less said about him the better) and Jackie Boy who 'never hits a woman' (or so he claims before he beats the sh*t out of his girlfriend). Or Becky, the dumb trinket-slinging whore that you would be better off not getting out of the car to speak to.Visually, the film is a bit like a comic strip with spot-colour in a half-world somewhere between 'reality' and artifice. In previous comic adaptations, the likes of Marvel heroes, Batman and Superman are fleshed out to be 'real' people and the audience is simply asked to accept the extra level of suspension-of-disbelief: In Sin City, the characters live in a murky underworld (L.A. a few years from now??) but, for all their apparent reality, will spin the wheels of a car or defy the odds in exactly the same way that a comic strip character would - simply because it looks cool. The effect is quite remarkable, and identifies the uniqueness of the comic strip as an art form probably better than any movie before. Sin City is less a comic strip turned into a movie than an homage to the comic strip genre.The finely tuned use of things like spot colour are also brought to magnificent effect. Standing on a balcony at night-time, colours are faded out, only slightly more than they would be naturally at that time, yet the red of the heroine's lipstick is saturated, quite appropriately - as you may have guessed, the morality of Sin City is one where women are women and men are men (or horrible caricatures of one or the other) and there's lots of dodgy chivalry but no-one sitting on the fence. The overall colour sense throughout is one of the things that sticks with you, like the constant rain. Sin City works as a piece of art and as sophisticated entertainment. It is no wonder that it has lost none of what must have been the intensity of the original, due in part no doubt to the presence of author Frank Miller as co-director. Other big names awash - Tarantino as guest director, Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Clive Owen, Rutger Hauer, and Benicio Del Toro leading the action. For director Robert Rodriguez it is surely the most mature and compelling film to date. As Sin City 2 is still only pre-production, the best answer is to see this film at least once and then see it again - on the small screen it just won't be the same.",9,1,4,3 June 2005
Gangs of New York," Excessive talent dished up with too much monosodium glutamate
","Over three hours of Scorsese's self-indulgent odyssey supposedly about the birth pangs of 19th Century New York City but really a gratuitous re-enactment that tells us very little about history and a lot about Mr Scorsese's continuing efforts to work out his personal religious angst. After a bloody and horrifically realistic opening battle, the gang warfare festers on in simplistic Protestant vs Catholic rabble-rousing fashion whilst Di Caprio, Diaz and Daniel Day-Lewis all take turns to sparkle a bit. Scorsese shines with wasted talent throughout and the film will no doubt pick up the odd minor Oscar or two for misdirected effort. Mainstream fodder that ought to be something more than the sum of its pretensions.",6,0,0,19 January 2003
Happy Feet," More than just a flipperful of fun
","Happy Feet could almost be described as a Top of the Pops animation of March of the Penguins. But it was nearly four years in the making - as long as the latter hit documentary that moved the hearts of millions in the story of penguins ready to make every sacrifice to give love. A family film rather than kids' entertainment, Happy Feet tells the story of a vocally challenged penguin who nevertheless has a gift for dance. Against all odds, he finds a way to encourage mankind to help penguins survive. The penguins are cute and cuddly, the landscapes are realistically rendered, and the subtexts are delivered with an accuracy to make non-green authoritarians wince.Investment in the film goes beyond the quickly recouped $85M. Research included sending expeditions to the Antarctic so visual effects and camera crews could capture the textures, light and landscapes. The result is a film that looks and feels realistic enough to be taken seriously - giving extra weight to its strong environmental message. But a film like this is only as good as the fun it generates. The humour is genuine and wholesome but the tap-dancing is addictive.Our blue-eyed penguin hero Mumble (or Mambo) has the voice of Elijah 'Frodo' Wood but the tap-dancing of dancer-choreographer Savion Glover. In the production notes to March of the Penguins, Luc Jacquet tild us that, in real life, a penguin walks through the crowd and occasionally stops, trumpeting a loud and violent song. This is repeated at intervals until a fellow penguin answers him, upon which ensues a succession of dancing duos. Happy Feet's hero has to fast forward to the dancing bit.Dance is one of the oldest means of communication, pre-dating language. As a key story element it is an ideal device for making the connection from animals to the audience but also as the pivotal ingredient of Mumble's lovableness that eventually gets him noticed by environmentalists.But Happy Feet is not preachy. There are moments of pure belly laugh, such as when mamma-penguin regurgitates fish for junior. Or the extended joke about 'alien abductions' (ie contact with people). Some of the humour is more sophisticated - the high priest sounded to me suspiciously like the Reverend Ian Paisley. The knocks on dogmatic, harmful, overbearing and out-of-touch religious dogma will be too close to comfort for some of the faithful. And the parallel moral fables in the story may be beyond younger audiences.Happy Feet easily crosses an ocean of feelgood and is both an ethically responsible film for children and addictive entertainment for adults. That alone is a remarkable achievement.",9,1,2,9 December 2006
Slumdog Millionaire," Impressive conjuring tricks from Mr Boyle
","In his most mainstream movie to date, director Danny Boyle successfully transfers Trainspotting's renowned raw realism of economic deprivation to bustling, modern day India. Colourful and ingenious, Slumdog Millionaire adds that pure warmth of the child's smile to the kick of a curry made from a moneylender's intestines, well-laced with raw spirit distilled from fermented slum-dwellers. Rich and poor come together in an orgy of excess, bolstered with a love-song whose words you barely decipher but whose tune stays in your heart. Boyle has been reborn in Mumbai.India is a country of inimitable charm. Yet asked to describe what is good, I am usually stuck for words. It's dirty. Corrupt. Unreliable. Disingenuous. It leeches off you like a starving African stealing food at a Band-Aid concert. Oh, and it stinks. Quite literally.Yet, if you lean your weight against the old buildings near the Taj Mahal, something magical can happen. Somehow it is easy to feel your spirit leave the body. It will flow back through thousands of years of rich and vibrant history. Gandharvas and mythical kings. Back in reality, look up at the monkeys as they scamper across parapets, the sun dazzling you, and Hanuman and Lord Krishna echo from past aeons. Or walk through the mess that is modern Mumbai. Suddenly there's the architectural wonder of the railway station. An incongruently colonial splendour bizarrely appearing in the teeming twenty-first century.Slumdog Millionaire uses the Taj Mahal and Mumbai Station as iconic reference points, rising from the dirt and chaos. Like the boy dressed as Rama, who pops up early in the film. Timeless and almost mythological. But conflict simmers broodingly beneath such visual wonder. Muslim versus Hindu. Strong versus weak. And Slumdog versus Millionaire. Something says the twain ne'er shall meet, so when a kid from the slums succeeds on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, everyone is suspicious.On the other hand, unpredictability is the norm in India. The sense of this is so strong it could almost be described as 'spiritual.' Disconcertingly, it is easy to believe that India is a land where miracles could still occur. Even a child of the slums becoming fabulously rich.The freshness with which Boyle paints the country, the punchy editing and charismatic performances, all conspire against our recognising this is a standard against-all-odds story, a standard rags-to-riches, and a standard do-anything-to-get-the-girl. It is standard pulp. But done so well we barely notice. He has put together a film of surprising maturity, and perhaps his first to win general audiences in a big way. It's a film that uses lessons from Boyle's earlier movies Â– the gross-out shock value of Trainspotting, the lovable rogues of Shallow Grave, the exoticism of The Beach and the bold visual experimentation of 28 Days Later and Sunshine. It repackages them in feelgood form for all but the most delicate of tastes.True, the sight of a young boy diving through an ocean of sewage (with filmstar photo held aloft) recalls the stronger images from Trainspotting. But here it is done for humour and too brief to be offensive. Everything about the film is refreshingly clever and a delight to watch. If occasionally there are subtitles, they are inventively inserted at interesting places on the screen with their own background colours.The plot starts just before the question that lays the golden egg and cuts engagingly back through the boy's life using flashbacks. Why is he being tortured? How did he get on the show? Why doesn't he care about the money? In the background is his love, Latika, whom he has known since childhood. Both orphaned, she saw him by chance (standing abandoned in the rain) and he lets her share a corrugated iron shelter. It's a touching scene without too much sugar. And chance is the theme of the film. How does a Slumdog like Jemal guess the answers to general knowledge questions that could baffle the educated? That's what everybody wants to know.Few Western directors have managed to embrace India so convincingly. Colours become sanitised, dirt becomes exotic. Boyle leaves us in no doubt as to the degradation, but makes it palatable through daring cinematography. This is no work of realism such as that of Satyajit Ray. Apart from a joyful closing credits scene, neither is it Bollywood. And although I thoroughly enjoyed it, I can't help feeling that some critics have gone overboard in estimating it to be more than the sum of its parts. As if Mamma Mia! could become art-house if it only had had one more ancient artefact. The film has nothing very deep to say. It is entertainment, pure and simple. Boyle's hodgepodge talents have been brought together for once in a recipe that any professional chef should be very proud of. It might even be his best film since Trainspotting, but it is heralds no new frontiers. A rounded display of talent that holds its own against the best in the Hollywood tradition. I would hate to think that the future of British film-making is in India, but I'm pleased Danny Boyle has firmly found his wings again. And I was also very pleased to see one of the stars of the outstanding TV series, Skins, conquer the lead role.Slumdog Millionaire is a bag of very colourful tricks. The end result is great entertainment. It would be more remarkable if, in a later film, we were to see these stirring skills used for real comment on the human condition (for instance) and take us off the popcorn ride. When will the real Danny Boyle stand up? Near the Taj Mahal, I once looked down and saw boys pretending to levitate a corpse. They wanted tourists to throw money down to them (with a cut, no doubt, for the boy beneath the stretcher). It was all good fun. But made me wonder when the real fakir would appear.",8,4,8,29 December 2008
Gladiator," ('Blood & Guts in Ancient Rome' - sorry ladies, this film is *not* called 'Russell Crowe gets his Kit Off')
","An epic worthy of the best traditions of this sort of cinema. Top notch acting, an opening battle scene that almost does for that time period what Saving Private Ryan did for WW2 - it recreates the sheer horror inflicted by the Roman Army. Later, the actual gladiator scenes in Rome are also convincingly portrayed. The cerebral elements where we follow the moral strengths and weaknesses of the characters give it more substance than a mere action movie. Its main weakness is probably that which most big Hollywood epics have had - no more than a passing attempt to use the film as an art form - this, as the gladiator organizer says, is entertainment. (Note - from the little history I've been able to glean, the storyline - who kills who - seems to be largely fiction, although the portrayal of the characters of the main players seems reasonable enough and the other details are apparently quite well constructed. So we get quite a reasonable picture of the Empire in this context if we ignore the plot. Perhaps some historians reading this will want to add details about the lives and deaths of Marcus Aurelius, Maximus and Commodus just to keep the record straight.)",8,0,0,27 May 2000
Donnie Darko," Description-defying but very original movie about a disturbed adolescent with schizoid fantasies that manages to be charming, disturbing, funny, touching and thought-provoking all in one
","Many genres magically and effortlessly blended Â– supernatural suspense, comedy, sci-fi fable, teen high school romance, adult drama and fantasy. Could watch it many times over. Tears for Fears amongst others soundtrack. Acting is a bit like a very young Dustin Hoffman. Slow fast frames. Oscar material Â– except it seems, from disclosures made since its release, that this may have been almost luck rather than judgement on the director's part, as his original cut had given the movie a religious slant that would probably have weakened it greatly. Having seen no end of directors make a fool of themselves after an initial hit, the Academy voters may, as they have been known to do, exhibit a tendency to expect people to Â‘earn their spurs' rather than voting for what may have been a fluke (cf Sam Mendes with American Beauty, followed by the lamentable Road to Perdition). The sincere and realistic performances make the occasional caricature or stereotype all the more humorous.",9,1,3,3 November 2002
Macbeth," A cinematic triumph
","While it will not please everybody, Kurzel's treatment of a familiar story is little short of spectacular, gripping the spectator emotionally and visually.There have been many treatments of the semi-fictional yet inspiring Shakespearean saga of ambition and corruption, with famous actors and directors from the earliest days of cinema. In 1971, Polanski injected new life in the tale by depicting the grimness of the early Scottish landscape and the violent and brutality of events from the play. Although Polanski made an effort towards faithfulness of the words written by the Bard, bringing a grittiness to the screen that could hardly be achieved on stage, Kurzel in one sense goes a stage further, completely accepting that cinema is a different medium and that faithfulness to the spirit of a story can be fulfilled in many dimensions.From the very opening scenes, before hardly a word has been spoken, Kurzel uses visual images of desperate conditions, a child's death, a youngster preparing for war, to heighten our emotional sensitivity. When spoken words begin, there is little attempt to 'make Shakespearean English understandable' in the normal way. True to the story, he uses heavy Scottish accents, forcing the viewer to follow what is happening visually, and the emotional journeys become a tsunami.Superb acting shows Macbeth as an initially good, loyal, man, the three witches not as bat-boiling hags but as sincere, folklorish women, and the future Lady Macbeth as devoted, loving and kind (if a bit misguided). All this fits with reasonable history of the period and the story generally. The unsophisticated Macbeth is loyal to his king, but allows his wife (who wants him to succeed in life) to influence him against his better judgment. Her unravelling, as she witnesses the monster that her husband has become (at her bidding) is a transformation effected by Marion Cotillard in one of the most remarkable female performances of the year.As long as you have a passing idea of the story, it is easy enough to follow by focussing on the emotions of the characters. There is no need of the usual cinematic markers of overblown heroism and evil deeds to delineate good and evil (although there are plenty of evil deeds as well, some of them clothed in sweetness and piety). We can see for ourselves, in the subtle expressions and choices, as a pure heart becomes corrupt, and as evil takes root until the person no longer knows themself.The contrast between the old king and Macbeth in power also touches on broader themes: that leaders can embody things that all men and women aspire to, such as honesty, recognition of others, kindness and a better future for all. When these are lacking, most people no longer love and identify with their king but merely think of staying alive, being a bit better off materially, or going home to their family.Kurzel finds novel ways of dealing with the big supernatural events that strike us as entirely credible without the use of special effects and even manages to add a new interpretation to the famous 'Birnham Wood'. The stunning climax might suggest modern day lessons of tolerance over the heated Scottish independence question; and the final footage is used not to amaze in typical blockbuster style but to tear at one's heart and guts as we consider the horrors visited on innocent men and children by the unleashed greed and ambition that was as unstoppable as it was unintended.One cannot make a film like this which breaks the mold without upsetting those that seek straightforward entertainment. Yet this is, in some sense at least, Shakespeare: those that only go for battle scenes and the story on a plate may leave feeling distinctly unsatisfied.",10,6,12,2 November 2015
The Pursuit of Happyness," A two hour pursuit where we know the ending
","The relaxing opening music and reassuring title suggest this will be a warm fuzzy feelgood movie with a nice star turn from Will Smith. The switch to grainy film and self-consciously natural performances start to eat away at such assumptions. Will Smith plays the rags-to-riches father, but wades through heartbreaking poverty before he can climb the ladder to apprentice stockbroker, all the time bonding and maintaining good spirits with his son whom he loves dearly.The title, from the Declaration of Independence, affirms the American Dream. We might wish that Will Smith, for all his acting skill (his performance is the best thing about the film) could expedite it a little more - two hours, when the end is a foregone conclusion, feels like labouring the point. The clunky story comes to rely overmuch on the undoubted chemistry between father and son (played by Will Smith's real life son) and one of the best performances of Smith's career. Its main achievement is its heartfelt depiction of fatherhood.It might well be 'inspired by a real story', as the credits claim, but the broken-marriage, salesman-down-on-his-luck, yet fighting-through-to-a-better-day, is formulaic in the extreme. Smith sells bone density scanners - an item he has bought many of in the hope of making a profit. Although he has the ability to solve a Rubik cube in a short taxi ride, he still manages to lose his scanners repeatedly, providing repetitious sub-plots as he struggles to retrieve them.One of the best scenes is when father and son, homeless, are stranded in a subway station. Dad pretends that the bone density scanner is a time machine as a game to distract the young lad from the seriousness of their situation. They sleep in a disused latrine, perfectly dressed - Smith has to attend broker induction classes in the morning.The Pursuit of Happiness holds a nice idea, but one that could be told in a half hour TV slot. Its suggestion that happiness is equivalent to money grates somewhat on the non-American ear, especially considering the film's relentlessly didactic tone. A great vehicle for Smith to show his talents as a serious actor, but not a movie that in any other way comes up to the standards he admirably sets.",5,24,43,25 January 2007
Cinderella Man," Simple crowd pleaser
","Cinderella Man is the story of a Depression-era boxer and American hero Jim Braddock, but it contains enough love interest, family interest, and great-champion-of-the-people interest to satisfy most Saturday night out filmgoers. It's a total no-brainer, beautifully served up, and all the clichÃ©s delivered with such accurate emotional punch that you forgive it for being a tad unoriginal.Gladiator and bar-brawl man Russell Crowe plays the lead role and RenÃ©e Zellweger puts in a good performance as the ideal and very loving wife that supports her husband through thick and thin. The story starts in 1928 when Braddock is doing quite well, but the depression hits and, with an injured hand, he is forced to work in the shipyard. He and his family live in fairly abject poverty until a lucky break enables him to make a comeback.This is the working man's hero who never says a bad word, teaches his kids never to steal for food even when they are starving, and nobly gives back his social security money the minute he can afford to. Zellwegger is similarly faultless of course, striking the right balance between supportiveness and concern that her man could get his brains knocked out permanently. The last fight generates quite a lot of genuine excitement due largely to neat editing and intense cinematography - you can almost feel your nose bleed just watching it.This is classic American-style hero creation and worship and, on the face of it, healthy enough. So why the doubts? Sure you can sit back and just enjoy it, it's the type of story the U.S. has done well for a long time; but compare it with European cinema and it all seems very full of absolutes. The heroes don't have any failings. The choice is between total success and total failure, no half measures. Much as I admire the use of role models, I somehow wonder if more human heroes aren't sometimes called for, people who do quite well, who sincerely better themselves and others, but without becoming the most applauded individual on the continent. In watching the big picture we sometimes miss the detail that makes life real to everyone, not just the lucky few.",7,21,29,31 August 2005
Dodgeball," superior slapstick comedy - tightly scripted, it gets immense mileage out of the flimsiest of gags
","Go and see it. It's one of the best comedies of the year and a lot funnier than it should be given the flimsy premise. Ben Stiller has a big 'Globo' health club worth millions (it even includes cosmetic surgery facilities - they know that 'fatness is genetic, like baldness or necrophilia'). The lovely Christine Taylor is his lawyer, charged with getting rid of the 'Average Joe' gym across the road so they can build a parking lot for Globo customers. She takes a liking to the 'underdog' owner of the Average Joe gym though, and helps them in their plan to win a Dodgeball contest in order to get the money they owe. Dodgeball is an 'obscure' sport that mostly consists of throwing a ball to hit your opponent (look it up on the Net - Dodgeball fans take it quite seriously!) Even when I describe the film, I think 'it sounds awful' - I probably would have avoided it if it hadn't been recommended so highly - and I recommend you stay till the *very end* of the credits for one of the best scenes (which also takes a swipe at the US film-making industry!)",7,66,88,3 October 2004
From Here to Eternity," Chiefly famous now for 'that' scene . . .
","This is a film that many people now will know for its most famous scene. The kiss and embrace on the beach between Deborah Kerr and Burt Lancaster. That scene is truly awesome. Technically, emotionally and for its timeless appeal. Often copied and even parodied, it is one of the best lip-clinches in cinematic history. For viewers looking back on it now, little can be said of the rest of the film in such superlatives. But is worth watching for that kiss.The story is a watered down version of a famous novel. Set in the American army just before the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbour, it shows the harsh reality of the bombing (in a finale that is in sharp contrast to the easygoing flamboyance of the rest of the movie). It was one of the first films to show the harshness of military life, including bullying (though this was one of the many aspects watered down for the censors at the time). It has award-winning or famous performances from many stars that are still household names. A vast amount of talent was poured into it. Some subtleties (such as Deborah Kerr playing against her standard, pure-as-the-driven-snow roles) will be lost on modern audiences if they miss the contrasts. But who has not heard of the title?Two love stories form subplots to the main story, which is one of a harsh and unfair commander (together with a brute also in charge of the stockade) and an unfairly victimised young bugler. There is a passionate and illicit love affair between a First Sergeant and the Commander's wife. Then there is an equally furtive liaison between the young bugler (in between beatings) and a 'hostess'. Using Hawaii as a backdrop, there is great contrast between the idyllic setting on one hand, and the vicious treatment of junior soldiers (not to mention the horrific bombing scenes) on the other. And some nice bugle playing.The merits of the film could be eulogised at greater length, but in the interests of balance and to reflect the concerns of modern audiences, two other aspects might be mentioned. At least they were things that stuck out quite horribly to me, so I am going to mention them.The first is the overwhelming portrait of drunkenness and brawling (according to reports, the first was common among some of the stars, not just the characters). There are many justifications, including the sufferings they were going through and the general tolerance of alcohol in American society. But what I found disconcerting (and still find disconcerting in many modern films featuring American soldiers, both fiction and documentary) is the toleration. If viewed through the lens of a society that doesn't embrace drunkenness (for instance Brasil, which is about the same size as America), it portrays a simplistic picture of American G.I.s as drunken louts. The datedness of the scenarios, although probably effective at the time, makes such obnoxious behaviour stand out all the more.The second thing that made me feel uncomfortable (though not to the same extent as the thoroughly awful modern film, Pearl Harbour) is the pervasive jingoism. America, it seems, can confront its own weakness in films about Vietnam (when the war was so obviously lost), but in 1953, as now, America was 'all perfect' and Japan was 'all evil'. It would be refreshing to see a film that embraced not only the inhumanity of Japanese attacking forces but acknowledged some of the background - the Washington-imposed oil-blockade of Japan that gave that small nation state the bleak choice of capitulation or war.From Here to Eternity is a great film. But it is perhaps little wonder why the excerpted clips are usually of Burt and Deborah on the beach rather than Sinatra falling about drunk. The realistic footage of unexpected bomb attacks however, probably deserves more acknowledgement.",8,1,1,3 October 2007
Atonement," red carpet reconstruction attempt
","If you are looking for another review to tell you how Atonement is the best acted, best adapted, best costumed (and so on) movie of the year, please stop reading. I don't disagree with that. I simply feel duty-bound to tell you why it is still a bad movie.Atonement is a period piece, set in 1935 and onwards. It follows the life of Briony Tallis (played by three actresses in the course of her life, including Vanessa Redgrave). We see how her error of judgement destroys the lives of at least two other people. She never does actually 'atone' for her wrong, although she ultimately finds a way of telling a second lie, more openly, to do the best she can in her own head. Excessively high production values, superlative acting, and a generally interesting story, blind to us the moral bankruptcy of our tale. A tale that has moral values as its focus. We come out of the cinema saying how interesting it was. But have accepted complicity in the same errors it purports to address.Cecilia Tallis (Kiera Knightley) lives a life of wealth and privilege in her family's Gothic mansion. She is having a tempestuous affair with Robbie (James McAvoy), the housekeeper's son. Cecilia's younger sister, Briony, is still a child. But Briony is at that cusp where hormones start to play havoc. She has been raised in a typical atmosphere of sexual hypocrisy. With an imagination informed more by her precocious skill as an author and playwright, than any understanding of humanity, she is only too ready to believe that most sex is evil. (Sex from a commoner is probably worse.) It is not long before some indiscretions on the part of Cecilia and Robbie allow Briony to form a wicked picture of the young man.When Briony witnesses a genuinely horrific sexual act, she makes a false accusation against Robbie. The power structures of wealth and class soon close ranks with Briony. She spends the rest of her life not only screwed up by Victorian values, but by her own over-arching sense of guilt for what she has done. The real victim of the crime - and real perpetrator - are tidied up as mere plot loose ends.I have not read the book and cannot comment on whether the original novel is as hypnotic, glossy - and essentially vacuous. But I am given to understand that Ian McEwan is happy with the screen version.Like a modern Lady Macbeth (there is a rather overly obvious hand-scrubbing reference), Briony is unable to assuage her guilt. And like the very power-forces that gave her childish lie such strength, the wealth, skill and moral righteousness thrown into this movie con us into believing it is anything but superficial. The acting is faultless. I have been critical of Knightley in her Pride & Prejudice Oscar-nominated role, but here she does clipped, slightly stroppy Cecilia to perfection. Much of the lauded talent from that earlier film has been reassembled. And it is almost as if they are having another shot at the Oscars they narrowly missed before (acting, costume and art direction) and a few more. The middle section (focussing on Dunkirk) has many 'Oscar worthy' moments, such as when lovesick Robbie/McAvoy is silhouetted against a cinema screen kiss. Or the long panning shot of the desolate battlefield that mirrors his inner desolation. But they are done self-consciously: the screen silhouette, for instance, is repeated (in case we didn't get the significance the first time?) By the end of Act Two I was convinced that the filmmakers were not going to let a lack of anything constructive to say get in the way of a good Academy attempt. We are invited to marvel at the film's elegiac quality. Indeed, there is much to admire. But its self-conceit goes on for a rather long time. And at the end, blame has been placed in all the wrong places. It even hints that, as a last resort, stories are better than the truth.",7,12,30,8 September 2007
V for Vendetta," Matrix-lite semiotics in a confused, if mildly entertaining, grab-bag of popular elements
","V for Vendetta throws together a remarkable melange of elements, bringing them together in an attempt to be overtly political. We have a dystopian future, an England ruled by a Hitler-lite version of the worst of Blair and Thatcher's governments (multiplied to a horrifying degree); a slightly crazy Guy Fawkes -style figure (V) who is conducting a vendetta against those who kept him in a detention centre; a mild-mannered heroine, Evie, who is almost gang-raped at the hands of corrupt government thugs; and a rather lovable Stephen Fry playing a closet homosexual TV producer.What was originally a comic-strip, updating an Orwellian tale of revolt against an authoritarian government to the eighties, has become a movie that updates the same themes to the present day. There's mention of rendition, an all-male cabinet that hearkens only to its leader, extensive use of 'spin', people detained without trial, secret police putting hoods over people's heads Guantanamo bay style, and most importantly the theme of 'terrors that we all face' as an excuse for government clamp downs and erosion of freedoms. For people pulling their hair out over the antics of Bush and Blair, V for Vendetta must seem like great fun in true liberal tradition. Indeed, there's a very intelligent film there somewhere Â– but this isn't it.In one scene, Portman (Evey) is about to be abused to the extent she will wish she had never been born. The masked and near-invincible V appears, slays her attackers, and treats her to a barrage of alliteration in which whole paragraphs use words starting with the letter 'V'. Thankful for her deliverance, she is wondering if she has been rescued by a mental case, but V demonstrates some of his pre-arranged demolition jobs set to music. As terrorists go, he's the thoughtful kind, respectful and artistic. Yet any considered analysis of the film gives us little help in deciding whether V is a true hero, saving the nation, or just someone with a heavy personal vendetta that might have the side-effect of getting rid of the bad guys. V's hero, Guy Fawkes, was not a liberator, even though he wanted to blow up parliament (as does V) Â– he was a Catholic dissident who wanted to destroy the Protestant aristocracy by blowing up the House of Lords and killing the reformer King James I. V wants to overthrow the government not because they are bad, but because they hurt him (and his family) personally, and is quite happy to murder extravagantly and with a certain panache. The two aims do overlap though, and he realises Evie must play a crucial part as the representative of more regular society.The (Matrix) Wachowski Brothers, who wrote the screenplay, indulge their love of literary association by referencing Shakespeare and the Count of Monte Cristo extensively. The use of colour is striking, jumping from violent red and black to smudgy warm interiors with artistic treasures or the white utilitarian rooms of plebeian offices. Natalie Portman's acting is tolerable, but the film's weakness is that it fails to convey any sense of reality, whether as a believable future society, a symbol of modern day ills, or a political thriller. We are left with the Watchowskis' portmanteau of assorted skills thrown together in an inadequate script, and central characters that add up barely as well as the Joker from Batman and Robin, but with the added baggage of trying to ride the crest of left-wing political comment films without having done the necessary homework. Bereft of its pretensions, V for Vendetta is just about acceptable fare for comic-to-film fans, but otherwise fails to rise above the mid water mark for a night's viewing. Like Superman before him, V is a hero who is portrayed as physically and emotionally emasculated, unable to have normal sexual relations, genetically modified with super strength and near invulnerability Â– a comic-book fan's wet dream. He ensconces himself in a fortress, venturing out as a god-in-a-cape messianic figure. But when the masses rally to support him in their look-alike masks, we can't help but wonder if they will be capable of instituting an intelligent democracy to replace the order that is overthrown. As a superhero, his philosophy has little to recommend it beyond listening to Julie London classics and imitating the Three Musketeers (unless we add a sympathetic ear for gays and lesbians). Bereft of V's remarkable powers, the pub-soaked working classes watching him on a TV screen seem to offer little hope for an enlightened future.",6,12,23,14 March 2006
The Island," The Island is an opportunity wasted, in an ocean of talent and opportunity
","For a dedicated sci-fi fan, The Island is necessary nourishment. But what is there for a wider audience? Ewan McGregor starts questioning his environment, the general belief that everyone he sees on a day to day basis has been saved from a contaminated planet, that they are the 'lucky' ones being prepared to go to the Island, an uncontaminated last haven, where they will start a new Eden. His friend Scarlett Johansson is less questioning but is good at recognising lying in his facial expression. The truth gradually unfolds, interspersed with several high speed chases and reasonably convincing future landscapes.What turns out to be a decent plot is made overlong, and as there is so little time to build detail into a fairly mammoth story, it is easy to lose interest. Lame direction (from the guy who brought us Pearl Harbor) and pedestrian acting doesn't help matters, however inventive some of the explosions. Steve Buscemi almost rescues things as the hapless engineer bridging two worlds, but Johansson is cast well below her abilities and McGregor - instead of stretching his acting talents - stretches nothing more than his good looks to play himself yet again. The 2hrs+ finds plenty of room to squeeze in plot holes and clichÃ©s, but in a sea of talent and opportunities, The Island remains, sadly, an opportunity wasted.",5,1,3,11 August 2005
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Possibly the Coen Bros' most inventive movie to date
","Possibly the Coen Bros' most inventive movie to date, it is crammed with memorable images, a storyline nicked with some flair from the classics, and acting and singing to give most moviegoers a hefty wallop of feelgood together with a sense of cut-above-the-rest aesthetic appreciation. George Clooney is at his best and combines comedy, drama, romance and singing in his performance. I've met one or two people who didn't think much of it, but many people would put it in the category of 'If you only go to see one movie this summer . . .'",8,0,0,26 September 2000
The Godfather," An offer you can't refuse
","Taking the old-fashioned gangster film to new heights, The Godfather used traditional story-telling freed from the strict censorship that meant bad guys always got their come-uppance. More film noir than thriller, there are no good guys, and we meditate on the small rays of hope within the darkness of corruption, or wonder how far our good and pleasant lifestyles are supported, at some level, by corruption.In dark, Rembrandt-like backrooms, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and his family grant favours, blessings, and generally run things for their friends out in the real, bright and beautiful world. A bride's father traditionally grants any wish, and petitions come from far and wide as Don Corleone's daughter has a colourful wedding celebration outside.It's 1945. Things are changing. Narcotics is the big new industry that beckons temptingly, and one in which the other mafia families have already started. Don Corleone is cautious, but his competitors are envious of the control he has over the police and the judges and want him in. Before long, bloody warfare between the gangs ensues.The Godfather continually contrasts dark and light, external show with violent murky depths, and the devoutness of the gangsters is emphasised. One sequence has a scene of a family baptism intercut with brutal killings ordered by the head of the gang (who is in church). Further similarities to the Roman Catholic Spanish Inquisition might be inferred from a scene immediately afterwards where a confession is obtained from a double-crossing gang member - he is promised redemption but executed anyway.The double nature of the main characters is convincingly emphasised as we watch Don Corleone play with his grandson in the garden, or his successor Michael (Al Pacino) enjoy the idyllic countryside of Sicily. It is taken to a new level when, in a different situation, he tells a blatant lie compellingly and lovingly to his wife so she doesn't think him a murderer. His gentleness goes hand in hand with his brutal nature.The Godfather catapulted the career of the young Francis Coppola and revitalised the career of Marlon Brando. A masterpiece of restrained film-making, its biggest fault may be that there are so many characters and details to absorb in the complex family plots for a first viewing.In a conference over whether to deal in narcotics, one of the arguments that sways the day is that if they don't control them, someone else will step in and do so. By dealing in narcotics at the most powerful level, they can keep them away from children. An argument that should perhaps be given greater consideration by legislators.If anyone has ever made you 'an offer you couldn't refuse', this is the film that created and popularised the phrase. It was meant quite literally.",9,2,5,23 December 2006
