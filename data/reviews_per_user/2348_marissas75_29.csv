Marie Antoinette," Immerses you in Marie's world
","'Marie Antoinette' takes you into two places the movies have never been before: the sumptuous halls of Versailles, and the thoughts and feelings of the notorious French queen. It treats its heroine with great sympathy, even her gambling parties and playacting at being a shepherdess. Marie's (Kirsten Dunst) shopping and trendsetting aren't sheer frivolities, but ways for her to distract herself from the strictures of court life and her despair that her husband, the none-too-majestic Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman) shows no interest in her. The movie's centerpiece pastel-shoes-and-pastries montage, set to the song 'I Want Candy,' comes right after she reaches her lowest depth of misery that other court ladies are having babies while she remains a virgin.There's a lot of talk about how Marie must produce children to cement a political alliance between France and Austria; other than that, the movie is quite apolitical. It doesn't concern itself with the causes of the French Revolution, and a few scenes of Louis debating whether to aid the American Revolution feel tacked-on. But interestingly, this apolitical quality makes the climactic scene of an angry peasant mob storming Versailles very effective. The shock you feel at seeing the mob is the same as Marie's shock, because the whole movie has been limited to Marie's perspective, the hermetically sealed world of the court. Some have criticized the against-type casting (e.g. Schwartzman, Rip Torn, and Molly Shannon as French royalty), but it points out the human side of these aristocratic figures, making them feel more contemporary and individualized. Every actor uses his or her natural accent, be it British, American, or French, which adds to the unpretentious feeling. Besides, the emphasis here is not on speech, but on mood and image. What little dialogue there is mostly consists of gossipy whispers, lectures to Marie about her royal duties, or casual, seemingly improvised conversations.Dunst is especially good in the early scenes, successfully playing a character much younger than her actual age. She really seems like a spontaneous, uncomplicated 15-year-old girl, which is important for the movie to be effective. This 'Marie Antoinette' wants you to think about the natural versus the artificial: how the rigid Versailles etiquette stifles Marie's and Louis' natural instincts, how Marie's desire to immerse herself in artifice (shoes, clothes) is actually natural or understandable, why she is happiest on her faux farm, etc. Dunst's performance, which goes from sweet naiveté to stubborn frivolity to a growing maturity, matches the movie's rhythms.With its dainty pastel color scheme, rock soundtrack, female protagonist who seems like an ordinary young girl instead of a remote aristocrat, and focus on visuals and emotion rather than plot and dialogue, 'Marie Antoinette' is not a typical historical bio-drama. Though not as affecting as the intimate 'Lost in Translation,' it does cause you to sympathize with the young queen. Aesthetically pleasing and apolitical, it's the sort of movie that Marie Antoinette's favorite portraitist, Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun, would have made if she were a filmmaker instead of a painter.",8,0,1,26 December 2006
Chinatown," A bleak and brilliant noir masterpiece
","One of those bleak, brilliant 1970s movies, 'Chinatown' draws inspiration from 1940s-style film noir, but is much more than just a homage to the genre. Though its excellent screenplay features the requisite snappy dialogue and tight, twisty plotting, its deeply cynical view of human nature takes the film beyond simple entertainment into near-tragedy. The glittering reservoirs and sun-baked deserts of Los Angeles turn out to be dangerous places, and a lush score helps set the movie's darkly romantic mood.Private detective J. J. 'Jake' Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is hired to investigate whether Hollis Mulwray, head of the Los Angeles water department, is cheating on his wife Evelyn (Faye Dunaway). Things are much more complicated than Jake can possibly imagine, though: not only does he dredge up secrets about Hollis, Evelyn, and Evelyn's millionaire father Noah Cross (John Huston), he also discovers massive corruption in the water department. Though one plot deals with individuals and the other plot deals with society at large, they're both equally fascinating, and tie together in surprising ways.The role of Jake Gittes was written to take advantage of Jack Nicholson's sly, sarcastic persona and other trademark mannerisms. But Jake's not just the cool, clever guy we've come to expect from Nicholson, or from movie detectives in general. Instead, he's hardly ever in control of the situation, and vulnerable because of this. To Nicholson's great credit, he captures these nuances, rather than coasting on his persona.Evelyn is an even more layered, mysterious character, and Dunaway plays her with the elegant coolness known to every film noir dame. But Dunaway makes clear that Evelyn is not really a femme fatale: her coolness does not reflect an inner heartlessness. Instead, Evelyn's self- possession is just an act, and internally she's wounded and fragile.'Chinatown' has been directed with superb attention to detailalways a good thing in a detective movie. Film noirs of the '40s, as good as they are, sometimes display hints that they were shot on a soundstage, but that's never the case with 'Chinatown.' Roman Polanski's camera enjoys following Jake Gittes as he examines the many clues and false leads, and there are some nice visual motifs, such as water and broken glass.'Chinatown''s ending is famously despairing, acknowledging that ordinary citizens with good intentions stand no chance against a corrupt bureaucracy. It would be unusual nowadays to have so many great talents collaborating on such a pessimistic story; fortunately, in 1974, the makers of 'Chinatown' pooled their efforts and created a tragic, engaging, and outstanding movie.",10,2,4,17 August 2006
I'm Not There," Preaches to the choir of Dylan fans
","'I'm Not There,' Todd Haynes' meditation on Bob Dylan's many facets, never mentions Dylan by name, preferring allusion and metaphor instead. Judging by the amount of 10-star ratings this movie has received here on the IMDb, it seems to have found an admiring audience, but I'd bet that most of them are Dylan fans who understand what Haynes is trying to say. I'm a little different: though I very much respect Dylan as a songwriter and musician, I was born in the 1980s, and thus missed all of the cultural moments that Haynes alludes to. As a result, I think my appreciation of the movie was severely diminished.Haynes does have a reputation for making intellectual or postmodern films, but I feel like that got the better of him here. I loved his 'Far From Heaven' because it wasn't merely clever; it made me emotionally involved with the characters and story. 'I'm Not There' has fewer emotional moments, and even when I started to feel connected to certain characters, I constantly wondered, 'Why is he showing me this? What does this have to do with the rest of the movie, or with Dylan? Is there some hidden meaning I'm not getting?' For instance, one of the movie's Dylan incarnations is an 11-year-old African-American hobo, played by Marcus Carl Franklin. Franklin has lots of personality and is fun to watch, but still is almost overshadowed by his character's metaphorical, cultural, and historical 'significance.' And the film's most thoroughly explored relationship is the troubled marriage of actor Robbie (Heath Ledger) and painter Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) but that seemed like outtakes from a different story, that of the celebrity who abandons his wife when he gets famous. At least this segment had fewer obscure Dylan references.I admired much of the acting and Haynes' ability to give each segment a different look and feel, but often I wondered whether I wouldn't have been better off buying a few more Dylan albums and reading something about the real Dylan instead. For example, I really enjoyed Cate Blanchett's performance as the jittery, sneering, gnomic 'Jude Quinn'--she does a great job of being incredibly charismatic and incredibly off-putting at once. But if her mannerisms and some of her dialogue were copied from the Dylan documentary 'Don't Look Back,' as is apparently the case, should I have just watched that instead? Then there are certain aspects that don't work at all. One Dylan incarnation, 'Arthur Rimbaud' (Ben Whishaw) is just on hand to make enigmatic pronouncements. Another, 'Billy the Kid' (Richard Gere), shows up in a segment full of if-Fellini-were-American images (à la Tim Burton's 'Big Fish'). This is the kind of literal-minded recreation of Dylan's surreal lyrics that made the Broadway musical 'The Times They Are A-Changin'' such a notorious flop, and it just feels like padding here.'I'm Not There' is partially about Dylan's complex relationship with his fans--his desire to keep changing his image, upsetting people's preconceived notions and refusing to preach to the choir. It's too bad, then, that 'I'm Not There' is the definition of a preaching-to-the-choir film: probably satisfying for Dylan obsessives, but too cryptic for us Dylan rookies.",6,3,4,4 January 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," It definitely feels like a sequel--is that good or bad?
","'Dead Man's Chest' is basically an amplified version of the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie, 'The Curse of the Black Pearl.' So if you adored the first movie, you'll probably get a kick out of this one; but if you, like me, are in the minority that considers the first movie entertaining but overrated, you'll probably have even less patience with 'Dead Man's Chest.'Where 'Black Pearl' had a silly and convoluted plot involving a crew of undead sailors, 'Dead Man's Chest' has an even sillier and more convoluted plot centered on a different crew of undead sailors, this time led by tentacle-faced Davy Jones (reliable character actor Bill Nighy). Because each character in this movie has his or her own quest, which involves going on subsidiary quests to find other people or objects that they require for help, the structure quickly becomes overstuffed. However, the number of competing characters does provide for an exciting chase sequence near the endas long as you can remember what everyone's motivations are for taking part.For 'Dead Man's Chest' to make sense, you must also remember what happened in the first movie, because most of the characters (even those who made little impression in 'Black Pearl,' such as Norrington) recur. But, ironically, you would also do well to forget the first movie, because this one recycles many of the same jokes and scenarios. The actors have amplified their old performances without exploring any new ground: Johnny Depp is woozier, Keira Knightley feistier, and Orlando Bloom blander than in the original film. Action sequences are bigger and busier; despite 'Dead Man's Chest''s 2.5-hour running time, there's no room for a simple one-on-one swordfight like Depp and Bloom's in 'Black Pearl.'So 'Dead Man's Chest' is bloated, convoluted, and not particularly original. But I found myself enjoying parts of it nonetheless. One sequence set on a cannibal island has no bearing on the plotits only purpose is to let Johnny Depp make a fool of himself, but he does this so willingly that it's a pleasure to watch. The director and writers didn't take any risks with the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise, but they didn't embarrass themselves or betray the spirit of the first movie, either. And hey, at least you know what you're in for.",5,4,6,24 December 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Oustanding blend of the classic and the modern
","'Brokeback Mountain' combines high-quality film-making technique and universally resonant emotions with subject matter that some people still find discomforting or taboo, for an outstanding movie that feels both classic and modern at the same time.The first part of the film deals with a summer spent by two young sheepherders, Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist, on Brokeback Mountain, where their relationship goes from friendship to copulation to a love that they can scarcely believe is real. After this idyll, the film follows these characters for the next twenty years as they marry, have children, and pursue their love in secret. It's a succession of heart-wrenching emotional moments, each more painful than the next. But, amazingly, the film is never noisy, bombastic, or sappy. The film's quartet of young actors all do wonderful work. Heath Ledger is astonishing as Ennishe takes the stereotype of the taciturn, stoic 'Western' hero, forces this iconic character to confront a range of new emotions, and does it all without a hint of mockery. He makes an archetype believable again. As Jack, Jake Gyllenhaal is a great foil to Ledgermore exuberant and more hungry than he. Michelle Williams makes Ennis's wife, Alma, into a sympathetic, quietly tragic figure, and Anne Hathaway is a lot of fun as Jack's wife Lureen.I heard that the director and producer decided that women were the target audience for this movie, according to the logic that 'it's a love story, and they're cute!' But because the 'love story' part of that statement is so true, the 'they're cute' part gets negated. When watching certain romantic movies that star good-looking actors, you start to fantasize that it's you in the movie, kissing the handsome guy (or beautiful gal), in place of his or her co-star. This is fun, but it also means that the movie is mediocresuch fantasies take you outside of the world that the movie is trying to create. Daydreaming that you have replaced one of the actors means the romantic relationship was so weak and unpersuasive that you think you'd make a better romantic lead than the actual character in the film. But in a truly romantic movie, you believe so strongly that the two characters are meant to be together that you wouldn't dream of replacing one of them with yourself. 'Brokeback Mountain' is such a film. Who on earth could break up Jack and Ennis' lovea love that persists in the face of so many obstacles, a love that they themselves cannot end? It would be sordid even to try.So, women: go see 'Brokeback Mountain.' Get your heart broken half-a-dozen times by all its emotion-filled moments. Be astounded by the performances of Ledger, Gyllenhaal, Williams, and Hathaway. Just don't go expecting to spend two hours fantasizing about a handsome actor or two. This film's rewards are different, and greater. Any mediocre movie can make you fall in love with a cute leading actor. But 'Brokeback Mountain' has the rare quality of making you fall in love with two characters, Jack and Ennis, and the love between them.",10,26,32,13 December 2005
Juno," Gets deeper and wiser as it goes, just like Juno herself
","Movies named after their main character usually work best if that character has an outsize, iconic quality--and Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) certainly qualifies. A smart-mouthed 16-year-old who becomes pregnant by her friend-with-benefits Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera), she is the star of one of the year's best comedy films.The movie is divided into three sections to correspond with the three trimesters of Juno's pregnancy, as well as the conventional three-act screenplay structure. The first part gets off to a rough start because the dialogue is over-written, too clever by half. Some of this is necessary to characterize Juno as a snarky alterna-teen, but why should a random pharmacist talk this way as well? Also, the filmmakers don't convincingly explain why the self-confident Juno chickens out of getting an abortion.Things get better with the introduction of Mark and Vanessa (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner), the yuppie couple who want to adopt Juno's baby. Their dialogue is 'normal,' not overly hip, and their arrival really sets the plot in motion. The relationships between Mark, Vanessa, and Juno become interestingly complex, and their characters deepen--we learn that our first impressions of them do not tell the whole story.Indeed, although the first part of the movie seems to idealize everything about Juno (her wit, her taste in music, her hamburger phone), it eventually allows her to be unlikable at times. Her flippant jokes do not impress Mark and Vanessa, and she behaves thoughtlessly toward sweet Paulie. When she apologizes to him in front of his cross-country teammates, it's a nice reversal of all those teen movies where the guy publicly apologizes to the girl.So by the end, what seemed like it was going to be 90 minutes of shallow pop-culture allusions becomes a warmhearted comedy about a teenage girl learning that she still has a lot to learn. Though Juno's dialogue is still sardonic and clever, it no longer feels artificial. At her lowest point, she quips 'I've been out dealing with things way beyond my maturity level'--a funny line, but one that shows her vulnerability and fear of growing up too fast.At least, that's what I got from Ellen Page's reading of that line, and it feels spot-on, like all of her work in this film. Michael Cera assists with his trademark awkward-but-trying-not-to-show-it attitude, and together Page and Cera provide an adorable final scene. Bateman and Garner handle their character development well, and J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney play Juno's sympathetic parents. And I am especially looking forward to writer Diablo Cody's next project--I hope she got her excesses out of her system with the first part of 'Juno,' because the rest of the movie proves that she can write a charming comedy.",9,1,9,20 January 2008
Match Point," The Man Who Had All the Luck
","Filmed on location in England and featuring just one joke about neuroses, 'Match Point' is perhaps not instantly recognizable as a Woody Allen film. But its intelligent script and skillful direction mark it as the work of a talented filmmaker, and one who is still willing to try new techniques.Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), who teaches tennis at a posh club, becomes friends with the wealthy Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode) and starts dating Tom's sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer). But he finds himself extremely attracted to Tom's fiancée, an aspiring actress named Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson). Increasingly, Chris must choose between two very different women and two very different lifestyles--optimistic, naive, moneyed Chloe, or worldly, seductive, struggling Nola? Using this rather simple story, 'Match Point' goes on to explore questions of luck, fate, ambition, and morality.Allen takes his time with the early part of the movie, which is perhaps a few scenes too long. Eventually, though, it subtly shifts from being a realistic drama to something much darker and more involving. The last 40 or so minutes are absolutely gripping, full of classically suspenseful moments and a very clever resolution.Some reviews have called Nola a 'femme fatale' type, and her memorable first appearance certainly gives off that impression: her husky voice purrs 'So, who's my next victim?' as she pouts by the ping-pong table. But one of the nice things about 'Match Point' is that it subverts these expectations. Nola's character gains depth until she seems like a rather ordinary young woman who got herself into a difficult situation and is trying her best to get out of it. She's far from a perfect human being, but far from the evil 'femme fatale' mode too. (Besides, no one in this film is perfect.) Scarlett Johansson gives a vivid performance of this complex character.In the early scenes of 'Match Point,' Chris's personality is a little unclear, both in the way Allen wrote the role and the way Rhys-Meyers performs it. However, by the end, both writer and actor have fully committed to making Chris a 'Talented Mr. Ripley' type. Mortimer and Goode excellently capture the Hewett siblings' characters--good-natured, accustomed to a life of ease, unaware of how lucky they are.'Match Point''s slow start keeps it from perfection (there is also one small misstep toward the end, where Allen violates the rules of the world he has created). Still, in an era when many movies begin well and then fall apart by the end, I'll take 'Match Point''s solid-but- unremarkable beginning and brilliant ending any day.",9,1,2,23 January 2006
Once," Lost souls in Dublin
","Descriptions of 'Once' as a modern-day musical are all well and good, but to give a better sense of its mood and style, a comparison to 'Lost in Translation' seems to fit. Both movies depict a wistful friendship-slash-romance between a rumpled, sad-eyed guy and a dewy younger girl. In 'Lost in Translation,' Bob and Charlotte's connection grew stronger when they sang karaoke together--'Once' takes this idea and runs with it, focusing entirely on how music unites the two nameless protagonists. A busking Irish guitarist (Glen Hansard) and a Czech pianist (Marketa Irglova) meet by accident, discover their shared love of music, and quickly become songwriting/recording partners.The best scene in the movie is definitely their first song together, 'Falling Slowly.' Irglova gaining confidence and starting to harmonize with Hansard, and director John Carney finally giving us a close-up of their two faces singing, are both beautiful moments. Wisely, this same song closes the movie--and though the characters are now at a very different place, the lyrics take on new resonance. The other musical highlight is a long tracking shot of Irglova walking along a street late at night, wearing pajamas, singing some lyrics she has just written. Other songs are more generic 'singer-songwriter' stuff, even though the lyrics match the characters' emotions and the music sounds like what they would write.Rock musician Hansard's falsetto voice and twisted-up facial expressions when singing convey his character's sensitive side (he just broke up with his girlfriend). Irglova was just 17 when filming this movie, but she is an old soul (rather like Johansson in 'Lost in Translation'). Her character is strong and forthright so much of the time, yet afraid to confront her own feelings.Ultimately, I prefer 'Lost in Translation' because the incidents it depicted were more varied and amusing; 'Once''s total focus on the music means that if you don't like the songs, you're out of luck. Also, scenes like the rather contrived meet-cute don't stand up to scrutiny. Still, both movies are fine examples of how sometimes our most memorable, life-changing relationships happen by accident and last only a short time--and certainly don't conform to Hollywood norms. As it should, the ending of 'Once' has the right bittersweet effect.",8,3,6,15 January 2008
Crash," Not so deep
","I admire Paul Haggis's intentions in making 'Crash'--I'm sure he honestly believed his movie provided penetrating insights into urban American race relations. I understand that he wanted to show how people's lives can intersect in fascinating ways, how sometimes it takes a great shock in order to jolt us out of our patterns of thinking and reveal our common humanity. Unfortunately, the methods he uses to get this message across are rarely subtle and never as profound as he thinks they are.The problem is that 'Crash' never goes any deeper than pointing out that everyone has the potential to be both a racist and a caring human being. Rarely does it suggest why its characters automatically revert to racist thinking whenever they are stressed or angry. Only Matt Dillon's character is given some motivation: he has a monologue describing his hatred of affirmative action. But we never learn why most of the other characters are so quick to hurl racial slurs at one another--or, for that matter, why the Mexican locksmith is the only character in the film who is not racist, despite living in a community full of bigots.I've written 'Matt Dillon's character' or 'the Mexican locksmith', rather than using the characters' given names, because those names are so unimportant in the script. (For the record, they are 'Officer Ryan' and 'Daniel,' respectively.) The characters are blatant types, with a few surface contradictions but little real insight into how race and ethnicity has affected their lives. I would love to know how Don Cheadle's character ended up a successful detective, while his brother is a criminal. Or what prompted the Persian storekeeper to buy a gun in the first place. We learn how the privileged white Jean (Sandra Bullock) feels about her Latina maid--but how does the maid feel about her employer?'Crash' is also poorly structured and directed. For me, the best moment in the film is when Officer Ryan rescues Christine (Thandie Newton) from her car: the situation is so emotionally charged, and the direction so simple and powerful, that it works in spite of itself. But this scene, which ought to be the climax of the movie, instead comes about an hour into it. And the impact of a later scene, which could be equally powerful if handled correctly (it involves Daniel, his young daughter, and a man with a gun), is counteracted by Haggis's decision to demonstrate to us that this is an emotional moment, rather than letting us figure it out for ourselves. He goes overboard with ponderous music, slow-motion, and shots of agonized, crying faces. When he later employs the same music and slow motion as Jean falls down her staircase, the effect is so anticlimactic, it's laughable. Haggis also seems not to know how to end the movie: he takes too long tying up the various plot-threads, and strains too hard for a sense of redemption and hope.Despite these flaws, 'Crash' did keep me continually engaged, even if some of the story lines required me to suspend my disbelief to an absurd degree. The large cast of actors do the best they can with Haggis's superficial script, and the Los Angeles landscapes are nicely filmed in a palette of ambers and blues.Racism is an issue that society (and the movies) still often refuses to discuss. It's a pity, then, that when a movie about racism does get made, it's as shallow as 'Crash.' Although individual scenes are effective, individual lines are witty, and some of the questions raised are provocative, the overall effect is unsatisfying.",4,12,18,14 March 2006
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Hilarious and horrifying
","'Dr. Strangelove' is a comedy of errors with tragic consequences. It's both a freewheeling satire and a suspenseful story about what happens after the paranoid General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) oversteps his authority and orders a nuclear attack on Soviet Russia. Little does he know that this will bring the world to the brink of annihilation because the Soviets have created a 'Doomsday Machine.' Disaster is narrowly averted, only to return againAnd yet this is also one of the most uproarious, biting, ironic comedies ever made, a parody of apocalyptic scenarios. The fate of humanity depends on a group of oddball diplomats and soldiers who are obsessed with destroying the 'Russkies,' mainly, it seems, as a way of compensating for their sexual frustrations. Gen. Ripper is fixated on his 'precious bodily fluids,' a Texan pilot (Slim Pickens) reads 'Playboy' in the cockpit, General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) gets dirty phone calls in the War Room. The humorthose character names!is gleefully juvenile, but nothing better illustrates the absurdity of war. Hayden, Pickens, and Scott are all very funny, often playing their roles with straight-faced commitment.Peter Sellers excels in his three roles as a common-sensical British officer, the well- intentioned but ineffective American President, and the ex-Nazi mad scientist Dr. Strangelove. The former two characters have some very funny moments, such as Sellers' parody of the British 'jolly good' stereotype, and the phone conversation where the President treats the Soviet Premier as if he were an obstinate child. However, they are basically 'straight men,' meant to be more sane and sympathetic than the crazy figures around them. But Sellers pulls out all the stops in creating Strangelove, what with his weird smile, his mangled accent, his misbehaving hand, and the maniacal glint in his eye.Strangelove is actually a pretty minor characterhis first appearance must come about halfway through the movie. His arrival lifts the movie into new heights of absurdity, but it is always lively, sharp, and funny even when Strangelove is not on screen. And although he's not the central character, it's easy to see why the movie is named after him: he's the figure who most completely unites the hilarious with the horrifying.",10,2,3,30 September 2006
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Excellent stage-to-screen transfer
","I'm a longtime Sondheim and 'Sweeney Todd' fan, so it's hard for me to briefly sum up my thoughts about this movie version--but, if I had to, I'd just say, it's a success and I truly enjoyed it. Yes, I have some quibbles--but I'd probably have similar quibbles with any stage production; I nitpick because I like this show so much and know it so well.The musical is based on the nineteenth-century urban legend of vengeful barber Sweeney Todd (Johnny Depp) who slits his customers' throats, and his accomplice Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) who bakes the corpses into meat pies. Tim Burton was obviously attracted to the terrifying Gothic elements of this story (he favors the bloodletting over the cannibalism) but the characters have true passion behind them; they are not just Gothic cartoons.Depp acts the role of Sweeney Todd very well, getting more intense, more aloof, more inhuman as the movie proceeds. But he sometimes sings in a crooning pop style that proves distracting--too modern. I prefer Mrs. Lovett portrayed as jollier, less haunted than Bonham Carter plays her, but she eventually eases into the role and finds the humor in it. The two have good duets in 'My Friends' and 'A Little Priest.'The distinctive supporting roles are all well cast and add texture to the movie. For a sadistic, villainous judge and his unctuous assistant, what current British actors are better than Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall? For the young lovers, I enjoyed seeing a Johanna (Jayne Wisener) who really looked just 16 years old and a teenage Anthony (Jamie Campbell Bower) to pair with her. It was also great to finally see Toby played by a young boy, the talented Ed Sanders. Usually onstage this role is filled by a grown man who has to act mentally retarded; a real child engages your sympathy more, like something out of a Dickens novel. And Sacha Baron Cohen provides a hilarious cameo as a vainglorious barber who employs Toby.Tim Burton exercises his usual meticulous control over the look of the film, bleaching out almost all color from the production design so that the gushing red blood shows up better. His Victorian London is its own sooty, industrial, sordid world (though I think he borrows his initial winding-through-the-streets shot from Baz Luhrmann's 'Moulin Rouge'). The few brightly colored flashback and fantasy sequences, especially Mrs. Lovett's song 'By the Sea,' are a nice contrast.People like me may regret the loss of some clever Sondheim songs, but the cuts in the movie version make sense: when you're watching it, it feels like a complete work of art. More importantly, the stage show 'Sweeney Todd' already had some cinematic aspects to it, and the movie allows them to be realized more fully. In a song like 'Johanna,' Sweeney sings tenderly of his lost daughter while slitting throats, Anthony wanders the streets searching for his lost love, Mrs. Lovett bakes pies, and a crazed Beggar Woman prophesies doom. The use of intercutting and montage, along with the beautiful and complex song, is the best that movies and musical theater can provide.",8,3,5,30 December 2007
The Devil Wears Prada," The Devil is in the details
","With 'The Devil Wears Prada,' there's finally a comedy geared toward women that is about career and workplace problems, not just romantic complications. Granted, most of us aren't personal assistants to universally renowned, universally feared fashion magazine editors, but the movie works well as a wish-fulfillment fantasy mixed with a 'be careful what you wish for' message. The movie's central questionwhether naïve Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) will give in to the ruthless, manipulative ways of her boss Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep)certainly doesn't apply only to the fashion industry.Unfortunately, 'The Devil Wears Prada' does slip into romantic-comedy cliché too often for it to live up to its potential. It makes it seem like there are only two available, straight men in the world for Andy to choose from: her scruffy chef boyfriend and a famous, smarmy writer, neither of whom are very interesting or likable. In fact, the movie suffers whenever it shows Andy's old friends: these characters are just as judgmental as the denizens of the fashion world, but much more boring.The workplace scenes are fresher and more lighthearted, full of eye-popping fashion, scheming competition, and Miranda's outrageous demands. There are good performances from Emily Blunt, as a snooty but neurotic fashionista, and Stanley Tucci, as the sympathetic art director who gives Andy her obligatory makeover. (At heart, this is a movie about temptation, and the loads of free designer clothes that Andy gets would be enough to tempt anyone.) Hathaway has trouble making Andy's extreme naiveté at the beginning of the movie seem believable, but once the character comes into her own, the actress does too.But Streep, as Miranda, steals the show. Though her delicate features and soft voice might seem innocuous, Miranda is ultra- perfectionistic and cunning, with a sense of world-weary entitlement. Yet we're allowed to see more than her devilish exterior: the movie wants us to realize the sacrifices that Miranda has made to get where she is. It is a testament to Streep's performance that at the end of the movie, you feel not elation that Andy has escaped the Devil's traps, but a kind of pity that Miranda is caught in a trap of her own making: doing her job well requires her to be heartless. Her trademark designer sunglasses and chauffeured car may shield her from the ugliness of the outside worldbut they also imprison her.",7,0,0,20 December 2006
The Passion of Joan of Arc," Simply devastating
","In 'The Passion of Joan of Arc,' Carl Theodor Dreyer elects to tell the story of Joan's trial not through action or dialogue (or title cards, as this a silent film), but through faces. His simple but mesmerizing technique is to place the actors in rooms with stark white walls, film them in extreme close-up, and assemble the film by alternating images of Joan with those of her interrogators. The bare white set contrasts with the actors' faces, which are filmed in such detail that their flesh almost becomes tangible, and reveals everything you need to know. The craggy, warty faces of Joan's interrogators suggest human menace and evil, without the actors ever assuming an overtly menacing expression.Renee Maria Falconetti, playing Joan, is required to go through the entire film with the camera focused tightly on her bare face as it registers all the infinite nuances of anguished but steadfast faith. Tears often roll down her cheeks, yet she never forces them out of her by sobbing, or tries to hold them back by closing her eyes. The openness of her face, the involuntary flow of her tears, help establish Joan's saintliness: it feels as though she suffers and weeps not for herself, but for the whole world. The moment when Joan, alone in her cell, realizes that she must become a martyr, is an extraordinary piece of acting.Famous theater director and theorist Antonin Artaud appears here as a young, compassionate monk. At first I thought it ironic that the founder of the 'Theater of Cruelty' should play one of the least cruel characters in the movie; however, after doing a little research on Artaud, I noticed similarities between his theories and this film. Artaud wanted theater to be an intense, cathartic, spiritual experience, relying on emotion and gesture rather than text, using physical means to achieve a metaphysical purpose. I can think of no better summation of 'The Passion of Joan of Arc,' than to say that it is the cinematic equivalent of this. Its almost ritualistic evocation of pure suffering produces an emotional effect that few other films achieve.",10,6,11,7 February 2006
North by Northwest," Across America and into Movieland
","'North by Northwest' is surely one of the most purely entertaining, gripping, and flat-out fun movies of all time. From the moment some nefarious men mistake Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) for a CIA agent named George Kaplan, the movie is a chain of dangerous situations each more suspenseful than the lastwhich keep you wondering 'How in the world is he going to get out of THIS one?'But at the same time, despite the fact that the movie is about a man running from people who want to kill him (the French title translates to 'Death At His Heels') it's all done with a light touch. After all, there's a strong escapist element to Thornhill's story: visiting the UN, Chicago and Mount Rushmore under bright sunny skies, running from an office job to help protect valuable government secrets, getting propositioned by a seductive blonde (Eva Marie Saint), and always wearing a spotless gray suit. (OK, it does get mussed-up in the justly famous crop-duster sequence.)The little details of 'North by Northwest' are, for the most part, spot-on. Casting James Mason as the main villain is extremely cleverhe's one of the only actors who can match Grant for smooth elegance and charisma, and it's fun to see them go head-to-head. And even though Grant's role mainly consists of narrowly escaping from danger during a cross-country journey, the film also gives him a little emotional journey too. In the beginning, you like Roger Thornhill because he makes wisecracks and looks like Cary Grant. In the end, you like him because he's discovered that he is actually a good, honorable man.Eva Marie Saint is not quite a natural for her role as a mysterious, glamorous woman (she'll always be the shy girl from 'On the Waterfront' to me)she seems to imitate the character rather than embody her. But this doesn't ruin the movie; indeed, 'North by Northwest' is all about artifice and imitation. It acknowledges that it exists in Movieland, not real life, then devotes itself to providing more than two hours of pure cinematic delight.",10,2,4,8 March 2007
Dreamgirls," Effie: a dissenting view
","The movie adaptation of 'Dreamgirls' looks great and moves at a quick, montage-filled pace, enough to provide two hours of entertainment. But when it tries to be more than a collection of glossy production numbers, it often falters. Sometimes it's a showbiz melodrama about singers Effie (Jennifer Hudson), whose voice, body, and personality may just be too big for commercial success, and Deena (Beyonce Knowles), her pretty, pliable opposite. At other times it aims at being a semi-serious exploration of the history of African-American pop music, exemplified by the changing sounds of Rainbow Records, headed by the ambitious Curtis (Jamie Foxx). These two aspects of the film are less successful, for a variety of reasons.For instance, the songs of 'Dreamgirls' move the story along and have some fun double meanings (e.g. when Curtis gets involved in payola, he's promoting the song 'Steppin' to the Bad Side'). But they lack the extra kick that would make them equal to the best of Motown. And scenes featuring historical events like the Detroit race riots are extremely clunky.More importantly, Effie is a difficult character to accept. Yes, one theme of 'Dreamgirls' is that our culture has trouble accepting big, assertive African-American women. But it's hard to identify with a character who is the best, knows she's the best, and won't settle for anything less; and at the beginning of the movie, Effie comes off as disagreeable. When the Dreamettes get their big breakan offer to sing backup for a famous soul musicianEffie initially refuses, saying she was made to sing lead. But this makes her look like she is selfishly thwarting her friends' dreams. Later, a destitute and unemployed Effie says she's not looking for a job because the only thing she can do is sing. She has a child at this point, and her stubborn refusal to find work makes her seem like a bad mother. The movie, though, is always on her side.And yet, this immensely proud, self-confident woman becomes a wailing bundle of desperation for the movie's centerpiece song, 'And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going.' It's shocking to see her abase herself like that, seemingly willing to do anything to keep her man, Curtis. But, strangely, even in her desperation, she still has enough pride not to tell Curtis that she is pregnant with his childsurely that might make him stay? A similar contradiction occurs when Effie makes unreasonable demands on her accompanist at an audition, then immediately sings 'I Am Changing,' about how she's given up her stubborn pride.In short, the character of Effie is confusingly written, and Jennifer Hudson is not experienced enough to conceal these problems. On an individual basis, her songs work like gangbusters, and she nails Effie's sass. But her scenes seem disconnected from one another, and she lacks chemistry with Jamie Foxx. (In fact, Foxx doesn't do enough with his role, which would be much better with more villainous flair.)Beyonce shows how Deena quickly learns to create a superficially gentle, warm, and 'appealing' persona that contrasts with Effie's self-contained attitude, as well as with Deena's inner misgivings. Eddie Murphy, playing soul singer Jimmy Thunder Early, does a fantastic job as someone who could be 'the hardest-working man in show business'; and Anika Noni Rose makes a sweet and funny Lorrell, Jimmy's love interest and the third member of the Dreams. The movie also has the best end credits I've seen in a long time.I realize that in not finding Effie sympathetic enough, I open myself up to charges of 'not having soul' or 'preferring a stick figure like Deena to a 'real woman' like Effie' or 'liking black singers only when they sing like whites.' But I don't think any of these things are the case. Instead, my problem with 'Dreamgirls' is that the movie wants us to applaud everything Effie does, rather than taking the risk of viewing her as the complicated, prickly, and interesting woman she is.",6,0,2,16 January 2007
Ratatouille," Boiling over with humor, visual beauty and food for thought
","Those wildly creative folks at Pixar have done it again with 'Ratatouille,' a funny and sophisticated movie about Remy, a rat with an unusually well-developed palate. After getting separated from his provincial (or should that be Provençal?) colony, Remy ends up in Paris, where he takes it upon himself to save the renowned Gusteau's Restaurant from a villainous owner, a fearsome food critic, and an inept busboy named Linguini, who mistakenly believes that he can cook. Remy and Linguini enter into a 'Cyrano'-type partnership, Remy providing the recipes and Linguini the human face, while dodging all those people who don't think a rat in the kitchen is so appetizing.Remy is cute and appealing, but also has a fully developed, human-like personality. You are never in doubt that Linguini is Remy's sidekick, and not the other way around. Also, thank goodness, the movie doesn't make Remy able to talk to humans, which would be far too twee. Remy can communicate only with his fellow ratsunfortunately, none of them understand his ambitions.Still, the story of 'Ratatouille' doesn't seem quite as tight as in other Pixar movies like 'Finding Nemo' or 'Toy Story.' Those movies had one central objective (get Nemo back home/get the toys back home) and culminated in a thrilling action sequence. 'Ratatouille' has more, smaller conflicts, and plenty of action throughout, but it doesn't build in the same way. Also, 'Nemo' and 'Toy Story' are told entirely from the perspective of the toys or fish; 'Ratatouille' switches between the rats' perspective and the humans', and the seams show a little.All of the action sequences look fantastic, though: my favorite is a chase scene alongside the Seine, which captures Paris in amazing detail. Indeed, the movie's backgrounds are jaw- droppingly photorealistic. Pixar is also getting better and better at animating humansthere is great physical comedy when Linguini gets drunk and when he has Remy running around inside his shirt. 'Ratatouille' has a consistently great sense of humor, with puns, amusing character interactions, vocal performances, physical action, and throwaway visual gags all contributing. My favorite character voice comes from Peter O'Toole as food critic Anton Ego. Monsieur Ego also provides one of the best visual jokes, with his skull-shaped typewriter.What really distinguishes 'Ratatouille,' though, is its larger theme. Remy is kind of a loner, and that's rare for the hero of a kids' movie. Usually, a loner exists in these types of movies only so he can learn the lesson 'You can't succeed without friends.' Though this applies to Remy as well (actually, he knows from the start that as a rat, he'll need special help to realize his dreams), the real message of 'Ratatouille' is about uncompromisingly pursuing excellence and teaching others to appreciate itabout leading a community rather than simply belonging to it. Let's hope that Pixar, too, can continue to take the lead in upping the standards of computer animation.",9,2,3,9 July 2007
The Lives of Others," Good German(s)
","Since the early days of film-making--actually, since the first plays were written--the gold standard for a good dramatic work is one that combines an intriguing plot with complex characters, to illuminate something about human behavior. It's surprising, then, that so many movies still fall short of the mark. At the risk of oversimplifying things, plot-heavy movies tend to ignore character development, and character-study movies ignore a streamlined plot for the sake of a series of episodes. It takes something like 'The Lives of Others,' an excellent and moving drama, to remind you of how great a movie can be when it combines these elements.Not only does this movie have a suspenseful plot that follows the logic of cause-and-effect until everything ties together beautifully, but the workings of the plot are unpredictable, and intimately linked to the characters' psychology. For drama does not result merely from watching external events happen to characters, but from seeing them actively make choices that affect their own lives and (forgive the pun) the lives of others. The set-up is simple but highly resonant: in 1984 East Berlin, by-the-book Stasi agent Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe) is assigned to wiretap and listen in on playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his actress girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). But because Dreyman has always presented himself as a loyal citizen, Wiesler dimly begins to realize just how paranoid and corrupt his government is. Also, he becomes fascinated with the couple's warm, semi-bohemian lifestyle, which contrasts with his own solitary existence. Wiesler thus finds himself reconsidering his values, while at the same time Georg and Christa-Maria reconsider theirs. Should Georg use his writing talent to reveal the horrible conditions in East Germany? Should Christa-Maria submit to a lustful government minister, who could ruin her career if he doesn't get his way? These choices are hard, and only lead to more hard choices.This plot allows for scenes loaded with the great dramatic irony and subtext that results from one character knowing something that another does not. The movie's complex and intelligent themes include theatre/fakery/acting versus real life, and the voyeurism of a spy versus the voyeurism of a cinema-goer. And above all, 'The Lives of Others' is a moving exploration of ethics and humanity. Not many recent movies ask the question 'What does it really mean to be a good person?' and even fewer answer it with the honesty and depth that this film does.'The Lives of Others' does not over-explain itself--none of the characters can confide in anyone, so they make their difficult choices without talking about why they've acted that way. Yet everything that happens in the movie has the ring of emotional truth. Thanks to the beautifully realized performances, you never doubt that the characters would behave in exactly that way, nor that they feel deep anguish in coming to their decisions.I haven't seen all the acclaimed movies from the past year yet, but as it stands now, 'The Lives of Others' is my choice for the best movie of 2006.",10,8,13,31 March 2007
Moulin Rouge!," Aesthetics and emotion fused into one
","I'll admit, it's hard for me to be objective about 'Moulin Rouge.' I've loved it since I saw it in the cinema, it was the first DVD I owned, and I still return to it. Every time, Baz Luhrmann's colorful, heartfelt, and sometimes overpowering film-making draws me into the movie's world of beautiful design and high emotion.Yes, the plot is a total cliché--a love triangle between penniless poet Christian, doomed courtesan Satine, and a sneeringly villainous Duke. 'Moulin Rouge' is intelligent enough to winkingly acknowledge the melodrama at times (it also winks at some iconic bits of pop culture), but irony is not the film's prevailing mood. The actors play many scenes completely straight, speaking the sometimes-trite dialogue so earnestly that you come to believe it after all.And what marvelous performances! It's rare to find a male actor giving a performance as open and pure and vulnerable (and handsomely sung) as Ewan MacGregor's. Nicole Kidman gamely, and skillfully, does everything from low comedy to high tragedy to old-fashioned movie-star glamour. Jim Broadbent, playing the Moulin Rouge's owner Harold Zidler, finds unexpected depth and tenderness in his vulgar and blustering character.In many musicals, the songs are moments of heightened emotion, but are also designed to show off the actors' singing and dancing talent. 'Moulin Rouge,' on the other hand, emphasizes emotion above all else. Yes, the corps of can-can dancers is excellent, and McGregor and Kidman sing very nicely, but the film-making, and the mood it evokes, is the true star. My favorite sequence, the 'Roxanne' tango, encapsulates Luhrmann's technique. It's a wickedly clever use of a familiar song, turning it from a catchy, groovy little tune into something boiling over with tension and danger. The film rapidly cuts between the passionate tango dancers, Christian's heartfelt counter-melody, and a fight between Satine and the Duke in the tower, building to a climax where image, sound, and emotion fuse into one.The credo of the Bohemian characters, and of 'Moulin Rouge''s creators, is 'Truth, beauty, freedom, and love.' I would argue that a fifth item should be added to that list: Art. The whole movie is about how life imitates art and art imitates life; how art can redeem and resurrect us; and most importantly, how art is central to the Bohemian credo. Art is 'fake,' but it conveys a higher truth; art highlights life's beauty; artistic expression is a kind of freedom; art inspires love.'Moulin Rouge,' a piece of film-as-art, does all those things.",10,2,4,20 January 2006
Mulholland Drive," A puzzle well worth exploring
","'Mulholland Drive' is one of the most critically acclaimed movies of this decade, as well as one of the most talked-about. Its dreamlike ambiguity and refusal to explain itself (director David Lynch will only discuss the movie in the most cryptic terms) guarantees that viewers will always debate it. Not bad for something that started out as a failed TV pilot.At first, 'Mulholland Drive' has standard mystery elements to it, such as the gorgeous amnesiac brunette (Laura Elena Harring) who calls herself 'Rita' after Rita Hayworth, and the sparkly blonde aspiring actress, Betty (Naomi Watts) who thinks it would be fun to make like Nancy Drew and help Rita discover her true identity. You can easily see how this set-up could have become a TV show, which only makes the movie's twists more astonishing. But even in the earlier, sunnier parts of the movie, things lurk in the shadowsbehind dumpsters, in corporate offices or cheap apartmentsand eventually these physical and psychological demons take control. Characters switch identities, people and objects return in surprising ways, and the already complicated puzzle becomes about ten times stranger. I won't say too much more about 'Mulholland Drive''s mysteries, because you can easily find theories, explanations, and debates online. (What did people ever do when they watched these kinds of ambiguous movies before the Internet?) Perhaps the biggest clue is one of the movie's themes: this is Los Angeles, a city where fantasy seems more real than reality does.Watts made her name with her accomplished performance here. She goes from over-the-top wholesomeness to romantic passion to self-loathing despair, and succeeds at the tricky task of being an actress playing an actress in Betty's stunning audition scene. But I'm surprised that Harring hasn't found comparable success: not only is she beautiful, she makes for a touchingly vulnerable Rita. The baffling nature of 'Mulholland Drive' is not alone what makes it a great movie. Rather, the best part of the movie is that it is captivating and entertaining enough to make you want to decipher it. Sequences such as the 'Club Silencio' centerpiece are so vivid and haunting that it's a pleasure to try to figure out how they fit into the overall scheme.",9,2,4,5 July 2006
The Graduate," Still hilarious, still affecting
","'The Graduate' has been part of American pop culture since long before I was born. The story of uncertain college graduate Benjamin Braddock, his affair with older family friend Mrs. Robinson, and his eventual pursuit of her daughter Elaine is now common knowledge, and the many upheavals of the '60s have come and gone. Despite all this, 'The Graduate' is still emotionally involving, rather than dated. The acting, screenplay, and direction are all skillfully done, and overall the film truthfully conveys how it feels to be 'adrift,' like Benjamin.'The Graduate' is hilarious and painful, often at the same time. Some great humor comes from the satirical skewering of American culture ('Plastics'), but most is character-based, arising from Ben's awkwardness and knack for saying exactly the wrong thing.Technically, Dustin Hoffman was too old for his role and Anne Bancroft was too young for hers (they were just 6 years apart in age!). And sometimes it's hard to believe that Hoffman is supposed to be 21, but his performance captures so much of Ben's post-college angst, insecurity, and confusion, it's easy to forgive him for looking a little old. Bancroft is able to play older than her actual age, and more importantly, she makes Mrs. Robinson into a complex and human character. Mrs. Robinson could easily be a cartoon of a sex-hungry woman, but in Bancroft's portrayal, she is rueful, bitter, wry, and determined. 'The Graduate' has inspired many other films focusing on youthful alienation and anomie. But, in my opinion, a lot of those movies fail by trying to be 'hip' or 'ironic' or 'quirky' to such a degree that it's impossible to empathize with the characters. 'The Graduate' avoids most of this. Sure, the Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack was very hip at the time, but the music always serves the mood of the film, rather than just proving that Mike Nichols listened to cool bands. The film's montages, underscored by this sweet, melancholy folk-rock music, have a surprising emotional power.The famously ambiguous final shot practically begs you to speculate on what will happen to Ben and Elaine in the future. In other words, the characters are interesting and relatable enough to keep thinking about long after the movie has ended. That should be proof enough that 'The Graduate' is still an excellent, relevant, involving film. Go check it out.",10,6,9,31 December 2005
Pride & Prejudice," Exuberant, emotionally resonant version of a classic story
","Joe Wright's film of 'Pride and Prejudice' has tough standards to live up to: it's based on one of the most beloved novels of all time, and comes just 10 years after an acclaimed miniseries version of the same story. I'll leave it to other reviewers to give this new movie low marks for its supposed historical inaccuracy or betrayal of Jane Austen's intentions. As someone who admires Austen's novels, but admires good film-making even more, I found this 'Pride and Prejudice' highly successful.At 2 hours, the movie obviously can't flesh out its supporting characters or provide quite as much social commentary as the novel and miniseries do. But because of its need to tightly focus on the main plot line, it conveys the emotional life of its heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, better than the other versions of this story. The intelligent, opinionated Elizabeth has so much to deal with over the course of six months or a year: her family includes a silly mother, sarcastic father, and flirtatious younger sisters; her beautiful older sister Jane gets her heart broken; and she must contend with characters like the sycophantic Mr. Collins, the judgmental Lady Catherine, and, of course, the haughty Mr. Darcy. Watching this movie, you relate to Elizabeth's problems on a more personal level.Furthermore, the movie (more than the miniseries) is very cinematic, smartly using visuals to tell the story. The dance sequences are some of the best I've ever seen in a period film--the dancers don't merely go through the motions to add background detail, but look like they're truly having a fun time. The camera effortlessly moves through the crowds, following first one character and then another, but always showing exactly what we need to see. Darcy and Elizabeth's first dance together is filmed in an almost haunting way that makes the tension and attraction between them clear.Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen both find fresh approaches to their iconic characters. Knightley's Elizabeth is dreamier and less vivacious than usual. She delivers many of her witty comments with a serious undertone, and there are plenty of shots of Elizabeth alone, lost in thought, trying to find solace in the beautiful landscapes that surround her. MacFadyen plays Darcy not as a fully-formed romantic hero, but as a young and imperfect man who has just as much to learn about life as Elizabeth does.Brenda Blethyn and Jena Malone have great fun with two of the showiest roles, Mrs. Bennet and Lydia Bennet, respectively. I'm not sure what to think of the casting of Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet. He gives a fine performance, but at 70 years old, he looks more like the Bennet girls' grandfather than their father. However, his white-haired cragginess underscores the poignancy of the fact that when Mr. Bennet dies, his family will lose their home.Maybe Sutherland stands out so much because otherwise, this is truly a young person's 'Pride and Prejudice.' Knightley and MacFadyen are younger than the typical Elizabeth and Darcy, and their performances make clear that a major theme of the story is how both characters mature by coming into contact with one another. And the film-making has the youthful energy and boldness that is necessary in order to tackle filming such a famous novel--and to come out a winner.",9,0,3,12 March 2006
Some Like It Hot," Cross-dressing and so much more: one of the funniest comedies ever
","Its reputation holds true: 'Some Like It Hot' is an inimitable classic of Hollywood comedy. Though men dressing up as women (and vice versa) is one of the oldest gags in the book, Billy Wilder brings this plot device to its culmination.It probably begins with the fact that in 'Some Like It Hot,' there are two men in disguise out-of-work musicians Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon)instead of just one. Sometimes, in comedy, nothing succeeds like excess, and with two cross-dressers, the movie can spin out twice as many funny situations. Also, the two men act as one another's foils and confidants, in a kind of friendly rivalry.In all comedies of this type, the disguised hero inevitably falls in love with a beautiful girl (here, Sugar Kane, played by Marilyn Monroe) and has an old man fall in love with him (Osgood Fielding, played by Joe E. Brown). 'Some Like it Hot' splits this plot between its two heroesJoe gets the girl, Jerry gets the guyand then takes things in unexpected directions. Joe creates another persona for himself as the millionaire 'Junior' in order to woo Sugar, which allows Curtis to do a hilarious (and anachronistic) impression of Cary Grant. Meanwhile, Jerry gets struck by a sort of gender confusion, which allows Lemmon to give the movie's standout performance. Jerry is always more comfortable as a girl than Joe iswatch the gleam in his eye when he announces that his name is 'Daphne'and when Osgood proposes to him, he goes over the moon. He says it's because he figures that he can get a quick divorce and lifetime alimony, but really, it's obvious that his girlish pride has been flattered.Sugar Kane is the quintessential Marilyn Monroe rolethe ditzy, vulnerable sex symbol from the wrong side of the tracks. I don't care how much trouble she caused on the set; her performance is completely adorable. Interestingly, Osgood is just as sweet and trusting as Sugarperhaps even more, since he is asexual to the point of naïveté. There's so much great stuff in 'Some Like It Hot' that some of it even goes overlooked. I tend to forget that there are funny Mafia-movie parodies at the beginning and end (Joe and Jerry are forced to don their disguises to hide after witnessing a Mob murder). The movie really presents a wide variety of humor, not just two hours of pointing out how silly it is for a man to act like a woman. Anyone who loves good-natured, slightly subversive, impeccably crafted, high-energy comedies will certainly like it hot.",10,0,0,29 March 2007
Psycho," A horror film that I actually admire
","More so than with most films, it's impossible to watch 'Psycho' these days in the same way that its original audience saw it, unaware of the shocks that lay in store. We all know what happens to poor Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) when she makes the fateful decision to stay at the deserted Bates Motel; maybe also the psychotic pathology of the motel's young proprietor, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). 'Psycho' is widely regarded as the granddaddy of today's horror films featuring outlandish serial killers, after all. For this reason, though I'm a Hitchcock fan, I avoided 'Psycho,' as straight-out horror is not my favorite genre. It's not that I get nightmares, it's that I dislike cruelty or exploitativeness. Fortunately, when I got around to watching the movie, I found it very impressive, and not at all gleefully bloodthirsty.For 'Psycho,' unlike a cheap blood-and-gore flick, actually has a philosophy of life to go along with all its horror. In the world of the film, sin, such as Marion's stealing her boss's money, will always be punished. And the long conversation between Norman and Marion over dinner (very well acted by Perkins and Leigh) probes some pretty serious psychological depths. 'We're all caught in our private traps,' says Norman, and the movie illustrates how first Marion, then Norman, gets trapped. What's most shocking about Norman is how pitiable he is, especially when compared with the villains/killers of other horror movies.Even though 'Psycho' was made on a relatively low budget, having Hitchcock behind the camera makes for lots of subtly effective shots, images, motifs, etc. He orchestrates two frightening death scenes (I won't spoil it, but there's another, less famous killing that is just as effective as Marion's), a suspenseful beginning that fools you into thinking that Marion is the protagonist, and a quietly chilling conclusion. Bernard Herrmann's score really is as good as everyone says, and not only the shrieking violins during the famous shower scene. In particular I liked the scene where Marion is debating whether to steal the money, and the music mirrors her indecisiveness.I was very impressed by 'Psycho,' but I'm not sure if it'll ever be one of my favorite Hitchcocks. There's at least one serious flaw: the lengthy scene where a psychiatrist over- explains Norman's psychoses, which is much too prosaic. Also, this is mainly a personal preference, but I tend to like Hitchcock better when he's indulging his love for working with iconic movie stars in glamorous scenarios. Still, I now have a new favorite horror film whereas before, I didn't have a favorite horror film at all.",9,2,3,18 February 2007
Sherlock Holmes," Detective-story / action-movie hybrid doesn't always work
","This new 'Sherlock Holmes' is an attempt to make the iconic Victorian sleuth cool for the blockbuster generation by punching up the story with fights, explosions, and steampunk style. And, while I'm not morally opposed to the idea of an action-hero Holmes, it makes the movie kind of a strange hybrid. Action movies work best when they are 'dumb' (that is, when they have a relatively simple story), but Sherlock Holmes movies work best when they are 'smart,' with a twisty mystery that requires Holmes' intelligence to solve. Therefore, the plot of 'Sherlock Holmes' is way too convoluted and contrived for what should be a simple action movie. But it's not really satisfying as a mystery story, either, because the constant onslaught of action scenes means that the audience never has time to stop and think about the clues.Additionally, the story, about an evil lord and his secret mystical society plotting to take over the world, seems like the Victorian equivalent of a Dan Brown novel. It's a lot of hokum, in short, and I couldn't get myself to really care about it.So this movie would really be terrible if it didn't star Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law as Holmes and Watson. Their presence proves that even in a silly blockbuster, it's worthwhile to cast people who know how to act and entertain an audience. Because Downey always comes across as the smartest guy in the room, as well as a total eccentric, he was an inspired choice for the role of Holmes. The best scenes in the movie are the ones where he and Jude Law's Watson bicker like an old married couple; they make a great buddy-movie pairing.Rachel McAdams doesn't have much to do in the role of Irene Adler, the designated love-interest, but she still seems miscast. Irene is supposed to be an international woman of mystery, but McAdams comes off as too young and too contemporary.So the intelligence in this movie comes from Downey's performance as Holmes, which I guess is as it should be; I had just hoped for more intelligence in the writing and direction as well.",5,3,7,1 January 2010
Iron Man," A comic book movie that's more than a cartoon
","The character of Tony Stark/Iron Man is like wish-fulfillment for comic-book nerds: an engineering genius, a mighty superhero, and a debonair ladies' man all at once. That combination might sound improbable on paper, but Robert Downey Jr. makes it believable, and very entertaining. He credibly shows Tony's transition from amoral opportunist to responsible hero, but fortunately never loses his sense of humor. His quick-witted, sarcastic line readings keep you aware at all times that there's a human being underneath that shiny metal suit.Indeed, it sounds weird to say this about a superhero movie, but the best thing about 'Iron Man' is that it's somehow realistic. For instance, Iron Man's nemesis isn't just some random guy who dresses up in a supervillain costume and plots to rule the world. Instead, he's Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), Tony's business partner, who doesn't like the way Tony is running the company and crafts his own metal suit in retaliation. Also, it makes sense that if a superhero suddenly emerged on the scene, the U.S. military would want to monitor what was going on--which leads to the movie's best action sequence, as Iron Man is attacked by two American fighter planes. Tony Stark's Los Angeles feels like our world with somewhat cooler technology--not enhanced with extra bright colors as in the 'Spider-Man' movies or extra gloom as in 'Batman.' The movie even has some contemporary relevance, questioning how to behave responsibly in a world threatened by terrorism.The storytelling of 'Iron Man' is generally solid, though the movie maybe spends a bit too long on sequences of Tony constructing and testing the Iron Man suit, first in Afghanistan then back in America. I mean, Downey does a good job of acting with only robots and gadgets to keep him company, but it's even more fun to watch him interact with his straitlaced pal Rhodey (Terrence Howard) or his concerned and capable assistant, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow).We'll certainly see more from all these performers (except Bridges) in the inevitable sequel, now that this movie has told the hero's origin story in such an enjoyable way. Marvel Studios has definitely grabbed the brass ring with 'Iron Man,' its first-ever release.",8,1,3,7 June 2008
La Vie En Rose," Cotillard's performance is the only thing holding the movie together
","'La Vie en Rose' uses a nonsensically jumbled structure to tell the life story of Edith Piaf, a woman whose life had perhaps enough tragedy for two movies but barely makes sense in this version. This structure certainly sets 'La Vie en Rose' apart from all those other biopics about talented, difficult, drug-addled musicians, but that's not necessarily good. While there's nothing inherently wrong with telling a story out of sequence, there needs to be some logic to the way the scenes fit together. 'La Vie en Rose,' however, has the annoying habit of cutting away from a scene just when it is getting interesting, to show a different time period that bears no obvious connection to the other scene.The movie also assumes previous knowledge of Edith Piaf's life, since it leaves so much unsaid. For instance, on her deathbed, Piaf mentions her husband Theo, but that's the only reference to him in the movie. Worse, the movie skips from 1940 to 1947missing the World War II years when Piaf was in her prime. And considering 'La Vie en Rose' presents Edith as a French folk heroine (she is guided by Saint Therese and discovers her vocal talent singing 'La Marseillaise'), it's strange to omit the heroic work she did for the Resistance during this time. Instead, the movie finds its greatest emotional resonance in a love affair Piaf had with boxer Marcel Cerdan (Jean-Pierre Martins) in the late '40s. You can tell that this relationship is doomed from the startthe tension between Edith's wholehearted faith in love, and the way that destiny seems to be set against her, is quite affecting. In the middle of all this, Marion Cotillard does an amazing job, embodying all the physical and emotional states of a woman who lived a short, hard life. She's great as the scrappy 'Sparrow Kid' with tremulous eyes and smile; the imperious diva made vulnerable by love; and the broken-down, stubborn woman who is 47 years old but looks 77. Truly, she abandons herself in this role.The English subtitles translate the dialogue well, but not always the lyrics to Piaf's songs. This is a problem, because often the song has some thematic relevance to the scene it's accompanying, and non-French-speakers will miss out. Sometimes the song is the only thing that connects two seemingly disparate scenes in this very disjointed, whiplash- inducing movie.",6,14,23,6 July 2007
Rear Window," A tight, suspenseful movie with universal implications
","Due to its tightly defined setting and the short time frame that it covers, 'Rear Window' at first seems like a film that will dazzle you with its economical construction, but run the risk of feeling limited or claustrophobic. The story takes place over 4 or 5 days, entirely within a Greenwich Village courtyard and the surrounding apartments. Furthermore, the camera never travels inside any of the apartments except for that of L.B. 'Jeff' Jefferies (James Stewart), a photojournalist recovering from a broken leg. Instead, the inhabitants of the other apartments are filmed as Jeff sees them: from a distance, across the courtyard, through windows. By the end of the film, you are quite familiar with everyone and everything Jeff can see.But the genius of 'Rear Window' is that it rarely feels confining. The plot takes its time getting started, introducing all the characters at a leisurely pace. Even when the machinery of the suspenseful plot starts to click into motion (Jeff suspects his neighbor Thorwald of murdering his invalid wife), the movie continues to follow the interesting lives of the other apartment-dwellers: a seductive dancer whom Jeff nicknames 'Miss Torso,' the depressed 'Miss Lonelyhearts,' a struggling young songwriter, a newlywed couple, a middle-aged couple with a little dog... The voyeuristic Jeff finds these people endlessly fascinating, and so do we; the apartment courtyard is a microcosm containing enough stories to make many more movies. And something magical happens when Jeff looks beyond the courtyard, at the bustling patch of street and sidewalk that he can see down an alley. Suddenly you realize how many other people there are in the world, thickly crowding the New York streets, and how each of them would reveal a different, intriguing story, if you were able to watch him or her from a distance.'Rear Window' might still be a decent thriller if it were pared down to eliminate all the subplots about the neighbors, but Hitchcock does the more difficult, braver thing: he maintains the suspense of the main mystery story while intercutting it with the neighbors' vignettes. Thus, for a movie that was filmed on a sound stage at the height of the studio system, 'Rear Window' feels surprisingly realistic and lifelike. The story might sound confined, even airless, in summary, but Hitchcock reveals its unlimited possibilities.James Stewart plays Jeff as a man who has always relied on his wit, his observational powers, and his analytical skills. In order to take his mind off his broken leg, and stop himself from over-analyzing his relationship with fashion-model girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly), he starts obsessively watching the neighbors, and witnesses Thorwald's strange behavior. Stewart has some great moments when he tells his friends about his suspicions, and they doubt him, and he doesn't know what to do, because his eyes and brain have never failed him before.Kelly is better here than in her other famous Hitchcock film, 'To Catch a Thief'--she's more sympathetic, vulnerable, funny and relaxed. Thelma Ritter is very entertaining as Stella, Jeff's shrewd nurse.Nowadays, the 1950s have a reputation as a time when Americans liked to think that everything was sunny and prosperous, and pretended that the darker side of life didn't exist. Recent films such as 'Far From Heaven' have deconstructed the '50s, revealing the disturbing undercurrents beneath the cheerful faÃ§ade. What amazes me is that Hitchcock explored that exact theme here, in 1954--the despair, the passionate sexuality, the murderous impulses found in a group of seemingly ordinary New Yorkers. 'Rear Window' may be one of the films that best encapsulates its era, in addition to being superbly crafted entertainment.",10,0,1,21 January 2006
Slumdog Millionaire," Works better as an India travelogue than as inspiring drama
","'Slumdog Millionaire' uses a clever narrative strategy to tell the life story of Jamal Malik, an 18-year-old former slum kid, and at first, that was one of the things I liked best about the movie. When Jamal wins ten million rupees on 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?', the police don't believe he could have done it without cheating, so he must explain how he came to know the answers. Cue a series of flashbacks of Jamal's life, each of them incorporating the answer to one of the game show questions. It's an innovative way to tell a story, and the flashbacks are all exciting and dramatic. Jamal has confronted murderous religious mobs, sinister orphanage-keepers, and tough modern gangsters in his young life.But the suspense disappears somewhat when you realize that no matter how much filth and poverty Jamal encounters, no matter how many villains pursue him, he will survive to appear on the game show. Furthermore, it becomes increasingly clear that Jamal's story is a fairy tale, and that destiny is going to work in mysterious but positive ways to make sure that everything turns out all right.Thus 'Slumdog Millionaire' works better as a tour of modern India than as a story about Jamal Malik. There is a terrific montage sequence set on a train, an interlude at the Taj Mahal, and some thought-provoking scenes of the gentrification of Mumbai. Meanwhile, the movie also gives an un-sugarcoated look at some of India's major social ills: religious conflict, extreme poverty, and prostitution/exploitation. Danny Boyle manages to fit this all together by directing everything in an exuberant, colorful, quick-cutting style. Even the subtitles are playful and color-tinted! (Most of the film is in English, except for the scenes where Jamal is a very small child and speaks Hindi.) Dev Patel, who plays Jamal at 18, has an open, innocent face and frequently seems a little out of his depth. This quality is useful during the game-show scenes, when Jamal is in the hot seat and dazed by his own success. But he otherwise seems like a nice suburban kid: someone who witnessed the horrors that the younger Jamal has seen should be both grittier and more soulful. The same goes for Freida Pinto, who plays Jamal's love interest Latika: she is a very pretty young woman but hard to believe as a former street waif. Additionally, Latika is not given much of a personality, which makes the love story hard to really cheer for.Ultimately, 'Slumdog Millionaire' failed to move me, despite how hard it tried to do so. The flashy cinematography and propulsive action made the movie fun to watch, but also made it difficult to connect emotionally with the characters. And although the movie is meant to be the inspiring story of an underdog who triumphs, it makes clear that Jamal succeeds because destiny has chosen to smile upon him. He's a good-hearted and sympathetic boy, but a passive character in his own life. 'Slumdog Millionaire' wants us to think 'It's OK that Jamal suffered all these hardships, because it enabled him to win millions of rupees and the girl of his dreams,' but what about all the other Indian slum kids who suffer with no hope of relief, whom Fate has not chosen to favor?",7,2,4,1 January 2009
Goodfellas," Brash, energetic, and brilliantly directed Mob movie
","'Goodfellas' is a superb movie presenting an amoral and very real-seeming portrait of the Mafia. Where 'The Godfather' limits itself to a sepia palette and a somber tone, 'Goodfellas' is brash, busy, and captures both the humor and the horror of a mobster's life. Nor do the Goodfellas pretend to have noble motivations. Instead, they're a bunch of power-hungry guys who band together for protection but double-cross each other at the first opportunity. Many admit to a compulsive love for crime, including robber Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and, especially, the unhinged, trigger-happy Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci).Tommy and Jimmy are the closest associates of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), the movie's narrator and main character: all are mid-level mob guys who start out around the same time. Henry is half-Irish, so he knows that the Mafia will never fully welcome him. This outsider quality complicates his personality and makes him an ideal narrator.'Goodfellas' runs on style and atmosphere rather than a linear plot. The first hour culminating in the famous long-take at the Copacabana nightclubshows the glamorous appeal of the mob lifestyle for young Henry. It's the Rat Pack early sixties, and America and the mob are still somehow innocent. As we follow Henry into the late sixties and beyond, the mob becomes more insular and a parody of what it once was. The women have tacky outfits and hard-edged faces; the men's crimes get bigger. Henry gets involved in drug dealing, and his wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco) turns from a tough-but-sweet Jewish girl into a full- fledged Mafia wife.The best part of the movie is the virtuoso, suspenseful, darkly funny sequence (it could almost stand on its own as a short film) where Henry's responsibilities as mobster and family man threaten to overwhelm him. In the course of a single day, he must keep his drug smuggling, mafia connections, large extended family, and mistress under control, while trying to evade a helicopter that seems to be following him. The editing and music perfectly recreate Henry's jittery, cocaine-fueled paranoia. Indeed, 'Goodfellas' has probably the best compilation soundtrack that I've ever heard: each song perfectly fits.There is always so much going on at once in 'Goodfellas'music, narration, dialogue, camera movements and imagesthat boredom is not an option and dazzling moments come frequently. And its ambivalent moral perspective (should we love these men and their lifestyle, or hate them?) gives you something to think about after the pop songs and shootings have ended.",10,0,0,23 June 2007
