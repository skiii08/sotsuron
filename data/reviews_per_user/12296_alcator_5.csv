Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," pretty funny
","I'll be very brief on this one: If it wasn't for the unnecessary hotel room gay-like scenes, this would be a 9/10 for me; as it is there (without serving any greater purpose (I expected the manager to enter the room due to the noise or something, at least), it doesn't fit there very well and will probably chase away some viewers.Borat succeeds in revealing the hidden anti-semitism and bigotry in many of the victims; and surprisingly, even though the film begins with jokes about Jews, in the end it's exactly the old Jewish couple in the rent-a-room house that comes out of the movie totally unscathed by Borat's jokes.Since I'm from a country not that far from the supposed Kazachstan, I loved the supposedly Kazach scenes; because it very nicely shows how an average West-country-citizen thinks of Eastern European and post-soviet countries (even though we actually have better cell phones than an average American ;-) ) Thumbs up!",7,0,2,19 March 2008
Resident Evil: Extinction," Surprisingly better than the first two - for an amateur
","First and foremost: I never played any R.E. game. All I know about the franchise is what I got from the three movies.That being said, I really enjoyed this adrenaline zombie-splattering action movie; away goes the annoying Jill Valentine from RE2, away goes anything resembling the 'Nemesis' crap from RE2, while things like the Red Queen, the laser-beam corridor, the blood hounds return, and a greater picture of the world is provided. The characters finally have a little more depth to them, they have their doubts, fears and passions; civilians finally stop being automatically saint and it turns out that some are afraid, some are liars and some are wicked.True, automatic guns still have 100+ rounds per clip and ladies still have perfect makeup and flawless skin even when driving through desert and smoking 30 cigarettes a day; but this is an action zombie movie just like Doom-the-Movie or Land-of-the-Dead, and it works well as such.100 minutes well spent.",8,0,1,19 March 2008
Watchmen," Pixel-perfect adaptation
","For the second time in my life, I've read a comics just mere days before watching a movie version of it. First, it was with '300', now with 'Watchmen'. In the case of '300', what I criticized was adding the secondary storyline. In the case of Watchmen, there's nothing to criticize. The comics has been adapted almost page-to-page (with the exception of the 'Black Freighter' comics-within-comics, and a few cosmetic changes such as the visual appearance of the near-end catastrophes), and those responsible for the visual side of this movie have made a perfect job -- costumes, devices, rooms, prison cells, streets -- it all looks almost exactly as in the comics. In this regard, the movie follows in the footsteps of SinCity with its 'frame-to-frame' conversion, without looking ridiculous.The choice of relatively unknown actors who will not try to steal the show for themselves was also a lucky one: They seemed to me to play as a team, rather than stars.With over 3 hours of screen time, the movie didn't bore me for a single second, and that's quite an achievement, considering I knew the story from the comics.This is a must see for all comics fans.",10,1,5,21 July 2009
300," True to the original, entertaining and visually stunning
","Frank Miller made a comic book. It took an actual event -- a suicidal stand of 300 Spartan warriors under the command of king Leonidas against a vast armies of Persian god-king Xerxes -- and transformed it into exaggerated heroic legend. It added cool remarks, cool view angles, cool action sequences, and readers loved it.This movie is that comic book transformed almost frame-by-frame onto the film; the only change is the addition of a secondary storyline about the king's wife's desperate attempt to get some reinforcements for him.These events are more than 2000 years old; the people portrayed in there have nothing to do with today Arabians (after all, the 'losers' were worshiping their KING as god, not Allah, for god's sake!), nor with 'the West' (those 'winners' were disposing of weaker children without mercy, after all!). So it's not US against THEM, it's not U.S. against Muslims, and anyone trying to see that parallel in the movie is a stupid warmonger.The transformation of the comic onto film was superbly done: Same colors, same visually stunning angles. It's much better than Troy, it's much better than Gladiator (in terms of the visual appeal of the fight scenes); the edit cleverly uses 'temporal jerkiness' (wow, I wanna trademark on this expression! :-) ) , i.e. slowing and speeding one continuous shot so that you see each kill in slow motion and the 'dance' between kills in fast-motion; the CGI of 2006/7 allowed the film makers to create absolutely unbelievable battle sequences that are jaw-dropping.The secondary storyline seemed to me to be heavily cut; I'd say prolonging some of the scenes of that storyline with a bit more solid background for them (i.e., adding more of 'before' and 'after' for the scenes) would be good and I think that the extended version will add formidable amount of time to this storyline, as it seemed too brief. It's similar to Gladiator (the Extended version of which I greatly recommend), where in the original cut, certain acts didn't really seem rational, but the extended cut added plenty of 'evidence' that justified them.To sum it up, if you're looking for a historical action, you won't be disappointed. And if you are paranoid and see anti-Whatever-ism in everything, being it The Passion of the Christ or Black Hawk Down, give this movie a break - it's over 2000 years past the events depicted and we do have a brain.",9,4,8,14 June 2007
The Island," Don't look for 1984 and you won't be disappointed.
","I read a lot of negative criticism on this one and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the movie. True, now that I search intensely for any hidden flaws, I might find some, but they are definitely not visible while watching the movie, and for a summer blockbuster, this movie works well.Scarlet is really sweet and - as we learn later - true to her 'Delta' origins; McGregor is like a teenager who's starting to question authorities but does not always know the right way to do it.Other actors are showing their better skills as well, without over-acting.The highway chase is one of the most spectacular that I've seen without being obviously 'designed' that way - where other movies need way too improbable constellations of cars, trucks, helicopters and other stuff, here, Bay succeeds with one special truck (the rest is just ordinary cars with no special parameters) to create a memorable chase that will surely be quoted many times.The finale is also nice and thrilling, the witty 'shite' dialog is just pure fun and although you do expect the movie to end in this way, the path that leads to that end is quite surprising.",7,1,1,25 June 2007
