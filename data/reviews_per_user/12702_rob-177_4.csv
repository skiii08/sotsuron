The Blair Witch Project," A great film which can scare even the vivid imagination
","The Blair witch project is the most realistic movie you are going to see for a long time. Although it only cost around $22000 it was made so perfectly, so Precisely that no one could find a mistake in this, the years best flick.The movie is based on the 'Blair Witch' (an old cursed witch who lived deep in the woods near Burkittesville. She was said to have lured young children into her house and then to have slaughtered them. Three student filmmakers Heather Donahue, Mike Williams & Josh Leonard decided to make a documentary on the Blair Witch. Before the students went into the woods they interviewed many people asking them about what they know about the Blair witch. After all that they got their 2 8mm film cameras and headed deep in the woods. Along the way they encountered many attacks, especially at night. They are suspicious because after each attack they find rock piles around their tent. This leads up to the biggest movie of the 20th century. If you like a thrill or if you're a horror addict then this is right up your alley. The Blair Witch Project is not physically scary (you don't see anything that is scary) But it is Mentally scary (You see the expression on their faces and hear the sounds that they hear). Overall it's a preety good movie and it gets a solid 8/10 from me.",8,0,1,21 December 1999
Erin Brockovich," A movie that will make you laugh, while bringing a tear to your eye
","Erin Brockovich is a movie that contains the lot. From the acting right through to the plot this movie is a definite must see flick. Julia Roberts is at an all-time best in this a-class movie. All of the co-stars are magnificent. They all put in a top class performance and made the movie worth seeing.Even though this is based on a true story it is really a well-thought out and planned movie. The basic storyline is about Erin Brockovich, a jobless, mother of three who has been divorced twice. She hardly has a hundred dollars in her bank account and the only thing holding her from suicide are her kids.But one day when she is hit be a reckless driver and takes him to court she loses. Annoyed at her lawyer she decides to force him into giving her a minimum wage job. He accepts and whilst she is doing her job she comes across a case which she wants to investigate upon. She is given permission and goes ahead.From there onwards it is Roberts and Finney taking over the show in this heart stopping, laughable and sad tale of family, love, work and sex. Well maybe not sex but I thought it was a nice touch..Overall a 9/10.. definitely worth seeing.",9,1,1,19 April 2000

The family is taken to a concentration camp women on one half men on the other.Whilst all old people and children are being gassed to death Guido Orefice (Roberto Benigni's character) is hiding his son Joshua from the soldiers. He turn this whole experience into a game for Joshua and tries his absolute hardest to keep the truth away from him, in this the years best comical drama.Roberto Benigni was marvelous. He could make you laugh and cry at the same time. He deserves all the credit that he has received over such a magnificent masterpiece. The movie itself can send a tingle up your spine.
