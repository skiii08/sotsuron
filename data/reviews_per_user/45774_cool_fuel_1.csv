Lucky Number Slevin," Immoral?
",I would like to detest the statement made by 'niuqniuq' that the homosexual in the film was made to be gay to make the audience not feel bad over his death. He was killed for the sins of himself and his father had done towards his family and if you would recall he was not innocent in the least. He was 'getting fat' as they put it off the deaths of innocent people. The reason he was homosexual was they needed a way for slevin to get into the building in the first place without having a cheesy endless fight scene put in for the effect of action. They made it hold more intrigue in this way. Although this gives far from a moral picture movies would be like children's books giving the moral of the story in its entirety.,9,0,1,28 December 2006
