Ali," The Greatest.
","Director Michael Mann and star Will Smith don't just show us Ali, they take us along with him. They take us through the most turbulent years of Ali's life. A lot of people will still see the man as a showboating draft dodger. But he was and is more than can be defined in any single sentence. The man is flawed like all human beings are. And agree with him or disagree, love him or hate him, you have to respect the fact that he stood by his principles even when the United States government tried to change him. From the opening sequence Michael Mann proves he is the right director for this movie, and Will Smith proves he is the right man to play the champ. If the Academy doesn't recognize both Jon Voight (playing Ali's friend, yes friend, Howard Cosell) and Jamie Foxx, with Smith and Mann, then there is no justice and Oscars are a fraud. Also Giancarlo Esposito, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Mario Van Peebles are in top form. 10 of 10.",9,0,0,6 January 2002
Independence Day," Horrible
","All the money piled up to make this movie and they couldn't get a screenplay without plot holes the size of Cleveland. The actors are a wide variety of good actors, and yet here, they show no chemistry. For instance Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum are two very fine, capable actors. But they share the screen in what should be the dramatic high point of the movie and it comes off as overacted and cheesy. The whole film is poorly conceived, poorly directed, not thought out at all, and has fine actors giving their worst performances ever. Bill Pullman and Mary McDonnell as the president and first lady make watching grass grow exciting. Skip this film. The sad part is I was excited to see this when it first came out. And I couldn't have been more disappointed by this big budget no brainer. 1 of 10",1,6,10,22 January 2003
The Piano," Great parts to a fair film.
","This film has some great things about it. Holly Hunter, Anna Paquin, Sam Neill, and Harvey Keitel are in top form. Director Jane Campion does a remarkable job. The cinematography catches the beauty of New Zealand perfectly. The problem lies in the script. It is slow moving, plodding, and rather predictable. And within its tight confines, the characters don't get a chance to grow. All in all, this film has some interesting and intriguing parts, but the whole is not as good as the parts. 6 of 10",6,4,8,4 July 2001
Signs," A whole lot of nothing
","This film has some very good things going for it. Mel Gibson gives his best performance to date. Joaquin Phoenix, who played the evil, whiny, wimp in Gladiator convincingly plays the polar opposite in this movie. Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin are very talented young actors. M. Night Shyamalan proves to be a very good director. His camera angles and long shots build suspense very well. With all of that going for it, this is still not a very good movie. As good as Shyamalan is as a director, he is just as bad as a screenwriter. From the get go there is a plothole through the middle of this that makes the whole movie not make any sense. He gives us a priest from a religion that probably doesn't exist that has lost his faith, his ever faithful brother, alien obsessed son, and cute but spooky daughter. We meet the sheriff, the bookstore owner and wife, the man that caused him to lose his faith, and thru flashbacks, his recently deceased wife. There are a few other people in the movie, but not many. Shyamalan gives us an isolated area in Pennsylvania that seems borrowed from an old Twilight Zone episode. The lack of speaking parts makes it seem all the more isolated. And then he blows it by asking us to believe that a global conspiracy may be afoot. He tries to pay homage to so many films from Independence Day and War of the Worlds to E.T. and the famous bigfoot home movie that it comes off as hokey. The final scene just adds to the ever growing list of plotholes. And in the end we find that this far-fetched and plodding film is trying to tell us that life is not an accident and everything happens for a reason. Shyamalan just goes a strange and pointless route to get there. The Sixth Sense this isn't. 5 of 10",5,1,1,27 August 2002
The Godfather," The greatest movie ever made.
","Francis Ford Coppola achieved perfection on film with this great work. He directs so subtly that he makes it seem simple. But watch the subtleness of the scene outside the hospital when Michael (Al Pacino, at his best) lights the cigarette of Enzo the baker. One quick shot of Michael's hands, and they aren't shaking, and we know that he was born for the family business. The great Marlon Brando ad-libbed the films most important scene, that in the garden with his grandson, as the Don dies in peace, ironic for a man that lived such a violent life. The moody cinematography of Gordon Willis is the best ever caught on film. And the score by Nino Rota (I know the Academy didn't believe it belonged entirely to Rota, but who cares what the Academy thinks?) is a classic. The rest of the cast, which includes Robert Duvall, James Caan, John Cazale, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Abe Vigoda, Richard Castellano, Richard Bright, Alex Rocco, Richard Conte, John Marley and Sterling Hayden is in top form. Every film and television show about the mafia since this one has borrowed or outright stolen from this film. It is a story of profound depth, an American tragedy, told in three acts, and this, the first act, is the best. And yet at its root, it is a very simple story, as Don Corleone prepares his children for the lives they will have to live and the world they will have to live in. It can be summed up as family values, mafia style.",10,0,1,3 July 2001
