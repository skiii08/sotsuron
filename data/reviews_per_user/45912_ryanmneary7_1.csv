Iron Man 3," What a joke.
",OK so I was very excited for iron man 3 after iron man 2 I was hopping they could come back with something as good if not better than the first iron man. The first 30 minutes of this movie had me going and look very promising and then it went all down hill from there. This movie had nothing to do with what we saw in trailer and used the mandarin to get people to buy tickets when they never even had plans for him to be a part of the movie. Let me put it this way imagine you went to see the dark knight and 30 minutes into the movie you find out the joker is a cover for some villain that you have never heard of and that's the last of the joker. That's exactly what happened here.,4,6,12,3 May 2013
