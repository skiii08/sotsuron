Black Swan," Stunningly shot, but other than this there's little to keep you interested
","Although this film has followed the Inception route of receiving amazing reviews for the first forty pages on this site, followed by scores of negative reviews which are actually more on track, there are some elements to this production which do make it stand out over others.Lovers of ballet would have been left breathless by the exquisitely shot dance sequences and the development of Portman's character as she attempts to discard her porcelain doll beauty and let her Black Swan truly take over. Add to this a psychological struggle with reality, clearly brought on by the stress of such a hugely emotional production, and you've got the recipe for a critically acclaimed commercial success. To some.To others, we see another example of style over substance as the narrative plods along slowly, intentionally attempting to throw its audience off the scent that the storyline is actually a lot less confusing than the director is trying to make out. Although it provided me with no titillation in the slightest, Nina's exploration of her sexuality could have been utilised as a much more effective tool to keep the audience interested in order to create some empathy with the lead. As it stands however, although beautifully played, for those who are not fans of ballet there was very little connection between Nina and the audience. At times I wanted to shake her and scream 'get over yourself woman and just do the bloody dance.' Target audience for this film? Educated women in their forties and the upper middle classes. A surefire Oscar winner then.",4,3,5,6 February 2011
Ted," Starts off great but then descends in to standard Hollywood rubbish
","The problem with this film is that it sets itself up to be a pastiche on a children's story which is aimed at adults. By the end of the film however, it feels as though the producers are patronising its audience having forced them to sit through 100 minutes of recycled, unoriginal and highly formulaic ideas.Sure, there are a lot of laughs to be had along the way, but its not long before we start to see the characters develop in to their Hollywood stereotype. Kunis starts off funny and cute before quickly descending in to a wining, selfish stereotype who wants Wahlberg all to herself. The latter generally mopes around like a sad looking monkey in the last half of the film whilst also managing to over-egg it in the first.There are lots of Family Guy references throughout which do work well in live action, although they lack the sublime ridiculousness the cartoon format can bring.Overall, the film lost its way half way through which was a shame as the great CGI could have really made this one something to remember for years to come.",6,0,2,27 August 2012
Inception," Same old lame Hollywood tripe
","It beggars belief how both critics and movie-goers have been won over by this pseudo-intellectual piece of garbage. Really world? I thought better of you.There were three key problems for me in this movie. The first was the love story. Blah. I mean really, BLAH. This was an action based thriller, whose ultimate fate was rested on DiCaprio's characters obsession with his dead wife. Ultimately the film could have achieved its original thought provoking intentions had it dumped the obligatory Hollywood love story entirely.My second issue with this movie was the teams motivation for going into the energy tycoons son was weak. If you really want to get your audience thinking, why not try to get a politician to push through a new law, or stop the production of nuclear warheads? Why focus an entire movie, so well shot and expertly produced, in trying to get someone to break down a business? Finally, and maybe this was just me because I was disconnecting with the film at this point, but some of the dialogue was just way too cheesy and over the top. 'A dream within a dream within a dream? It's never been done before!' All in all a big let down, mainly because the concept was great and some of the scenes were incredibly filmed, yet the producers bowed to the same old Hollywood model. Not all of us need to see a love story in order to engage our brains y'know.",3,10,16,3 August 2010
Prometheus," Great entertainment with an interesting premise that doesn't quite fulfill
","I had very little expectations of this film as I kept my head buried in the sand for all the trailers and clips. So when I saw the opening scene of a human-looking alien effectively kick starting the human race I thought to myself that potentially this could blow my mind.Poor scriptwriting however is this films biggest failing. Using a crew that represents a gaggle of Americans from your local diner for instance hurt the 'reality' of the piece, as other reviewers have stated, for a 'trillion dollar' mission one would expect the worlds leading scientists to be present, not extras from Dog the Bounty Hunter. Naturally the acting suffered, Charlize Theron in particular coming across as wooden and only there for her blond hair and figure hugging suits.There were a lot of questions that remained unanswered clearly opening it up for a sequel. However, Scott could have easily covered everything in one full impact mind blowing 2 hour film rather than spreading it over what I presume will be another trilogy.3D was pointless and I thought a lot of it had been done in post production so was very surprised to find it had been filmed in 3D. Still, was pleased that I saw this in the cinema. It did keep me entertained however, which is why I begrudge giving it less than a 7. 6.5 would probably be my overall grade if IMDb offered half stars!",7,0,7,17 June 2012
