The Legend of Bagger Vance," It's 2019 and it's by far Smith's best film.
","DreamWorks and Redford absolutely nailed this one.

Will Smith's performance is truly wonderful.
Great performances by Theron, Damon, McGill, Gretsch and Moncreiff.
Narrated by Jack Lemon who will have you weeping by the end.
