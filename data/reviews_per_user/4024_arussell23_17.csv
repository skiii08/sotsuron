Vertigo," 'Vertigo' is a smart, excellently crafted unconventional mystery with some surprising twists
","In 1954, Alfred Hitchcock gained an interest in a French novel entitled The Living and the Dead (or, in French, D'entre les morts), and gained the rights to it before it had even been translated to English. Originally, Madeline was supposed to be played by Vera Miles, but she had to back out due to her pregnancy, and Hitchcock then went with Kim Novak. It took three months to film, and the music was done once again by Bernard Hermann, composer of a lot of Hitchcock's work (including Psycho). When it was first released, it received mixed reception, with people disappointed that Hitchcock departed from his usual romantic-thriller, and had veered off into mystery. So, with all of this in mind, and this film being a personal favorite of my friend, a Hitchcock aficionado, let's dive right into a film that changed Hitchcock's career forever! Vertigo follows an former detective with a fear of heights who is enlisted by an old college friend to follow his wife, because the man fears his wife may be suicidal. As the detective gets further and further into the dark mystery, he soon finds that he may be in love with the woman.I didn't know what to expect from this movie, honestly. Like I said, my one friend is a very big fan of the movie, and that's what propelled me to watch it as one of the first Hitchcock films as part of my marathon. James Stewart and Kim Novak do stellar jobs as the two leads, bringing themselves as well as the audience into a whirlwind romance that is rather remarkable the more you think about it. Stewart, in particular, really sells the character that I believe Hitchcock was going for. Barbara Bel Geddes does a lovely job as Midge, and really sells the character of a girl just trying to help Scottie through what is happening. Tom Helmore does a great job in his somewhat limited role as Madeleine's husband, really selling the role he's supposed to play.The effects used in the movie, particularly the ones used to convey Scottie's fear of heights are quite remarkable given the time in which they were done. It truly feels like you can feel his fear and what he's going through, The music, done by longtime Hitchcock collabrator Bernard Herrmann, is quite impressive. Especially the music in the opening, it gets you curious and grabs your attention immediately so you begin asking what's going on.The set pieces, making great use of many locations around San Francisco, are fantastic. Special greetings are given to the church used in the middle-end of the film, which had a tower that was digitally superimposed upon the church, harking back to the effects comments I made. Another set I liked are both Midge and Scottie's apartments, the contrasts between Midge's bright colors and Scottie's more subdued ones are quite subtly done.Perhaps my one complaint with the film, and it's probably just trivial, but the scene where Scottie has a nightmare and it's all cartoonish and stuff, it seemed really fake and forced. I mean, it's still a cool sequence, but I feel like it didn't mesh well enough with the rest of the film.Overall, Vertigo is a superb film. It's acting, effects, music, set pieces, and script are all fantastic. While I have some issues with Scottie's nightmare sequence, the rest of the film is a cut above the rest and if you enjoy a good unconventional mystery, then you'll get a kick out of this film.10/10.

Se7en," 'Se7en' is a twisted, thrilling film that managed to give Fincher the start he deserved
","In the mid-90s, director David Fincher read the screenplay for Se7en, a mystery-thriller film and said that he found it to be a fascinating idea. Little did he know, that the script copy he had been sent had the original ending that New Line didn't want, so he had to fight to keep it in the film. Either way, the film was released in September of 1995 and instantly had rave reviews, and managed to make even Roger Ebert proclaim it as dark, twisted and a great movie. So, let's see if all of these critics are whackjobs, or if this film truly is as good as they say.Se7en follows two detectives - one set to retire by the end of the week, and a rookie set to take over his position, as they slowly realize that several seemingly unconnected murders are actually the work of a serial killer basing his murders on the seven deadly sins.This film is one I had been fascinated by for a long time. Many people referred to it as a basis for the dark and twisted films to come, such as the Saw franchise, so I wanted to finally see why people were constantly comparing the two. So, what did I think? Well, let's get into it.The acting was phenomenal. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman both do terrific jobs as the two detectives investigating this twisted case, and both really play off of each other very well. One of the best examples of this comes from the opening scene, where Pitt meets up with Freeman and they have a chat. Quite intriguing. Kevin Spacey... I feel like I shouldn't spoil who he is because of the plot, but believe me when I say, he'll send shivers down your spine. Gwyneth Paltrow does a stellar job as well as Pitt's wife, and manages to emote more than in any other performance. Ha, I'm only joking. And R. Lee Ermey does a good job as the police captain.The music in this film, by Howard Shore, of all people, was stellar. One of the most effective scenes in the film, which is surprisingly the opening credits, had a remixed version of a Nine Inch Nails song paired with Shore's score, and it works very well. Hell, the score works very well throughout the entire film. The lighting and just overall tone of the film is very dark, which helps compliment the subject matter very well. I just love some of the shots, like when they first come upon the Gluttony crime scene and are using their flashlights all around, that scene looks so dark and mysterious, you can't help but be intrigued.Of course, Fincher's direction is brilliant so we don't even need to have a long discussion about that. The screenplay, as a whole, works very well. It's very good at keeping us contained to these murders and the people surrounding them and being affected by them. I can see why Fincher really wanted to make this screenplay. The editing in this film is definitely something to note, as scenes such as the opening credits and the overlays of the days look very well done, and it's obviously that either Fincher or the editor had very good ideas on how that was supposed to work.Overall, Se7en is a very solid flick. It boasts some talented performances, some great tone, music, direction and a solid screenplay and some very bold, but fantastic, editing choices. If you haven't seen this film, do yourself a favor and go see it because it's very dark, and the twist ending will leave you reeling, I'm sure.10/10. Grade: A",9,4,5,8 July 2015
The Terminator," 'The Terminator' has classic action thrills that will please most, if not all
","In the early 1980s, James Cameron came up with the idea of the film and when his agent told him it was a bad idea, Cameron fired him. Originally, the film was to include two Terminators, one of which would have been a liquid type (later used in T2). He later changed it to just one. He sold the rights to Gale Anne Hurd for $1. Literally. Anyway, in 1984, the film was released to rave reviews. By that, I mean it has an 8.1 on IMDb and a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. If that's not rave, I don't know what is. So, let's see if the critics are right or if they're just nutcases.The Terminator follows unassuming Sarah Connor as her life is turned upside down by a man claiming he's from the future to protect her, and a man who is part cyborg whom is trying to kill her to prevent a future war from ever beginning.To be honest, until today, I had never seen any of the Terminator films. I had heard many praise them and had heard a lot of good things about them but had never seen them. Now that I've seen one, I can definitely say that all the things people have said about the Terminator films being good are true.The acting is pretty well done from everyone. Arnold Schwarzenegger has that robotic feel to him already so he obviously does a great job as The Terminator, saying some truly hilarious lines like the scene where he says 'Fuck you, asshole.' Just brilliant. Michael Biehn does a great job as a man coming from the future to protect Sarah Connor at the advice of her future son, John Connor. Don't expect me to explain that one to you, go watch the movie. Linda Hamilton does a great job as well portraying the woman trying to come to grips with what a man from the future is telling her, believe me, I know how weird this sounds, haha. Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen do good in their somewhat-limited roles as the detectives assigned to Sarah's case.The music by Brad Fiedel is awesome. The music over the opening credits is really cool, and although it's expanded upon a lot more in future sequels, the original ain't bad either. The cool thing about the score is that it's not just the big action sounding score, it has some emotional music in it too. Always nice to have diversity. The visual effects are great in this film, especially for a film released in 1984. At the end of the film, the film uses stopmotion and other effects to great lengths. It all looks quite natural and works very well.The cinematography from Adam Greenberg looks awesome, and makes the film look the part of a basic chase through the streets of Los Angeles. It's pretty darn cool. The script, too, is written very well, written mainly by Cameron (even though Hurd got a writing credit too), and is very tight. It manages to restrict the film to it's chases and a few different places where the characters spend anywhere from 5-10 minutes. It's very cost-effective, especially since the film was only made on a $6.4 million budget.Perhaps my only problem with the film (I know, shocking, I have issues), is that the first thirty minutes or so before the club scene are a little slow-moving and it really does take a while for the film to kick into gear. It's not a big problem, really, just me nitpicking, but it did bug me a bit.Overall, The Terminator is a fantastic action thriller. While the film's first act moves a bit slow, the effects are ahead of it's time, and the acting, music, cinematography and script all are just as fantastic. I'm so excited now to watch the next Terminator film, especially since I just saw a fantastic one, and people say the next one is even better. If you haven't seen The Terminator, please check it out, it will be worth it, I promise.10/10. | Grade: A",10,1,1,2 July 2015
Interstellar," 'Interstellar' needed more help with it's beginning and end, but the film overall is a brilliant space adventure
","'Do not go gentle into that good night; Old age should burn and rave at close of day. Rage, rage against the dying of the light.'Christopher Nolan, over his long and illustrious film career, has made many films that have redefined cinema and people's notion of filmmaking. Memento, for example, with it's unorthodox storytelling and mind-bending way of letting the film unfold showed us all that a film doesn't have to be in perfect order to make sense. Inception changed our perception on dreams and what can be shown in reality, it gave us a new dimension to our dreams and what we perceive and believe. The Dark Knight Trilogy made it so that comic book movies could be taken seriously without judgment, and redefined not only the comic book film genre, but also the action genre. And, so, when people first saw trailers for his latest work, they immediately began to think in the vein of Memento, Inception and The Dark Knight Trilogy - they began to think of it as a film that would change things. Let's see if the Nolan man has done it again. Let us begin our travel with...Interstellar follows a group of explorers who head into space, leaving behind a Earth filled with drought and famine, through a rip in the space-time continuum to try and find a new home for the slowly dying people of Earth. As they travel, they realize they are about to go farther than any other human has, and they have to decide whether it's worth the risk of never seeing their loved ones again.I had heard nothing but pretty positive things about this film. People said it was mindblowing, really emotional, and such, so I decided I had to check it out for myself. I thought McConaughey outacted everybody else in the cast, because he did such a great job at portraying the simple family man who has to try and be the last hope for humanity. I guess I shouldn't be surprised at this point, with his acting in some of his latest work, but it still astounds me that he can do such a good job. Anne Hathaway was great as well, especially in some of the scenes where her and McConaughey's character verbally sparred. Jessica Chastain and Mackenzie Foy both do terrific jobs in portraying the older and younger versions of McConaughey's daughter. I think they both did a really good job in showing that they really cared about their father and just really wanted him to come home. Michael Caine was great, as well, as Hathaway's father. I guess I shouldn't be surprised since he's been in Nolan's last like seven films.The effects in this film were brilliantly breathtaking. I wish I had gotten the chance to see the film in IMAX, but even on my computer screen, I was simply blown away by what I saw. The effects used to accomplish the space travel were nothing short of brilliant, and the effects used in the final twist of the movie were also really great and truly mindbending. I thought the dialogue of the film was written very well, in particular the scenes where McConaughey's children constantly send him messages, and also the last few scenes.The cinematography in this film is just amazing as well. The shots of the spaceship floating through space, the shots of the two planets they go to, they all looked really incredible. Nolan had to use a different cinematographer than his usual one, and although it seems like you would probably notice, you don't because you're just so sucked into the film.I definitely enjoyed the music by Hans Zimmer, but by this point, is that really something you need to address? I mean, in every single one of Zimmer's films, his music is always one of the best parts about the film. It was definitely a different kind of score than I had really heard before, so I truly liked that a lot. I thought the characters of the robots, TARS and CASE were both pretty funny at times and really helped ground the film a bit better. They were great additions to the film and are probably one of the highlights of the film.Now, here's what I disliked about the film. I felt the opening 40 minutes could have been trimmed a bit or could have had some things removed. Not to say the opening was all bad, but I felt like it moved too slow compared to the rest of the film. On the subject of trimming, I thought the last 10 minutes of the film were also somewhat unneeded. It basically ended the film on a happy note, and while I'm all for that, the ending felt more like a gift-wrapped present rather than a proper conclusion. Another thing I disliked was that the first planet they go to feels like a simple pit stop and not enough like a thing that needed to happen to move the story along.Overall, however, Interstellar is a brilliant film. It's effects, cinematography, script, music, the robots and the acting were all brilliant. While I did think the opening and ending could have used some work, and the first planet they head to is a bit too pit stop- ish and not plot-needed-ish, the film overall is one you have to see to believe. IMAX is preferred, as I've learned, but a large HDTV will do you just fine.8.5/10.|Grade: B+",9,2,5,15 July 2015
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," 'Fellowship' is an excellent beginning to an excellent trilogy
","In the 1990s, a director had a vision. A vision to adapt one of the most celebrated fantasy series of all time, and turn it into a film. Originally it was to be one film, then two, and finally was settled at three. Slowly, the film became reality, with real-life sets being built and still standing, a filming that took over a year, and the trilogy going on to make billions of dollars at the box office. This film trilogy is entitled The Lord of the Rings. Now that I have reviewed it's prequel, The Hobbit, it is now time to review the next series (in chronological order). Let us begin with......The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. The Fellowship of the Ring follows a hobbit named Frodo Baggins as he comes into the possession of the One Ring, which has the power to control all of Middle-Earth. With the help of a dwarf, an elf, a wizard, a prince and several of his hobbit friends, Frodo is ready to embark on a journey that will take him to the home of Sauron at Mount Doom, where everybody's fates are tied.This is a tough film to review, mainly because some of the visual effects do begin to look dated, especially fourteen years later and with the advances in technology we have made since then. However, I suppose I'll do my best. The best thing about the film, perhaps, is the music. Howard Shore creates a musical score that is both haunting and memorable. Listening to the soundtrack, I tend to hum most of the tunes throughout the day (especially the theme song of the Fellowship).That's not to say everything else isn't good either. The plot works well, and manages to end on a note where we feel satisfied with the ending, but we're also wondering what will happen next. It's very well done and written, considering the book's original ending. The actors and actresses in the film do a phenomenal job. I think there's too many for me to rattle off names, but my personal favorites are Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Grey, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, and Hugo Weaving as Elrond. Not to say that everybody else did a bad job, but these are the people I enjoyed the most.The cinematography in the film is beautiful. Whenever there's sweeping landscape shots, the film manages to make it look as amazing as it possibly can. I sadly have not seen the film in HD Blu-Ray, but even on the DVDs I've watched the film on, it still looks, quite frankly, amazing. In the darker scenes (basically the Mines of Moria), the cinematography makes it feel unsettling and cold, as does the music. That is when you know you've crafted something great.The special effects, though slightly dated now (especially in the opening prologue), are still a marvel to look at. Back in 2001, I can't imagine how I might have felt back then, if I sat in the theater, looking at all of these things that seemed impossible to create, at first. I mean, who really thought that a 3-part movie filmed all at once and released over three years was going to be great? I'm sure lots of people were surprised by the film.The film has a lot of character development, which is great, especially for the characters who leave at the end of the film. I won't spoil who, but someone dies in the final battle of the film, and it made their death that much more heartbreaking when it occurred. Frodo gets a lot of development, as his struggles with the Ring begin to show, and a conversation between him and Gandalf in the Mines of Moria is probably my favorite scene in the film.Overall, Fellowship fits the shoes it was required to fill, and manages to create a smart fantasy that hits all the right notes: great music, cinematography, characters, acting and special effects. I'm sure that after this, everybody was excited for The Two Towers. And so am I.",10,3,3,8 June 2015
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," 'Judgment Day' is a fantastic sequel that ups the action, heart and much more to the highest level it can go
","In 1984, James Cameron hit a home run with the highly-successful The Terminator, and the main players involved (Cameron, Schwarzenegger, and Hamilton) were all game for a sequel. It took about six years for it to enter production, due to issues with the effects for the T-1000 to work, and the rights to the Terminator franchise. When it did, the work for the film lasted about 171 days, nearly half a year. They filmed at around 20 different locations for the film to be made. When the film was finally released, having spent about $94-$102 million dollars on the film, the film quickly made back it's budget about 5 times. Many people have given the film rave reviews, as the film has an 8.5 on IMDb and a 92% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. So, let's see if the film holds up after twenty-four years, and if the film is any good.Terminator 2: Judgment Day follows John Connor as he comes into contact with a reprogrammed T-800 who has been sent into the past to protect John from the T-1000, a upgraded Terminator that can turn into any living being and has been tasked to kill John to prevent the future from ever occurring.This film is freaking amazing. Okay? Just saying. The acting in this film is outstanding. Returning actors Schwarzenegger and Hamilton both do fantastic jobs as their roles, and Hamilton does an even better job than before, portraying a slightly more hardened, more badass Sarah Connor. Edward Furlong, in his first film role, does a pretty good job as John Connor. I mean, there are a few cringe-worthy moments, but isn't that how most child actors are? Robert Patrick... I really think there's no really good way to describe his phenomenal acting in this film. He's menacing and always has that sort of look on his face of menacing, yet somewhat charming. Reminds me of Norman Bates, haha. And Joe Morton does a fairly good job as Miles Dyson, basically the man behind the future SkyNet.The score was done once again by Brad Fiedel and he manages to one-up himself from the previous film. Don't believe me? Then listen to the music played over the opening credits, because it's kickass! It really does set the tone for the rest of the film. The special effects this time around are one hell of a lot better than the first go through. I mean, sure, the stopmotion Terminator at the end of the first one wasn't that bad, but the special effects for certain scenes, especially ones involving the T-1000, are a thousand times better. It's amazing that special effects created in the early 1990s are sometimes better than the ones in films made a few years ago.The screenplay written by James Cameron was as good as it was last time. I watched the Special Edition/Director's Cut, because I heard that was the best version, and while some of the humor in that version was a bit weird, it was still really good. I can't imagine the film without those scenes now. The cinematography in some scenes, especially scenes when they are driving and wide shots of the city all look amazing, and that's thanks to the cinematographer, Adam Greenberg. He really did a fantastic job with this film.The plot works for the most part. I mean, of course, there's going to be a few discrepancies, no matter how minor, because this is essentially a film where several people time travel and change the history that's been established. The fact that so much happens over the two and a half hour film and it all still manages to make sense is quite amazing, to be honest.Overall, Judgment Day is a very worthy sequel to the original Terminator, and dare I say it, it surpasses the original. The music, acting, screenplay, cinematography, plot and special effects, especially, all look and sound truly amazing. I do recognize the film has it's flaws, but you know what, I'm still going to give it one of my highest ratings because it is definitely becoming one of my favorite films.",10,2,4,5 July 2015
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," 'Desolation' ups the stakes, while gearing us up for a epic finale
","Once upon a time, there was a film series. It began with one film, that only covered a third of the novel it was based upon. Critics and fans alike were divided. Some enjoyed the film, while others loathed it. For better or for worse, a year later, the second film was released, covering another third of the book it was based upon. We started with An Unexpected Journey, now let us dive right into......The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. The Desolation of Smaug continues the story of the 13 dwarfs led by Thorin Oakenshield, and Bilbo Baggins, as they get closer and closer to Erebor. Through their travels, they meet elvish kings, men of a lake town and finally come face to face with the formidable dragon, Smaug.First things first. Let's talk about how good Smaug was in this film. Benedict Cumberbatch was phenomenal, doing great motion capture work and his voice sends chills down my spine each time I watch the film. The special effects used to create him looked amazing, I felt like he could have really been there. Smaug is definitely one of the biggest pluses towards the film.Other things I enjoyed? Well, I enjoyed the music in the film, but that's a given. I did have one gripe with the music, and that was the non-return of Misty Mountains. That was the best song in the first film, and the fact that it wasn't continued as a theme of the dwarfs really bummed me out. The special effects were really good, for the most part. I can't remember exactly, but I know there's a few parts where the effects were a bit shoddy.The acting in this film is as good as it was last time. Some newcomers to the party include Luke Evans as Bard the Bowman, and he does a really good job portraying the guy he's supposed to portray, Stephen Fry, who is a riot as the Master of Lake-town, and Lee Pace as Thranduil. Thranduil is probably my favorite out of the new characters, mainly because he's just so much fun. Pace overacts the character a bit, which is exactly what the character needed to make it more fun.The cinematography is, again, great. I won't spoil, but in the forest scene, apparently they had to make everything they wanted to appear in color really bright so they could make the forest around them look as dark as possible. It's interesting how they went to that length to make it look so good.Let's get to the negatives. Evangeline Lilly portrays Tauriel, a new character not in the book at all, and why Lilly does fine in her portrayal, it's her storyline that annoys me. I won't spoil it, but she gets into a relationship (sort-of, not really) with one of the dwarfs, and it feels so shoehorned in, I don't even feel anything good about their relationship. The difference between this relationship and one like Aragorn and Arwen, is that I actually bought that relationship and cared about if they were going to end up together and stay together. Tauriel and the dwarf seem so forced it's not even interesting.I also didn't like how goofy the ending was. Sure, okay, I can accept running from the dragon and maybe even running around a lot because of that. But blocking fire using pillars? The whole scene where dragon fire lights up the room? MOLTEN GOLD? It's not all bad, it's actually kind of fun, but the logical side of me wonders how the hell that would work.Overall, this is a step up from An Unexpected Journey. Although some of the ending is a bit goofy, and I dislike the love story, this is a solid entry to the Hobbit trilogy, and the last film is shaping up to be a very intriguing ending to this decent trilogy. The plot was good, the acting was good, the cinematography was on point, and the special effects were good. This is a great film to watch if you want some fun that doesn't take itself too seriously, while also taking itself seriously.9/10 Grade: B+/A-",9,0,4,8 June 2015
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," 'Unexpected Journey' is enjoyable, but seems slightly unnecessary
","There was once, a novel, written in 1937. The book became a success, as a children's novel, and the author wrote and released, 16 years later, a darker sequel to the story, split into three parts. From this sequel, a whole world spawned that would continue to be created until his death in 1973. What book am I talking about? The Hobbit, of course! What author am I talking about? J.R.R. Tolkien, duh! Let us begin our review of the first film in this trilogy......The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. An Unexpected Journey follows a Hobbit by the name of Bilbo Baggins as he is swept up in an adventure with 13 dwarfs and a wizard to reclaim the dwarfs's homeland of Erebor from the terrible dragon, Smaug.I first watched this film about five or six months ago, mainly because I had finally watched the Lord of the Rings Trilogy (which I will be reviewing as well), and I wanted to see the upcoming (at the time) Battle of the Five Armies (which I will be reviewing too). So, I finally watched it, and here is what I think of the film.Positives, first. The acting in this film is really great. Martin Freeman as Bilbo is easily one of the standouts, as he captures the young Hobbit's uncertainty in going on the adventure, while also managing to turn in a great performance. Ian McKellen always does a great job, no need to mention how great he was again. (Even though I just did.) Richard Armitage does a great job as Thorin, portraying a dwarf who loves the fun and adventure, while also struggling with his wish to return to Erebor. All of the dwarfs do a good job, especially the ones we actually start to know, including Kili (Aidan Turner), Fili (Dean O'Gorman), Balin (Ken Stott), and several others. Several characters from LOTR return as well, including Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), Elrond (Hugo Weaving) and Saruman (Christopher Lee).The special effects (for the most part) worked really well. I'm still in awe of how they managed to make Hobbits and Dwarfs smaller than their on-screen counterparts. It's a amazing technical feat. I really enjoyed the music as well, even though half of it was a retread from LOTR, Howard Shore always manages to create music that will stick with you. Misty Mountains is one of my favorite songs from a movie, ever. The cinematography was beautiful as well, the sweeping shots of the landscape as the dwarfs made their quest were amazing.I'm sure most of you want to hear about the scene that is probably going to be the most remembered from this part: Riddles in the Dark, or otherwise known as, Gollum's 20-minute return to Middle-Earth. Probably the best scene in the film, in my opinion. I enjoyed it immensely, all the little cat-and-mouse games they played with each other worked out beautifully. This is one of the things that saved the movie from getting a lower grade.Let's get to the negative stuff, unfortunately. I disliked the pacing of the movie. It's not really a spoiler, so I'm going to tell you that it takes 45 minutes for them to get out of Bag End and into the main plot. This wouldn't be a bad thing if it couldn't have been cut down. At some points in the film, you can really tell that they were stretching this into three movies, because certain scenes and plot points that were not in the book or were barely mentioned were given a lot of screen time (Where the hell did Radagast the Brown come from?).Another thing I disliked was the fact that Azog was a part of the film. Why give someone to chase the dwarfs when they had enough adventures on their own? For example, the troll scene, and other scenes that were either not in the book or barely mentioned? The whole thing felt way too drawn out, and I honestly believe they should have kept it to two movies. Shorten this one, cut DOS in half, shorten DOS entirely, and then tack on BOTFA at the end. Bam, two movies.Overall, this is a welcome addition to the Middle-Earth saga. The acting, characters, special effects and music were all well done, however the plot had pacing issues and that really affected my enjoyment of the movie. Still, it's a great movie and one I will return to.8/10. Grade: B",8,1,3,8 June 2015
Gone Girl," 'Gone Girl' works as a intriguing mystery with outstanding performances from Affleck and Pike
","'You two are the most f*cked up people I've ever met and I deal with f*cked up people for a living.'While shopping with my mother at Walmart, I decided I wanted to get a few books. So, I looked through the books, and I found the one book that interested me: Gone Girl. So, I got the book and began reading it over a week during school and outside of school. I was enthralled, because it was a mystery story that I never expected. So, shortly after I finished the book, I watched the film. I watched it late at night, and didn't really pay attention to half of it. I recently decided to rewatch it since it was on HBO, and I'm now ready to do a full review of the film. So, let's dive into the mystery everybody was enthralled by.Gone Girl follows a man who comes home to a crime scene and gets involved headfirst in a investigation involving the disappearance of his wife, and his life soon turns into a roller-coaster ride from hell.It's kind of hard to talk about this film without spoiling it, because it's such an intense and complicated film, that if you really want to do it justice, you need to talk about the film intensely. I'll try my best.One of the best things about the film is definitely the acting. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike really carry this movie straight through to the end, and give very realistic performances that do help ground this crazy ass film in reality. I'm very much shocked that Rosamund Pike was robbed of the Oscar, because she truly deserved it, for reasons I won't spoil. Tyler Perry was a riot as Tanner Bolt, the lawyer who reluctantly agrees to represent Affleck's character. He was serious in some scenes, and in others, delivered some of the best lines in the film. Carrie Coon did a good job as Go, Nick Dunne (Affleck)'s twin sister, and she truly portrayed the sister stuck in the middle of this strange case. The only cast member I was unsure about, and still am, is Neil Patrick Harris. It was weird to me that such an openly gay person was portraying a straight man. I mean, no offense to him being gay, I am myself, but it just seemed rather odd and took me out of the movie a bit. Aside from that, his performance was okay.The music by Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor is amazing. I listened to it on it's own and it still held up just as well. My favorite track from the OST is probably Empty Places, and it's reprise, because it just conveys the feelings Nick is feeling during the film. The cinematography in this film... just damn. The scenes all look really cold and empty, which is, I suppose, what you're supposed to feel in a film like this, and it works so well against the dark story unfolding before our eyes.The screenplay, written by Gillian Flynn, who also wrote the novel, is basically the same as the novel, however the ending has been changed a bit. It's not a bad change or anything, in fact, on the first watch-through, I hadn't really noticed the ending had been tampered with. It still works just as well as it did in the novel though. The film editing is great too. The timestamps, like what they did in the novel, work very well on film, and I'm glad. That was one of the things that I was wondering how they would do it, going in.My problem with the film stems from the third act. The third act is a bit over-the-top and a bit too unbelievable at times. It's still a fantastic finale, and I do really enjoy it, it's just that I could feel a bit of a step down when we reached the ending. Also, and this is kind of a spoiler, so I'll put a spoiler tag on this. When Amy does her monologue and talks about the cool girl, in the novel, we've seen her be a 'cool girl,' but in the film, that is barely shown and doesn't really help sell the image that Amy is trying to put on us.Overall, however, Gone Girl is an achievement in filmmaking. The acting, cinematography, music, editing, and screenplay are all on point. While the third act does delve into the insane, Amy's 'cool girl' thing isn't explained as well, and Neil Patrick Harris was miscast (in my opinion), the film still holds up remarkably well and is a intriguing thriller that is a great addition to David Fincher's line of works.9/10 | Grade: A-",10,3,5,21 June 2015
Room," Room is an amazing film analyzing the life of a kidnapped mother and son
","Room follows a kidnapped mother and her son who eventually make a complicated, but successful, escape attempt and must deal with life after being released.So, the main reasons I saw this film were because: a) Brie Larson is a great actress, as seen in some other films I've seen recently (namely The Spectacular Now), b) the film looked really intriguing from some clips and such that I saw during the Oscars, and c) it is an Oscar winner, and I'm always intrigued to see these movies. And I gotta say, this movie exceeded my expectations. Much like Spotlight, I didn't expect it to be as good as it was.Let's start with the acting, because that is the best thing about this movie, in my opinion. Brie Larson deserved the Oscar. She did an amazing job portraying a mother trying to protect her son, but also dealing with her own issues stemming from her seven-year imprisonment. It's amazing how well she just blends into her character. After a while, you don't see an actress anymore. You see a struggling mother, barely holding herself together. Part of the reason this works so well is that Jacob Tremblay, who plays her son, also does a fantastic job. From someone who generally doesn't like child actors, because most of the time they suck, I was genuinely surprised that he did such a fantastic job. He was never annoying, and instead, he was one of the biggest pieces that needed to fit, and he did a great job doing so.The other actors and actresses in the film are of lesser importance, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't bring them up. Joan Allen did a great job as Larson's mother, portraying a woman trying to be there for her daughter, but also wanting her to move on. Sean Bridgers is extra disturbing as 'Old Jack', aka, the man who has kidnapped the mother. William H. Macy portrays a father trying to keep himself together after so many years, and Tom McCamus does a fantastic job as Allen's new beau, providing for both Larson and her son.The score to this film, done by Stephen Rennicks, was absolutely stunning. He hasn't done many movies, but I hope he gets more work, because he does an excellent job with this movie. It never feels as if he's pandering, trying to get you to cry because of the music alone. It feels exactly like you're in the movie, and how you would feel if music would be playing during pieces of your life. The music only flares during tense and also rewarding sequences, and it always makes you feel even more for the people in the film.The cinematography and direction was great as well. For the first half, it's set simply in a storage shed. It's quite amazing how well you can come up with many different ways to film inside such a small space. Yet, the director Lenny Abrahamson, did a great job with this. The screenplay was also stunning. It really provides the best way for these characters to act and play off of each other. I, sadly, have not read the book yet, but I am almost tempted to go out and buy it right now, as it seems like it would be quite the read.Overall, I'm extremely impressed with Room. The acting, score, direction, cinematography, screenplay - everything absolutely worked. If you haven't seen it for some reason, do so. It's definitely worth your time. But, be sure to bring a few tissues. I'm not one for crying during movies, and yet I almost did here. That's the sign of a fantastic film.",10,2,4,26 March 2016
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," 'Towers' works on almost every level, except one plot thread
","Welcome back to my reviews of the Middle-Earth saga. We've gone on An Unexpected Journey, visited The Desolation of Smaug, witnessed The Battle of the Five Armies, and met The Fellowship of the Ring. Today, we are going to go on our next stop of the Lord of the Rings saga. Fasten your seatbelts, it's time to get hit by a waterfall. Let's enter......The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. The Two Towers follows several different plot threads: Sam and Frodo continue their quest to get to Mount Doom, as a creature named Gollum accompanies them; Aragon, Gimli, and Legolas all go in search of the Hobbits, and later head to Edoras in Rohan to assist in battle; Merry and Pippin are taken captive by Urku-hai and later meet a Ent that may help them in their quest.This is probably my least favorite of the three films, let me just tell you that before we begin. Of course, that doesn't mean it's not a good film, it's a fantastic one. It's just I don't like some of the new characters we are introduced to and Merry and Pippin's story isn't that interesting to me. Anyway, let's get on with the review.As usual, the best thing about the film is it's music. The music created by Howard Shore is always welcome, even in the film's most slow areas. The acting is really great too, by all members, but especially Elijah Wood and Sean Astin. Wood really portrays Frodo's desperation and slow descent into a form of madness due to him being influenced by the ring. Astin really works well with Wood, making Sam more than just a sidekick, but both a rock and friend that Frodo needs in his times of desperation.The special effects are just as good as the previous films, if not better. Treebeard and Gollum are the obvious highlights, and they are created so convincingly that I couldn't really see any issues with them. I recently read that Treebeard was filmed on a green screen, and honestly, I couldn't tell, even when I watched some of the scenes in HD. Magnificent.The cinematography and, well, shots of the film both are done beautifully. Every scene where groups are riding to battle and scenes where we see sweeping shots of landscapes look amazing, and you can tell that Jackson and anybody else working on that part of the film really wanted it to look good. The best example of this, in my opinion, is the first scene right before we get into what happened to Gandalf.The plot works, for the most part. I found the scenes in Rohan to be the most interesting. Like Peter Jackson said, The Two Towers is mainly focused on Aragorn. It's his main story. So, obviously, that was going to be the most interesting and the most focused upon. I also liked Frodo, Sam and Gollum's story. Gollum's internal struggle is made that much harder halfway through the film, when Frodo has to do something that he didn't want to do. I have to wonder, if that hadn't have happened, would Gollum have been more accepting of not leading Frodo and Sam where they end up in Return of the King?I don't know. I did think that the weakest story, and the one that I don't like to watch, is the story with Merry, Pippin, and Treebeard. I like the character of Treebeard, but it doesn't really work for me. It's just so boring, and it's usually cutting away from the more intriguing stories. Less focus on their tale would have worked for me.In conclusion, overall, The Two Towers is a intriguing follow-up to The Fellowship of the Ring. While I had some issues with Merry and Pippin's storyline, the film itself is a action-packed ride and a great lead- up to the grand finale in The Return of the King.10/10.

The Imitation Game," 'The Imitation Game' is not always historically accurate, but it is still a excellent film with an Oscar-worthy performance from Cumberbatch
","'Oh, because I'm sitting in a police station, accused of entreating a young man to touch my penis, and you've just asked me if machines can think.' 'Well, can they?'Ever since I had seen the promos, watched some TV spots and trailers, and read about who Alan Turing was, I was immensely excited for this film. I'm a homosexual myself, so hearing the story of a man who had gone on to create such an important piece of history, while being a homosexual, sounded quite amazing. What furthered my interest more what Graham Moore's speech at the Oscars after winning Best Adapted Screenplay for the film: 'Stay weird, stay different,' he said. I simply couldn't wait any longer. Sadly, I did not get to see the film in theaters and it greatly upset me, as I was still very intrigued in the film. My mother, however, being the lovely woman that she is, bought me the Blu-Ray, and I finally got around to watching it. So, after all of this, is this the movie I wanted to see? The Imitation Game chronicles the true story of Alan Turing, a professor, closeted homosexual, and mathematician, through three points of his life: one when he was a child, and fell in love with his only friend at school, one when he is a year away from the end of his life as his being a homosexual comes to light, and the most focused upon: the quest to, along with a group of Britain's best mathematicians, solve the Nazi machine Enigma, which could help them win the war.Let's start off with the acting. Benedict Cumberbatch is a revelation as Alan Turing, playing him in such a tremendous way that, much like with Jake Gyllenhaal in Nightcrawler, I didn't see Cumberbatch, I saw Alan Turing. Keira Knightley did a great job as well, portraying the only woman who was a part of the cryptography team. Matthew Goode was also great, and sometimes the comic relief of the film, as Hugh Alexander. Allen Leech plays John Cairncross and does a fantastic job. So does Rory Kinnear. I usually go on more about the acting, but what did you really expect with a cast this great? The music by Alexandre Desplat is just brilliant, and easily one of the best scores of 2014. I've been listening to it over and over and it's still just as brilliant as when I first heard it. It's just so fitting of the film, and when you hear it, it makes you feel as if you are just as much a genius as Turing was. The screenplay was top notch, as well. Some, as I've witnessed, have called the film 'boring,' but I'm of the belief that a film can never be boring as long as it has a great script or great action. This script was brilliant, funny when it needed to be, and just as dramatic as it needed to be sometimes. Graham Moore deserved the Oscar.The film's look is just brilliant. It never mutes the colors, it just downplays them. The color palette in this film is very vibrant, and looks that way except for scenes of the actual war going on around them, then it looks a bit more bleak. I really enjoyed two of the timelines they focused on: the past, which was brilliant in showing slowly how much his past at school influenced what he was doing as he tried to crack the Enigma, and the Enigma solving itself. The one timeline I didn't enjoy (until the end) was the timeline of him in the future, after everything had happened. It just felt like it was taking away from the story we most wanted to see: the cracking of the Enigma.One other thing I should mention: the historical accuracy of the film. Now, I've read up on the film a bit, and it's not exactly historically accurate, but if the film is good, why does it matter? I mean, honestly. The film may not be entirely accurate, sure, but what it's done is made me more interested in the story of Alan Turing and the injustices he faced not only in his lifetime, but in the afterlife as well. I mean, if a historical drama/thriller can do that, then it doesn't exactly matter if the film is entirely accurate, right? It's a film, not a documentary.Overall, The Imitation Game is a brilliant film. The music, the acting, especially from Cumberbatch, the editing, the script, the look, and the jumping of timelines were all done greatly. Although I didn't particularly enjoy the cutting of the future in with the past, the entire film is one that, while not always historically accurate, always manages to entertain and managed to make me more interested in Turing's life. If a film can do that, then I'm instantly sold.---- 10/10. Grade: A",10,1,3,18 July 2015
Saw," 'Saw' is an innovative horror film that all fans of the genre should witness
","In 2003, up and coming filmmakers James Wan and Leigh Whannell created a 9-minute short film (now dubbed Saw 0.5) to try and market their idea for the film that would start a cultural phenomenon. They optioned the script and short around until they finally gained the attention of producer Gregg Hoffman, who later showed it to some partners and created the film label entitled Twisted Pictures. Given 18 days and a $1 mil production budget, the two filmmakers set to work on creating one of the best horror films in the last 15 years. Let's see how good of a job they did.Saw follows two men chained to pipes in a bathroom, with no recollection of how they got there or who brought them there. As the two slowly figure out the game they're apart of, a detective obsessed with finding out who the person responsible is attempts to close in on his suspected killer.Until yesterday, I had never seen the original Saw film in it's entirety. Sure, I had seen some of the traps and I had actually seen a lot of the movie through clips and such. But, this was the first time I had sat down and watched the film. How does it hold up, especially nearly eleven years after it's release? Well, let's see.The acting is really great. Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell both do great jobs at portraying people from completely different backgrounds but who are both left, stuck in a situation they can relate to. Tobin Bell, even in his very limited role in this film, is still bone-chilling as the diabolical Jigsaw (or, his real name, John Kramer), and delivers a performance that many should remember for years to come. Danny Glover is fantastic as Detective Tapp, a figure with a dark past, who is obsesssed with finding out Jigsaw's identity. Monica Potter also does a great job as Elwes's wife. I won't explain her role in the story because I suppose it's a spoiler, but she does great in the role.The music, from Charlie Clouser, is just brilliant. It has that sort of dark, rough edge to it that you would expect in a film like this. The unofficial theme song to the film, entitled 'Hello Zepp,' is probably one of the best themes to a horror movie, ever, especially when you think about the climatic ending that accompanies the song. In my opinion, the music to the film really elevated it above a standard horror movie.I really enjoyed the script and the story. It really deserved it's R rating, with all the 'fucks,' 'shits,' and such in the film. The story was pretty tight, even if there were a few small plot holes that I noticed, but it's probably because I'm such a good person at noticing things like that. The script was great, giving us dialogue you would reasonably expect in a time like this.The cinematography and direction was spot on. James Wan, or perhaps the editor, liked to use a lot of shots that lingered or would like pan over to a spot and fade into another scene or location. That gimmick worked very well in some scenes (one I can remember the best is when the camera pans down and into the bathroom from the ceiling).The only thing I really didn't like about the film was a bit of the gore. I'm okay with gore and blood in films, but the film took it to extremes a bit. Perhaps that's why people didn't like the film, because there's so much of it in there. Now that I think about it, it doesn't really bother me, but still.Overall, Saw is a fantastic horror film. The acting, music, script, story and cinematography are all completely on point. While I do have a few issues with some elements of the story and a bit of the shots with gore, Saw is a film that any horror buff needs to check out.9/10. Grade: A-",9,1,3,11 June 2015
Whiplash," 'Whiplash' is an outstanding piece of art highlighted by Teller and Simmons
","I had been very excited to see Whiplash for a long time. Reviewers that I follow and watch had praised the movie a lot, and from the trailers and things I knew about the film, it looked like a fantastic film. So, when I finally saw that it was on Starz on Demand, I immediately sat down and watched the full 106-minute picture. Boy, am I glad that I did. Because, in my personal opinion, Whiplash is one of my favorite films of all time. Let's get into why.Whiplash follows a first year jazz student at the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory in New York, named Andrew Neiman, who catches the attention of a famed conductor, and the jazz teacher at the Conservatory, named Terence Fletcher. What follows this is a psychological battle of wits between a hardass teacher and a student who just wants to please his teacher.This movie seriously is fantastic. Let's start with the obvious: the acting. Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons together are probably the best movie pair I've seen in a long while. They play off of each other so well. I honestly believe that if Teller or Simmons hadn't been in the movie, it wouldn't have worked so well.Simmons brings a whole new level to the character of Fletcher. Fletcher is constantly spewing out insults and such, and what makes it work is that Simmons is so dedicated to his role. I read that on set, Simmons would always be in the character of Fletcher during takes, but during the breaks, he'd be the nicest guy ever, which made the filming sessions easier. That's some damn dedication right there. And we can't forget about Miles Teller, who truly plays the character of Andrew well. Teller hits the right balance between a scared student who wants to please a teacher, and a student who just wants people to understand how his music affects him. It's a joy to watch his scenes with others, like his father or his girlfriend, and how he tries to convey to them what the drumming truly means to him. The other main actors, Paul Reiser, Austin Stowell, and Melissa Benoist all do well in their roles as well.The music featured in the film (including the pieces Whiplash and Caravan) all sounds fantastic. I was honestly surprised at how cool the music sounded. I wasn't expecting jazz music (because going into the film, I actually didn't know how big of a part jazz played), and it worked so well for me, probably because of that. The cinematography and the film editing really bring this film up another notch, if that's even possible. The editing during Teller's drumming scenes really puts you in Andrew Neiman's shoes as he tries his hardest to please a teacher who can't be pleased. The cinematography works as well, showing off the band and Neiman equally, which gives greater perspective to what Teller's character is trying to accomplish.The overarching plot and script to the film are fantastic. As I said, the dialogue is actually really great, and I do see why people really enjoyed the screenplay and why it was on the Hollywood Black List in 2012. It's really fantastic, and some of the exchanges between Fletcher and Neiman are just exhilarating to watch.Whiplash is definitely one of my favorite films. The acting, music, editing, script, and just everything about the film is fantastic. If you want to see some Oscar bait, a prime example of it is definitely this film. If you haven't seen this glorious piece of art, please go see it. You'll thank me when you did.10/10 | Grade: A+",10,1,2,21 June 2015
Rear Window," 'Rear Window' is a thrilling film that keeps you guessing until the last few minutes
","Alfred Hitchcock's illustrious career truly began to take off in the 1950's, as most of his remembered films come from those years. One of these such films is the classic Rear Window, released in 1954 and based on a short story written by Cornell Woolrich. The film was regarded as one of Hitchcock's best, being included in every 'Masterpiece' or 'Essentials' collection of his, and it currently has a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, an 8.6 on IMDb and is in three of the Top AFI lists. So, let's see if one of Hitchcock's most known is as good as they say.Rear Window follows a photographer forced to stay in his home due to his leg injury. He bides his time by watching his neighbors out of the window, dealing with his girlfriend, and having discussions with his insurance nurse. One night, he witnesses events through his window that begin to make him believe that the man just across the square may have murdered someone. As he gets closer and closer to the truth, things only get crazier and crazier.This film was one that I expected to be great, due to it's history, but I didn't expect it to be this great, honestly. Stewart, as he always does, does a brilliant job as Jeff, a photographer who gains a greater appreciation for the people in his life as the film goes on, and he really sells the role. Grace Kelly also does a stellar job as Jeff's girlfriend, Lisa Fremont, managing to never seem like she's trying to nag Jeff as they disagree about their future together. Thelma Ritter is an often darkly funny character as Stella, and she truly brings a dimension to this film that really helps it, in my opinion. Raymond Burr does a intriguing job as the neighbor Jeff begins to suspect as the murderer. Finally, Wendell Corey is an intriguing character, as the detective friend Jeff calls in to consult with.The music for the film, only really for the opening and closing, done by Franz Waxman was great. I wish it had been utilized more, but I get that if it had, it might have ruined what Hitchcock was trying to accomplish. The special effects used at times, especially in a certain scene at the end, were not that bad. I mean, today, they wouldn't fly, but for the time, it looks pretty good. I enjoyed the lighting in this film, such as the many scenes where Jeff is sitting in the dark in his apartment, and it looks as if he's hiding in the shadows at times. I mean, sometimes, it's intentional, but at other times it works well.I thought the script was written very well. Several of the discussions between Jeff and some of the other characters were very riveting and hold your interest, even if it seems to be about something trivial on the surface. I enjoyed a lot of the camera motions and how the film was done. The film is basically set in Jeff's apartment for the entire film, as most of the camera shots of other people and apartments are from his apartment, which I thought added a lot to the film. We only see what the characters can see - nothing more, nothing less.I also really enjoyed how the sound effects really complimented the film. Instead of having a formal type of score, you mainly only hear sound effects from other apartments or natural nature noises. The only time you actually hear music, aside from what Franz Waxman did for the opening/ending, is from the songwriter's apartment. I thought that was a very clever way to keep the film grounded, props to Hitchcock for that idea.Overall, Rear Window is an achievement in filmmaking. Its mystery is compelling, the story is great, the acting is fantastic, the music, albeit limited, works very well, as does it's use of sound effects, the script and the way the film was done. If you haven't seen it, consider checking it out as it is very riveting and will keep you guessing until the end.10/10. Grade: A+",10,1,3,14 July 2015
Jurassic Park," 'Jurassic Park' is a technological achievement, but not infallible
","In 1990, Michael Crichton released a successful novel under the name of Jurassic Park. Steven Spielberg took an interest in the novel, and so, with the full cooperation of Crichton, the two began work on adapting the novel into a feature film. The film was released in 1993, to rave reviews, and soon spawned a film franchise that is planning it's fourth release in the next few weeks. Let us venture into the film where it all began. Jurassic Park follows a group hand-picked by the CEO of a powerful company to inspect the CEO's new park composed entirely of genetically modified dinosaurs. However, as the group takes a tour of the park, things suddenly go south and it's now a fight to survive the stormy night, without becoming a dino's next meal.Okay, I'm not gonna lie. I didn't see Jurassic Park at all until about two or three days before writing this review. So, maybe I don't have the rose-colored glasses that most people have when it comes to talking about this movie. Either way, I do agree with most when I say it's an enjoyable film, however, I have my qualms with the film.Let's start with the positives. The acting is great from all. Sam Neill and Laura Dern as Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler do excellent jobs, especially in some of the later climatic scenes. Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm is a riot for me, considering I love how he just keeps doing the 'uhs' and the 'uhms,' it's actually really funny if you think about it. Richard Attenborough as John Hammond was quite the treat, especially since he managed to convey that mystical wonder you would come to expect from anyone who just spent all that time building a freaking Dino park. The kids in the film (Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello) also did a great job. I was surprised I didn't hate them.The special effects blew me away, especially considering they were done in a time where CGI was relatively new and most of the dinosaur shots (from farther away) were all CGI. It's quite amazing, to be honest. And actually kind of funny, because while the dinosaurs look so real here (and still hold up), in other films involving dinosaurs (I'm looking at you, Transformers 4), they look really fake. Have we really regressed that far?The music by John Williams is great, as per usual with a composer like him. I swear, I will never get that damn theme song out of my head, it's that catchy. The cinematography is amazing as well. In some of the shots of the park, it's kind of hard to believe that the dinosaurs aren't really there and that the island didn't exactly exist. It looks all beautiful though, even on the DVD set I watched it with.I think my biggest problem with the film is how slow the first act of the film is. The film only really gets going when the kids arrive, and before that, it's a lot of expositional dialogue. Don't get me wrong, some of it is interesting, but there becomes a point where it's a bit too much to just have all of this dialogue and no dino action.Overall, however, Jurassic Park is a very solid film. The acting, special effects, cinematography and music are great, as I expected them to be. While it does have some plotting and pacing issues, it is still a film that holds up very well, and is definitely a timeless classic for all to enjoy.",8,0,2,8 June 2015
V for Vendetta," 'V for Vendetta' is an excellent action thriller with surprising amounts of heart
","In the late 1980s, Alan Moore and David Lloyd teamed up to create a graphic novel entitled V for Vendetta, and in the mid-2000s, the novel was made into a film of the same name and released. The strange thing about the film was that it truly did spark the Anonymous movement, with people in the organization wearing Guy Fawkes masks to protect their identities. I became interested in the film because of this, and decided to check it out. What did I think of it? Let's find out.V for Vendetta follows a anarchist freedom fighter who identifies as V who attempts to stop the United Kingdom's totalitarian regime. A working-class girl named Evie gets involved in V's plans, and soon the two pair up as a detective and the High Chancellor himself give chase to stop their plans to blow up Parliament on the 5th of November.This film is actually a really good one, which is kind of surprising since I went in with not that high expectations. The acting is fantastic. Hugo Weaving manages to do a stellar job as V, despite we never see his face and the most we see of him is his burned up hands. Natalie Portman does a pretty good job as Evie, managing to portray the character stereotype of the person caught up in something they don't want to do, but it still manages to work out well. Stephen Rea and Rupert Graves both do a great job as the detectives who are trying to find V and Evie.John Hurt is a fantastic person to watch as the High Chancellor, and manages to portray such an evil role that I was surprised. In most movies that I've seen him in, he's the good guy. But whatever. And of course, Stephen Fry does a fantastically humorous job as Gordon Deitrich, and really brings a level of jokes and humor to part of the film, that I think it really needed. The screenplay written by the Wachowski brothers (or is it siblings now? I don't know), was a great one and especially fit the tone of the film I think everyone involved was going for. The speeches that V gave were very well written and got me really pumped for what the rest of the film was going to bring.to the table.The cinematography in the film was just amazing and it looked really kind-of post-apocalyptic, even if the world on the outside still looked somewhat normal. The set pieces with the film looked pretty good as well, even though some of them were probably just regular homes in London. The editing was really great as well, especially in scenes like the finale and scenes between V and people trying to attack him.This ties into the special effects that look great and work very well, much better than I expected them to for a 2006 movie. It's no Bullet Time from The Matrix, but it looks great. The music by composer Dario Marianelli was really great for the times it was used. I say this because most of the movie had other music other than Marianelli's score, but the times when his score was used, it still worked very well.Overall, V for Vendetta is a fantastic film. The acting, screenplay, cinematography, set design, editing and special effects all look and sound really fantastic. If you haven't seen the film, I definitely recommend it. It's a fun film and a surprisingly heartfelt one, especially towards the end of the film.10/10 | Grade: A",10,3,5,25 June 2015
