The Monuments Men," Walk away
","It is very rare that I watch a film that makes me want to walk away. I was in London with my girlfriend the other night and that was all that we could watch at the time we had available. I write this review in the hope to save you from wasting your time on this. There is no justification for such a horrendously made film. Besides having no script, no challenge, no evolution of character or plot, this is acted as it we, the spectators, are complete idiots. On top of this, you have numerous deliberate cigarette propaganda inserts that contribute nothing to the incomprehensibly bland story line. I have been working with television and film for the last two decades, teaching photography and video as well as watching passionately films from all around the world, including Hollywood, which I enjoy very much, but this is simply one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life. I only stayed in the theater because it was cold outside and between the two of us, this was an 75 us dollars bad joke. Watch one of your favorites again, but don't watch this. I hope to contribute to saving you some time.",1,7,9,3 July 2014
