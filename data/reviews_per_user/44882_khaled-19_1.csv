Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," this is an awful abusive trash!!! it should be forbid!!
","well, according to the fact that Kazakhstan is my Motherland..I'm so angry on these guys, who made this rubbish!!! They deeply offend Kazakh people, by this 'view'...I don't even tell that they didn't use Kazakh language!!!!! They used language they probably made up!!! They used names on the map - which they type just collection of letters, which means NOTHING!!! It's so unprofessional!!! It's so rude!! I'm extra-angry!! ALL I have to say - it has NOTHING IN COMMON with life in Kazakhstan!!! Not that it's ideal or so, it has own problems and yes, there are country-side with poor life-style, but they're not that silly and ugly...I just deeply hate this movie..",Null,4,8,24 March 2007
