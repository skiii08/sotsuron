Black Swan," Riveting - Black Swan is one in a million
","Perhaps in life good and bad are always evaluated. The main theme in this movie was about the weighing of the two sides. Like Star Wars between the Jedi and Darth Vader. Or like the ying and yang in Eastern Religion. This movie was about opposites. Not just good and bad but also the differences between reality and non-reality. Between success and failure. Between famous and destruction.Throughout this whole movie, I felt that someone was pulling my hair. The movie was so uncomfortable to watch. I found the whole content and graphics very disturbing. The blood from Nina's fingers, the blood and scratches on Ninas' back. I felt shaken inside when watching this movie. This is one of movies that I went to were people actually left the movie theater. Last night 4 people got up in the movie theater and left their seats - not returning either. The only other movie that I experienced that happening to was with Schindler's List.If I put this movie into perspective, I must admit that the movie was one in a million. That I have not experienced anything quite like it before. That I could actual feel the frustration, pain and complete loss of control and the gain of control all in one. So in that viewpoint the director succeeded immensely.I think the ratings 14A should have been put up to 18+ and Restricted because the movie has lots of blood and a very destructive intertwined story.Even though it was a story of a ballerina, the graphics, were almost like watching a war movie.I must commend the xtc scene and the hard dancing combined with the flashing paused cinematic photography. That conveyed an incredible real, life-like feeling. And I loved the metamorphose effect when Nina changed to the Black Swan - in one of the final scenes. Her skin started to change into scale-like features, and black patterns and wings started to appear on her body. She became the Black Swan in her being and it came out in her dance. That dancing display of blackness was amazing and empowering. It really gave a good impression of what was going on inside her head.",1,2,8,9 February 2011
Wind River," Deeply wrought subject-matter
","Wind River is a very dark movie. It is dark because it is based on a true story. This movie is not a movie about a hunter and a FBI agent instead it is a movie about First Nations people in a State in America. It is about poverty, a neglected police force on the reserve and it is about very deeply wrought subject-matter that is still too deep to really talk about in our societies.",6,1,5,5 September 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Rogue one was vagabond garbage
","Star Wars: Rogue One was a movie I watched in the Odeon, Dec. 2016. I believe the Mask that Darth Vader had was way too small, and the cape did not look good either. In the past SW movies, Darth Vader looked very powerful, but not this time. This movie seemed to be about good versus evil; about war and peace; and about destiny. However these themes and their challenges were not properly developed. There could have been a lot more suspense, plot developments and character development. It was very hard for me to like any of the characters, and I could not attach myself to the characters, like I once did with Luke Skywalker for example. SW is not only about Science Fiction Futures - but it is about current day triumphs over political evils in our world. SW is supposed to teach the audience that fighting hard, believing in ones dreams and aspirations gets rewarded - not destroyed. Like in this movie when 2 main characters perish at the end. Furthermore, the visual of Rogue One seemed too polished. It was that self-developed innovative style of brand new ideas that I loved about SW. This movie, did not have anything new in it. It was reproducing the same themes, visuals and ideas - SW is not about repeating the same ideas - but growing with the times, expanding into new modern philosophies and helping the audience to know that good triumphs over evil at the best of times.",5,3,6,28 December 2016
Passengers," Everything is all good
","Passengers is a movie intended for all age groups. I think this movie is a better movie then Star Wars: Rogue One because there were obstacles that were problem solved and all recovered. There were major challenges and everything was overcome. I think this is one of the only movies I have seen in about 1 year, where everything comes together in a positive and good way. The movie is like V for Vendetta where a lot of the challenges seem to be cliché, but on the other hand - what is wrong with that? Living in a Western Hollywood Film culture - I have gotten used to clichés and at times they make me feel comfort at identifying them, viewing them and experiencing them. This movie is also very predictable, for example, the man wakes up a lady who he is the most attracted to physically and mentally to help him on his quest to save the spaceship. If each one of us, as humans could pick out our soul-mate by reading their life stories and then matching their beauty to the picture - our world would be like going into Walmart and picking up an item we ordered on-line; except in Walmart you can return the item if you are not satisfied, which was not the case with the lady whose pod he opened. Of course this movie is a sci-fi movie and not based on reality and there needs to be a disclosure on that - for example that love is based often on indescribable thoughts, feelings and emotions - versus a description and the physical appearance of someone.",6,0,2,5 January 2017
Doctor Strange," Dr. Strange is like an ER sitcom
","The movie Dr. Strange 2016 is a movie much like the television shows House or ER. It is about a doctor and how he copes in his life. Perhaps he is always trying to either help himself or help others. On a certain level there is a philosophical meaning to this movie, for example, should the doctor help himself and keep himself safe - like a paramedic or should the doctor try to help all of society as best as he can? And then if he continues to help the whole of society, by fighting off evil, can he still be called a doctor, or does he transcend his role to be omnipotent? The role of the Ancient One could be seen as that of a dictator - but she does seem to be a wise woman. It is clear that Western doctors today probably get pulled into Buddhism and alternative methods of healing throughout their practices. Doctors, too must wonder about good and evil and maybe Dr. Strange is more a movie about trying to contribute to society versus thinking only about oneself, choosing altruism versus survival of the fittest. Maybe this movie is about caring versus struggling and about truth versus lies.",6,1,2,1 December 2016
Interstellar," A great hopeful movie about a family of scientists
","This movie, Interstellar was a great movie about a family of scientists who try to save the world and actually do. The story seemed to be a constant battle, always ending on a good note. The special effects of the black hole and a few of the planets was sensational. The story-line and dialogue was kept very simple and followed a very clear logical storyboard. This seemed to compel the audience and mesmerize them. Almost like being in a trance. While I sat in the IMAX movie theater in Victoria City - the whole theater with people was full and not a person moved from their seats throughout the duration of the whole movie. Furthermore, the whole audience was quiet and listened closely to the dialogue of the movie. The whole movie was captivating. I liked the simple space ships, and outfits that the space travelers wore. I also like the overall simplicity of the exploration of space. The space ships were small, the packages of left data in orange bags in the ocean were easy to be identified and everything seemed very functional and practical. This felt safe. This movie seems to have been a symbol of our future. One of simplicity externally and complexity internally. I also liked the fact that aliens were not introduced into this movie - but rather the notion of the evolved human being, being able to communicate and through new dimensions. It was a positive and happy movie about a hopeful future. One of change and one of humanity.",7,1,3,23 January 2015
Split," Aliens type design
","Watched Split in the Odeon, February 2nd, 2017. The movie is about a man with 23 personalities and which the 24th personality takes over all of the other personalities. This mental illness is called Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). I liked the role of the psychiatrist. She was a caring and curious woman. I also liked how the lead character turned into an Alien life-form at the end of the movie. It reminded me of Aliens, the movie combined with V-for Vendetta, especially close to the end when the lead character was in the subway station and placed the flowers on the ground. In V-for Vendetta, the lead character also used flowers in a subway station to symbolize a violent ending. The story line between V-for Vendetta and Split are also similar in the way that both lead characters wanted to overcome societal challenges by using violence as the answer. Within the field of psychiatry it is the hope that patients can transform and in a sense that is what the lead character in Split does; like the movie Ex-Machina - the antagonist wins - which is an ending unlike Star Wars were good always overcomes evil.",8,2,11,2 February 2017
Knowing," Knowing is like ESP
",Knowing is a movie about a family of a father and a son. The son gets a letter from a school time-capsule that changes both him and his father's life. This movie has some reality and non-reality elements; so it is on the verge of a science fiction movie combined with a tale of dementia or imagination which appears to have been caused when the wife and mother died. The element of alcohol and hurt could have been the cause of the twists and turns in this movie. But for the most part it is a straight forward logical science fiction natural disaster movie. I do not know how the screen play writer came up with this type of movie nor why however I found it to be creative. Very good special effects and Nicolas Cage plays a good role.,7,0,0,13 October 2017
Dunkirk," Like a dream sequence.
","Christopher Nolan, the Director of this film did a very good job at explaining a close to impossible story of failure on the shores of Dunkirk France in the 1940's. The movie opens up with an unknown British soldier walking into the French town of Dunkirk. The French forces are holding off the Nazis as best as they can behind a sandbag homemade barricade. In a way, it seems the French, through their ability to block one of the only streets leading to the Dunkirk beach, saved the lives of the British soldiers; and at the same time the British soldiers in the movie would not allow the French to escape with them on their sea vessels. This detail explains the complexity of war and the expression - all is fair in love and war. Christopher Nolan captures the true essence of the unknown British soldier and his need to survive against all the odds. The filming and the visual narratives showed the viewer the component of luck in many of the survival maneuvers. However, Dunkirk is also known historical to be an ultimate failure on the part of the British; and at the same time a miracle that three hundred thousand British soldiers were able to survive this defeat without being slaughtered by gun-fire, bombs and explosions. Christopher Nolan is a great film director for telling a somewhat open ended story and leaving the unraveling up to the viewer. Like a good novel the author leaves the interpretation up to the viewer. Christopher Nolan, intentional or not filmed this movie, Dunkirk in a dream sequence. Dreams are often collages of piece of visuals that at first make no sense, but on thinking about it, makes lots of sense. Dunkirk 2017 had three narratives: earth; air and water. Dunkirk 2017 was a very original movie. I have not seen a movie is this style before. The detailed camera work and special effects were pin pointed on accuracy. The sight of the spinning spitfire propeller while shooting the Nazis was miraculous. The long Dunkirk beach and the North Sea had some kind of religious aspect about it. The sea itself seems to be a monster. Also the visuals of all the sea foam on the beach caused by the crashing of the waves was like something in a Renaissance painting of Zeus, Venus and Aphrodite. As a viewer, one could almost taste the sea foam. Dunkirk was a failure for the British but in happened at the start of World War II and if all the soldiers would have been wiped out on the Dunkirk beach in 1940, there would have been no soldiers left to fight the Nazis. The British soldiers were able to fight another day; and in the end, the British and the Allied forces were able to bring down the Nazis, which probably would not have been possibly with out these specific soldiers there to help.",8,3,10,6 August 2017
The Intouchables," A movie filled with real feeling
","This movie was the best I have seen in 2013. It was so good because it was real, versus fake. Within the field of psychiatry (the act of giving medications to a seriously mentally ill individual) there is usually little room for psychotic behaviour / symptoms. For example in the film the care-giver takes a certain number of risks, that to me borders on psychotic behavior, namely, driving down highways at high speed zigzagging in and out of cars at high speed, experimenting on his patient and stealing. All of these symptoms could also be experienced as criminal through the lens of a police officer - but this movie was more then it's details. It was a movie about a connection, pure and simple. These two grown men connected with each other one way or another. It was real bond that they formed, and this bond was unconditional. No matter what the other one would do, it would be forgiven. The filmmaker could bring to the screen, a feeling that is deep and pure. That is what makes his film so special.",8,0,0,26 December 2013
Before Sunset," love, where are you?
","This movie is pretty good. I liked it more then the first one. It was more mature. Here one can see the symptoms of serious mental illness develop. The vehicle of love seems to be like a conjunction. Is that true or not? Can love provoke symptoms? Can everything of value provoke symptoms? Art, movies, love, sex, dialogues, conversations, music and theater? Is that why society sometimes condemns art forms of sorts? To prevent a movement of unpredictable thought? An artist, like a person inlove with symptoms often operates in a dream world like a Henri Rouseau painting, this state is comforting and discomforting to the individual, and this discomfort often results in chaos which is artwork. This movie shows all of these components wrapped in to one.",7,0,2,10 June 2014
Revolutionary Road," 'Revolutionary Road' Dreamworks Pictures
","'Revolutionary road' teaches us that life is not always what is seems. The title of the movie is a contradiction. It means 2 different things. A lot of time in life, things do mean 2 different things at the same time. A lot of the time, things in life are not 'this way' or 'that way', instead they can be a combination of both sides. Thats what I think this movie is about.In the movie the two lead characters came to a cross roads and needed to make a decision. Once the decision was made, things seemed to happen to them - in a very unexpected way. In a way both of the characters changed. Or did they take on each others' reciprocated personalities - like a chameleon - like a reflection in the mirror?",8,0,0,27 February 2012
Ex Machina," PG rating should have been R
","The PG rating should have been R because the content of the movie was disturbing. The content of a robot going into society after killing off the lead players is a disturbing and menacing idea which I think should be banned. The notion of a robot out thinking a human of high intelligence is scary and the idea is plausible at the same time. The two main characters of the movie had major flaws, which made each person a real human being in the romantic sense of the word. One had a sexual addiction and the other an addiction to alcohol. Both were smart with blindspots. It is at least conceiveable that a AI robot could outsmart humans. And perhaps they already are. If the film-makers can film it, and think of it, then some scientists in the world are probably already leading into this kind of technology. It is very terrifying because the robot makes little or zero mistakes and the human sometimes does, like a pilot of an aircraft. If there were robots who could fly an aircraft flawlessly always - then this could benefit our world, but on the other hand, an aircraft needs to be manned by humans because of all the decisions that need to be made in times of emergency. Could robots be the new future pilots? Are not aircraft almost all automated already? If human error in flying was eliminated would we have more safety? Or is the notion of a decision making robot entering the realm of untrue - because of inferiority of robots to humans? Does this movie break the stereotype and show that robots are superior to humans? Could this be a true statement?",8,1,7,17 May 2015
Silence," Roman Catholic to Buddhism by the crack of a whip
","Watched Silence in Capitol 6 last night in Victoria City. I think this movie is about a resistance to change, and that is why this movie, even though it is about circumstances that happened many hundreds of years ago, it still relevant in 2017. The Japanese in this movie had the power and the authority to outlaw Christianity; and they did so in a very clever way. This movie was able to capture some of the details of power - for example, the Japanese were able to use techniques which in essence was the defamation of the R. C. religion. Perhaps this was an example of how colonization through religion did not work in Japan; whereas in other countries like South America, it did work. The 2 priests that were sent from Portugal did seem to believe in the truth of R.C. - was it is debatable if they were actually out to harm the Japanese with intent (by innocent Japanese laying down their lives in the name of Christianity). I give it a 9/10 because it is about a topic that I am currently interested in - the resistance to change.",9,5,11,18 January 2017
Logan," Logan the movie is all about fighting
","The title of the movie and the main character are both called Logan. Logan is a man developed by a mad-scientist. He has switch-blades coming out of his hands which come out when he is angry. There is a character of a little girl, named Laura, who is a mini-wolverine, and in a round-a-bout way Laura is Logan's daughter. In the movie, Logan and Laura do make a family bond with each other, like robots make bonds with each other. Logan and Laura are mutants and they kill. They are the opposite of pacifists. They kill like animals in order to survive. Like a deer escaping from a lion, or a deer beating a lion in an attack. It is Darwinism. And lucky if the deer can escape a savage lion, like Logan and Laura being able to escape the mad scientists. Logan and Laura both have an instinct to live. They do not seem to have a direct mission in life, like to save other people from the unfairness in the world creating my evil or greed. I did like the reference to the comic book, with the coordinates of a safe-haven. This seemed to be a fantasy which turned out to be a reality. This component gave the film a bit more strength but otherwise the story and plot were both weak.",5,4,9,15 April 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Manual special effects
","The Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) was a movie that was full of manual special effects. Manual Special Effects are effects that have some force to them, but that are also linked to the physical nature of the Avenger fighting. This movie had a lot of features of mass destruction that seems to draw a crowd to the theater. There were more punches and fighting then dialogue, but the dialogue was witty and the component of good versus evil seems to be one that Western civilization never seems to get enough of. The robots in this movie looked like the robots in Terminator and in a sense they took on the same character. Avengers 2015 seemed to encompass all aspects of science fiction movies and then connect them into a whole story. The themes of evolution, change and chaos and order are universal themes and they coincide nicely with the way the Western World is operating in the realm of Europe, the Americas and Asia/Africa. There is a feel of colonialism which is deeply rooted in the notion of innocent versus guilty. This movie was a snapshot of tensions that each Western adult human being lives with in order to live in the civilized world ... a world where, on some days being a super hero is necessary just to get through the day in one piece.",7,4,10,1 May 2015
Les Misérables," A great movie, and interpretation of Victor Hugo's book.
","The film-maker of this film is a great visual story-teller. He used triggers to link pieces of the story together weaving everything in such a creative way as to honour Victor Hugo and at the same time remaining true to his own craft (namely making movies). For example, the future king had a gold ring. This gold ring appeared in the middle of the narrative, then again closer to the end and then at the end of the movie itself. The visual linking of the gold ring hooked most parts of the story together and weaving them together with such finesse. The story, Les Miserables by Victor Hugo is a complex one, but the movie explains it like the stories of the bible on the stain glass windows in the Middle Ages did to people when they visited the church. The one downfall in this movie is the special effects. I think I would have preferred some of the landscapes to have been authentic landscapes versus a 100 % reproduction. Other then that, all and all a very well-thought out visual experience.",7,0,1,1 January 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," The Wolf on Wall ST has one more layer than meets the eye
","The Wolf on Wall ST. is a movie about a man who survived. He started out his life as a pretty decent man, then he lost his job and with almost zero prospects, he ended up in the Penny Stocks business and from day one he was able to pull himself out of unemployment to having a constant job. The led character was labeled the Wolf. The movie was original in the sense of cinematic experience. The theme of the movie was pretty sordid - with ripping off others as the main element - but the lead character seemed to not have a clue to his defective character - and this actually made him a sympathetic character. I do not think that, for one minute, did he think that what he was doing was wrong. I believe he thought it was justified. Is this the zone of a sociopath, or just an ambitious human being - who seemed to be operating well in the cut-throat America. If he was at fault in his acting and thinking - whose fault would that be? The whole American culture? Is this not, in a way, the Jim Morrison gene? The gene of destructive- self destructive ultimately .... America - even though it often seems like a Dream - the City on the Hill - but actually America is probably the most cut-throat boom or bust country in the world in 2014 New York had 50 thousand homeless people - I believe that some of those individuals, if not all, where victims in one way or another of the boom or bust fast-paced commercial environment of America. In a way The Wolf on Wall St is like a modern day Western / Cowboy movie - only this time the protagonists and the villains seemed to have blurred roles. This movie is really a nightmare - but the way it is filmed - was mystifying and hence switched the nightmare into a kind of dream.",7,0,3,10 February 2015
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Lots of action and fighting
","This movie 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies' 2014 is a movie about groups of people that are all interconnected and through arrogance and self-righteousness many of the single armies seems to not want to join the other armies - even though it is clear they share similar interests. There is a pathos within the film, one of rivalry, negotiations and coming together. The evil forces, are like in the movie Alien, where the evil is so evil that there is no realm of sympathy with the monsters - and in this movie, like in Interstellar, all the good forces seem to prevail. This movie is a good distraction from everyday life, but there is a lot of action, special effects, army scenes and in a way it is like Inception with it's Escher-like maze building and high mountain vantage points - as well as this movie had features of The Matrix in it - like a magic character running along rocks while they were falling down dozens of meters to the ground and surviving. All round a relatively fun movie to watch.",5,2,6,21 February 2015
Arrival," Arrival is like Contact
","This movie Arrival has the feeling of Contact because both movies have a main character that is a middle aged female. In both movies there are a lot of flashbacks and memories and an interplay between now, past and future. The dark oval shaped space crafts looked like the Evil eye in Lord of the Rings, Mordor. And I thought this movie had elements of ET - like the way the base camp was set up and the plastic like uniforms the team had to wear when visiting the alien creatures. At first I thought this was a pretty original idea for a movie, but when I watched the movie further, I noticed that so many Hollywood movies had already experimented and displayed almost all of the parts of the science fiction story line and plot. Mixing in components of Close Encounters of the Third Kind and 2001: A Space Odyssey. I guess it costs the directors and film sponsors lots of money to make a movie like this, a couple of million, and the movie needs to be a success in order for it to break even financially. I can sense that Arrival stayed within the status quo of what a Hollywood audience would consider safe. It did not come up with anything evil or scary instead it stayed within the comfort-level of the general film population. What I would have liked to have seen is some brand new original ideas regarding aliens, and the idea that these aliens have a different technique of writing is not different enough in my mind. To me, it means that aliens and humans are more the same then different in their ways of thinking, communicating and processing information. A more original idea would have been something along the lines of a non-verbal but pure sensory communication. Something that could not be data analyzed within the house-hold computer.",6,1,6,11 January 2017
Wonder Woman," Sauron and Terminator
","The movie opens up in a Lord of the Rings, Elfish setting kind of a way, with beautiful women dressed in exotic gear with special designs on the outfits. One little girl is the smallest out of the bunch and the camera follows her. She is a born fighter. It turns out that Wonder Woman is Ares, the God of War. She has not been made out of clay but rather she has been implanted in this universe to sow seeds of corruption, hate and greed. Ares' adversary is a Robot Machine villain who comes alive at the end of the comic film. The Robot Machine looks like a combination of Sauron and Terminator (1984) robots. In the last couple of scene sequences, Woman Woman (2017) has Ares and the Robot Machine villain fighting each other. Ares gains strength through the Robot Machine and develops even more special powers, and in the end Ares lives and the Robot Machine parishes. Ares (Wonder Woman) is like an undercover villain that looks good on the outside by betrays citizens at the same time; and is both good and evil: much like the rest of humanity.",6,0,4,3 September 2017
Son of Saul," Son of Saul - a religious symbol of everlasting life
","The movie Son of Saul is a religious movie about a little, 11 year old boy who actually survives the blast of gas inside the gas chambers in the Second World War. He is lifted out of the corpses of naked bodies and is put on a table. A man listens and hears his breathe - in and out - inhale and exhale. This is like the breathe that God breathes into Adam in order to create man. This breathe is very significant and represents all of human life. Saul understands this meaning and wants a religious leader to mark this miracle - of surviving the holocaust ovens and breathing outside the gates of hell. Saul searches for a rabbi. It is unclear in the movie if a rabbi is found, as I do not have enough knowledge of what being a rabbi entails. Saul did find someone who I think could have been a rabbi - but the burial for the small boy who survived the gas chambers was never completed to the end. There was an attempt made but then they had to flee again. I believe that the boy transformed into a German Spy when he was left to drown - half alive in the river. The river must have awoken the boy and he went to where Saul was hiding to witness him one more time. Saul was then delusional and thought the young boy was wearing Nazi clothes and a informer - but this was the holy child not an informant. Saul was hallucinating. In the end Saul gets shot to death - but not without giving up, withdrawing and being internally defeated first.",8,0,1,2 January 2017
Flight," National Transportation safety board
","Denzel Washington plays an excellent role here. He is an alcoholic who admits he is an alcoholic and in the end he admits this. He admits he can no longer lie. One good quote is 'I betrayed the public's trust.' The scenes of the airplane turbulence are very life-like. The director also directed the movie Contact. Both have long scenes were there is no talking, more visuals, which I enjoyed.The scene of the National Transportation safety board is an excellent professional portrayal of a good investigation.",6,0,2,27 October 2017
Her," Technology has splintered the human spirit.
","This movie is about social isolation and how technology has splintered the human spirit into broken parts. Throughout the whole movie I was left feeling very uneasy and embarrassed to be sitting in a movie theatre hall surrounded by people and watching the lead character in the movie having a sexual relationship with his computer. It reminded me of peep-shows or sex-museums where individuals go to experience something they have not actually experienced themselves. The use of the computer in this movie and the interactions with humans showed the scary intimate relationship each entity has with each other. There were elements of 2001: Space Odyssey and the HAL demon computer in this movie, as how loyal is a relationship, if the entity is having a love relationship with 600 plus others? A movie is about feeling, and this movie left me with a feeling of dismay and at the same time, this non-reality reflected our Modern Day reality in a very specific way. I live in a society and a community that is absorbed by artificial connections, engineered combats and stylized realities so in a sense this movie reflects truth.",7,0,1,30 September 2014
