Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Well Done!!
","I just got to see this film yesterday in re-release.  Overall I thought it was very well done and extremely well cast.  Stand out performances by Liam Neeson, Jake Lloyd and Natalie Portman in particular.  Portman is an excellent actress and has a great deal of presence which makes her delightful to watch.  Ewan McGregor was very good in his portrayal of the young Obi Wan, and did an extraordinary job of emulating Sir Alec Guinness' style in previous performances.I can see why reviews for the film were mixed.  If you are not a fan of the Star Wars saga, I imagine that you might not see much to this film.  The special effects were excellent although they were slightly much at times. The storyline is confusing at times, and it is hard to identify with some of the characters.  The Jar Jar Binks character is definitely annoying but not as bad as I thought he would be.I think Episode One's big failure lies in its comparison to the previous three films.  No matter how good the writing and directing is, it is impossible to stack up to the Star Wars mystique that is attached to the saga.  The feeling is similar to the feeling one would get if a studio today remade a Casablanca or a Gone With the Wind.  No matter how talented the director, cast or crew would be, nothing compares to the original. Ultimately, I believe that a lot of the flack this film took was somewhat unwarranted.I concur with many others who say that Episode One's biggest achievement is that it sets up the next two films.  The viewer can see what is developing here and can understand the direction the story will take.Overall, a very well made, good looking, well acted film that is more for true fans than the general public.  There is a decent amount of well choreographed action sequences (the final light saber duel is nothing short of fantastic), and the plot keeps you interested throughout the film.  I am very interested to see what Mr. Lucas has in store for us in his next two installments.SSB - December 10, 1999 - NYC",10,8,10,10 December 1999
The Mummy," Not Bad.
","I picked this one up at Blockbuster because I needed something to fill in about two hours of my evening.  Its not that bad.  Brendan Frasier provides you with what you expect from the lead in this caliber of film, and Rachel Weisz is stunning as the heroine/love interest/damsel in distress.  Its definitely big budget with some great special effects, however, sometime the effects are a little too much.  That is, with all the computer generated effects these days, the studio spent a lot of cash to still have certain things look incredibly fake.  Not a major breaking point of the film however.  Overall, 'The Mummy' is good if your looking for a predictable story, ample action and have the desire to kill a few hours in some self indulgent fun.  I did think the film could have shed about 15 minutes or so but its bearable enough.  I also agree with other reviewers in that its nice too see a Mummy who is not lumbering after his victims at an 'overpowering' 2 miles an hour.  Not to knock the brilliance as well as screen presence of the great Mr. Karloff.

The Commitments," Have You Got Soul
","The Commitments is the story of Jimmy Rabitte's quest to assemble a 'true to its roots' soul based band comprised of working class Ireland's hungry musicians.  Despite the fact that most of his recruits aren't even familiar with soul music, he manages to come up with something quite wonderful. Director Alan Parker (Midnight Express, Mississippi Burning, Pink Floyd: The Wall) manages to do it again in this one.  The story is simple but its the dialogue and the acting that make it so great, (not to mention the soundtrack).  Parker assebled a group of unknowns (Excluding Colm Meaney as Jimmy's Elvis worshiping dad) and when he finished he had a dynamite band that also prove to be able actors as well.  The band is a diverse group of people and their escapades throughout the film are heartfelt yet laughable at times.  Standout performances go to Robert Arkins ('Brother Rabitte'), Johnny Murphy ('Joey The Lips'...and the band's spiritual guide), and Andrew Strong whose incredible voice fronts the band (its hard to believe that voice belongs to a 16 year old).  Strong is essentially a younger Joe Cocker.  The film is never boring, the music is fantasic and the cinematography and direction are excellent.  All in all 'The Commitments' is is one of those films that you can watch over and over again and not get tired of.  Its just a whole lot of fun.

The Shawshank Redemption," A Heartfelt Masterpiece
","OK, so I am a huge fan of Stephen King as well as of the cinema itself, and it took me almost 5 years to finally see The Shawshank Redemption.  I think I was one of the few people on the planet who did not see this fantastic motion picture.  Everything about this film exudes greatness, from the performances of Freeman and Robbins to the masterful screenplay, cinematography, cast and especially the direction.  I agree with most people who fume over the fact that films such as this one (perfect in every sense) rarely, if ever garner an Oscar win.  Its a shame that the big budget over - hyped (and often mediocre at best films) win all the awards while a gem like The Shawshank Redemption comes up empty.  You never grow tired of watching this film and its introspective ending is just perfect.  If you are one of the 4 remaining people who has yet to see this masterpiece, find 2 hours of quiet time and watch it.  You will thank yourself afterwards.",10,0,0,11 January 2000
