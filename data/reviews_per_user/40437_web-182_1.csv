The New World," I registered with IMDb just so I could give this a '1' rating
","The slowest movie we have ever seen. Had we not been in the middle of a crowded aisle, we would have walked out. By the time hour 2 rolled around, we wished we would have. The movie is so incredibly boring that you find yourself searching for some artistic or cinematographic angle, but you will be left wanting. I know what you're thinking...'7.5 on IMDb...that's pretty good.' Yeah, got me too. We read a review from a guy that said he would never go to the movies again because of this movie. We laughed and went to see it anyway. The worst movie I have ever seen. Period. OH! And just when you think something is about to happen with the plot (about halfway through the movie), nothing happens. Just another 'plot' starts if you can even call it that.",1,70,121,20 February 2006
