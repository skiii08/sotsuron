Requiem for a Dream," utterly devastating
","The multi-talented Darren Aronofsky follows up 1998's Pi with perhaps, the greatest film this year. The story of how searching for dreams inthe wrong places and utter horror of the drug world is nothing short of brilliant. The elder woman of the story (Ellen Burstyn) is ageing and alone. Her wish of being loved and important in someone's life is almost granted in an invitation to appear on t.v. Her attempts to crash diet for her alleged fifteen minutes go from hilarious to downright painful.
 Jared Leto appears as Burstyn's drug addicted son. His dream of starting his own business and marrying his lover (Jennifer connely) go equally awry. His 'partner' (Damon Wayans) is a small time hustler that attempts to move up in the drug world, all the time a junkie himself.Leaving the theater, I felt truly jarred. The final scenes of the film stayed with me for days. If there was any justice this film would have come away with more than just one nomination, while Gladiator basks in 10! A Requiem indeed.",10,0,0,2 March 2001
