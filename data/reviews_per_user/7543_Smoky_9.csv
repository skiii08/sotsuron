Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Slight suction
","Well, not that anyone would care for my opinion - I just have to write it anyway. There is one and only one reason to see this movie and (correct) it's the special effects. They are amazing. They are beyond anything ever seen before. They are nearly flawless (from a technical point of view) and perfectly integrated. Everything else in this movie was pretty much forgettable and some things really hurt (me at least). Among all things, this movie starts with a taxation dispute. Gone are the days of swashbuckling heroes with a loose tongue and a good sense of humor. Everything is business now, even the storyline. For the loose tongue we get wooden dialoge (which at certain points is just really, really bad and completely unbelievable) and the humor is now provided by fully animated fart jokes and one of the most annoying sidekicks I have ever seen. The force is now the effect of some microbes and can be measured by means of a blood sample and Darth Vader is virgin-born messiah who speaks to his mom as if reciting from ancient scriptures (altough I believe this point may be altered in the coming episodes). In this galaxy, I would not be too surprised to find the planet Zeist somewhere. But all of this would be unimportant if the story would run smoothly. Unfortunately it does not. The movie takes no time to introduce us into its universe, we get thrown right into it. The plot is contrived and most scenes feel packed with necessary references for the sequels and expository dialoge. Those which are not are technically excellent, but really superfluous from a story point of view. The light saber 'duels' for example are top notch action and far better than anything seen in the original trilogy, but Darth Maul is just your typical pop-up-enemy with no background and totally lacks the evil aura of the original Darth Vader. Even worse is senator Palpatine, who we know will become the evil emperor finally. There is nothing scary or sinister about him and none of his manipulative tricks is ever shown. The only scary thing is our knowledge of his eventual fate. There is a lot that I would still like to comment, but let me just mention the scene cuts. The editing left me extremely unsatisfied as I felt some scenes were cut right in the middle. This very much added to my impression, that this film is overcrowded and tries to accomplish too much in too little time.Anyhow, I gave this movie a 7, the special effects just were that good. Also the soundtrak is very well done and Neeson really saves the day, making this movie watchable regardless of its flaws",7,0,0,21 May 1999
In Bruges," What was that???
","There are not many movies I stop watching after the first half hour has passed - this was one of them. It is advertised as an intelligent comedy then we see a boy (about 10 years old) murdered by a head shot (yeah, comedy!) and the murderer, hiding in Bruges, picks up a local lady, tells her on a dinner date that he is a hired gun and starts a bar brawl with their neighbor and his girlfriend (yeah, intelligent!).i suppose no police arrived at the scene, arrested him, and compared his fingerprints to the one he left on a sheet of paper that belonged to the boy he murdered (we saw him do that in the murder scene).i'm sorry, but i really don't know why I should care for stories taking place in this parallel universe.",2,1,4,27 December 2015
Alien: Resurrection," The best one could do
","Well, this movie pretty much explores every interesting possibility left open by the first 3. The problem is however, that there are not that many left. Also there is the small issue, that Ripley died in the previous part (but in this kind of film logic is not an ingredient anyway).On the other hand, some ideas were pretty original and the half-Alien Ripley was interesting, even if it was obvious, which side she would join. Also, this film featured one of the coolest Macho-characters ever. 'What a waste of ammo - must be a chick thing.'",7,1,1,11 May 1999
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Why did they cast Swinton?
","The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe could have been a nice little (almost) family movie. The story is not brilliant but OK, there are some likable kids as heroes - although they don't do that much heroic stuff - and there is a lot of magic and special effects for eye-candy. Without thinking too much about it you could just cheer for the kids and enjoy a happy end.But then there is Tilda Swinton as the white whitch. Although she is stuck in some ridiculous wardrobe and with some borderline ridiculous dialogue, it takes about ten seconds of her mesmerizing performance to make you realize how mediocre all the rest is. When she is on screen everyone else pales in comparison and I found it near impossible to root for the heroes. In some scenes she also projects a villainy that for my taste was well beyond a PG rating. All together her presence was kind of a reality check which is not very becoming for a relatively flat fantasy story.",6,0,1,21 May 2015
Full Metal Jacket," Ain't war hell?
","Yes, indeed, war is hell. And a lot of men seem to enjoy it. Like the crazy helicopter gunman in Full metal Jacket that utters this phrase after explaining his techniques of shooting women and children. But also the other characters we meet, like Private Joker, take a keen pleasure in killing. We follow them trough their Marine boot camp, where they learn to connect their sexuality with their killing instincts, through more or less random events in the Vietnam war, where they have an alternating lifestyle between fighting and having sex either with a prostitute or on their own, into the final showdown where - at the peak of the movies irony - a woman turns out to be the most effective killer.It took me almost to decades and several viewings to vaguely understand what Kubrick is trying to say with this movie. It's of course a bitter and cynical war movie, but ultimately the real message is about the relation of men and women and how this tension so drastically shapes our world.Compared to Kubricks other war movies - Dr. Strangelove and especially Paths of glory - this one doesn't hold up quite that well. While the inevitable logic and human nature itself drive the plot forward forcefully in these other pieces, this one is more of a philosophical statement about human nature and it is very dark and cynical indeed. I would not count it among Kubricks best, but it nonetheless is a really great movie.",9,1,2,21 March 2015
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Like good frozen Pizza
","For me 'The Rise of Skywalker' tasted like frozen Pizza. Good frozen Pizza, mind you. All the ingredients are there - and well declared on the package. You essentially get a remake of most of the most iconic scenes of the previous 8 movies in the franchise with a little extra twist. But nothing more.There is no heart, no daring, no artistic vision I could discern, just a desire to tick off all the boxes the average moviegoer expects from a Star Wars film. There are actually hints of really interesting new ideas that, fully developed, could have made a great movie. But the almighty hand of some studio boss was all too obvious: you don't just do daring stuff with a multi-billion dollar investment.So the story meanders from scene to scene that all feel vaguely familiar to culminate rather predictably with an ending that gently prepares us for part 10 of the saga.But at least (minor spoiler!) the wookie finally got its medal.",6,4,8,4 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," well done!
","A lot of bad things have been said about George Lucas following the mildly annoying Star Wars Episode I. Two of them are definitely not true: That he doesn't listen to critics and that he `has lost it'.Honestly, I did not expect much from Episode II. I hoped for a state of the art display of CG which was not so obnoxious you would want to turn away. But I was pleasantly surprised already a few minutes into the film. There was a lot of CG, but not just for the fun of it. The atmosphere was dense and gloomy and as the plot unraveled, there was a real sense of danger and, almost too good to be true for the action movie it basically is, it actually started developing some depth. The force is no more an infectious disease and Jedi are finally something more than well coreographed martial artists. There was a mystical undercurrent, brilliantly displayed by Joda in two very different pivotal scenes. There is the overall sense of corruption and doom, a very well done hierarchy among the Jedi and finally a really interesting geneology of people to play a role in the original Star Wars.Also the characterization and acting was quite good overall. I even found the love story well done. It was so ridiculous and juvenile - if by accident or by design - that it provides a firm background for Anakin to be thrown onto the dark side, as it inevitably has to come.Some things could of course have been done better. Obi-Wan for example was a little too weak and uncharismatic in my opinion to make Anakins rebellion against him believable. And, if queens are elected on Naboo, do they really vote for one that is a mere 16 years old? But these are minor glitches that do not substantially undermine the general soundness of the plot and characters.On the technical side I liked the action sequences a lot. In contrast to the now usual action fare, they are not cut in the 2-second pieces that make you want to throw up after a minute. They actually allow you to follow what is going on to a large extent and, although quite frequent, they do not cut the movie into disconnected pieces. And, what is really nice, they are lacking the totally unbelievable two-people-against-a-whole-army-scenes.And finally, there is one little detail that I almost admire Lucas for: He managed to dispose of obnoxious Jar-Jar Binks in a fashion, that both his fans and opponents will approve: He is there in the movie, but he is not only told to shut up once, but, as it turns out, he is the one formally responsible for the death of the republic and the creation of the empire!Overall, I really liked this movie and even a little more. George Lucas has grown up - and that is meant as a compliment. Back in 1977 the now `Episode 4' seems to have hit the nerve of that time. For me at least it seems, that Episode 2 has done that again.",9,0,0,29 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The best in the series
","After having seen episode 9 on the big screen I just had to come back to this, the best of the Star Wars movies, to give it a massive thumbs up. Although we knew that Anakin has to turn into Darth Vader here, the drama surrounding it is breathtaking. The intensity of a scene with nothing else than a guy waiting in a room. The twisted righteousness of the Jedi, the political trickery of Palpatine and a character lost and torn apart by love, fear and conventions of society. It really is great drama and on top of it is great action. It shows how Lukas has matured and if you are honest, none of the original trilogy did even come close to this.After having seen it again I can almost forgive Lucas for having sold the soul of it to Disney. Revenge of the Sith completes a good story arch in a non-cronological manner. And if you must have a happy end, you can follow it up by watching IV, V and VI.",10,7,7,4 January 2020
The Martian," a great movie!
","Congratulations to Ridley Scott, this was a great one! I love good science fiction movies, but they are so hard to find. In most 'science fiction' the 'science' is thin at best and an excuse for special effects or some absurd action.The Martian is different and it really is a great one! When it started out with this unrealistically strong sandstorm I was ready to bury my hopes, but then it got better and better by the minute. there was one more inaccuracy that was initially a bit off-putting - the non-martian gravity, but apart from that the science was sound. And better yet, it was the core of the action. Getting stranded on a distant planet is challenging :-) and the challenges in the movie felt like they were the real thing. How to survive? How to get food? How to take off? How to reach earth? All these are tricky to figure out and it is a blast to watch a bunch of smart, friendly and cooperating people figure them out - always with that smirk that old-timers know from the heroes of the Apollo days. Yes, they've got the right stuff and they need plenty of it to 'bring him home'.Apart from this technical side, there is something even more wonderful about this movie. Through the extremely intelligent choice of (sometimes very bad) music and little hints here and there it has a curious 'retro' feeling. It almost makes you feel like this is an alternative reality, playing out sometime in the last decade of the previous century, in a world where after the moon landings we did not stop but just made the logical next move to go to mars. And somehow this feels so right and so upbeat, it is a joy to watch.In any case, the Martian is a joy to watch from beginning to end. After all, whan did you last see a movie that let kept you excited with the intricacies of celestial mechanics?",9,0,1,15 June 2018
