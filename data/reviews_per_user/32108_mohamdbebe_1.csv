Hereditary," Nonsense, Disappointment, over-rated.
","Lets be honest, The only good thing in that movie was the acting.
things are so complicated and twisted, you will not be able to realize what is going on in the scenario. some non-explainable shocking scenes pops up every 10 mins.
THE STORY IT SELF IS BORING. THE STORY IS A COMPLETE PURE MESS.
I do not recommend anyone to waste 2 hours of his life on that movie I am so very frustrated right now because I just did waste 2 hours of my life on this movie !!!!.
I donnu what to say except that this was a very big disappointment for me !
NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL !!!!!",1,2,4,20 April 2020
