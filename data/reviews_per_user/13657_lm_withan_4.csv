Requiem for a Dream," Back to reality
","After watching 'The day after tomorrow' and 'Spider man', this movie was like a punch in the face.Reality. That's what this movie is all about.Summary: In two or three short sentences, this movie is about the Goldfarbs (Leto and Burstyn) and two friends of the son (Wayans and Connelly). All of them have a story, all of them has a problem (anorexia, prostitution, drugs, prison...) and... A DREAM. The goal is to get to that goal, whatever the consequences are... In the end... well... you'll see!In my opinion, this is a must-see movie. Not only is the story truly interesting, the actors are great and the music is absolutely fantastic (if you've seen 'Lord of the rings, The two Towers' and the most recent 'Zathura', those movies have the same kind of soundtrack).Personally, I started to cry after seeing that movie... Why? I have no clue... Probably just because it's real.",10,0,1,5 December 2005
The Notebook," Quite the 'chick movie' but yet just GREAT
","You haven't seen the Notebook yet? Go rent it... If you're a woman or if you're going to watch it with a woman! Quite sentimental, Notebook is all about love and emotions... So don't forget the Kleenex! You're not sure if you should rent it? Here's what the story is all about... then, I'm pretty sure you'll go at your video club! It's the story about an eternal love that illness teared apart. Allie (McAdams & Calhoun) and Noah (Gosling & Garner) are two people coming from different social status. Situation is simple: an old woman is suffering from Alzeihmer and an old man tells her a beautiful story about two young people. The story is beautiful, about an impossible love between two people from different social status.Even if the end is predictable, the actors are wonderful, the story is really touching and full of emotions.If you like Ryan Gosling or Rachel McAdams, you'll simply love this movie.",10,0,1,19 May 2006
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Repeat...
","Out of 10, this movie is worth a big 5.5... Just AVERAGE! Not a great movie, not a bad one either. The thing that annoyed me the most is that it's totally predictable because they do the same thing all over again during the entire movie.Summary: Mr. and Mrs. Smith met 'just like that' in another Country while they were both on mission. They 'do it' and next thing you know, not only are they married, it's been 5 or 6 years since they're husband and wife... BUT, even after all these years, they still don't have a clue about the occupation of the others! And all of a sudden, they are on the same mission, recognize each other, try to kill each other, make out, form a team and end up being a couple of heroes!Even if this movie brings nothing new to cinema, it's full of action and the actors do a great job. Plus, they're both hot! :)If you haven't seen this movie, you're lucky, you won't have to pay 10bucks to see it on a big screen! Rent it. If you like action, you won't love it, but you'll like it!",5,3,7,5 December 2005
The Island," Born to be...
","YOU ARE A LUCKY WINNER! YOU'LL HAVE THE ULTIMATE CHANCE TO POPULATE THE ISLAND...What if, all your life, you only had one goal? And what if, all of a sudden, you'd discover you're goal is in reality death? The Island is probably one of the nicest movie of his kind.First of all, the actors: Scarlett Johansson and Ewan McGregor... No big big names but big big talent. They are not good, they are great, they make you believe.Secondly, the story: it's all about a philosophy of life. You know when you're little and try to imagine what life would be if (...)? Well, that's what The Island is all about: some sort of theory of life.Finally, the actions: fully loaded would be the two words to describe this movie. The action is everywhere, all the time, even when you don't expect it.The only thing I personally disliked about The Island is the time... After 2 hours, it could be the end, but it's not... Maybe the whole thing could have been cut up a bit.",9,0,1,9 December 2005
