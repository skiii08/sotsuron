National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Rather Disappointing
","Having seen the first movie, I couldn't wait to see this follow-up. What followed was sadly nowhere near as good as the first...it's certainly easy to watch without too much effort but the storyline is not only obvious but feels rushed and at points, so ridiculous it spoils the feel of the movie. The similarities between certain scenes in the first movie and this one was also a bit too much, leaving this feeling like a bad copy with very little effort having gone into it. Helen Mirren was a good addition - shame we couldn't have seen more of her in the movie, she may have rescued some of the typically over dramatic, American scenes and brought a well needed sense of British dry humour into it! An easy film to watch but nothing to get excited over.",5,3,5,5 May 2008
