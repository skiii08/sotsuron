Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It just keeps getting better and better
","The first time I saw Phantom Menace was the first releaseday. I had gone to visit my brother, who is also an avid StarWars fan, and we were psyched to see it together. As wediscussed it afterwards, my first rating was a 7-8. Thefollowing Saturday, we went to see it with another brotherwho came to visit also, and my rating went up to an 8-9. I'veseen it 6 times in all now, and all I can say is that it justgets better and better for me all the time. If you've seen itonce, watch it again, you'll appreciate it more. If you haven'tseen it, don't judge it off of your first viewing, remember,this was the most highly anticipated film OF ALL TIME andpeople just didn't give it the break or chance that itdeserves.",10,0,1,28 March 2000
Fight Club," This is one amazing film
","I have been told repeatedly to watch this film by several people, andfinally got around to it this last weekend. One word- AMAZING. I had theluxury of watching it in a home theater system with a very goodsurround sound setup, but I can tell it will still be incredible in anyenvironment because of the absolute depth of the acting and story. Ibelieve that there have been several good overviews of the story, sowill not delve into that, I will merely state that after watching it twice, I'm desparate to own the DVD, and I don't even have a player yet! Watchthis movie!",10,0,1,17 July 2000
Being John Malkovich," Wow- what an original!
","I couldn't wait to see this movie ever since the first time I saw the trailer- which I believe to be one of the best trailers ever. The screenplay is singular in it's presentation of a concept that to most extents would seem absurd- the ability to be within another persons head, and the reactions and events that spring from such a situation. If you want to enjoy a movie that has given a new direction to originality in screenwriting, go see this. I don't want to say anymore, as I'm afraid of spoiling any of the sheer joy of watching this film for anyone.",10,0,1,9 November 1999
