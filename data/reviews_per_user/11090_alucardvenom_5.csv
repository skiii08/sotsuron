The Incredible Hulk," Marvel finally cares about it's product...
","After few dreadful movies based on Marvel comics, I went to this movie with low expectations, but I was wrong. It was great, fast-paced, highly entertaining experience. I'll be short on this write, because this is highly recommended for those who are not familiar with HULK comics, and must see for fans.Even if I had low expectations about this, there was some spark of hope when I've seen that Edward Norton was cast as Dr. Banner, and he was terrific. He never disappoints me as an actor, and this was no exception. Tim Roth was awesome as always and climax fight between Hulk and Abomination was fantastic. Great CGI and action sequences which last for about 20 minutes were more then enough for me... Ending was also well done and 'opens the gate' for many more elements from the comics. I wonder what we will get in the sequel.It seems that Marvel finally understood that their movies were terrible, so decided to take more serious approach to their movies since IRON MAN was also great (in my opinion better then Hulk) and this gives me hope that upcoming movies will be also great, and possibly we will get more serious reboot of some other awesome heroes like Daredevil, Ghost Rider and Fantastic Four (which was entertaining, but bad. Sue and Reed were total miscast, and Dr. Doom was just horrible. I can't believe they turned one of the best comic book villains (and characters!) into joke)",7,1,1,28 December 2009
Hereditary," I am worried about the state of horror...
","As a long time horror fan I am worried about the state of horror if 'Hereditary' is considered to be 'one of the best horror movies in XZY decades'.I am not too hard to please when it comes to horror movies, I enjoy bad horror movies equally as great ones, and when I finally got a chance to see Hereditary I went to see it with an open mind.Movie started well with some really nice scene transition so I had my hopes up. 'These people know what they are doing' I thought to myself. Turns out, while production looked really nice, with few well directed scenes, screenplay and pace were horrible. We are treated with family drama for about 3/4 of the movie with last half an hour being mash of horror scenes. This could work if pace was better and we didn't have to watch long monologues by a lead actress. She did her part well and she literally carries the entire movie, but after second 10 minutes long monologue where I see nothing but her face, my tolerance for her and her character has dropped significantly. Once the horror actually starts, it does get from bad to worse, but as someone who has watched dozens of horror movies I could easily spot 'homages' (or if you want to call them ripoffs) of scenes from plenty of other horror movies, mainly Conjuring, Exorcist 3 and The Sentinel. Ending is really messy and looks like it was made on spot. It wants to be intelligent, but once you break down the scene you'll realize that someone watched The Conjuring on Monday, Exorcist 3 on Thursday, and watched The Sentinel on Wednesday.Another problem is pace. Some scenes just drag on and on without real reason. I understand that director wanted to establish some atmosphere, however he isn't good at staging suspense so lot of scenes just drag on. Add in that some of those scenes don't really have strong payoff and you get long badly paced scenes with no real plot progression. Some characters just show up and wonder off the movie. I nearly forgot that one such character is even in the movie until he showed up to be cannon fodder. It was supposed to be emotional and horrifying but since we know so little about him it becomes a bad joke. I really don't know how anyone could by into hype. Did bunch of people just said 'It's great!' without even seeing it, or bars for horror are so low these days that we consider cinematic mess like Hereditary and Insidious to be called 'greatest of XYZ'?",3,120,243,16 August 2018
The Babadook," Excellent debut
","I really like Australian movies, especially their horror and exploitation movies, so when this was announced I was exited because I liked the basic idea and trailer was interesting... and it didn't disappoint.Made on tight budget, 'The Babadook' looks lot more expensive then it actually is. It takes for about 30 minutes for a movie to finally start, and once things get going, the atmosphere and mood turns more and more tense. There are several scenes that are well made and quite effective, like 'book reading' when book itself more or less explains to the audiences (or to it's main hero) what is going to happen. It's just a well made scene with really good sense of plotting. We as the audience know far more in advance what could happen to our two lead characters, which only adds to sense of dread and unease, because we know some of those things will eventually come on screen.Other note is that 'Badabook' is quite simple in it's plot. There are no dozens of unnecessary twist that only end up ruining the movie. It is what it is and only ends up building upon it's basic premise. That doesn't mean that movie doesn't add some additional elements to it's story, but it keeps it simple in it's core.While well directed, movie was perfectly aware of it's budget limitations, so there are no glossy effects, which only work well for the movie. It should also be noted that movie, while lacking in effects, is backup by really strong acting by Essie Davis.",8,7,16,1 November 2014
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Transformers 2: Revenge of the Michael Bay
","OK, I finally have to sit through this movie... What can I say beside two and half hours of my life wasted? What is wrong with this movie? Oh where do I start? First of all there is no real plot here. They go for one way, then turn it upside-down to another subplot. Some things that seem like a plot element are never mentioned again. One of the examples is that Matrix Cube part (or whatever it's called) where Desepticons search for it. After that, it's never heard or seen again.Movie is filled with funny lines and humor. Wait, WHAT HUMOR? Every thing that happens on screen has to be fallowed by one lazy one-liner. Bay, it just doesn't work. It's terrible and it just kills the scene. Now, you will think that man of Michael Bay's age would finally grow up and stop inserting FART JOKES in the scrip. Yeah, you've heard me right, we had to see two robots FART. Now, isn't that funny? Was that sarcasm coming from my mouth? I don't know. There are lot of more stupid scenes like that during the whole movie. One of them is at very end. You'll know it when you see it.Now... Since Terminator 4 was coming out, Michael Bay thought it would be interesting to put one Terminator in his movie. No joke, there is one and it's not Kristinna Loken. Few more random Gremlin robots are also presented.Then along the way came the acting... Megan Fox? Shia LaBeouf? Who you are kidding? Megan Fox has one of her emotional moments at the end that would even make Jean Claude Van Damme embarrassed. There should be subtitle 'Megan Fox is so emotional right now' so you can actually see it's emotional scene. Funny thing is that she complained how Bay movies are all about FX and Action... Well Megan, if we were watching long scene where you have dialog with Shia, it would be equal to watching two Bonsai Tree talking. Enough Megan, just please shut up.Visuals are well done but that's the only thing that's good about this movie. Of course, it's Michael Bay movie and everything is filled with light effects, explosions in every damn scene and shaky cam and you can't see what happens on the screen most of the time, but it's still a good movie, right? Sarcasm again? No? And why every robot, Desepticon or Autobot in this movie is gray? (except Prime and BB?). They look like Matrix robot rejects or like someone made them in their back junkyard.There's no plot, no character development, you just don't care who lives or dies, even if it's a main character, just bad corny one-liners and fart jokes.4 out of 10 just because movie production is well done, visuals are good. CGI robots were best actors in the movie anyway.",4,0,4,16 October 2009
The Purge," good direction, mediocre screenplay.
","I wasn't looking to check out 'The Purge' in hurry, but it naturally came out to my list. It's not bad as I thought it would be, but it still wasn't that good. It's well directed, had some rather descent moments with some fine angles, but screenplay was mediocre at best.Right from the start I had a trouble with basic idea of the movie: once per year, for 12 hours all crime in America is legal. Sounds good? Well, not that much. Right from the minute one, if you just think little about it, it doesn't make much sense. Just ask yourself a question? What all those neighbors do for the rest of the year, and how will one family act to another knowing that their neighbors just killed someone last night?In the hour before the Purge (around first 20 minutes), characters seem very relaxed. It doesn't make much sense, even if we are to believe they are used to 'happening' of the Purge event. They walk around their house, fix flowers, greet each other with cookies!? Shouldn't they be scared and locked down at least few hours before the Purge start? The whole concept is hilarious. Minute before and after the 'Purge time' crime is illegal, yet minuter after that, crime is legal? I must ask, what would happen if one person tried to murder his neighbor at 6:59am, yet the actual death happen at 7:01am. Would that be counted as crime? It's nitpicking, I know, but I couldn't resist. It's like a philosophical arrow.Another hilariously bad thought in the screenplay was 'weapon class'. It's mentioned in just one scene, then completely forgotten. Basically, all weapons up to class 4 are allowed during the Purge (they are legal), but all weapon class above are illegal? What exactly does fit into does classes? So, killing your neighbor with shotgun during the Purge is legal, with it's not with, dunno, flamethrower? There's a hilarious line that say if class above level 4 is used during the Purge, state will react. How? They will send police? What the hell?Kids are obviously allowed to watch TV news with footage of violence, murder, rapes and massacre. That's OK I guess in this movie's universe. At least, MPAA doesn't exist anymore and kids are allowed to watch rated R movies. The scene with the boyfriend was predictable (or I was just lucky in predicting it) and ending is not well thought and becomes ridiculous. Story gets going once the kid of the Ethan Hawke's family lets the stranger running from the Purge gang in their home. I didn't have that much problem with that scene, because it was a simple plot device and gives explanation why the villains want to target EH's house instead of dozen others.Movie has some positive sides to it: It's well directed, had some moments of suspense and some directional moments are well thought. Director knows how to set camera properly for this kind of a movie and knows when and how to use the music (soundtrack itself was not memorable). Some scenes reminded me of 'Assault on Precinct 13' (or Night of the Living Dead) with nameless villains trying to get into fortified building (here, home) while leads try to fend them off. Acton scenes are also well directed, they were tightly edited but you could see what's going on. Well paced.Villains don't have much of a personality except the Leader, who is OK for the most part. He's bit creepy at first (I really liked the actor who played him and didn't mind his hilarious haircut) but there are few moments where he becomes cartoon character, mostly because of some silly lines he had to deliver. (tip: using Thee never makes your character sound creepy, just silly).Rest of the actors were fine. Kid was bit off, but I am not sure if he was suppose to be that stiff as a character or actor is just horrible, because I don't remember seeing that kid (actor) in any other movie. Ethan Hawke is little unbelievable in scene where he has to give some exposition about the Purge and you can almost sense he is trying hard not to laugh (it was a very silly line). Daughter was OK and the actress is pretty. Lena Headey was her usual self (also, hot as usual).Overall, like I said, mediocre screenplay that wasted director's solid skills. It's well paced, so if you can close your eyes on some of the stupid moments in the movie, you won't have a problem with this movie. You should just rent it when it comes on DVD, don' waste money on buying it, because you'll probably want to watch this one just once.",5,0,0,30 September 2013
