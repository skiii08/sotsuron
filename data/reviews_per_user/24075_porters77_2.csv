Walk the Line," See it
","Go see this movie.Even if you don't know anything at all about The Man In Black or June Carter Cash.I was born in 1970, and by that time, Cash was already a legend. Being born in '70, Cash wasn't exactly my cup of tea. It's only since I've gotten older that I've expanded my musical tastes to include many things I used to scoff at.Phoenix is unbelievable as Cash. He's got his mannerisms down cold. As I watched him play the guitar, held up high with his strumming hand way back on the strings, it brought back memories of seeing the real Cash on TV when I was a young boy.Whitherspoon was also amazing. I'm sure her Nashville bloodline helped out, but, she perfects her performance every bit as well as Phoenix's Cash.I did think that Witherspoon sounded just a tad bit like Sandy The Squirrel on the Spongebob Squarepants cartoon. But, then again, so did June Carter Cash. Southern through and through.Like 'Ray', being a period piece, Walk The Line really is convincing in portraying the 50's and 60's.I loved the scenes where the Sun Recording artists are all riding around in cars to their next show. Can you imagine todays over-bloated egomaniacal musicians traveling to their next gig together in a sedan?Another performance I really enjoyed was Shooter Jennings portrayal of his father. I thought the Jerry Lee Lewis character was funny as well. The whole bit about 'God said 'don't touch!'' was great.This movie is worthy of its praises. I can't imagine it getting beat out at Oscar time.I also liked that it was a fairly clean movie. My 13 year old son went to see it; actually ASKED to go see it, and I wasn't embarrassed to sit there with him and watch.The movie touched on some pretty serious issues; drug abuse, infidelity, etc., and did so more or less cleanly. That is a welcome change in todays films. The movie is plenty strong enough on its own, so it didn't need any 'shock value' or explosions, blood and guts, etc.The only thing I would like to have seen was more of an expanded role by the other Sun artists on tour. But, the movie was long already, I suppose.I was already a fan of Phoenix, from his roles in movies like 'Signs' and others. I like Witherspoon as well, but this performance really shows that she can truly act, and is simply not just a 'star'. She's quite the actress.Go see this movie. It's one of the best films I've seen in a long, long time. It's right up there with Ray in my book.",10,0,2,1 December 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," This Chocolate Tastes Bad
","Horrible. I saw this movie last night and I really hated it. I wasn't hoping for an exact remake of the great original, and, with Burton directing, I wasn't disappointed in that regard.I suppose, for me, it was just a bad marriage of director and movie. It could have been good in another directors hands. But Burton makes ...his own style, I guess you could say. He's made some movies I have really liked: Edward Scissorhands, for example. This, his latest effort, just falls flat for me.Depp is creepy as Willy Wonka, and that's not really what I wanted. I could never get into the character at all.If this version of Willy Wonka had been the original, trust me it would not have became a beloved classic.There is simply no way that this movie will be remembered thirty plus years from now as the original one is today.",2,5,11,7 August 2005
