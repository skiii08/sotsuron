Minority Report," A good film to watch
",A very enjoyable film with some excellent performances in particular from Tom Cruise who was more than believable and Max Von Sydow who was excellent as the old man with the plan. Special effects were good but didn't over shadow the rest of the film. Definitely one worth watching.,8,0,0,30 August 2002
Event Horizon," Utter rubbish
",This is without doubt one of the worst films I have ever seen. I cannot remember checking my watch quite so often during a film. The only redeeming feature was some nice effects. As for anything else....what a waste of time. I really didn't care about what happened to any of the characters and was overjoyed when it ended. The only reason I didn't leave before the end was curiosity to see if it could get any worse.Miss this one!,1,11,23,1 June 2000
The Sixth Sense," Excellent film, well made, well paced superbly acted
","A different film in many ways but one of the most entertaining I have seen for years. No fancy computer graphics or complicated stunts, just a good story well acted. The atmosphere created by the film is also excellent. All of the characters are believable and Bruce Willis and particularly Haley Joel Osment are excellent. The plot is all there at the end. The clues and set pieces are superbly worked to the final revelation. This is definitely a film to see on the big screen.",9,0,0,19 November 1999
