Black Swan," overrated pretentious garbage
","this film has been so raved about recently recently that when the offer came up to see it how could i refuse? i should have anyway because this is an extremely simplistic and straightforward. nothing about it seems subtle, everything is so blatantly obvious, nothing is played down. for example when she gets the plot of swan lake explained to her its extremely obvious that she is going to die in the end, i predicted from that moment. the way she turns into a psychopath just seems to happen, i cant really see any sort of gradual change to her new character. also i don't quite know what was up with the camera work, it constantly shook about, i don't know why and the camera filter choice just made the film look like crap.everything just seems to the directors way of saying 'i am far superior to all of you' and ended up just being boring. ignore what others say, this film was awful.",5,10,17,30 January 2011
Alien 3," well, i enjoyed it.
","this is one of those films everyone seems to hate like terminator 3 and Indiana Jones 4 (both films i enjoy, i don't love them but i still liked watching them) and it seems to be because of the outrageous expectations people have of them. i mean with the previous films being pure genius, aliens is on of the best films i have ever seen, they seem to dismiss any film that doesn't match up to it.First off the characters weren't bad, they weren't anything special but they worked well, i could sympathise with them at times and hate them as well, i also like the idea of Ripley once again being out of place as she was in Aliens and her getting to prove herself.I thought the film looked slick and was very dark in terms of appearance and feel, its easy to tell its a David Fincher film, who is one of my favourite directors. However the film wasn't all perfect because if it was, i would have give it higher than a seven.i thought that Ripley's reaction to seeing Newt dead could have been more shocking because she didn't seem very emotionally disturbed by it, and Hicks' death went nearly unnoticed, i'm not against killing Hicks because even though i liked his character i felt that it ultimately made everything harder on Ripley adding to the suspense because if Hicks was there then they would have killed the alien easier and ultimately would have felt like a let down.All in all, its not the best of the franchise and made for a good finale, unfortunately resurrection came along, which wasn't terrible, but wasn't good either.",7,1,1,28 May 2011
