Deja Vu," I saw Minority Report
","Even though Denzil Washinton is a great actor - and gives another stellar performance in this new one- this movie is lacks creativity. Despite the innovative sci-fi themes which are pursued, they are not new and are merely twists on old ploys and themes from the sci-fi genre.Without a doubt,this movie ECHOs of the recent PK Dick written 'Minority Report' (Tom Cruise/Steven Spielberg) synthesized into one movie with Denzil's own previous 'Man on Fire'. While Denzil, Val Kilmer, and the other actors shine as performers, there is little doubt that this effort is merely a high action drama intended to generate revenue rather than to dazzle viewers in artistic effort.This movie is nice cheap entertainment intended to capture the holiday crowd in the malls, and is definitely not intended to be an award winner!!",6,2,4,25 November 2006
The Fountain," Well, it is certainly different!!!!!
","Firstly, I am a huge sci-fi fan. Having read the early rave reviews of others posting here at IMDb before seeing 'The Fountain' I was expecting something a little better. Granted to those previous reviewers who warned that there are definitely spatial displacements in the time line of this story, the film is substantially over before a viewer can understand the esoteric opening introductory clips which are united with the closure. Rather than concentrate on cosmic special effects, the filmmakers should have attempted to produce a film with better clarity to the story line. This is particularly true of the first half of the movie and references to specifics of the history of catholicism.",6,3,6,24 November 2006
