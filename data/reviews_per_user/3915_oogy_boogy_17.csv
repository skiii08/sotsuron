"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Wow
","I saw this movie and couldn't do anything but laugh! I thought that it was SO FUNNY! I must admit, 'Adam' was also a major attraction if u get me.... Wow, what a body..Well enough of that! LOL I thought that this movie has been one of the better things that i've seen come out of Australia in a while, i liked 'muriels wedding' but to be honest, i didn't really identifie with a fat girl and a love of  Abba :( Sad, but true. But Priscilla on the other hand... Now that was something that made me laugh! I'm not a drag queen but it was something that i would watch and do nothing but giggle at. The characters were well written and there are some true scenes in it, e.g. the 'queer bashing' :( I just wish all queers could stand up for themselves as well as 'Ralph' did! I thought however, that there was some bits where i was like 'Oh, My GOD!!!!' This movie is outrageous and fun, it makes me laugh and i heard the 'Bisto song' at the end. (if your from England you should know what i'm talking about, and if not SORRY!) But this movie was funny, outrageous and something that made me laugh, now if only i could watch it sober.... LOL!",7,3,6,9 November 2001
Se7en," Oh dear...
","Quite sick this movie was, i couldn't watch most of it, i spent quite a bit of my time hiding behind a pillow and when i saw/heard of the things that the killer had done... Well, lets put it this way, i was kinda SICKENED!This was a mystery to me this movie, i couldn't understand it for the life of me, and not thru lack of trying, i don't like movies where there is just too much killing and not enuff reason, it just seems like a waste to me :(
I didn't enjoy this dispite the great performances by Morgan Freeman and also Brad Pitt, i just didn't like the whole story but i can't fault the characters in the story, they played their part v. well, if this wasn't just so sick then i'm sure that i would have enjoyed this movie abit more, but as it stands, i won't be watching this movie again as i personally would rather go top myself :(",Null,0,1,13 December 2001
Underworld," For what it's worth, not bad.
","Personally, i thought this movie could have been much better, as do the majority of people who commented here, but basically, for what it's worth it was a good action flick.I had some plot troubles.*Here be spoliers*Such as why didn't the wolves use the UV bullets more often? You never see them get used, only see them put into the guns.  Also, the vampires themselves reminded me of decandant children who's parents are away for the weekend and they're throwing a goth party... Gee, that's a sight to inspire terror.The acting of the hero(?) Was good, and i'm not talking about Selene, i'm talking about Micheal, i think this was his first movie? But it was good, and in regards to the main comment about this movie, LICHEN are moss, and Lychan are not.  Put's the movie in a completely wrong state of mind for people who going to see this.If you're going to see this movie, then don't expect lots of deep introspective scenes, accept it for what it is.  A hollywoods director chance to make money by cashing in on the Matrix and Blade, after all, this movie is little more than a mixture of them both surely.There were a few problems in the beginning, i firstly thought 'Bland bland bland'  and then started to like it.  I loved the wolves, thought they were interesting, and the directors even tried to make the vampires more human by *only* drinking Animal blood, but then again, guess that didn't work in the case of Selene's family huh? I'm guessing with all the effects from the wolves the directors didn't have much money left over to change the vampires! But it was a good change, they at least got the teeth right...But in general, i liked the story. It could have been SOOOO much better, but it was a good story line i think, secondly, i think the acting, while slightly over done in several cases *coughVICTORcough* it was good.  The main characters were good and convinced me that they earned their salary, considering the story they had to deal with they should off.  And finally, all that science stuff, call me a skeptic but tracing a pure family line from over 1400 YEARS ago?  Slightly hard.But i enjoyed it, would recommend it to those kids who have goth inspirations, and more importantly, would tell them not to expect the matrix with fangs, or blade with bullet time.  It tries to be one or the other, but it doesn't quite meet it...I liked it, shame that's as far as my emotions strech for it.  Would be interesting to see how Underworld2 comes out and Micheal fully in his power...",Null,0,0,24 October 2003
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," I wonder....
","This movie from the get go was designed to offend some people and make most people scream in horror, and as a result it is now on of the better movies ever made! This movie was fun slick and also aims for the jugular every time that you watch it, i couldn't believe what was happening in alot of it, it was just so mind boggling and esp if you've watched the series you'll understand why sometimes this can be a lil' bit too shocking!
If you don't like the series, or you just are a 'moral person' (yeh right!) then i don't recommend that you watch this at all, it is desiged for those who are already sucked into the bowels of toliet humour and outrageous gay performers *shudder*A word of advice, leave all scruples and morales behind when watching this movie...",Null,0,0,11 December 2001
Spice World," 'they don't just sing...'
","But what else do they bloody do then! They sure as hell can't act!This movie was just plain badddddddddd and it also helped alot to people getting just plain sick of them, i don't really understand how the people in charge thought that this would be a good idea, i thought it was awful in everyshape and form :(The only character that i would say was good in this and managed to act without looking like the children of a high school drama act was victoria, that girl could at least act better than the rest! (Which believe me, isn't saying very much!)I didn't like this movie becoz i thought it was silly and just plain rubbish, however if u like the spice girls you will love it, but i don't and therefore i thought it was trash! Ahh well...NEXT! please!",Null,1,2,9 December 2001
Alien," Pure and simple
","I'm not trying to rip of hear'say and their song but i'm gonna say with the only exception of Aliens and Alien3 this movie was fantastic and one of the few movies that i can watch again and again, the fact that there is so little info on the alien and also the very physical apparence of the alien makes u want to squirm, this movie was made incredibly well done.The acting in this movie was second to none and also Ripley was incredible, i can see where she got the personna of being a 'tough bitch' because in this movie it is incredible the way she acts and also the way that she is portrayed, i would watch this again and again if only it wasn't so slow moving, i admit that it works very well for building up tension in the right mood, but if ur not in the right mood it just puts u 2 sleep :(I won't critcise this movie because it is/was a master piece and it still is very good. This movie is something that will go down in the annuals of history as a very good movie, something to watch and feel very scared by.",8,0,1,22 November 2001
Pitch Black," Not bad..
","This movie wasn't really that bad at all, i've seen worse and it had its good points such as a REALLY buff/good looking guy in it (Vin Diesel) and secondly it had my fav sci-fi female in it Claudia Black.This movie was good, but to be honest at times i thought 'WILL YOU JUST EAT THEM ALREADY!!' Some of the characters in this movie like (regretfully) Claudia Black were just shallow characters with no real depth (or at least as much as u can pack into around an hour and a half!) Some characters like Vin Diesel were awesome simply because they were the main characters, but the rest of the actors pailed in comparsion to his better acting skills. (and pay check probably)The story line is a bit drab and boring at times, but it does manage to surprise you and there are some class scenes in this movie, just as there is some boring parts, i liked the graphics in it, like the eclipse part? WOW! But no matter how much u like the special effects, a movie with wooden characters and no real good story line is still something that will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth..",Null,0,0,1 December 2001
Aliens," Wozar
","Possibly the best Alien movie ever, better than the other two (or three even!) I personally would LOVE to see what could happen if this could be remade etc... but then again, that isn't gonna happen now is it :(This movie is very kewl, it has everything which speaks of a great movie, its fast in some places and has a good ending, tho i don't understand just HOW the creature got up there in the first bit! (alien3 thingy!)Ahh well, this movie is kewl and one of the better movies that i've ever seen, now i just hope that one day it could be remade.",10,0,0,5 December 2001
Man on the Moon," Umm, ok?
","I saw this movie with my friend and he told me that what i should have really done was watch some of the eariler stuff and try to get a basic understanding of him, i didn't do this and it was a BIG mistake.The movie is little more than an autobiography in my opinion of a crazy man with a split personality, i didn't understand most of the jokes and if anything, i think that you have to be a big fan of this guy in order to understand most of whats happening on screen.I won't disgrace this movie by calling it bad, but at the same time i really couldn't say that i would recommend this to anyone who asked without reservations becoz u have to know something about the films 'before' plot. This movie for those who know what its about will be quite good, but in my opinion, steer well clear away if u have NO IDEA of who this guy is!",3,2,3,17 November 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Been said once before...
","But this is one of the best movies ever made, the actors in this movie were incredible, the fight scenes were surreal and at the same time they don't look like something out of a cheap 70's reject movie that even the creators laff at!This movie has style grace and elegence, it is one of the best movies that i've ever seen and i've seen it quite a few times let me tell you now!Watch this movie and forget about the fact that its in subtitles, just enjoy it and let the past, wash over you. Or if you don't like that then dig the girls and the fat fight squences, for me this movie was perfect in just about every detail.",10,0,0,10 December 2001
Moulin Rouge!," 'The greatest thing you'll ever learn, is just to love, and be loved, in return'
","I really can't say anything bad about this movie, the acting was fantasitc, the screen play was fantastic this movie was just plain FANTASTIC!!!!I went to see this on the opening night on my cinema and then i went back a few weeks later to see it again and now i've seen it something like 5 times! This movie is just one of those great love stories which to be honest u just can't hate and even worse you can't help but identifie with, i loved this movie and if you haven't seen it yet then i believe that you should and soon, you will not be dissapointed.",Null,0,1,21 November 2001
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Ahhh, jack 0=]
","I personally loved this movie :) Even tho as mentioned it does tend towards the shallow side, it did have alot going for it, for me Halloween is one of the more favourite holidays! When else can u dress up and try to look as ugly as possible and then get candy for doing so? ;) Ahh, thats a good holiday!Well, now back to the movie. I thought that it was really good. I haven't seen something like this for a while and as a result it was a treat to see it 0=] The sheer amount of work that went into this movie shows by the fluid animation, altho at times it isn't the best it is far supeior to anything that i've seen before. Jack himself looks excellent and i love the songs in the movie!There are some faults, like the lack of character diversity within the film, there ARE only 15 main puppets, but that was mainly due to the limit of man power and money, i think its already been mentioned here that Jack had around 600 different and individual heads!? Wow! And now just think about what would have happened if they had had to do that on a factor of 60, just like any other normal movie? That would have been madness :(The movie is one of my favourite movies i have no doubt, it had everything that i like in a movie, a few freaks and a love story and also someone trying to break out of their boundries which they feel are constricting them, go see it and try to forget about all the bad things which can be apparent, listen to the story and what is happening, i think you'll be surpised about how deep this movie is!",Null,0,1,7 November 2001
"Girl, Interrupted"," V. Good, V. Disturbing
","This was a VERY good movie! I thought that the actresses in this were fantastic and i esp like the two main stars, like Wyonna Rider, were brilliant.This movie has depth and is very disturbing, don't expect to watch this and come away with a smile on your face and a happy thought in your heart, i came away with a new found feeling of my own nerouses!What made this movie in worse in my opinion was that it was supposed to be based on a real life thingy so the fact that this happens to people doesn't make me feel more secure, it also has made me resolve to be more nice to my parents! Watch this and just be prepared for the outcome...",Null,1,1,13 December 2001
The Mummy Returns," You don't expect me to take this movie serouisly!
","Ok, this movie wasn't *that* bad, but it was close, how about i make a list of what i thought was really *that* bad...<ul><li>The acting, - The fight scenes, - The fight scenes, - The acting, - Plot loopholes, - The acting, </li></ul>And as you can tell, the acting REALLY  bugged me! I thought that this movie was nothing more than a joke, i couldn't understand WHY exactly this movie was intended to be serouis coz it bloody wasn't! LOLThis movie was just a comedy as far as i was concerned, i couldn't understand much of it, but when those pygmy mummies turned up... I had to stop the movie for a while coz i was laffing so MUCH! Also, the fight scenes, were just as, if not more, comical than anything else, the first fight scene when the boy puts on the armlet thingy and when the girl fights, oh dear GOD! I haven't laffed that hard in a while!Also, some plot holes made me wonder in distaste, like HOW did they get the books, and IF they got the books then how did they by any chance manage to open them without the key!? Things like this gave me headache :(This movie was nothing more than a joke, i loved it however, i just couldn't take it serouisly...",Null,1,1,15 December 2001
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Blood....
","Ok, plain and simple, i loved this movie.There is very little else to say to be honest, this movie had everything in it which i think makes a good movie. It has cute actors (Keanu Reeves...) it has a MAJOR bad guy (Dracula) and also it has a soppy, but (somehow) believeable love story stacked in the middle! This movie fortutantly, relys on the 'old' method of doing effects, there is some CGI filming technolgy here, but it is alot of old fashioned techniques used as well, and in my opinion this is what makes the movie the more freaky!I love the scenes at the castle and also the characters add to the movie as well, you can't have a movie as creepy as this and then have some crappy characters who don't know how to act! This is why i thought the film and the characters were well thought out and extremely well made.I like the fact that in this movie they FINALLY use Ol' 'Vlads' powers as they were meant to be i.e. He CAN sustain direct sunlight, but it bloody weakens him unlike the myth which says he can't. So i was glad to see that go in. Also i liked the love story behind it and how God forgives all in the end, it made me wanna cry... NOT! But it was a well crafted story line and it did have its moments, i wish i could tell you what they were.. but if you're looking for a movie in which you don't have to worry about how much the director has put into special effects, this movie does have special effects, but they don't domainate it like other movies *COUGH PHANTOM MENANCE COUGH!*Go see this movie, have a few chills at the scary movies and then go home with your b/f or g/f and wonder if you could really last over 600 years (or so) in waiting for your true love, it makes you think don't it?",9,1,2,9 November 2001
Bring It On," Eliza Dushku! I worship you!
","Ok, i muist agree, i did think that this movie was 'cheesy' but it was a good attempt and the actors did do they're best in order to put out a quality movie.I think that the casting was actually quite a good one, with the lead actress being Kirsten Dunst, how could this movie not be about 'sugar and spice and all things nice' I ask you? I have seen worse than this movie and i think that it is saved by some good stunts, some really good music and some passable acting by all involved. It attempted to have the typical sub plots which make a movie a good one, but no matter how many good sub plots it attempts to have, it is a teenagers movie about 'shiny happy people' and also about 'good wholesome fun' so you know that it isn't going to have anything spectacular about it.The casting was one of the things in my eyes which saved it, Kirsten Dunst and Eliza Dushku make this moive that i would see just to see them two in it! Eliza herself seemed abit out of kilter in this movie as in my eyes she will always be 'faith' but at least she's getting out there in the world 'tying new things'This movie, despite all its flaws, and God knows it has some, is somethign that you can watch and somehow feel good at the end, it doesn't hold no surprises and also manages to make u think at the end (i think!) Watch it for the stars, or watch it because you want to see alot of teenage girl (and boy!!) flesh on desplay, its something that i would recommend given half the chance!",Null,0,0,7 November 2001
Beetlejuice," V. funny indeed!
","This is one of the more funnier movies that i've ever had the pleasure to see! Even after seeing it for like the 100th time last nite, it small manages to make me crack a smile 0=]There is soo much that is good about this movie, it has class and also it has Alec Baldwin in tight clothes... Right! I loved the acting in this movie and i thought that it was easily one of the better things that all the people in this movie (Alec Baldwin, Winona Ryder, Geena Davis) have ever done! Its funny and it does have alot to offer 0=]I love this movie and i don't think that there is a single person who i know who doesn't love it as well 0=]",Null,1,2,11 December 2001
