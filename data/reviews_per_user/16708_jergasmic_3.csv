Sucker Punch," Blown away.
","If you know Zack Snyder, you know that people either love his movies or they hate them. This is exactly the case with his newest visual 'Sucker Punch'. Not everyone liked his previous films like, '300' and 'Watchman'. This is also Snyder's first film not adapted from previous work. But the ones who did, were in love. I'm going to come out and just say, that the people that didn't like 'Sucker Punch' probably didn't get it. It's more than just five sexy girls in slutty outfits shooting up the place. It has such a deeper story, and if you're one of the people that picked it up, you'll feel for all the characters so much more. The story is pretty simple. A teenage girl goes through trauma, get committed to an insane asylum, and is trying to escape. The story seems simple, but it goes so much more deeper than that. She pretty much is using her imagination, to deeply intensify her surroundings. Remember when we were little and certain parts of the floor was hot lava? That's kind of what she's doing. With the help of four other girls in the asylum, she goes on unreal 'missions' to get the key items needed to escape. I wish I could touch more on the deep story, but I feel like it'll give too much away. I'll just say that this movie makes you think. If you actually pay attention to the story, and not just the action, this movie is will be one of the most original movies in years.Overall this movie was amazing. The visuals, the action, the story, as well as the acting. I must admit, Vanessa Hudgens and Jamie Chung, although not as prominent as I wish they would've been, steal every scene they're in. The soundtrack was awesome, I actually downloaded it as soon as I got home. One gripe I did have with the film, was it's rating. I wish it wasn't PG-13, an R rating would have allowed Snyder to get away with so much more, and I feel like the insanity would have been intensified, which would have been nice to see. If you're a fan on mind bending movies that a lot of people will say 'that didn't make sense'. Think, 'Wizard of Oz', meets 'Inception', meet's 'Alice In Wonderland', with video game action and levels. Remember, that this movie, it's her mind that you're in, and whatever happens, no matter unreal it may seem, that you once believed that certain parts of the ground was lava. Free and open you're mind, and watch 'Sucker Punch'. It's a feast for your eyes, ears and mind.",10,4,10,27 March 2011
Tangled," A New Classic.
","I was very sketchy walking into this movie. I didn't know what to expect, it's Disney which is promising, but it's also Disney's first CGI Disney movie that got a PG rating, so it seemed different. It was pretty hard for me to choose between 'Tangled' or 'Burlesque' but I'm glad I made the decision to watch 'Tangled'. This film has everything, for everyone, boys girls and tongue in cheek humor for adults. It's Disney's answer to Shrek, but in a classy way, that doesn't feed off of pop culture. The story of the film is simple. Rapunzel is a princess that has hair that has power to heal and keep people young, but once it's cut, it loses all power. When Rapunzel was just an infant she was kidnapped by an old woman who locked her away in a tower to keep her hair all to herself. Rapunzel grows up thinking that her kidnapper is in fact her mother, and the reason she's locked away is because her 'mother' wants to keep her safe from the hardships of the world. I'd tell you more about the movie but I don't want to ruin it. Let's just say she runs away. Very simple, fairy tale plot.I was kind of saddened that Disney has succumbed to making Princess movies using CGI, but watching this movie I realize that some scenes wouldn't have the power it had, if it were in 2D. The lantern lighting scene, for example, was amazing. It wouldn't have been the same in 2D. The music, was perfect. Enough musical number to keep Disney fans more than satisfied and not enough to where it's overkill. The songs were heartfelt and meaningful, they all served a purpose, it wasn't just a nameless song thrown into the movie. The voice acting, by Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi were amazing. I was a little sketchy about Mandy. I'm a long time fan, but I wasn't sure if she had the right voice to be a Disney Princess. She gave Rapunzel so much life, and innocence, I couldn't think of any other actress who could play her better. Zachary gave Flynn life, and humor, and made him a very likable character. However, the two characters that stole the show were Pascal, the chameleon, and Maximus, the horse. Although these supporting characters have no speaking lines, through actions and emotions, you know exactly what they want to say, and the message comes in loud and clear. This movie has enough action and comedy to keep boys happy and enough emotion, romance and drama to keep the girls happy. There are a few scenes that made me tear a little, well maybe more than a little. Some scenes have so much emotion and depth that it tugs at your heartstrings, and gives you goosebumps, especially the lantern scenes. Disney is testing the waters of their film making with this one. There were many alcohol references and even references about being drunk. There's violence, people getting stabbed, and yes, even blood. Which you never see is Disney movies. Overall, I highly recommend this movie, to everyone. Anyone could enjoy this movie. It's very hard not to like it. With theater prices so high, I suggest you don't spend 10 dollars to watch Cher and Christina, but watch 'Tangled' instead. They don't make movies like this anymore. It's much better than last year's 'Princess and the Frog'. Rapunzel is now in the line-up of classic Disney princess. I cannot stress how amazing this film is. Go out and see it.",10,316,368,24 November 2010
The Hangover Part II," The wolfpack is back.
","I went to the midnight premiere last night. With mixed expectations. I went in totally stoked to see the sequel to the funniest movie ever made. But, I was dreading the sequel curse. This movie, plays A LOT on the first movie. References to The Jonas Brothers being in town. The opening scene is exactly like the first movie's opening scene. When I say 'exactly'. I mean EXACTLY. Camera angles, characters, lines, stances., music. There are a few new characters added to the wolfpack. The two main ones being Jamie Chung's character as Stu's fianc√©, and Mason Lee's character. Stu and Lauren (Chung) are getting married in Thailand. Which I don't get. Jamie Chung is korean, not thai. But I guess we're going by the 'all asians look the same' stereotype and have her play a thai girl. Anyway, I'll just get to the point. The boys go have a drink, and wake up with no recollection of what happened the night before.If you've seen the first movie, you've seen this movie. 98% of the gags, laughs and jokes are basically repeats of the first. All of them are recycled. Asian guy pops out of something and beats someone. Some sort of jungle animal is in the bathroom. Something is wrong with Stu's face. Scene by scene it's the same movie. I'll admit, it did have it's moments where I was cracking up and roaring with laughter. But I just sat there in the theater a lot, thinking 'I've seen this before'. It was a good sequel, as far as sequels go. But if this was the first 'Hangover' film, it wouldn't do very well. This movie relies A LOT on the first film. It does have a lot more vulgarity and potty humor, which is expected. However, I do kind of feel like the actors phoned this one in, which was disappointing.Bottom line. If you haven't seen the first movie, don't see this movie. You won't get any of the jokes. And if you have seen the first movie, I'd wait for the Blu-Ray. 98% of the jokes are recycled from the first one, you'll just feel like you're watching the same movie. I do give it credit that the idea of it happening exactly the same as the first one is funny. But it gets exhausting about 45 minutes in. It's a funny movie, I'll admit it. It just felt like I was watching the first film over again. I suggest you wait for the Blu-Ray.",7,2,13,26 May 2011
