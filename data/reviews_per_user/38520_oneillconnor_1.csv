The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Very surprising
","As I downloaded this film from iTunes, I didn't have great expectations for it but thought it would be a fun watch to pass some time. After only a few minutes I was drawn in and immersed in a rich cast and story.The movie not only follows the main character through his social life, but also through his thoughts as he struggles with a problematic childhood memory which, for me, made the film. The flashbacks give an amazing view of the character and help to define his personality and make him very human to the point I could relate very well.Through the highs and lows of the detailed times, the viewer is swept through emotions with the character. I, personally, finished the film on the verge of crying a mixture of tears of sadness and joy.The casting is absolutely perfect and I cannot imagine anyone better to play the parts, which heavily supports the story and makes the characters more 'real'.This is a must watch film for everyone out there.",9,4,8,24 May 2013
