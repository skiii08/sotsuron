","'Sir, I need to give him something...'This is the story of a US Air Force Captain who is sent back in time to prevent a terrorist attack. The movie that follows the story has interesting direction, a script that could have been better, good actors and great special effects.This is the second film by Duncan Jones, the director of 'Moon', a small budget project with a great story and cast which explores the difficulties of being alone in the world... err... moon. His second movie is placed in a much more populated setting, but still very limited. The entire action takes place on board a train and in some undisclosed other facility.From a technical point of view, the movie presented two main challenges: how to make the story and the sets not look linear and unidimensional, first, and how to induce the sensation of confusion and insecurity, second. Both problems have interesting solutions, the second one being particularly well done, with the opening sequences of the movie plunging the viewers into a very confusing environment, where they are not quite sure of what they are seeing. The angles are strange, either vertical, filmed from above straight down or very horizontal, flat and distant. It does not make sense and it is brilliant. The solution to the first problem is also very creative.The script is quite complicated, and it has some problems, the techobabble being one of them. It is confusing and not very convincing, but it could have worked well. There are other problems, however with the way the drama unfolds, layer by layer. The layered approach has been used before and done better. 'Ogres are like onions.' 'You smell bad? You make people cry?' 'Layers, Donkey, ogres have layers.' Unfortunately there are far bigger problems and one of them is the current state of the main character. It is totally uncalled for, it is a very weak and soap opera like device to introduce an unnecessary emotional charge, and it negates much more interesting possibilities and development opportunities. It also leads to a very bad ending. On the positive side, the script is very good at creating tension and drama.The actors are good, with a strong emotional presence. Jake Gyllenhaal is very intense, Vera Farmiga is also intense, in a subtler, quieter way and Michelle Monaghan provides an welcomed balance to all this intensity, by being nice and relaxed.The special effects are excellent and very unexpected, with a very effective timing.Source Code. A good thriller, if not for some script incongruities and an unnecessary ending. 6/10.",6,1,1,14 July 2011
Alien," Alien (1979)
","'Why don't you guys freeze him? How come they don't freeze him?'Alien. One of the movies that made history. One of the movies that every single Sci-Fi movie has copied, cloned or ripped off ever since. Or worse: made fun of.This is the story of how humanity met the purest, most perfect killer anybody has ever seen before. Or since. It is the story of the commercial starship Nostromo, on it's way back to Earth with a cargo of minerals and a crew of idiots.The movie starts with the huge ship waking up to respond to a signal of some sort, which for some reason the crew has to investigate and identify. And because they could not find a better reason, they thought of a very compelling one: money. 'You investigate, or you go home empty handed'. Which after a very, very long mission would have been very unfortunate, I guess. Sure, they start to want to go home shortly after that but... no, I won't say anymore.Watching this movie more than 30 years after it's premiere, I would say it is not much of a movie. It is long - too long - the sets look like they are some sort of oil rig or refinery or something, the music is lame, the sound is uneven (to be polite), the story is ridiculous, the monster is great but very shy, nothing is really up to expectations, it is one big bad movie.The actors do a fine job with the story they've got, which calls for them to be and behave like truckers. Truckers in space, should have been called. Tom Skerritt is the captain, John Hurt is the guy with the death wish (also second in command), Sigourney Weaver is the third in command, Ian Holm is the forth in command (kidding, he's the science officer, actually), Veronica Cartwright is the damsel in distress and the other two guys are not payed as much as the others so... just ignore them; everybody else does. There is a cat, too. Very important.Many have said that this movie has a lot of star power, but I suspect that they were not that much of a star, back in the day. I mean... they only had a few TV movies under their belts, so they couldn't have been all that... shiny, including the director - Ridley Scott. And the fact that all of them have confirmed and went on to become big successful stars makes this movie even more fascinating.The characters are overaged, out of shape (with one notable exception), they have lousy self preservation instincts and they have even lousier logic. Unfortunately I know people like that, which makes the characters very believable, no mater how crazy that is. I mean... I could see some people go: 'Oh my God, this is one huge creepy spaceship! I'm afraid to take one step further but I'm taking it! Oh my God, I could die out here but it is so fascination! Yeah! I'm taking one more step. Oh my God, I'm slipping! There is a huge egg thingy in front of me, why don't I just stick my face in it. Yeah, that seems like the smart thing to do...'And the story continues to do all the wrong things for all the wrong reasons, even if some guy or another wants to know why they're doing it and other guy or another explains their reasons to do so. Which gets really annoying really fast, and after about the hundredth time they've done that I just gave up and started to fast forward a lot.Alien. One great movie but... not that great. I understand the sequel was far better. 7/10.",7,0,1,9 June 2011
U-571," u-571 (2000)
","'Everything is in German!' (No sh*t! Really?)This is the story of how the Americans captured the Enigma code machine in World War II. And since the real Enigma was captured by the British, actually, we know that the story is a work of fiction.The movie starts on a German U-Boat somewhere in the Atlantic, attacking and being attacked in it's turn. It is a world of fish eat fish out here and the Germans have the upper hand. But when the U-Boat is crippled, the Americans see an opportunity to board it and get the Enigma.The directing is not that great. It is as if the director tried to recreate the scenes from 'The Hunt for Red October' in a 2 by 4 cabin. It was ridiculous to watch a whole bunch of senior officers prancing around in a tiny cabin, inches from each other, and the pendulum mounted camera didn't help things, either.Some complain about the inaccuracy of the story, but I complain about the quality of the story. Tarantino changed history too, on occasion, but at least he did it in style. This movie looks like it was filmed in a bathtub and the action has all the credibility of a bed time story.The actors have not much to do except act scared, stiff or worried (looking at the walls, if possible). The music is terrible and the camera work is boring. In fact the whole movie is boring and a bit too long, just under two hours.U-571. If you want to see a underwater movie try 'Das Boot' or 'The Hunt for Red October'. Much better. 4/10.",4,2,4,15 June 2011
Jarhead," Jarhead (2005)
","'Sir, I got lost on the way to college, sir.'This is the story of the first Golf War, as seen by one Anthony Swofford, a 20 year old soldier in the US Marine Corps. The war movie that results is quite bad. It has a bad director, a very, very bad script, bad acting and bad special effects.The director is Sam Mendes, the man behind American Beauty and Road to Perdition, movies with many Oscars between them, which makes me wonder: 'What happened to Jarhead? What is wrong with it?' I'm not quite sure. As I was watching I kept feeling that something is not quite right and that somebody messed up big time. Looking back, I guess the directing is to blame for this. There are long - too long - scenes, there are a lot of empty spaces in between, there are way too many scenes where something starts and then just fizzles. It's just as if the movie is suddenly struck by amnesia: 'What? What was I doing here? What's going on in here? Who? Me?' and so on. The framing is decent, for the most part, but what we see is just too linear and unidimensional and the camera rarely moves.The script is very poor. The story is told as if there is just one guy in the world and everybody else is there in passing. Most of the actors have nothing to do, they just come and go in a constant parade, without establishing any real connection with the viewer or the movie. Maybe the camera and the directing is at fault for staying too far and too cold, but there is something very wrong with the script. As I red the Trivia section after the movie, I saw all these character's names and I was like 'Corporal Who? Who was that guy?' I just couldn't identify any of then except the main character. Or care less. Many reviewers have said that this is an insult to the US Marine Corps and it sure felt like it. An insult to the viewer, too.The acting is quite bad across the board. Jake Gyllenhaal is usually a good actor and so is Jamie Foxx. In this movie, however, they came up short and empty. Jamie Foxx not as much, maybe, but Gyllenhaal does nothing but stare at everything around him with a bovine look on his face. I understand that much of the dialog was improvised, to give it a feeling of authenticity, but all it managed instead was long empty pauses and wordless scenes, which is the script's and the director's fault.The special effects are just wrong. They couldn't light up a couple of barrels of petrol and make a proper fire? They had to make it with CGI? What kind of moronic idea was that? Anyway.Jarhead. A big slap in the viewer's face. Avoid if you can. 1/10.",1,3,6,5 July 2011
Aliens," Aliens (1986)
","'Get away from her, you bitch!'This is the sequel to the 1979 original, Alien. It has more aliens, it has more firepower but not much else. If you're looking for a movie about boys with toys, this is it. If not, you may skip this one.If the first movie revolved around people doing all the wrong things for all the wrong reasons, in this one the story is just about the same. People do stupid things, for reasons equally stupid. And to make matters worse, the writer decided to mix in the story some incompetence as well, to make things more interesting. Why? Beats me!The script is bad, long and unbelievable. For example: the soldiers go into the aliens' nest armed to the teeth, but all of a sudden Ripley realizes that it would be dangerous for them to use their weapons. Everybody should just use their barbecue lighters instead, which is totally unrealistic. If a bunch of professional soldiers ever faced a situation like that, they would have just retreated and reevaluated their situation. When you are downgraded from level 245 Space Marine to level 45 Chicken Sh*t you run, you don't stick around for questions. Then the shuttle pilot lands on a planet full of dangerous creatures, yet she leaves the bay doors open. Really? Why? And so on.The actors are just along for the ride, but you can't really blame them. The only one that actually felt like she knew what she was doing was the kid (and the fact that she had no business being in this movie is not her fault). The direction is decent, there is action and there are a lot of special effects. The music is average.The only character that's truly incredible is the computer. If Alien had computers that could only do a bunch of ones and zeros and maybe an occasional line or two, Aliens marks an incredible evolution. Computers can now do a lot more than they could only seven years before.Aliens. A good action movie, if you are willing to overlook some bad choices. 6/10.",6,5,10,15 June 2011
JFK," jfk (1991)
","'The government is gonna jump all over your head, Jimbo, and go cock-a-doodle-doo.'This is the story of D.A. Jim Garrison, as he tries to unravel the mystery behind the Kennedy assassination. The movie has brilliant directing, a great script and excellent acting.Director Oliver Stone directs this epic. The presentation takes more than three hours, and is a torrent of information, faces and places, mixing in together. The past, the present and even the future are there, in slow motion, in home video, in black and white, in color and in any other disposition.The script is a collection of all and every single conspiracy theory ever proposed on the subject. There are countless people telling their story, and there are countless versions of the same truth - or lie. The viewer is walked through a whole exposition of different angles, different bits and pieces and different people. No one is left aside, be it an outstanding member of society or not.The acting talent assembled for this movie is just incredible. Kevin Costner, Jay Sanders, Gary Oldman, Michael Rooker, Laurie Metcalf, Joe Pesci, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, and the list goes on and on. But above all - the biggest actor - is the TV.JFK. Big. 20/10.",10,1,8,5 September 2011
Ip Man," Ip Man (2008)
","'Daddy daddy, mummy said if you don't attack soon all the things in the house will get broken'.This is the story of a Chinese martial arts expert, before and during the second Sino-Jananese war.The movie starts by following the easy, rich and carefree life of a Chinese City in the years immediately before the war. Their time is spent between mock fighting and drinking tea with their friends on one side and their wives and children who don't really approve of this lifestyle, on the other. The tone is light - even humorous at times - and the only concern anyone has is saving face. The drama is subdued, the cinematography is beautiful, full of color and grace, everything is clean and pretty (with a few notable exceptions) and the music is fast, alert and used sparingly, punctuating fights and hilarious moments, mostly.But then the war begins. The tone changes, the atmosphere becomes much darker, and the story shifts dramatically. The good days are long forgotten and the light comedy changes to a dead serious war drama. The sets and the settings change, the lighting too, the music becomes graver and over the top on occasion, but that is fine, because the drama is over the top, also. The fighting becomes a life and death mater and the limited, careful and thoughtful use of power, strength and skill changes to a brutal demonstration of superiority, with terrible results.The actors do a great job and I was really impressed with their work. The fighting is top notch, even if there are not that many fight scenes. There isn't much of a story and there is little dialog of any importance, but words are sometimes unnecessary. There are some obvious propaganda influences and the bad guys are portrayed somewhat stereotypically, but that does not impede the story, too much.Ip Man. A very well executed drama, featuring excellent martial arts. 9/10.",9,1,2,29 April 2011
The Da Vinci Code," The Da Vinci Code (2006)
","'He forgot everything we've learned. Everything we teach. It's why we study history. So we'll stop killing each other.'This is the story of how the most important secret in the history of the world was - almost - revealed. The movie has a very controversial subject, told by a great cast.The subject is quite unbelievable. So unbelievable, in fact, that if it were ever revealed to the world it would destroy the foundations of Christianity itself. And so, it was kept secret. A select few kept it hidden from the curious eyes of the world, while a select - other - few tried to eliminate the threat by eliminating the secret itself. By any means necessary. Until one day, when the two factions, like two fighters almost out of breath, are finally too weak to control the secret any longer. Will it get out? Will it destroy the world?The script tends to minimize everything except the subject, and that is why it is so predictable. It is acted out by a fantastic cast, and I can think of no one better to tell the story. Tom Hanks and Ian McKellen do a great job of explaining events and symbols long forgotten. Audrey Tautou has the innocence needed for the part. Paul Bettany the intensity. And Alfred Molina is perfect as the powerful elite working in the shadows.The music is great, a little over the top maybe, but very much fitting the magnitude of the story. The special effects are few but very well done.The Da Vinci Code. A very intriguing story, for those who care enough to listen. 9/10.",9,0,2,21 July 2011
Thor," Thor (2011)
","'I need a horse!'This is the story of the God of Thunder, Thor. It is a movie with incredible sets and special effects, fantastic costumes and makeup, good acting and good script and directing.The movie is one incredible visual experience. The realm of Asgard is created in astonishing detail, with art, grandeur and power. The architecture is an amazing combination of detail and perspective, where all the elements combine into a stunning ensemble. The interiors are equally out of this world, they are big, large, massive yet cozy and familiar. They have a certain roundness that makes them... comfortable.The costumes, armor, weapons and makeup are fantastic. They are beautifully built, with much care and attention. They look and they feel right (except for the shoes, maybe. I can't see anyone fighting in those heels).The acting is very good. Chris Hemsworth is very convincing, Anthony Hopkins is absolutely brilliant, and Tom Hiddleston has the intensity and the passion required. The rest of the cast is very good, although their roles are more or less decorative.The script is good, and it has good rhythm and pace. On the down side, however, there are some parts that could have been done better. For example, there is (almost) nothing that really shows how good 'Lady Sif and the Warriors Three' are, and we kinda have to take their word for it. Also the part of the movie that takes place on Earth is not really that exciting. There is one scene that I really enjoyed, though: the redneck hammer pulling contest. It was hilarious.The directing is good, and Kenneth Branagh tells the story well. The camera moves, the editing is good and the lighting and the colors are fantastic. There could have been a little more detail added into it here and there, to really complete the experience, but it was very good as it was. One drawback was that they really skimped on the fight scenes, having them take place under the cover of darkness. Not much to see there.Thor. A very good fantasy movie, that offers an entertaining visual experience. 8/10.",8,0,1,28 August 2011
Paths of Glory," Paths of Glory (1957)
","'Why didn't you attack the anthill single-handed?'This is the story of... well... I don't know what the story is here. The movie has strange directing, average acting, an intriguing script and low production value.Director Stanley Kubrick directs this movie in a weird and strange manner. The camera does strange things, the metaphors are predictable, the angles are also predictable, and the battlefield scenes are average. Sometimes even below average. The only scene that really stood out for me was the night recon mission: the atmosphere was very well done, and the landscape could very well be from the Moon.The acting is average. Kirk Douglas has a subdued role, the three patsies are interesting but completely unrealistic, the french generals are nothing more than caricatures and the rest are there just to make the numbers. There are no enemies, but with friends like that, who needs them?The script is quite intriguing. It certainly kept me interested, but for the wrong reasons. I couldn't believe where they were going with it and I was anxiously waiting for something to happen, to change, to contradict what I was seeing. The very odd subject caused a huge controversy and the French banned the movie for it, and I can't say I blame them. The way they were portrayed in this movie was simply despicable. The subplots were also predictable and even annoying, at times.The production values are very low. There are only a few sets and a handful of soldiers. On a positive note, there are a lot of explosions.Paths of Glory. Artsy and pretentious war movie wannabe. 4/10.",4,5,20,2 September 2011
X-Men: First Class," X-Men: First Class (2011)
","'I will count to three and you will move this coin.'This is yet another entry in an apparently never ending line of sequels-prequels-shmequels Hollywood keeps turning out, these days. The script sucks, the director is utterly incompetent, the main actors are miscast, the secondary actors are wasted. The entire movie is made of plastic (poster included).The script is a joke. It was written by committee and not even a good one. None of the writers have any major works to their credit and to make maters worse - as if that was even possible - the story is written by none other than Bryan Singer: the guy who ruined every super hero movie he ever touched.The entire movie is nothing more that one huge introduction. Introduce super hero (sorry, mutant) number one. Check. Introduce mutant number 2. Check. Introduce mutant number 3. Check. And so on and so forth. Should they do anything interesting? Anything at all? No, no, no. God forbid they'd do something exciting.Dear writers, this is a prequel, we get it. You have to introduce people, we understand that. But by Golly, why did you have to make them so excruciatingly boring? Couldn't you find them something interesting to do? Anything?The director of this movie is one incompetent bastard. There is nothing that says: 'Hey, that was interesting.' Nothing. This is just one big music video clip, but without the music. The sets are very similar with the ones in Superman Returns: big, expensive and unrealistic. And dead. There is nothing that says: 'We live here'. No. There should be a big sign on the door saying: 'Vacancy. Rooms to rent. Butlers to hire. Everybody's gone fishing. Big discounts!' (and in smaller letters) 'The place stinks!'The actors are terribly miscast and/or underused. James McAvoy is completely miscast as Professor Xavier, he doesn't look anything like the comics character or like Sir Patrick Stewart, for that matter. Plus his only ability seems to be touching his head with his fingers: 'I'm gonna put my fingers to my head and I'm gonna smack your arse', he seems to say. Plus he is given the stupidest lines ever: ' Remember, true concentration lies between rage and serenity.' No kidding! Really??Michael Fassbender seems a little more adequate, but nothing about him says: 'Look at me, I'm Magneto'. And to make maters worse, he is not spared the idiotic writing either. I mean, the Nazi doctor kills his mother and the poor kid goes on a rampage killing everybody, but he doesn't kill the guy who did it? Really? What the heck! This is joke, right?Everybody else is wasted in this movie. Oliver Platt and Michael Ironside have a few lines, and Ray Wise is on the screen for about 2 seconds.X-Men: First Class. More like third or fourth class, if you ask me. 2/10.",2,13,26,26 August 2011
