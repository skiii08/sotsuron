Vertigo," Obsession is our greatest disease
","This is the closest that comes to my all-time favorite and most effecting film. When I tell someone to see only one Hitchcock film this is it. Not because it displays all of Hitch's talent, but for a greater reason. After having seen nearly forty of his films it seems there is no set style, the PSYCHO 'shower' scene is not how we should judge Hitchcock, his restraint and minimal work is his best(i.e. SHADOW of a DOUBT, NOTORIOUS, REBECCA). Try not to feel for Stewert's 'Scotty', it is hard since a lot of us have a little of him in us. It definitely is a film that exists in the universe of Hitchcock films (a man on the run, or falsely accused, or seeking the truth). I promise you will be drawn in. See it, know it, love it, and repeat, again, and again and again. Remember: VERTIGO IS ONE OF THE THREE BEST HITCHCOCK FILMS, and I've seen enough of them to say so.",10,5,7,4 June 2004
