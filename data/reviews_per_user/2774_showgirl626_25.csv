"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," A campy side-splitting good time.
","This movie was a scream. Hugo Weaving was great, though it was a little disconcerting to see the same guy who played the Elf lord in LOTR, and Agent Smith in the Matrix playing a rather scary looking cross-dressing stage performer. I must say, though, that he cuts a lovely figure in a dress.Terence Stamp was grand as Bernadette, but Guy Pearce was darling. I've seen several of his films, and though I think he's a good actor, the only other one I like is L.A. Confidential (which is one of my favorites in general). Seeing that, then seeing Pearce in this, was probably the best way to go. Had I seen this first, I don't think I could have believed him playing a strait-laced detective. But he was grand, and he makes a gorgeous woman. He also lip-syncs really well. The scenes of him sitting in a giant shoe on top of the bus singing opera were great. How striking to see the long bolts of material streaming along behind the bus.The bus itself - the title character - was a great prop around which the film was crafted. It was pink, temperamental, and instrumental in introducing Bernadette to Bob, played with understated class by Bill Hunter. His flaky wife was nuts, and luckily not in the movie for long, but her character was hilarious.This film won a richly deserved Oscar for costume design. The cinematography was wonderful, the script beyond reproach, and full of little vignettes about life as a drag queen, and the unfair treatment that results when people see boys wearing girls' clothes. That was another reason I liked Bob...he didn't bat an eyelash, helped his friends without reservation (except for one momentary pause that showed he's just as human as the rest of us), and he and Bernadette got along like a house on fire.I'll repeat that Terence Stamp was wonderful, and Guy Pearce was wonderful plus 10. I loved this movie. A unique, wild, campy ride, and I recommend it whole-heartedly. 8/10. Enjoy.",8,1,2,17 April 2010
Casablanca," A wonderful movie that stands the test of time
","Wow. I actually haven't seen this movie until recently. I'm not a big Bogart fan under normal circumstances, but Ingrid Bergman is ethereal in everything she does. I'm so glad I finally sat down and watched it. This, along with Hitchcock's 'Rebecca' are perhaps the 2 best movies to come out of the early 40s. Such great dialogue in both movies, even without the action required in today's flicks to make up for a sh***y script, there's never a dull moment. If you've not seen Casablanca, you're doing yourself a disservice. Marvelous flick. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 out of 10 is because there are movies I like better. Not many, though, I assure you...Casablanca is a movie I would recommend to anyone.Enjoy!",9,0,2,1 May 2006
In Bruges," Delightfully wicked
","This movie was WONDERFUL. Very twisted, a little gory, quite surreal in spots, but marvelous nonetheless. Brendan Gleeson's quiet nobility (as a hit-man!) was sublime. Gleeson was a great foil, and it was also great to see Ralph Fiennes play a mush-mouthed hood. I'm used to seeing him in films like The Constant Gardener or The English Patient. This departure from those roles had me grinning from ear to ear as I watched.Colin Farrell, though, was truly magnificent. He played his role to the hilt. His childish affectations and facial expressions were such a treat. Regardless of how dark this film was, I laughed out loud many times.The supporting cast were all excellent, and the city of Bruges was a beautiful backdrop. I give it 4.5 out of 5 stars, and two enthusiastic thumbs up. Watch this film. It's delightful.",9,1,3,28 August 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," I love this movie! And Johnny, je t'aime beaucoup!
","Great action flick. I was quite surprised that Disney was behind this, and that they gave Depp such free reign. He is a marvelous actor, though, I love just about everything he's done.It was nice to see Orlando Bloom have some more lines than he did in the LotR trilogy. And Geoffrey Rush...ah, Geoffrey...I love just about everything you do as well (Quills, though? What were you thinking?). Mr. Rush did such a great job, overshadowed only by Depp. What a great character he created in Captain Jack Sparrow. But he's created so many great characters.Johnny? When are you going to team up with Morgan Freeman to do something? Now THAT would be a movie. But this one was great too. Pirates of the Caribbean? Two enthusiastic thumbs up, and I highly recommend it.Enjoy!",9,1,4,1 May 2006
Public Enemies," A huge cinematic letdown
","I was foaming at the mouth when I learned that two of my favorite actors - Johnny Depp and Christian Bale - would be sharing the big screen, but when I finally got the chance to catch it recently, I was really disappointed. I mean, REALLY. The first time I tried watching it, I made it through about an hour before I realized there wasn't going to be a plot, and switched over to watch the far more compelling Law Abiding Citizen instead. But I was determined to watch this movie I'd been longing to see for so long, and I finally managed to choke it down in its entirety via episodic viewing after a couple of weeks, and I really think it was a clunker.Johnny Depp brought NOTHING to his portrayal of John Dillinger. Booooring. Bale was worse than boring as Melvin Purvis, and this movie left me questioning their golden child reputations, as well as that of Marion Cotillard. She brought less than nothing to her role. None of the other acting was even worthy of mention. Not even the blazing gun battles were engaging.Trying to maintain a little of my faith in Depp and Bale as actors, I'll tell myself they did the best they could with the script and direction they were given, but this movie is passable, and forgettable. Don't waste your time.Thanks for reading.",3,0,0,6 August 2010
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Jaw-dropping animation!
","Wow! Omigosh! Cheese oh peets! What a gorgeous movie! I have a background in commercial art/computer graphics/animation, and I love full-length animated feature films because of the artistry, if not necessarily the story. The story here was a bit goofy in spots, but it was still delightful, holding me mostly rapt with the plot (even on the edge of my seat a few times), and completely swept away by the beauty of the way the artists rendered the smoke, steam, fire, water, and FUR! The animal fur (especially the anteater) was unbelievable! I love this movie! I'll probably go see it again and again, and I'm definitely adding it to my collection when it comes out on DVD.A couple of things that bugged me - the whole sloth cult thing was pointless, and the singing vultures...that was just stupid.All in all, though, I recommend it. Take the kids...they'll love it, and you'll appreciate the adult humor that shows up every now and then.Enjoy",7,1,1,1 May 2006
The Prestige," Amazing
","This is a milestone for me. I don't think I've ever seen two movies in a YEAR that I thought were utterly perfect, and here I am writing a review about my second in a month.This is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen, and I'm SO glad I experienced it on the big screen. It was a compelling story, beautifully scripted and filmed, brilliantly acted by Jackman, Bale and Caine (I like that Bale's name was Alfred this time, like Caine's was in Batman Begins). Bowie was really restrained as Nikola Tesla, and I even liked Scarlet Johannsen (that lucky, lucky, LUCKY lady...getting to cozy up to both Jackman AND Bale? Sigh). However, her role, Alfred's wife, and Andy Serkis's character could have been played by anybody. I'm not sure any of them are worthy of special mention. And regarding Serkis, all I could think of was 'my preciousssssssssssssss.' This is a movie about misdirection, and I was surprised often by the twists and turns...a rare feat for a film. I kept trying to guess where it was going and I was either partially or completely wrong almost every time. There were only 2 parts where I guessed what was coming, and I LOVED that. It was really a clever movie.After a first viewing, there are only a couple of things about this film that I didn't find utterly satisfying. One is the fact that the last fifteen minutes or so played out as though the people associated with the creation of it suddenly assumed that the viewer's brain had stopped functioning. The rest of the movie dances along just out of your full reach, begging you to keep up, waving and sticking its tongue out if you don't, then screeches to a grinding halt while two characters suddenly start explaining away every minute of the previous two hours.I didn't mark the movie down because of this. The concepts were too intriguing, the intellectual and cinematic pace of the movie moving too precisely...there are fundamentally no dead spots in this film.I wouldn't have answered ALL the questions at the end, were it my decision. I would have left at least a few questions unanswered.**************BIG SPOILER HERE***************My only other problem with this film is the question of 'which knot.' That could have been easily ascertained when the ropes were untied and removed from the body.*****************OKAY DONE WITH SPOILERS*******************However, those things said, I still can't recommend this movie highly enough. If it isn't nominated for at least a few Oscars, I'll be seriously questioning the sanity of the Academy Members. This film was very cerebral (a rarity when coupled with 'mainstream' and big budget'), and I hope it gets the industry recognition that it surely deserves. It's a quality film, and that is a sublime understatement.I highly recommend this film. Enjoy.",9,2,3,26 November 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Sheer magic
","I'd forgotten how much I LOVE this movie. I probably watched it 100 times the first 2 years it was out on DVD (I'm not kidding...I could quote large portions of it verbatim), hadn't seen it in a while, and just finished watching it again for the first time in probably more than a year.I was fortunate enough to see all three movies on the big screen, and this one grabbed me so utterly and completely from the first moment, pulled me body and soul into that world and hasn't let go since. No other fantasy has done that before or since.As you watch the movie, you're also a part of it...you're there feeling every little nuance of Elijah Wood's expression, you're left breathless by the beauty of the land, you fall in love with Aragorn and Sam for everything they both do to protect Frodo, you echo Frodo's screams with your own when Gandalf falls into darkness with the Balrog (I've never seen a mythical creature brought to life more amazingly on the big screen!), and you can believe totally Boromir's pain as the arrows pierce his body (by the way, attention, Entertainment Weekly - I nominate Boromir's final 7 minutes in this film as the Best Death Scene Ever in a Movie!). There are so many other things I could list, but I'd rather leave them for you to discover.Though I love all three movies, neither the Two Towers nor the Return of the King will ever usurp the sheer wonderment of the first in the trilogy for me. Peter Jackson took Tolkien's amazing imagination and intelligence and brought both to the big screen in a way I wouldn't have believed possible. The music sung in Elvish, the lighting, the CGI, the ACTING! - all of it...utterly spellbinding. I'll watch this movie again and again and again, and possibly love it more every time I do.If you haven't seen this movie, I suggest you run out and buy it (I can't imagine you won't want to own it after your first viewing), come home, turn down the lights, turn your phone off, and give yourself over completely to the spell this film will cast.Enjoy!",10,1,1,9 December 2006
The Thing," Good Horror in its Purest Form
","I just finished watching John Carpenter's 'The Thing' for at least the 25th time. I've been a huge fan of the flick since the mid 80s (I had a mad teenage crush on Kurt Russell at the time, thanks to 'Escape from New York'), and I considered the John Carpenter / Kurt Russell association to be a winning one.I'm not shocked or horrified by the gore anymore, but that's only because I've seen it so many times. The gore is totally believable, and slightly understated (considering the subject matter), and there is no end to my amazement that it's just as good - if not better - than the cookie-cutter CGI horror flicks that have been released more recently. This movie holds up to anything recent in the genre, and will probably continue to do so for quite some time.Russell does a great job (as he always does, regardless of the Grizzly Adams impression in this one), Keith David (I'm a big fan of his voice work) is outstanding...Wilford Brimley was a bit of an odd choice for this flick, even though he does do a good job. You think of the Quaker Oats / Diabetes Test Equipment guy playing that sort of role...it's a bit of a head-scratcher.My point, I guess, is this: I've seen this movie many, many times, and it still holds my attention. No sexual tension, no political intrigue...just a bunch of guys playing with flame throwers and bad-tempered aliens. And the ending is phenomenal!!!!!! The only reason I didn't give it a higher score is because there are obviously many movies out there that ARE perfect 10s, such as: Hitchcock's Rebecca, the LOTR trilogy, American History X and the Shawshank Redemption. But John Carpenter's the Thing is definitely high on my horror list! Though it isn't my perfect 10, I still give it 2 thumbs up from my thumb and my other thumb. There you have it. Enjoy.",7,3,7,11 July 2005
American Psycho," Christian Bale falls apart....
","Christian Bale plays a MARVELOUS psycho. In this movie his American accent is nearly flawless (if overdone a bit in spots); the tics, the facial expressions, everything - outstanding! You could really believe that he is Patrick Bateman, crazed killer.However...He was the only thing that held this movie together. There wasn't a single other character that stood out. Everybody else could have been played by ANY-body else.The movie really started to fall apart for me when the shooting spree began. It just went nowhere, and fizzled out in a damp corner. I was left unsatisfied.I will say that I liked the chainsaw interlude, I liked that Jean gets out alive, and I will say again that Christian Bale was fantastic in his loony rage - bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, spewing sometimes but only an implied threat at other times. He did well.Suggestions I would have made? - I think Luis should have had a special torturous death waiting for him, detective Kimball should have almost-but-not-quite bought it at the end, and Patrick should have died a gloriously gore-ific death.This movie is definitely worth seeing, but only because Bale did such a good job. The directing was interesting (up until things went kerflooey...almost like an intern took over the script and directing when the shoot-out began), but I was basically struggling to see what so many others have seen before they sung the praises of this movie.8 out of 10 because of Bale, -2 because the movie fell apart.",6,0,1,6 August 2007
The Shining," Okay, Stanley Kubrick is a better director than most, but........
","I've never understood why everybody thinks Stanley Kubrick's movies are the best thing since sliced bread. Though I loved Clockwork Orange, and I thought a couple of his other films were okay, I don't think he's worthy of the slobbering worship he tends to get.While I'll grant to Stephen King's detractors that he isn't the most sophisticated writer in the world (there are only so many books about writers that take place in Maine that one can stand, correct?), however, he knows his genre well, and knows how to touch your deepest sense of foreboding. The Shining wasn't anywhere near close to his best work, but the novel was LIGHT YEARS better than this movie.I wasn't going to bother with the mini-series remake of this flick, because I've felt that when Stephen King puts his sticky fingers on film adaptations of his books, he ruins them (there are perhaps 4 exceptions)...but I wanted to see Steven Weber go from his goofy Brian Hackett persona on the sitcom 'Wings' to Jack Torrance. I was thrilled. The mini-series was far superior to the crap version that Kubrick produced for the big screen.Maybe it isn't so much Kubrick's directing skills (I like the way shots are set up, I like the contrasts...his style really is maverick), perhaps it's his screen writing skills that should be called into question. He had a hand in development of the screenplay for the majority of his movies...maybe that's where it all breaks down.Kubrick's the Shining was marginally average. By no means brilliant, and certainly not scary in any way, shape or form (not to mention a far cry from King's book of the same name), the acting didn't impress me a whole lot (don't even get me started on Jack Nicholson - who plays the exact same character in every bloody thing he does...though I must admit that I liked Chinatown). Its saving grace was Kubrick's directing style (if not his directing talent, per se), and a pretty original bent by King on the typical yawn of a ghost story upon which Kubrick loosely based the movie.4 stars, 5 yawns...Take my advice: if you haven't read the book yet, read that first, then rent the TV mini-series, THEN rent this one. But don't expect to be scared, not even mildly. At most you'll probably just be annoyed that you wasted one of your Netflix choices on this clunker.",4,9,19,2 June 2005
Over the Hedge," Oh...My...Gawd
","Wow! Wow! Wow! I was transfixed! The animation? Gorgeous! The subtle humor? Uproarious! The not-so-subtle humor? Even better! This was a great movie that will surely be nominated for an Oscar if for no other reason than the beauty of the animation. While I could have honestly thought of a couple of better casting choices, I will mention that Wanda Sykes, Thomas Haden Church and Steve Carrell were brilliant in their roles. And who better to make fun of William Shatner than William Shatner? Worthy of special mention (and a second look - go see this movie again!): the Rottweiler interludes, the ripples in the water, the porcupine quills, the oh-so-amazing foliage throughout the movie, and Vincent's cartoonish-yet-strangely-scary expression.Really REALLY a great movie that should appeal to all.Enjoy.",8,126,154,25 May 2006
Disturbia," One of the best suspense flicks I've seen come out in years!
","MAJOR SPOILERS...READ AT YOUR OWN RISK...Shia, congrats on proving that you can carry not just any flick, but a take-off of a Hitchcock masterpiece.This movie was great. The kids were great, Carrie-Anne Moss was great, David Morse was GREAT (man, he plays a spine-tingling baddie in this one), and the inside of his secret torture chamber was CHILLING. Kudos to the set designers. The fact that it was clean was somehow worse than if there had been carnage splattered everywhere.I enjoyed it a lot. Yes, overall it was predictable, but the path to the end was strewn with surprises. I recommend this film to all suspense/thriller fans with a sense of humor.Enjoy, and thanks for reading my review.",7,0,2,17 March 2008
28 Days Later...," Spare me (by the way, this is a big SPOILER).
","I'm a huge fan of the horror genre, and 28 Days Later looked like it was well worth watching. However...First and foremost, I find the idea that a man in a coma for weeks can suddenly get up, walk, and fight zombies with enough brute strength to kill with a couple of whacks with a bat even more ridiculous (not to mention unbelievable) than the idea of zombies themselves.I have to say that the first half hour or so wasn't too bad (if you can get around the comatose-to-instant Hercules concept). But as the 2 main characters started meeting up with more and more 'uninfected,' it just kept getting more trite and predictable. And dumb.I even gave it a second chance to see if there was something that would actually engage me, but this served only to make me like it even less. While I've definitely seen worse, I most certainly have seen better.Don't waste your time.",3,0,1,7 November 2004
Gran Torino," A wonderful script with a bunch of stiffs
","I've said it many times, but now I risk putting it in writing: Clint Eastwood has been playing the same character for more than 40 years. He's not the best actor, but he's simply marvelous at picking movies where his lack of depth works. Unforgiven was divine, Million Dollar Baby was a masterpiece, but I'm still trying to make up my mind about Gran Torino. I spent much of the film appalled by the wooden acting of everyone (except Sue and Thao's very animated mother and grandmother, a couple of the gang members, and the black kids during one brief interlude), but the end made me forgive almost everything.The movie was a great lesson in tolerance, understanding, forgiveness and the power of redemption. I thought some of it was ridiculous (such as the over-the-top insults between Mr. Eastwood's character, his barber, and his friend the builder), but all in all it progressed well and satisfied. I'll say again that the acting was pretty dreadful overall, and I'll repeat that the end made it worth watching. I could have been spared the reading of the will at the very end, and (*cringe*) Clint Eastwood singing over the closing credits was just wrong.The plot was good, but the acting took a great deal away from it for me. Sorry. I know this was a well-received film, but I think some acting lessons for just about everyone would have prompted me to give it a higher rating. Watch it anyway. There's still much to redeem it. Thanks for reading.",6,0,4,17 April 2010
The Illusionist," This was a great movie
","I fell in love with this movie. Edward Norton, Paul Giametti, Rufus Sewell, even Jessica Biel (imagine my surprise on the latter)...all did wonderful jobs.It moves along so eloquently, elegantly, beautifully, this movie just drags you right into it. The sets were gorgeous, but a little sparse with people. I think a bit more bustle in the streets of Vienna would have added just a bit to this movie, but it didn't take anything away either. I felt like I was part of each audience watching the magic acts, I could smell the forest as the Duchess tracked down Eisenheim, I could feel the chill of the river as Eisenheim plunged in, and I felt it was a very clever movie. No assuming its viewers are stupid on this one, though there are some similarities between this and The Prestige.I don't want to give the plot away. There are some good twists. See it for yourself. I bought the DVD even before I watched it for the first time (because I knew Edward Norton would not disappoint), and I've enjoyed it twice now.Highly recommended! Thanks.",8,1,1,17 March 2008
Grave of the Fireflies," I've never seen its like
","I just finished watching this movie on TCM. I've heard such good things about this movie, and I was so excited to see that it was going to be on, but then I was SO disappointed that it was dubbed. Though it's difficult to watch gorgeous Japanese animation AND read subtitles, I feel that too much is lost in translation when the film is dubbed. Two perfect examples of that are 'Spirited Away' and 'Howl's Moving Castle.' I've seen both the Japanese and English versions, and they felt like different movies.Getting back to 'Grave of the Fireflies,' it was actually a bit of a disappointment. But I blame Miyazaki for that. Once you've become a connoisseur of his work, nothing else compares. It was a very compelling film, beautifully drawn, but it didn't live up to the hype for me.Obviously from the rating I gave it, I still loved it. I really appreciated how such grim subject matter was treated with such reverence (2 things that seem like oxymorons when dealing with animated film; I loved how the suffering and the death was portrayed with such incredible realism (so to speak); and I have to say that I shed quite a few tears during this film, from the first sentence to the last. But one of the things that I found so incredibly compelling was the 2 kids' ability to find laughter and fun even when surrounded by the horrors of war. That aspect of it rang more truly for me than any other part. I'm not sure why.The end was pretty weak when compared with the rest of the film, but then we already know how it ends. I would have done a few things differently to {perhaps} more effectively tear at your heart: *******SPOILERS HERE******* I would have let the watermelon drop off Setsuko's chest when she died; when her spirit was flitting in and out of your vision at the shelter, the one where she was reflected in the water - I would have let her disappear while her reflection remained; and I would have explained how much time passed between Setsuko's death and Seita's, and I would have explained how he ended up where he did. It was a little confusing to know that in the final scenes before we know he died, he had just bought a lot of food, and had withdrawn 3000 yen from the bank.*********SPOILERS DONE******** I think this movie should be required viewing for elementary and middle school children. I used to think that about 'Saving Private Ryan,' but that movie is too visceral for the kiddies. Using animation in this way, deadly serious subject matter can be effectively conveyed, while the medium softens the blow a bit for the younger viewers. Perhaps there would be an end to war.No matter my complaints I still think this was a marvelous movie. I'm not sure if it's one of the top 250 movies of all time, but it's really good, certainly unique, and well worth watching.Highly recommend. Enjoy.",7,0,8,12 November 2006
Blood Diamond," Not as great as I thought it would be, but still pretty great...
","This film initially captivated me, and I immediately fell head over heels for Solomon and his family. Djimon Hounsou always gives a phenomenal, passionate performance, whether he's in Amistad, Beauty Shop, or as a guest on ER. Whether he's a lead or a footnote, he's simply marvelous in the roles he chooses. In Blood Diamond, the other family members were also compelling in their roles, however brief.DiCaprio really is a gifted actor. His accent in this film was very convincing. However, he played his role SO well that I had trouble believing in - or having any empathy for - his character until his last moments in the film. I fault the writing for this, not Dicaprio, for making it so difficult to care for a pivotal character that the viewer is supposed to care for. He ran the gamut of facades, but he proved again and again that his motives were exclusively self-serving. I was never able to trust Danny Archer until he knew he was dying. At that point it was too late to care for him.And Jennifer Connelly? Though I love a couple of the movies she's been in (Labyrinth, House of Sand and Fog), I've never seen her in anything where her character does any more than superficially interact with other characters in the films. She's not engaging at all, and even DiCaprio couldn't pick up the slack for her to save their scenes in Blood Diamond. What her character accomplished in the end was the only thing that endeared her, otherwise I felt nothing.The action of the film was fantastic, the cinematography beautiful, the fundamental story haunting and heartbreaking. I've never been a big fan of diamonds because they're too expensive and they look gaudy, but since seeing this film, I like diamonds even less.Djimon Hounsou made this film the incredible experience that it was. The character of Danny Archer and Jennifer Connelly's lack of acting skill prevented it from being more for me. It is definitely worth watching; I'd even say it's worth buying on DVD, but lower your expectations a little or you'll feel a bit let down.Recommended. Thanks for reading my comment.",7,1,1,7 October 2007
Pride & Prejudice," A splendid and moving period piece
","I saw this movie for the first time on a premium channel, and bought the DVD shortly after. I also can't pass it up any time it's repeated on cable. I'll look forward the whole day to watching some program or another, but if I see that this movie is on, I'll forsake almost any other other program for it.Though I've seen many cinematic interpretations of her work, I must confess that I've never read any Jane Austen. I generally have trouble plodding through the language from books published from the late 18th and early 19th centuries. I just tend not to have the patience for it. Anyway, I've finally, after watching this version of Pride & Prejudice for perhaps the 15th time in less than 3 months, felt compelled to share with you my tremendous love for the story, and I think - when I'm done here - that I'll go to my favorite bookstore's website and buy some of Ms. Austen's work. (Actually, I couldn't wait that long...I just paused from writing this to place an order for the literary Pride & Prejudice.)The cinematography of this movie is fantastic, the locations very stirring, and the script brilliant - really lending itself to the actors' abilities to realistically interpret it with incredible depth and color. But the director, Joe Wright, deserves extra special commendation for getting such WONDERFUL work from the actors, especially Keira Knightley. Yeah, sure, she was great in Bend it Like Beckham and the Pirates trilogy, but I really didn't think she had it in her to lead a cast...much less a cast with Donald Sutherland and the mighty Dame Judy. But she really did prove me wrong. Much like Rachel Weisz did in the Constant Gardener. Keira did a fantastic job. Mind-numbingly so. Kind of scary that this is the same young lady that did Domino.Matthew MacFadyen stormed into my world with a delicate grace that suggested a deep abiding talent with which I should further acquaint myself (I hadn't been aware of him before I saw this movie). The way he and Keira traded their characters' individual pride and prejudice (they both suffered from large measures of both) was a magic dance. I can't say with any certainty right now that I've seen a portrayal of two such lovers done better.What MacFadyen REALLY did for me with Darcy was the sublime nuance of his expression. Though his face really didn't change much at all - whether he was stuffy, indignant or angry - when I first saw that dazed look and tentative smile of devout worship on his face when Elizabeth was about to have that profound, private audience with her father toward the end of the movie, it was wonderful. I could really FEEL Darcy losing himself in his love for Elizabeth, and I could feel almost as strongly his relief at not having to fight it anymore. The stoic, starchy, intimidating Darcy has been reduced to a fumbling child. I thought it was the truly naked face of the character madly hinted at, but so well hidden before just then. Bewitching.Every well-fleshed portrayal in this movie was done really well (it will be the actors from THIS movie that I picture when I read and re-read the book), but I must make a point of saying that Tom Hollander's Mr. Collins is brilliantly pathetic, Mr. Bennett was TRULY one of Donald Sutherland's greatest roles, and it was a great thrill to see the Dame Judy's Lady Catherine put in her place when she made that late night visit to see Elizabeth.I now understand that the story of Darcy and Elizabeth is one of the greatest love stories of all time, and it's one of those grand love stories that retains its delicacy without being smarmy or ridiculous. I treasure the privilege of being allowed access to this interpretation of Pride & Prejudice, and I'll recommend it to anybody. It's destined to become a legend.Watch this movie. You'll be glad you did.",10,12,17,25 May 2007
Singin' in the Rain," A rollicking good time
","Gene Kelly is a marvelous actor, and an even better dancer. This film was as delightful as it could be, considering I don't generally go in for musicals. But the dancing was divine (I especially liked the interlude with the lovely Cyd Charisse). What really made this flick for me was Donald O'Connor. He was amazing. His goofy expressions, his lightning fast quips, and his own impressive dancing skills were marvelous. Debbie Reynolds was okay, but Jean Hagen's Lina Lamont was a splendid scream. The movie had me laughing out loud often, and I was held rapt by the dancing. The songs were delightful (I know I'm saying that word too much, but it fits), and it was great fun all around to watch. It's a little overly sweet, but it's supposed to be. Very charming, 9/10. Thanks for reading.",9,0,1,17 April 2010
How to Train Your Dragon," It doesn't get much better than this
","Dreamworks Animation astounds yet again. Unfortunately for me, the title was a turn off for more than a year after it was released. I thought it was going to be something more suited to the kiddies, with little to engage the adults. I could NOT have been more wrong.This is hands down, no ifs ands or buts about it, can ya gimme hallelujah my FAVORITE animated feature film of all time. It was magnificently designed, the characters were wonderful, but Toothless was a beautiful and sublime revelation. He was a pretty significant departure from the book's description of him, but just wonderful to look at. The subtle scales, the detail of the irises, his expressions, the bunching muscles as he launched into flight, the moment he and Hiccup first connected... ahhhh, such heady, wonderful stuff.The dragons were all wonderful (especially the big baddie at the end). Just incredible. The detail in the human clothing and hair...I could go on and on and on. Eek. This review is giving me withdrawals for the film. I must go watch it again. Anyway, carrying on...The setting was also extraordinary. The sky, the towering rock formations, the trees...and the fire? Wow wow wow wow. But what REALLY affected me was the WATER. I've been waiting for an animation studio to get the water right for decades, and Dreamworks did. I felt I could walk up to my screen and get splashed. They nailed the color of the sea in all her moods. The waves, the crests, it was just amazing. Hold on to your seat when Hiccup and Toothless go for their first major spin. You may want a sling for your jaw, or it might fall off.Wonderful acting all around. Craig Ferguson gets a special mention for being so lively. Jay Baruchel? Never heard of him, and didn't have high hopes for his acting style when the movie first started, but he knocked my socks off within about 2 minutes, and kept on knocking. Gerard Butler was good right from the gate, and the actors playing Hiccup's peers all did a fine job as well.Some issues I had? Slightly wooden human character movements, and the difference in accent between kids and adults was a bit of a head-scratcher. The storyline was of course predictable, but I don't consider that much of an issue. Perhaps the fact that I was able to stop watching it on HBO 3 times a day after only a few months? Hmm. Nope. Not an issue. I still love it, I bought the DVD the same day I saw it for the first time, and I'm going to go watch it again when I'm finished ranting about it.Another legendary animated film. Toothless has knocked Smaug (from the '77 full-length animated take on the Hobbit) from his pedestal, and I think he even knocked the Balrog from Peter Jackson's LOTR/FOTR from his, and THAT, my friends, is a mean feat. Both of those other beasts still (and always will) take my breath away, but Toothless is more than just a beast. He has ascended to that rare place where you also love him.I was mesmerized from the first second to the last. My minor quibbles with the film did not detract from my joy of it. 10/10 stars, 2 enthusiastic thumbs up, and when you're ready to watch it, let me know. I may just shove you over to make space on the couch so I can watch it with you. No salt on the popcorn, please.Thanks for reading. Enjoy the film!",10,0,0,10 April 2012
Zombieland," The best zombie movie I've seen - BIG SPOILERS
","This movie was really cute. Perhaps that's a strange thing to say about a zombie flick, but it was. The script was good, the direction was good, Eisenberg's character's Rules were a hoot, and I don't think I've enjoyed a Woody Harrelson role more since Cheers. He was so bleepity-bleeping funny as he stalked through most of the movie trying to be the baddest bleepity bleeper left on earth, and his unwavering search for something very specific was a delightful little quirk that endeared.Bill Murray's surprise appearance - playing himself - just about knocked me off my chair. Though I knew someone big was going to make an appearance as soon as I knew they were headed for Hollywood, I don't think it gets much better than Bill Murray (though I was cheering out loud for either Brad Pitt or Gwyneth Paltrow before Murray showed up...THAT would have been classic). Murray's screen time was perfect for being brief, and his departure was a side-splitting scream.Though I didn't think Emma Stone or the normally charming Abagail Breslin contributed anything substantive to their roles, there were a few great moments between them and the boys, and there had to be girls for advancement of the plot. Amber Heard's very brief role in the film is worthy of an honorable mention for being completely over the top, utterly predictable, and funny, funny stuff.Each role was contrived to take itself way too seriously, which was one of the things that makes this movie so fun. There were many, MANY horror movie clichés in the film, but that didn't detract from the plot one bit. There were a few ridiculous asides in the film, some pointless scenes, and some pretty campy dialogue, but it all added to my overall enjoyment. Though not necessarily for the squeamish, this wasn't supposed to scare. This was a clever film, all the more clever for making fun of itself at every turn, and I enthusiastically recommend it.Thanks for reading.",7,0,1,6 August 2010
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," This review has major major major spoilers
","Let me start out by saying that I'm ONLY giving this 4 stars because of Shia and the CGI (but there was way WAY too much CGI). If you don't want the spoilers, skip to the last paragraph...Good LORD am I disappointed that I wasted my money on this movie. What happened, Michael Bay? Why did you have to abandon your success and go back to your signature style of style without substance? (And not even a particularly good style either.) And Mr. Spielberg, you should be ashamed of yourself.I must say that I think Shia is following in Will Smith's footsteps; he's going to be unstoppable as he gets a few more years of acting under his belt. As expected, he did a good job, and the special effects were amazing...for about two minutes. Trouble is, they were so over the top - and they went on for such a long time - that it was hard to tell if there was a plot. There wasn't.The movie went nowhere, and there were too many things that went beyond my ability to suspend my disbelief. I accepted the robots, but there were some serious holes that pulled me right out of the movie. Enough for me to write a novel about it, but I'll just give you a few of the highlights that I haven't blocked out:The little scrap of the cube that Shia discovered he still had? The robots would have known about it. And the out-of-nowhere introduction of the contraption inside the pyramid? I'm guessing someone would have found it a bit sooner, with little more than a metal detector. The other bits and pieces being protected by the military? The robots were onto it in the first flick, but couldn't even track the kid with a piece of it in the sequel? Stupid, stupid, stupid. The compulsory-but-unnecessary Hot Chick being able to control one of the robots with a simple human-constructed length of chain? Good GOD, it just keeps getting worse and worse.The biggest problem I think I had involved the electromagnetic pulse that knocked out all troop communications in Egypt. If an EMP knocked everything out, then the defibrillator 'used' to revive one of the main characters would not have worked. Also, I find it strange that a soldier on the ground knew immediately that they had fallen victim to an EMP, but the general couldn't figure out why he could not communicate with his men. And why didn't the robots just knock out the entire Earth with an EMP? If they had the capability, why were they not intelligent enough to use it? Oh...right...it would have made SENSE.It just didn't fit that the robots knew some things and not others. Details that seemed critical (and integral to either the characters or settings) were left out of some scenes, and these omissions were a large part of the movie's overall failing.I also find it unpalatable when a movie calls for the destruction of major well-known cities and landmarks. Good luck integrating these major global changes into the next script.The movie ground to a halt several times for a character monologue to explain pointless things. Worse yet, too many things were introduced in the sequel that were never referenced in the first - things the robots would have known because of the traits written into the script in the first place.There were so many things in the movie that were completely unnecessary to the plot - put in just for a cheap laugh. The pot brownies? - give me a break. The Jar Jar Binks version of this film that started out as the ice cream truck? - sheesh.The dialogue was trite and predictable. I think every single action movie cliché was used. The script was simply awful, ripped off from the most predictable portions of Star Wars, James Bond and Indiana Jones, among others. And I think the producers of The Matrix should sue for copyright infringement.Finally, this movie was sophisticated only by way of the computing power necessary to create the CGI. I could go on and on (yes, even more than I already have...trust me). Do NOT waste your time and money. Thanks for reading my review.",4,2,7,5 July 2009
The Green Mile," Transcendent
","I was with John Coffey every step of the way in this movie. Michael Clark Duncan was divine, as was everybody else. Tom Hanks has definitely risen above his 'Bosom Buddies' beginnings.I cried and cried and cried and cried at the end of this movie. I felt the pain of those watching a treasure being lost. SEE THIS MOVIE. This is my 2nd favorite Stephen King book that was turned into a movie. Shawshank Redemption is the first, and that's about as perfect as a movie can be. WELL worth watching. Make sure you have a box of tissues handy for this one. Make a night of it and watch both movies. I highly recommend it.Enjoy!",9,0,1,1 May 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Wow...I'll say it again...WOW
","I can't even begin to understand this movie's detractors. This movie was fantastic, spectacular, awe-inspiring...Though I have to admit that - to me after multiple viewings over a short period of time - it's a bit ponderous (not as light and magical like 'Fellowship' that I've watched probably 100 times, and I'm still looking forward to my next viewing), but it is a stellar flick. Yes, the movies didn't stick like glue to the books, but they were far closer than I would have ever given Peter Jackson and his team credit for being able to do. The ending in RotK (theater version) skipped a big piece of the book's ending, but that would be the only big issue.People have complained that this ending took too long, but I disagree. Seeing this movie end was like saying goodbye forever to a good friend, and I was sorry that it was over. That's perhaps the first time in my adult life that I was so genuinely caught up in a movie (or trilogy, in this case) that I was genuinely sad when it ended. Yes, it took a bit of time to wind down, but I thought that was a nice, gentle way of easing the viewer out of 3 years' worth of agonized waiting to see how Peter Jackson would treat the trilogy's conclusion. I think it was a far better way to send the trilogy's fans off than the old wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am methods of most movie makers in this CGI world. It was a long journey to get to the end, and the way it was filmed was beautiful and sublime, a quality sorely lacking in movies that are top-heavy with CGI in this day and age.I heard so many people say with immobile certainty that these films will be dismissed as inferior in a matter of just a few years. As computer graphics improves, the failings of this movie will become ever more apparent, some say. While I agree that there were some parts of the movie(s) that were quite obviously CGI, I'm that much more impressed that this movie (all three of them, in fact) were able to hold me so rapt, in spite of these CGI 'issues.' That kind of stuff usually pulls me right out of a movie because it's so distracting. Kudos more to Peter Jackson and Company for making something so wonderful, in spite of the fact that Mr. Jackson's vision was a bit more than current computer technology can handle. So what? How can anybody say that these three movies will be so summarily dismissed as substandard in a matter of a few years? Is the Wizard of Oz considered trash? Its special effects are laughable by today's standards, and yet it's still considered a classic. Is Dracula (Bela Lugosi's Dracula) considered trash? Its special effects are even worse than the Wizard of Oz, yet any horror buff still considers this movie great. Or (God forbid...she's about to say something bad about STAR WARS! Blasphemer!), how many of you are willing to forsake the first (er, the fourth...whatever) in the Star Wars series even though there are some glaring problems in the special effects department by today's standards? In fact, since we're mentioning the Star Wars franchise and 'today's' technology, the special effects in the last 3 (the first 3...oh, dammit, the PRE-Darth Vader ones) were pretty cool, but still couldn't make up for horrible scripts and non-existent character development. Anyway, back to the trilogy at hand...I think brilliant story-telling transcends special effects. And this movie was brilliant. It deserved every Academy Award it got. In fact, I think the Academy should go back and give special Oscars to several of the cast members. Each actor did a wonderful job (which, by the way, surprised me a LOT...before I watched the trilogy, I would only have given Sir Ian McKellan credit for being able to pull off such an epic role), the story was engaging, the cinematography was stunning, and Peter Jackson pulled everything together beautifully (another surprise to me, considering his humble directing background). The Fellowship of the Ring took my breath away, and made me want to re-read the LOTR trilogy all over again. The Two Towers left me again reaching for the books. Same story for Return of the King. I loved all three movies, and they shall probably always be among my favorites of all time.To the naysayers, I say you're being too hard on this movie. Enjoy it for what it is: a gorgeous work of art. I think Tolkien would be proud.Thanks for reading.",9,1,3,21 November 2004
