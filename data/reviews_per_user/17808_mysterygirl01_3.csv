United 93," Disturbingly real!
",I like a lot of people had heard a lot about this movie.But I wanted to make up my own mind so I rented it out last night.I found it to be a powerful but compelling version of events that happened on a day no one will ever forget.Yes it is disturbing but only because you're not watching some bogus storyline Hollywood made up-it's disturbing because it's real and it happened but that only makes it even harder to watch but you simply cannot tear your eyes away from the screen for one second because you know that the human adversity almost overcome such evil.I can't say I enjoyed this movie but I think it is a story which had to be told-if only for us to learn from the mistakes of that day..........,8,2,4,23 December 2006
Twilight," Definitely worth seeing!
",Firstly let me say I had never heard of Twilight nor read any of the books.My friend wanted to see the movie.All I knew was it was about vampires.I was hoping it wasn't all blood sucking nonsense.Well what can I say about it?It blew me away!The story is very believable and Robert Pattison plays Edward Cullen to absolute perfection.If was Bella I'd let him take a bite!Unlike others I didn't analyze every portion of the movie.Instead I just went along for the ride.I think Kirsten Stewart is amazing as Bella and the other vampires are so believable it's scary.The love story is kind of an awkward teen angst type of thing aggravated by the fact Edward is a vampire.The movie was slow to start but 30 mins in I was hooked.I am now in the process of reading all the books and whilst the book will always be better than the movie as it fits more content I would not hesitate in recommending seeing this movie whether you have read the books or not!,9,2,5,16 January 2009
World Trade Center," tasteful!
","I saw this movie yesterday and it brought tears to my eyes.I know its had its fair share of bad reviews.I wouldn't say I enjoyed this movie but I think it is a story that had to be told.No movie about 9/11 will ever satisfy every single person but this movie focuses on the story of 2 police officers who against all odds survived in the most extreme of circumstances.The message I came out with after this movie is you always have hope even when it seems lost.Credit must go to oliver stone for making such a movie that do not glorify 9/11 nor give any mention of the terrorists.This movie made me realize yet again that there was an enormous amount of nypd,fire fighters and port authority staff who risked their own lives to save others and this would have been even harder as they had no idea the scale of the disaster.Credit must also go to nicholas cage(who I am no fan of).His performance in this movie must surely earn him an Oscar.At the end of the day this is a movie that tells a story and does it well.",10,1,4,15 October 2006
