It," Two hours of basically nothing.
","I really wanted to like this movie, I heard a lot of great reviews about 'It' and a lot of people seem to love this movie. After watching it today, I am really asking myself why.Let's start with the good things, the child actors were amazing, they gave a great performance and played their characters very naturally. 
The cinematography is gorgeous, it's a really good looking film.
But like, that's it.I think my biggest problem is that there are just too many characters, six alone in the main group of friends. I did care about maybe one of them. There just wasn't enough time to give all of them a complex and interesting character arc and I can't feel empathy for any of them, I am just sitting her trying really hard to remember their namens. I personally think this movie would work better if there was a group of two or three people, so everyone would get more 
screentime and I as a viewer would get the chance to care for them.Besides the flat and boring characters, the plot it just _fine_. Normally I am easily scared and don't watch horror movies at all, but this is just a joke. I wasn't scared once. Pennywise has potential to be scary, but the film couldn't manage to build up suspense so the 'scary' parts are just happening in front of my face and I don't know how I should react to them.Another thing for me is the kind of forced relationship between Beverly and Bill/Ben, it's just pointless. Why is it there. I have no problem with a movie build around a group of young children, but WHY does there have to be some kind of love subplot? It's irritating and unnecessary. But maybe I just didn't get it, I don't know.I just couldn't stop comparing this movie to Stranger Things. This isn't the movies fault or the casts fault, but there are just _so_ many similarities that I wasn't able to ignore it. I bet you could cut out a scene of this movie and put it in Stranger Things and nearly nobody would notice.I don't wanna sound too harsh because clearly a lot of hard work and time went into this movie and it isn't the worst thing ever, but for me it was just mediocre at best. 
If you liked Stranger Things a lot you might also like this, if you're searching for a scary horror film with an interesting plot you are wrong here.",3,1,1,21 January 2018
Spider-Man 2," Disappointed.
","Being completly new to Spider-Mans character I wanted to give myself a bit of backstory before watching the new Spider-Man: Homecoming movie and decided to start by watching the three original Spider-Man movies. While the first Spider-Man (2002) was being really enjoyable, even though very cheesy at times, Spider-Man 2 is just nothing. Stuff was happening in front of me but that's it.I think Tobey Maguire is a good Spider-Man, he has this dorky face and fits really into this nerdy outcast kind of role, but I think his performance in this movie was just bad. He had the same facial expression for 90% of the movie and while this wasn't so bad in the first one, in this movie it just got irritating. No matter if a scene was sad or shocking or intense, he always looked like he tried smiling really awkwardly for a school picture, but maybe that was just me.Mary Jane was fine as a generic love interest, I didn't really sympathise with her in the first one and I didn't in this one either, but she was fine, I wasn't bothered by her.A thing that in fact did bother me a lot was the boring and predictable subplot between Peter and MJ. I don't really get this plot because Peter clearly turned her down for her own safety at the end of the first movie but is now mad at her for dating another guy, it's ridiculous. I get that he loves her and at the same time wants her to be save but come one, you have to decide what you want.I also think the villain of this movie, Dr. Otto Octavius, was just the Green Goblin with a bit different story. Both are scientists, both want to show of their big break-throughs, both experiments went wrong, both became evil and both of them couldn't control themselves anymore all the time. I am not an comic book expert but I am sure there are a lot of other villains from the Spider-Man comics you could have used instead.Even though they tried to make the special effects look good I thought they were awful. In the first movie the effects were good because they didn't 
exaggerated them, which they did in this movie. For me, it was just too much and additionally it looked horrible at times.This movie was bearable for maybe half of the time, but when Peter started losing his powers out of the blue it got really boring. I was happy when this movie ended.Maybe it's a different thing watching the movie at the time it came out, but now in the year 2018 it's just nothing.
I decided to skip Spider-Man 3 and just watch Spider-Man: Homecoming instead and I definitely didn't regret it.It's a fine movie and no shame on you for liking it, but for me it was just disappointing after watching Spider-Man (2002).",3,4,7,21 January 2018
Avengers: Endgame," Definitely not what you would expect.
","But I can't really tell if that's a good thing or not.I appreciate that Marvel is trying something different with this movie, that they changed their working formular to create something new, but for me it sadly didn't work out.In comparison to Infinity War, Endgame is just.....nh. Disappointing.
If you've seen all the other MCU movies you might get a kick out of all the references and jokes based on those, that's the stuff I greatly enjoyed. Endgame didn't take itself and it's characters too seriously and at times this worked out really well. But regretfully, there are others parts where this change of plans destroyed the movie for me.
I don't know, turning Thor into an alcoholic, lazy dude who does nothing besides playing Fortnite (yes, Fortnite is in this movie) all day just isn't funny at all and ruins the hard work Taika Waititi has put into him. I also hate what they did to Hulk/Banner, I always thought Banner was an extremly likeable and interesting character, but in this movie I couldn't stand him.
Most of the other characters are just _fine_, Tony and Steve being the only ones who really stand out. Endgame gives either of those characters important decisions to make and their dynamic is absolutely entertaining.
Steve's ending though was just awful. Not only was it predictable ever since we knew time travel would be part of the plot, it wasn't satisfying at all. Steve leaving his two best friends behind, who he hadn't seen in f i v e years, just to hang with the girl he met for a few weeks eighty years ago AFTER he already made out with her niece is just unbearable. Awful. Why would you do that.I liked the ending they gave Tony, it was fitting for his character and regarding his importance for the whole MCU he deserved a big goodbye.
To be honest, I would've liked it more if they gave Steve the big, heroic death and let Tony live in retirement with his family but hey, whatever.So in conclusion, after first watching it I really expected more. This just wasn't the big ending I was promised, it was weird at times and overall fine at best. I don't think it was necessary to make it three hours long. The Russo Brothers directed all of my favourite MCU movies so far, but this one was a total miss.
Wouldn't recommend if you're not a fan.",4,219,519,24 April 2019
