Alien 3," A quick change of pace, which may leave the viewer confused.
","This film had me stepping back a bit to try and understand exactly how it happened. One of the main problems I had was the Alien's sudden change in it's life cycle. Not only was the creature born of a dog (in some versions of the film, an Ox) but it emerged immediately as an adult. There was no larval stage. I am also trying to understand why an Ox would ever be hanging out on a trans-galaxy prison ship. I do however find this version of the alien nearly twice as terrifying, as it moves at lighting speed, can climb walls and ceilings, and is a force to be reckoned with. Although the use of CGI is quite often visible, I wouldn't necessarily say it took away from the film. Definitely not one of the best in the Alien series, but probably my least favorite.",5,0,2,12 March 2017
Alien: Resurrection," A new, almost separate film that will excite anyone.
","This movie was an unusual twist for the Alien series. It's almost as if someone wrote a fan-fiction and the plot and structure was used in the film. Don't get me wrong, there is probably more Alien engagement in this movie than any of the previous three films. The ending of course being a very infamous scene. I would say this is a pretty good film, but again I must stress that it seemed rather separate from the original series. I truly have to appreciate the fact that there is more creature feature and not as much human solution.",7,1,1,18 March 2017
Alien," An Instant Classic
","As I stated, 'Alien' is probably one of my most favorite horror movies, and series. The original movies keep you on the edge of your seat, using the dark and the unknown as a weapon against your mind. You never know if the creature will be right around the corner. It also adds little extra 'details' that you never expect just to make being trapped on the ship even more of a frightening experience. Definitely recommend this one, not only is it a great film, but it gets you hooked on the entire series as well.",8,0,1,12 March 2017
Predator," One of the best
","Depending on how enveloped you are in the AvP movies, you might like it even more, but this really is an awesome film. The monster has plenty of screen time, and it keeps you intrigued throughout the entire run time, which many movies fail to do. Beautiful design of the alien hunter, and a wonderfully awesome concept, which is probably why it's been so successful over the years. I recommend it to anyone who is a freak for aliens and science fiction, and if you like the Alien series, you will like this one~",8,1,1,17 April 2018
Aliens," A Masterpiece of Suspense
","Very rarely do I give a movie, a book, or anything a perfect 10/10. For this film however, I will make an exception. You really get attached to the characters in this one, and the monster action and designs are top notch. I could watch this film again and again and not get bored, and watching films more than once is also a rare thing for me. I may sound biased because I'm already a fan of the alien series, but give it a try! I assure you won't be disappointed.",10,1,3,12 March 2017
Alien vs. Predator," I'd say one of the better movies from the Alien and Predator films.
","This movie came out back when I was still rather young, and being a fan of both the Alien and Predator series, I couldn't wait to watch it. While I agree with some users on it's lack of acting quality and such, I really don't see why someone would give this film such a low rating. It has the best of both worlds, Alien and Predator action and violence, and a decent plot as well. The setting is rather odd and random, but that wasn't really problem for me. I really enjoyed this film.",7,1,2,12 March 2017
Toy Story 4," Touching
","Husband and I went to the late show to see this one together. We loved it! It's heartwarming and keeps a steady and suspenseful pace. There aren't any boring parts. A few what the heck moments sure, but nothing too crazy. I hope you don't hate dummies or creepy dolls though, this movie is filled with them! However, it isn't to the degree that children and parents alike can't enjoy the film together. I highly recommend it, for those who enjoy the works of Pixar and those who don't. you won't regret it :)",8,29,53,1 July 2019
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Slightly Disappointing
","As many have said, this film will never give the original any justice. The bringing of the Tyrannosaurus to the city is a clear renewal of the 1920's silent film, 'The Lost World'. It was based on the original Sir Arthur Conan Doyle book of the same name, which involves a live brontosaurus being brought to London, and inevitably escapes to wreak havoc. This film is a good example of the STUPIDITY of mankind. Oh, sure, lets bring a loud, injured young Tyrannosaurus right into our camp, that won't lead to trouble at all, no way! We're scientists. Not to mention the whole bus hanging from the cliff scene went on for waaaaay too long. It was as if a good quarter of the movie was the team hanging on a rope over the side of a cliff and trying not to fall to their deaths. Climb the stupid rope or don't. Someone always goes sliiiiiiiiiiiiiding back down to the bottom right as they get near the top. We get it, its suspenseful but it doesn't have to be annoying.It isn't a TERRIBLE movie, but its definitely my least favorite from the film series.",4,8,15,4 September 2018
A Bug's Life," Always root for the under-ant
","Ahhh yes, another childhood animated classic film. Don't get me wrong, a Bug's Life isn't perfect by any means, at least not in the adults point of view. However, it has some aspects that anyone could relate to, being adamant about change and passionate about people, but feeling small and inadequate to the point you feel hope is lost. I feel its a good film to watch with your children, because it gives off good subliminal messages. Don't give up, regardless of how hard life beats you down. Not to mention the bugs are interesting to view and learn about, for what you do get to learn. Definitely recommend!",7,1,2,29 July 2018
The Descent," Surprising!
","We're all afraid of what lives deep in the oceans, we're all afraid of what may live out in space, but you really have to respect this film in exploiting the fears of what may live deep in the earths crust. The movie is really scientifically accurate (if you're not a nerd like me though, that probably doesn't matter). I love the design of the monsters, they're like some kind of bat-human hybrid. The movie has plenty of suspense, infuriating moments and character situations, and monster creature screen time, which is what people like me want the most. Definitely recommend!",6,1,2,14 March 2018
War of the Worlds," For once, a decent remake
","I don't think I've ever secretly wanted a child in a movie to die as much as I wanted 'Rachel' to. I know kids are annoying, but oh my god. Onto the movie though, as a science fiction freak, I have seen the original War of the Worlds, and love the older more original films. That being said, most remakes don't usually make my cut, but this one I think does. It is fast paced and easily followed. The Tripods are awesome and terrifying, and the martians themselves...well they look a lot different from what you would expect. Its a great film to watch while having pizza with friends, but it also really makes you think too. What kind of creatures must exist out there in the open universe? Its also highly ironic and frightening to know that, as with anyone who is familiar with the story will tell you, they truly are indestructible. Their demise was not due to humans, but to a mistake they made themselves. If not for that, the earth would be theirs.",7,1,3,10 September 2018
Kong: Skull Island," A bit unrealistic...
","So for me, this movie is one that I can't give ALL my respect to. Not only am I a Paleontologist, I'm also a science fiction lover. If we are looking at the same Kong that we have seen in various other films, I think my question is the same posed as many others...how is he so impossibly huge all of a sudden? He went from being 25 or 30 feet tall to almost 500 feet? What in the world? Also the creature designs were interesting and I really liked them! But they seemed to be a bit out of place for this film. They would have made more sense if they were on an alien planet, and it kinda irritates me that John Goodman refers to them as 'ancient species'. Now one thing I really did enjoy was the aboriginal skull islanders, their designs for war paint and garb were very creative. Their communication without language gave the film a bit of a spice up in its uniqueness. So overall, the film was pretty great, I just don't feel like it can be connected to any type of King Kong prequels, and just kinda seems to have appeared out of thin air. I really liked it, but its underlying senses were a bit disappointing.",6,0,1,3 July 2017
Finding Dory," Film tends to drag on a bit, Snooze-fest for me.
","I'm not going to say that this movie was just a total waste of time...but about 85% of the film was. Coming from me, a person who is extremely passionate about science and biology wouldn't appreciate the constant factual errors in the film. Dory and other fish friends of hers could never tolerate the constant changing in water quality from hopping from tank to tank. Whale sharks are not whales, either. One thing that got to be a bit annoying was the tank jumping, because that's almost all that we see. Every couple of moments, either Dory or Marlin and Nemo are hopping from tank to tank at the aquarium, or flying in a bucket of water carried by sea foul. It's a constant aspect. Not to mention we have an octopus who can breathe for an undetermined amount of time. Also, forgive me but, how did no one notice an unattended baby stroller with tentacles flailing about from it, and no nearby adults? I understand most of the American population is rather dunce, but jeez, give commoners some kind of credit.Anyways, it was a sweet story and heartwarming ending, but the movie was mostly repetitive nonsense and persistence. Not my walk in the park.",4,0,2,7 May 2017
The Iron Giant," A beautiful 90's classic
","Taking place seemingly in the 1950's, this film literally has a little something for everyone. It's supposed to be for children, yes, but even older audiences can appreciate a film like this. It has aspects of wonderful science fiction action and adventure. I would say its a somewhat emotional movie as well. The giant is obviously sent to invade the earth and attack humans, but because of the 'bump on his head', he has forgotten his mission and is, as a child, slowly exploring the world around him and beginning to understand the facts of life. I've seen this film literally about 50 times since I was a kid, to the present day, and I can safely say, even watching it as an adult, that its a wonderful movie for the family of all ages to enjoy together.",7,3,4,17 September 2018
Signs," Greatly put together, but somewhat boring plot
","As my headliner says, this movie was oddly enough, pretty good. You couldn't go to a movie store or blockbuster in the early 2000's and not see at least an advertisement for this movie. It was really big. That being said, I was actually pretty impressed when I finally sat down and watched it with my boyfriend. My main issue is that the aliens themselves seem to be the secondary issue that is somewhat overlooked, while the actual hysteria caused by their presence seems to cause more issues than anything else. We're watching the movie and everything is going along good, but near the end, we suddenly hear on the radio that the aliens are leaving earth. You never see any ships, and you only get quick glimpses at the aliens themselves. I feel like this was a pretty decent movie, but there is so much more that could have been done with it.",6,0,1,22 July 2018
Jurassic Park," Classic
","A Childhood staple film for me, Jurassic Park has become one of the most successful film franchises of all time. Nowadays there are hundreds of people who share a type of cult following to the film. Famed Paleontologist Jack Horner assisted in the design of the dinosaurs, and his expertise really helped make it feel more realistic. Jurassic Park isn't just a film, it's like a gateway into the imagination of a child that we can all share a piece of. Even today, parents and child alike can both share in this wonderful masterpiece. Yes, some are eaten and killed by dinosaurs, but not in such a horrific and graphic way that would make a child too uncomfortable. It also serves us who are a tad more scientifically oriented, as a reminder of how precious and delicate life is. How we shouldn't be so quick to try and achieve things simply because they are possible...but shouldn't really be achieved due to our humanity. It's truly a landmark film for dinosaur lovers everywhere, young and old.",8,0,0,4 September 2018
Alien: Covenant," I will admit, I was a bit disappointed.
","There are a number of reasons why this film didn't really sit well with me. First of all, there isn't nearly enough information to really give you an idea of what is going on in the beginning of the film. It's as if you've already missed the first 25% of the film when you begin watching the movie. The creature itself, when first introduced, looks...a bit silly. It is born of a fungus, instead of a parasitic face hugger. The original design for the creature is not introduced at all until near the end of the film, and only for a short time. I feel like the entire film focused more on the androids (artificial humans) more than it did the battle between humans and the alien creature. The plot was a great idea at first, but it slowly became more obvious where the movie was headed, and I really wish they would have kept the alien legacy alive instead of trying to make this new, unattractive ridiculous version. Wasn't so pleased in the end.",5,8,14,30 May 2017
