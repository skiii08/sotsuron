Your Name.," Two star crossed lovers that travel through time.
","Beware. You might be ugly crying by the end of this one! It pulls on your heart strings from the very first scene in the film. The story weaves effortlessly back and forth between two people, telling a tale of star crossed love, a god of time and two of the most memorable characters I have seen in an Anime in a long time. The artistic direction leaves you feeling breathless at points with beautiful juxtiposition between the rural and city lifestyles the characters live in. The music score and direction in this film are key selling points, both beautiful and haunting. With key pieces placed in all the right places. I was glued to the edge of my seat the entire movie. I was never in a rush to get to the next scene, I just took it in, in all its glory and in the end it left me completely satisfied.",10,3,6,18 January 2017
