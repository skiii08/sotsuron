The Young Victoria," Disappointed
","It was difficult to see any reason why this film should be deemed anything more than ok. It told a story but that's all it did, developments in the plot were told in a rather boring way, I may as well have watched a documentary. The storylines are not developed and it seems their 'enduring love story' was squeezed into the last 20 minutes. I believe that there are much better depictions of the Victoria and Albert love story out there. This film feels as though it was been made especially to appeal to the Hollywood ideal of Britain and it's Monarchy.",3,0,0,21 April 2020
A Star Is Born," Captivating but some shortcuts
","I was captivated by the wonderful performances of both Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, their chemistry was very convincing and their voices absolutely superb. The songs were wonderful and the story was beautifully constructed around the music. My only criticism would have to be that the ending feels a little rushed: Jackson Maine's suicide seemed more to be attributed to hearing harsh words from Ally's manager, rather than due to his painful addiction, and there is little resolution for Ally in terms of her returning to her talent and realising that she doesn't need to change anything about herself.",9,0,0,11 April 2020
The Favourite," Great acting
",One of Olivia Coleman's best performances. Wonderful story and was left wanting more but think the ending matched the film well. Not an easy watch but thought provoking.,8,1,3,17 February 2020
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," Wonderful story
","A wonderfully touching story with just the right mix of love, friendship and adventure. I found that the acting was pretty good and the cast had great chemistry. The historical element was fascinating and it is always great to see a female lead with an empowering story. I found myself wanting to see how their story progresses even after the film had finished.",8,0,0,13 June 2020
The Breakfast Club," Disappointing
","This film was obviously ground-breaking in its time. However, it is not comparable to the quality of film-making today. I only sat through this film because it's a classic. I understand it touched on revolutionary themes at the time and I can appreciate that, but a lot less was needed for a film to qualify as 'good' in the 80s than is needed now, and this film has made that evident to me. It includes several clich√©s that would be unacceptable to today's audiences. As well as this there a holes in the characters stories which allow for poor character development.",4,1,2,15 May 2020
