The Avengers," This is a modern world 'EPIC'...!!
","The fans of the franchise now, have another reason to smile, this time an even bigger one!! :-)Ever since the trailer of The Avengers went on air, from that very day I had been watching it daily twice at least. Already knowing that its got to be a fantastic film...somewhere I feared that hype often kills it!!Thank God!! Nothing like that happened...instead, I, after finally having watched the awesome Superhero flick, feel that this one was under hyped!!!Its a waayyyyyy tooo goooooddd!!!!! One of the best kick-ass action flicks EVER!F***!!! I don't have words enough to describe the excitement I'm in right now. Brilliant it is! Anyone who has ever read any Superhero comic book in his life, GO SEE the movie...Having dazzling set designs all amazingly well crafted into one package, director Joss Whedon to my amazement has given this Superhero feast, a nice new treatment. And that is that The Avengers despite having been put into Genres like Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi, surprise, surprise, it is Extremely funny too...I knew Tony Stark(aka Iron Man) would be delivering some witty lines here and there, but never was I expecting it to be sooo hilarious!! Amazing work!!6 Superheroes, the earth to save, It has EVERYTHING a fan-boy would ever ask for, even more!!After having successfully introduced us to Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America in their individual ventures, Marvel studios have done a brilliantly good job by developing this unbelievable spectacle!!One more thing that I would specially appreciate about The Avengers is that EVERY superhero gets his/her deserving screen space! Nobody was overshadowing.Iron Man is techy, Hulk is destructive, Thor being a Demi-god it must have been a really difficult task to group them up along with Black Widow, Hawkeye and Captain America who are already used to obeying orders. Plus with all that being in place initially they had their egos clashing against one another. Having all that resolved, the enemy is Loki, brother of Thor, there were Supernatural creatures that had to be blended within the perimeters of the world that had been developed. Man, this would have been one hell of a tough job!!Spectacular, jaw dropping action, excellent fun, smart and witty dialogues make this Superhero extravaganza a treat to watch!! Exceeds all expectations.I'm still working on believing it! It was that good... And well, I don't know if I should tell this in public but I, literally was sitting on the seat like a little child, clapping, whistling and laughing my lungs out, enjoying every scene of the movie.There is sooo much to write about but that would be unnecessary i guess, so only one suggestion in the end.....Don't miss this!!This definitely couldn't be any better. Hats off to Joss Whedon, the cast who delivered their performances with a panache and to the Marvel crew!!!This was by far the most entertaining memorable movie I have seen in my life!! Will cherish this for long..... I wish I had my friends with me...huh!! Nevermind..!! ;-)The Avengers.....Go!! Go!! Go!!!",10,10,21,30 April 2012
