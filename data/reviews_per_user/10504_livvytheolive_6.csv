Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," A masterpiece
","It is an amazing out of this world film ever i did not give it a ten though because i do not think it is the best film in the world but it is amazing for all ages.Jonhy Depp is an amazing Jack Sparrow in the film and Kiera Knitley and Orlando Bloom are brilliant too. This film is about Davy Jones heart in a chest and the chest's key and Jack is trying to get hold of it while fighting the Kracken and many other creatures and shipmates, as they set sail on another journey for the Dead Mans Chest. Brilliant special effects and storyline, hilarious script and brilliant settings.As Captain Barbosa appears at the end for a particular twist.",9,0,2,3 December 2006
Van Helsing," an amazing film!
","It was the best vampire film I've ever seen! i love the graphics,locations,environment,special effects and the costumes! i think Hugh Jackman (Van Helsing) is great for the Van Helsing part because his previous X-men films are amazing! The script and parts were slightly funny a times.It all starts when Frankenstein's 'Monster' is in the windmill trying to save Dr Frankenstein then the people burn it down and it has no choice so it jumps and everyone thinks he is dead.Meanwhile citizens all think Van Helsing is a murderer after killing Mr Hide/Dr Jekel.Then he says he is here to help,Then all of a sudden vampires come and attack.I recommend this film for you as it is awesome!",10,2,5,26 December 2006

I love it love it love it! i do like night crawler but sadly he isn't in this film he is in X2.i like the part when they were fighting at the end with all of the other bad guys.i really really REALLY! recommend this film for you i watched it at the cinema ages and ages ago but it is fab!",10,1,2,26 December 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," brilliant film
","This is a brilliant film for all the family,it has a masterpiece of special effects.This film is amazing and it is quality,Daniel Radcliff is an amazing actor he is so young but very good and so is the others. it is about a Tri-Wizard Tournament but it is very deadly and some people have even died trying to get though the Tournament and the Goblet Of Fire draws out names of who is entering and once the are in there is no turning back. it is an brilliant film with excellent script settings and storyline.It can get a bit boring for some people on the dialog but it was probably the 4th film ever that i have not got bored on all the long dialog(there is only a bit of this in the film).",9,0,1,3 December 2006
Casino Royale," an excellent Bond movie
","Its a an amazing movie because they all do there own stunts witch are brilliant. Before Casino Royale was made there were bad comments that the new Bond would not make a good Bond but since the movie came out it seems people like him. The film has violence and kissing and stuff,but the moves were amazing.There was a great storyline script and settings.At first before i saw the movie i thought i was going to find it boring but in the end i felt like WOW that was brilliant!.People who really love action,Bond and mission movies will really enjoy this film. I recommend it to all the family and your friends you will really enjoy it I did! Because i used to not really like Bond but now I've changed my mind.",9,0,1,5 December 2006
