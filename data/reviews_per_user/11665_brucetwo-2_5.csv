Blade Runner 2049," A Misogynistic Video Game--more set-pieces than plot or story
","Does this director hate women?--they mostly get killed. On the other hand, the main character is always getting shot, but in the next scene he's always unwounded and whole--ready to shot people again.
Lots of spacey sets and art-direction--just a set-up for the next chase scene or battle scene. Made by/for the Video-Game generation. I wonder if any people working on this film ever actually read any Philip K. Dick.
And whats the point of the 'epic' battle scene near the end where the flying car is sinking in water and the 'hero' gets to strangle to evil woman person/android/robot--whatever underwater?
Seems like a video-game made by/for a 14-year-old boy--kick butt and kill women and be an altruistic martyr.",3,6,13,17 February 2018
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," I didn't like it--too one-note--not like the book at all--a 'Bromance'?
","I like art films, and I like original movies. And slow films too. I loved TREE OF LIFE-- a very unusual, original movie, and a heartfelt one. But I did not like this re-booting of 'Tinker Tailor'. Admittedly, I read the novel years ago, and then watched the TV series with Alec Guinness, which I enjoyed--even though it had to compress a bunch of the subtler stuff from the book.But THIS version of 'TTSS' I did not like--for lots of reasons--the insistence on dreary sets and muted colors--after a while, wasn't it laid on a bit thick? I mean--no contrast to anything else--just hitting us over the head with 'DREARY'--they'd made their point! Also, the main character actors--all chosen or made up to have very strange, unattractive-looking faces and weird-shaped heads. Even the Bill (mole) character has this greasy hair and dowdy clothes--not something emphasized in the book.But mostly they changed the PLOT from the book and from the first Alec Guinness adaptation. --Instead of being a spy-thriller/detective story with plot resolution--the exposure of the Mole and more important, the SURRENDER of CARLA to the Smiley character, the director turns this movie into a smarmy 'Bromance' about dumped gay lovers and betrayal of male relationships. And this is presented in very soapy fashion. It's like go from Le Carre to Dougls Sirk! And the film completely leaves out the story of CARLA's daughter and how Smiley discovers this master spy's one vulnerability--his concern for his daughter, and how this ultimately trumps his allegiance to the Soviet State and to his spy craft. NONE of this is in the current movie! Instead of CARLA being vanquished by Smiley's dogged intelligence and patience by the end of the film, we get the unexplained and rather hurried capture of Bill with his handler in the Safe House apartment (we aren't really told how exactly Bill is cornered--we just show that he is). And Smiley's rehiring and promotion as head of MI6.The whole subplot of Smiley's wife Ann is mostly told off-screen, (and thus we do not see how Smiley's vulnerability to Ann mirrors CARLA's vulnerability for his own daughter)--And the Ann actress and character herself never appear in the film. --Except for a shot of her very clothed rear end at a Christmas party. Even the killing of the traitor at the end is changed from the book and soaped-up with tears, to make a different emphasis in the story.Is this meant to be a 'Gay' film? --I don't know. But it's not Le Carre's novel! It's like the director or the screenwriter read the book and could only relate to certain parts of it and then added other stuff more to their own taste.And--here's a really unpopular opinion from me:--I thought Gary Oldman's performance was more wooden than expressive or exhausted. The longer I saw his face the more I thought how thick his makeup seemed to be. Alec Guinness was not made up with rubber prosthetics for his movie! And at the end of the film the Smiley character is sitting at the 'Boss's'desk --formerly occupied by Control--smiling in triumph and satisfaction, as if he's vanquished his enemies at the office and become 'the winner' over the other guys. --This again is hardly the point that Le Carre made in his novel, or about the Cold War, or about spies! Perhaps this should be a scene for the Dwight character from 'The Office' TV show.",3,0,0,4 April 2012
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Loud, Talky Film. By and For Actors
","Actors like to be in scenes with lots of closeups of their faces. They also like scenes with lots of intense, impassioned dialog. This film--Birdman_- is full of scene after scene with two actors shouting into each others' faces, about six inches away from the other actor's noses.This does not necessarily make for a good film. I thought the whole thing was at best uneven. And kind of self-conscious. I never felt I identified with any of these people, or enjoyed them much either.If you want to see a really GOOD and ENJOYABLE movie on the same theme and story--check out Bob Fosse's 'ALL THAT JAZZ.'--Much better!",5,2,7,24 March 2015
Before Sunrise," Surprised that I loved this film
","I just watched this on DVD. I saw the 'sequel' first--BEFORE SUNSET--a couple years ago. I'm (now) much older than the characters in this film and I thought I might find it corny or overdone--but it really got to me--but like in a natural, kind of subtle way. I guess I really believed it or identified with it. It didn't seem like just a fantasy fulfillment movie--which Hollywood is so good at doing.All the next day it made me feel kind of high and happy--after watching this movie. And of course,every attractive female I saw all that day I thought we'd suddenly fall in love with each other.--Too bad--it did not happen!I was in Europe with my girlfriend one summer quite a few years back, and I've had to travel alone on bus, trains and even via thumb through the US over the years. Nothing quite so dramatic or romantic ever happened to me when I was alone, but even so, I think this movie captured a lot of that feeling.",10,1,3,4 February 2012
Inside Llewyn Davis," self-indulgent. They must hate folk music and folk musicians
","OK--yet another wimpy young Jewish male who feels 'oppressed' and 'misunderstood' by his middle-class affluent relatives and milieu. Get a clue Coen Brothers--you've already done this theme to death!! And Todd Haynes or is it Todd Solenz did it better--'White Palace, Welcome to the Dollhouse and all that. A So did Woody Allen!!--Deconstructing Harry.What a wimp your Llewellen is!! The credits and promos said you were inspired by Dave Van Ronk's autobiography-MAYOR OF MACDOUGAL STREET. But did you guys even READ that book. Van Ronk wasn't some whiney, thumb-sucking foetal-position loser. Van Ronk was, among other things, a merchant marine, a jazz musician and an influential folk performer and guitar arranger.The plot of your movie was genuinely less-than-zero. Llewellen gets two girlfriends pregnant and he discovers that his current squeeze, or current-ex, has been screwing around with several guys, behind his back. And thus more wimpy whining from Llewellen.And the MUSIC in this film genuinely sucks., Except fro one song in one moment in this long, self-indulgent tedious movie, what music there is is really grating and purposefully BAD and annoying--whether it is untypically nasal Irish keening or something else. The only listenable music in the whole film is one exact copy of a Van Ronk recording.T-Bone Burnette did a great job of making and collecting the music for 'Oh Brother Where Art Thou' and the soundtrack for that has lasted much longer than that movie itself. But whatever input Burnett had to the music for this 'Llewellen' film must have been minimal.The viewer--and listener--gets the impression that the Coen Brothers either HATE folk music, or else they are very JEALOUS of folk musicians and wanted to make a movie to put them down or make them look stupid. What a let-down. Hope you guys do better next time. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.",1,4,9,8 March 2015
