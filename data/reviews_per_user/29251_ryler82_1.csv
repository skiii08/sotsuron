Requiem for a Dream," Totally mind blowing
","well what can i say... the movie just blowed me away. totally. And all credit to the director making it a totally awesome movie. Paying attention to the parts like when the characters are doing drugs. Like snorting the coke, preparing the heroine, rolling a joint, those small clips that appear for a brief moment in flashes.People who've seen the movie will know what i am talking about... and providing the amazing sound effects at that very moment... REally amazing..The best parts in the movie were supported by the most beautiful music.. Complementing the scenes just rightly and almost perfectly. Truly beautiful music. i made sure i downloaded the music onto my computer. This movie does make u aware of what drugs can do to you. But my question to others who have watched this movie or the makers of this film is whether it is truly enjoyed more when u've smoked up and totally stonned???",9,0,1,18 May 2005
