Ghost," Not better the second time around
","There are some films you enjoy seeing a second time - or even more. This flick is not one of them for me. I remember reading a reviewer's comment about Patrick Swayze (I believe Leonard Maltin, either regarding this movie or 'Dirty Dancing') describing Swayze's acting range 'from A to B.'That, plus the fact that upon seeing this movie again, after a long passage of time, I realized how summarily unappealing the characters and performances were in this picture. You can't have a more fictional premise than the lead character and others walking around while dead - but, nevertheless, there should have been some evidence of just what the hell Swayze did in his supposed high-finance job. Tony Goldwyn seemed to know more than Swayze, but his efforts seemed solely centered on money laundering, the crux of the story.Whoopi Goldberg provided nothing funny, or even the least bit believable - especially in the scene where her bizarre character bumbled her way through drawing a bank check for multi-millions, from the manager, with less effort detailed than you'd have cashing a small check in your home bank, where you know everyone and appear twice a week.Despite the steamy scene with both leads drenching themselves with the soft, wet clay which Demi Moore was sculpting, there was zero chemistry between the two lovebirds. And the enjoyment of this scene was simply demonstrating two very attractive persons in a rather unusual, spontaneous romantic interlude. Beyond that, even this scene lacked any 'chemistry,' or even a trace of emotion on Swayze's part. The nature of this story is worth perhaps a 7* rating for viewing it the first time - but 4* is generous for a subsequent one.",4,2,7,5 November 2006
Casablanca," It's simply ---- GREAT
","This movie can only be described as GREAT - and it gets even better with the passage of time and the more you see it. The tone of the story, and the presentation of the legendary Bogart persona, and his most famous characterization, Rick, the American ex-patriot owner of the famous Casablanca night club, is completely exemplified in two early scenes. The essence of 'cool' and 'authoritative,' Rick is in the private area of his establishment. Sitting alone at a chess board, he nods to his large guardian (in Mideastern attire and fez) at the entry door as to whether persons seeking entry are to be permitted or not. One man, tall and pompous, a key official (perhaps the head) of Deutsche Bank, gets a 'no' nod from Rick. As he protests, Rick joins the guard at the door, and indicates the man must limit his patronage to the bar. As the man, protesting still, hands Rick his card, Rick rips it and tosses the pieces aside. The arrogant big-shot shouts, 'What!? Do you know who I am!?' Rick,/Bogie replies with his unique look and tone, 'I do; you're lucky the bar's open to you!!'Next, Peter Lorre, as the smarmy, little, shady character, Ugarte, sits down at Rick's table. He has the 'Letters of Transit' which he later gives to Rick for keeping, and which comprise a key element to this story. But before this, conversing, he says to Rick, in his quiet nasal voice, 'You despise me, don't you?' To which Bogie replies, 'Oh, if I gave you any thought, I probably would.'It would be worth watching the entire film if only those two brief exchanges were all there was to enjoy. But they are only a preliminary to a picture and story which have offered everything one could desire, but even more as time passes. The drama, the depiction of the mood of the time and feeling of WW II, and sensational performances from the four principals - Bogart, Bergman, Rains and Henreid - and Lorre, Greenstreet, Wilson, Veidt, and the remainder of the supporting cast, all provide one of the most entertaining couple of hours you can find, regardless of medium or period presented.Regarding this turbulent time during the maturation of WW II in Europe and northern Africa - as an historical, nostalgic representation of that part of our history, and this film's representation of the best of Hollywood's craft during that era - it provides us more to appreciate today than it did when produced, or when it may have been viewed during years past, and closer to the time period of the story.If someone were to place a gun to my head and demand a criticism of any aspect of this film, the only thing I could cite would be the thought that Henreid's Victor character show perhaps a bit more energy and charisma. Henreid was one of Hollywood's most suave, virile, 'continental' characters, and the man who was already noted for his lighting two cigarettes simultaneously, for Bette Davis and him in 'Now Voyager.' In 'Casablanca' we are given to assume that the fate of the free world may hinge on his patriotic, underground leadership, and that the Nazis must fear his abilities more than Eisenhower's or Montgomery's. Granted he would have been low-key in not wanting to stir-up the authorities while seeking to leave - but Paul seemed to 'lower the key' a bit more than he might have in his performance. However, this is minor, and in no way diminishes this film's greatness.",10,4,5,26 August 2006
As Good as It Gets," 364th vote
","With 363 preceding comments at this time, everything which can be said about this film is undoubtedly included somewhere among them.I would add that Jack Nicholson's performance is among the best of perhaps the finest actor of our time. The two primary co-stars, Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear provide equally-competent, engaging performances, along with Cuba Gooding, Shirley Knight, and everyone in the remaining supporting cast.It is a very long movie, nearly 2-1/3 hours in length - but so enjoyable it seems like one of those shorter hour-and-a-half films. This is a true test of a completely-enjoyable presentation - and thankfully, the producers didn't try to cut its length to conform to a more normal movie theater show schedule.The entire story, all of the characters, and their relationships with one another, one-on-one or in some sort of grouping, entertain without pause or exception during the entire film.'Melvin' and all his cohorts are a group you're not likely to forget.{Some of the folks on this site have characterized Helen Hunt's character/performance as 'annoying.' Ms. Hunt is not my favorite actress, but while agreeing her character here was annoying - I would add that I feel this was a necessary, understandable component of her character. Here was a waitress, living with New York expenses, commuting from one borough to another, and with a son with a bad case of asthma, hospital emergency runs, etc. (I have family experience with such asthmatic-triggered emergencies, although thankfully, without her character's financial and insurance problems.) All of the circumstances surrounding her life and work would certainly provide this sort of comportment. Further, since most of her character's displays of an 'annoying' demeanor were with Melvin, a rich, neurotic individual, obsessed with self-centered trivialities, she couldn't logically avoid being impatient and less-than-empathetic to his seemingly (to her) relatively petty frustrations.}",10,0,1,2 December 2006
The Rookie," One of the best of this genre
","This movie has several things going for it. It is a 'feel good' story. The characters and actors are likable, realistic and present fine performances. Most important, I believe, is that Dennis Quaid knows how to grip and throw a baseball. Robert Redford looked good both throwing and swinging a bat in 'The Natural, and so did Kevin Costner in 'For Love of the Game' and 'Bull Durham.' In 'Major League,' Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen looked like they knew what they were doing, but many of the others did not, and that picture was pure silliness - and not very funny. So many earlier baseball movies, even where the stories might be interesting, presented such a lack of baseball ability on the part of the leads, they were ludicrous in this respect. In 'The Stratton Story' and 'Strategic Air Command,' Jimmy Stewart looked about as believable as a professional baseball player, as your overweight, non-athletic, elderly uncle in the softball game at the family reunion. Other virile and physically robust stars (e.g., Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig; Robald Reagan as Grover Cleveland Alexander; and Dan Dailey as Dizzy Dean) also exhibited a degree of baseball ability that would put them in the late rounds while 'choosing-up' for a game at the Sunday picnic (even if coed, and even if your uncle were involved). The scenes of Quaid's high school team he coached, the ones where he attends his tryout with the Devil Rays, and those with him playing in two minor leagues and in the American League, all ring true. The participants are believable and capable. In addition, he is an engaging actor who always delivers a talented and appropriate characterization (except, to a degree, some of his 'over-the-top' scenes, and his forced accent, in his portrayal of Jerry Lee Lewis). But he's definitely on-target here, and this movie is a '9,' as good, or better, as any others of this genre, except for 'The Natural.'",9,2,3,9 August 2006
Rocky V," Continued the decline
","Like many others, I became a complete fan of the 'Rocky' saga from original film on. All who have followed boxing know that the original was inspired by the New Jersey club fighter, Chuck Wepner, who fought the great Muhammad Ali and knocked the champion down. However, Wepner was also known as the 'Bayonne Bleeder,' because of the amount of punches he absorbed, with his propensity to cut easily.The original took this a step further, made the fight a 'split decision,' and 'II' portrayed Rocky's successful rematch with the 'Ali' figure, Carl Weathers' Apollo Creed. After losing the title and regaining it from Mr. T in 'III,' number 'IV' turned pretty ludicrous. The death of Creed at the hands of the Soviet 'super-human' indicated a lack of information and forethought on the part of those involved, even in the more secretive Cold War period. And Rocky's training on the Russian steppes in the dead of winter, and the whole bout in Moscow were also outrageous.However, 'V' here, in my opinion, missed the mark others have accorded it. First, even allowing for Stallone's acting style, and some intended exaggerations in the Rocky persona, it is too far beyond belief that Rocky would undergo such extreme metamorphoses as his fortunes rise and fall.In 'III,' continuing after he won Creed's title in 'II,' his dress, demeanor, speech, and overall sophistication, are on a level with, Pierce Brosnan wearing the $7,000 suits, in his Bond flicks. Rocky's grammar and speech patterns also seem to have improved from the original goon/dropout to those of somebody who may possess a degree from the Ivy League.But in 'V', his financial fortunes have taken a reversal. Rock seems to believe he has no alternatives between plush living and luxuries, Saville Row tailoring, and good diction and grammar --- and looking like his clothes came from Goodwill, living in a tenement, and speaking like a street person from 'Oliver Twist,' sans accent, or William Bendix, the Brooklyn lug in an old WW II movie.Even a modicum of consistency in the lead character should have been maintained, despite his varying circumstances.I'd give the original 10*, 'II' 9 or 10*, 'III' 8 to 9*, 'IV' 4* and this one the same. From what I've heard, the new film ('Rocky Balboa'), recently shown in advance premier, to be released several weeks hence, gets well back on-track. Hope so!",4,3,7,19 November 2006
The Natural," Should be even better than a '10'
","I recently saw this film - I never tire of seeing it again - with a friend who visited me for a weekend. He and I had played baseball together in college, and he's as big a baseball fan as I am. But for some inexplicable reason, he'd never seen this film, so we watched my DVD on a Saturday afternoon.First, it's far and away the best baseball flick, ever - not because 'Pride of the Yankees,' 'The Rookie,' 'Bull Durham,' or 'For Love of the Game' weren't excellent - but because it is such a terrific story, and because Robert Redford gives a sensational performance, and can really look like a talented pro in swinging a bat and throwing/fielding a baseball. (Incidentally, of the above movies, the last Costner film didn't gain the popularity of praise of the others, but I still found it excellent, and like Redford, Kevin can handle a bat and ball.)Since I'd watched the film just shortly before this visit, I looked for any details I might have missed before, instead of getting totally absorbed by the story.I noticed that despite his being presented as a multi-million-dollar bookie/gambler, wagering six figured amounts (in the depression 1930's, yet!) Darrin McGavin's 'Gus.' never drew the right bead on Roy Hobbs, and seemed to have a stupidly naive perspective with regard to his prodigious talent, and losing betting against Roy throughout.Also, Robert Duvall's 'Max,' the syndicated columnist, presents himself as a tower of virtue to preserve the integrity of the game, yet is friendly with Gus, who is involved in bribes to players to throw games to aid his confederate (Robert Prosky) and presumably also to clean-up in the betting arena. Even though Duvall's character obviously is ambitious to break the big, inside story, and is self-promoting, it seems his character would have been a bit fairer and more discreet.These two are still great actors, and their characters strong and interesting, despite any such inconsistencies.And the baseball scenes are terrific, in and of themselves, and provide a completely authentic representation of baseball five decades earlier than when filmed, and seven decades ago now.Some purists have criticized the ethereal, surreal aspects in the film as detracting from the baseball games portrayed. I disagree, and feel that these added immensely (even necessarily) to the 'story,' without in anyway detracting from the outstanding 'on the field' parts of the movie.Like Dennis Quaid in 'The Rookie,' Redford was in his late forties at filming, portraying a character about a decade younger. Like Quaid, no problem for him; and had the character been even a few years more junior to him, he'd have been just as believable.This film, along with 'North Dallas Forty' and 'One-on-One'/'Hoosiers' (a tie) comprise the far best films about our big-three sports. While there have been many excellent films about baseball, football and basketball, these are the absolute finest.",10,8,12,9 February 2007
Ed Wood," A '10' the first time
","I remember when I first saw 'Plan Nine from Outer Space,' when I was a kid. My best buddy and I had our baseball game rained-out, so we went to the matinée at our local theater in our suburb. We knew nothing of the film or Ed Wood, so we assumed it would be a 'B' matinée flick (at that age we didn't really know or use that designation, but we knew what these kinds of movies, shown on Saturday afternoons, were). We also understood that the quality of work - acting, camera shots, and even story line, would not be the equivalent of the first-run films in the major theaters, or which could be viewed later at this same theater during nighttime presentations. However, we didn't feel cheated by this film. Even in our adolescent way, we enjoyed its bizarre characters, dialogue, acting, scenery - appreciating in amateurishness and the fact that it was so awful it was funny and enjoyable. That film, and Wood's others, are in the category that for quality you would rate them a '1' on the proverbial '1 - to - 10 'dial' -- then decide to move it one notch farther to a '10,' in recognition that in its awfulness it was so fascinating and funny it actually provided a thoroughly-enjoyable experience. This biopic captures this essence of what the untalented, yet also undaunted, Ed Wood was all about. Johnny Depp is one of the outstanding talents today, and this talent is displayed here. Martin Landau certainly deserved the acclaim for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi. All the supporting cast, without exception, were also outstanding. Finally, the depiction of this movie genre, and the feel for the mid-1950's Hollywood, are superb. Give this one a '10' on the dial the first time.",10,0,1,18 August 2006
Ocean's Thirteen," Third time not a charm
","When Jack Lemmon and Walter Mathau made 'Out to Sea,' very late in their careers, and not very long before each passed away, it seemed that they were simply performing parts they could have 'phoned-in,' and perhaps add a few million dollars to their estates. Same for their original 'Grumpy Old Men' flick, and even more so for its sequel. But a lot of that could be attributed to their ages, and to the fact that they had worked so much together - from earlier days through middle age and into their twilight time.'Godfather III' was terrible, despite its two predecessors both winning 'Best Picture' Oscar. And the recent 'Spiderman,' 'Shrek' and 'P.o.C.' flicks certainly have all proved that in sequels, the third time certainly ISN'T the charm.This movie seals that principle in concrete. With the ever-expanding ensemble cast, it's different from a two-person, buddy/rival offering like Lemmon/Mathau's or a larger, but somewhat-altered cast as in the Godfather movies. All the 'Ocean' films have included the main group of hunky males and beautiful females, in their primes -- many of whom have been the 'before-the-title' leads in their own individual work.The problem is, the premise is exhausted; it's difficult enough to make one good major picture, and seemingly impossible replicate a third time (plus, the second/middle 'Ocean' was even worse than this one).But a main complaint, in my opinion, is that despite being younger, with flesh still firm on their faces and mid-sections, and without advancing age providing any excuse --- Clooney, Damon, Pitt, et al, seem to be performing barely a small notch above phoning in these roles, here. And the older Pacino and Gould almost seem to be attempting a parody of the roles they've been assigned, as opposed to straight acting. In terms of the plot, as another person commented here, it seems downright silly that the wise, caper-connected Gould character would be duped by the likes of Pacino's character in this story.It might rate a 4* or 5* mark only -- I'd give it a 6, simply in view of excellent photography/scenery, and the lavishness of production.",6,15,48,5 June 2007
The Caine Mutiny," Whole better than sum of many weak 'parts'
","Sometimes you can like a movie 'in spite' of various performances and characters, rather 'because' of them. Humphrey Bogart is sensational, as usual, as the paranoiac Queeg. However... Maryk (Van Johnson) is dense beyond belief, and so much so that only such a person would fall for the weak machinations of Keefer (Fred MacMurray), a short-timer whose performance as an inept officer was matched by MacMurray's one-dimensional portrayal, despite his depiction as some sort of genius novelist in civilian life. And... can you say insipid, colorless, and annoying?? -- both Wynn and Francis conform to all of these, both in terms of their characters and performances, and their romance, which was thoroughly uninteresting, unnecessary, and even detracted from the film's main story. Queeg may have been crazy, but NOT in his depiction of Francis as inept officer. Ferrer's performance as the lawyer can be termed as 'whelming.' One presumes his injured arm was real, and simply written in in the flick. However, Jose must have been in some danger of further injury, if the scenery had collapsed while he was chewing on it. Finally, there is no way - based upon his seniority, performance (as an officer) and experience to that point - that the Caine's predecessor captain (Tom Tully), now in command of a large combatant vessel (to which Francis' Willie character is assigned at the end) would direct this junior officer to 'take her out' when the ship was leaving the dock. For one thing, professional pilots, specialized in guiding ships at the particular port involved, and often performed this task. If one of the ship's company did so, it would only have been either the captain, executive officer, or another of the more senior officers. Were the captain in actuality to allow Willie to perform this task, Queeg's court martial would not be the only one. But as someone who performed a 3-year period as a naval officer, many, many years after the Caine's tenure - I still enjoyed - in addition to Bogart - the overall setting. I loved Bogart's performance and the shipboard settings, the portions at-sea, etc., so much, I still would rate it at the maximum.",10,0,1,24 July 2006
The Game," Outstanding flick
","Like many of the prior comments here, I found this film engrossing and interesting, in terms of its presenting more intelligent fare than most of the offerings today, on large screen or small. Having recently seen it again, it is also a flick which is one of those as interesting on subsequent viewings as the first.And aside from the excellent cast and performances, and with Michael Douglas, my personal favorite actor -- it managed to combine several genres at once, all of them better-presented than in films where only one would be involved.Science fiction has always presented unexplainable and impossible features compared with 'real life.' Heck, 70 years ago, Buster Crabbe as 'Buck Rogers,' along with his cohorts, was flying throughout the universe in a craft, large and well-equipped and -furnished, much like Kirk and Spock and the 'Star Wars' denizens, everyone walking around freely as if they were in a fancy hotel suite. Yet even today, the ships and space stations remain cramped and less-than commodious.Along with 'science fiction'' (and containing many occurrences patently impossible, but somehow credible), this film also has characteristic of the horror genre, 'Poltergeist-'type occurrences; also the good old-fashion 'noir' flick of the 40's and 50's (the reason why Brian Donlevey died with a healthy estate). It also has pure mystery elements, along with those of sophisticated drama, the 'main character (however powerful and rich)' reordering his priorities and finding what's really important in life. It also provided some 'road film' scenes, and plenty of danger for the lead character. There probably are a few other categories, but these are sufficient to describe this outstanding picture, well-crafted, interesting, and one of those few capable of holding your interest throughout.",10,4,6,16 October 2008
Men in Black II," Half as good as original, at best
","While this presentation is only 10 minutes shorter than its predecessor, it seemed about half as long in terms of content versus the original -- but twice as long in-terms of being a far, far less-interesting story, and a disappointing sequel to an excellent original.I agree completely with those who have said that the director (and writer) seemed to have placed the majority of effort solely on the special effects aspect, with the storyline far below the quality of the original.It's a shame, considering that talents of Smith, Jones and Torn, and the material was so weak at times, it seemed to affect the intensity of their performances as well.I rated the original at 9*.. Marking this sequel at 5* is generous, since it probably should be no better than half the rating of the original, probably a bit lower.",5,0,0,26 January 2007
Men in Black," Good flick, good cast, interesting presentation
","This is a very good picture - all-round, and the five lead characters/actors are well-supported by the entire rest of the cast.While a pretty short film, and just under 1-hour and forty minutes, it seems longer because of all the story lines it presents.Both the dialog and special effects complement one another, and it blends the more 'serious' aspects of the story with a continuing humorous approach very well.Smith, Jones and Torn are all actors whose work has been interesting and well-done in just about every film each has made, and together they provide a winning combination.",9,0,0,26 January 2007
Hoosiers," A 'perfect' feel-good movie
","This site shows this movie to have about the normal number of 'goofs' (here, all minor) - but its 'perfection' is in the fact that this is an interesting, truly uplifting story, with warm characters, outstanding performances, and an appeal to everyone, whatever sex, age, background - and equally for those who know and/or care little for the game of basketball.There isn't a finer actor around than Gene Hackman, and Dennis Hopper is in the same league. All of the rest of the cast perform admirably, also.With the film now 20-years-old, since it depicted events in the 1950's, 30 years prior, it is just as fresh, and even a bit more nostalgic now than when originally released.(An interesting fact to note if you watch the film again: the actor playing Jimmy, the team's super-stat, while athletic, had not been a basket-baller in real life; whereas the shorter young man playing the team's 'scrub,' was the best in reality, and had to 'act' to appear less-talented than he was.)",10,3,3,5 November 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Flagellating albino gave best performance
","Missed this due to traveling when it played first-run, and hadn't caught it until just recently.What a disappointment. I know the subject matter and settings demanded a significant amount of filming in dim light -- but holy hell!!!! - with his 'A-list' status as a director, and everything else about this flick also in the same top category - I got the feeling that Ron Howard had run-out of money for light bulbs.With folks like Hanks, McKellen and Tautou, each with credentials in the acting profession at the top in his/her own nation - their collective performances could have been equaled by a trio of weirdos in a John Waters opus. Hanks and Tautou moved and delivered lines like a pair of postal workers who had overdosed on Valium.The best acting and most interesting character was the albino, psychotic religious fanatic, loosening and tightening the cilice around his thigh, proceeding to flagellate himself, and belting an elderly nun like Joe Pesci stomping a rival in 'Goodfellas.' If somebody totally unfamiliar with the U.S. film industry were told Tom Hanks is considered by many to be its top actor, and by virtually everybody to be on the shortest of 'A' lists - and then exposed only to this performance, he'd think whoever conveyed this information to be insane.",2,1,5,21 July 2008
Psycho," Now enjoyable on multiple levels
","I recently saw this classic again - unexpectedly - at a friend's home. One of the people visiting mentioned she'd never seen it, so he popped-in a tape and we all enjoyed it again.It now presents not only the same 'classic' genius of a great director's most famous work - but with the decades since it was made provides an historic view of the 'noir' genre, and stars of the past in their more youthful days.This was perfect for Tony Perkins. His constant twitches, peculiar mannerisms and demeanor, and always somewhat weird persona, were perfect for Norman. Janet Leigh was beautiful to view, even in this key. but necessarily shortened. role. Although the two sequels, and another 'prequel,' never equaled this original (no surprise), I couldn't help but run them through my mind as I watched the original again.I also remembered one professional reviewer's subsequent humorous comment (I believe for Psycho III), remarking that (after therapy) 'Norman's doing better, but 'Mother' isn't doing so well.'",10,0,0,13 October 2006
The Bridge on the River Kwai," One of the all-time top films
","If this story were to be remade today, undoubtedly the characters would possess more diverse sides, and display more dimensions to their personas than this picture reveals. This is a '1950's film,' and was made only a decade and a half after the events portrayed occurred, and only 10 years after Japan was just getting back to some semblance of normality after the consequences of World War II.However, this IS one story which should never be remade, and which is all the better for 'when' it was produced - in addition to the perfect casting, which could never be replicated.The four leads were as perfect in their roles, individually and in combination, as one could wish. In addition to their acting talents, per se, their abilities to portray characters of proper relative age are equally notable. At true age of 47, Jack Hawkins' character is about the equivalent in the film. Holden, younger in the film, and Guinness older, were believable, although only two years apart (41 and 43 respectively) in actuality. Most amazing is Sessue Hayakawa - he was 68 - 'pushing 70' - in 1957, yet one could imagine his character's being a contemporary of Guinness's - even maybe a year or two younger.Guinness and Holden are among the all-time icons in cinema, and Hawkins almost the equivalent, especially to those familiar with his work in British cinema - but Hayakawa is certainly not remembered as vividly as he ought to be. This can be mostly attributed to the racial stereotyping during his period of work, from early in the 20th century through the period of this picture. But this was a truly gigantic figure for much of this period - and a star who received $200,000 for a film - IN 1919 - as he was turning 30, and several years before the first talking pictures.'The Bridge on the River Kwai,' has many dimensions - all powerful. It is one work for which the term 'spectacular' is wholly-applicable, and not some press agent's creation. The juxtaposition of the Hayakawa and Guinness characters, and the interaction between these two is as compelling as anything ever presented on stage or screen.The characters also ring true - not only in composite in portraying a depiction of World War II in general, and the Pacific Theater in particular - but also in characterizations of human beings in their roles which chance and destiny have placed them. It shows them not only in terms of the wartime circumstances which the world's events have brought upon them, but is also a metaphor of people functioning, persevering, adapting and bearing the consequences of their circumstances and the relationships these have spawned.",10,0,1,14 October 2006
The Shawshank Redemption," #2086
","Don't know how many will ever see the 2,086th comment in this site - but just saw a friend's DVD of this film, again. I had missed it due to being in Europe on an extended business trip when it played first-run, and caught some portions of it a few years later, and then completely sometime following.This was the third or fourth time I'd seen it straight through, and it is one of those very rare films which is as good - maybe even better - on successive viewings.Robbins, Freeman, Gunton, and all of the remaining cast - whether in larger supporting roles or smaller - are outstanding, without a single exception.My friend is a computer whiz, with an IQ of probably 150, and widely-expert expert in this area. But he's so immersed in this realm, that whenever forced to use pen and paper (instead of mouse or keyboard) he does so on about the 5th-grade level. After the film (he had bought the DVD, but had never seen it before) he stated he didn't feel the Robbins character could have pulled-off all the shenanigans with the money, from prison via mail (and perhaps sometimes using a messenger of the warden's) the way the film depicted -- whereas today, if such an inmate had a computer terminal available, it would be more possible.I told him I felt certain the opposite was true. In the era of the story, a very intelligent financially-adept individual - especially a former whiz-kid bank V.P. - could have done what was shown even more effectively and successfully than via computer today, with all the firewalls, and in-house computer nerds any bank has. Someone with both tremendous financial and hacker ability might - but not as easily as Tim did, during a period when signatures and figures on paper and the like were the governing elements.This aspect is one of the most critical and climactic for the story and its very satisfying ending. And Gunton, a tremendous actor who has done many sympathetic characters, presents one of the best performances portraying a truly evil person - more so for the quieter and 'nasty-nice' elements of this portrayal. He juxtaposes quiet demeanor, often even pious, with completely selfish, vicious, amoral actions, as well as humanly possible, with his performance in this roleThis is a film for which the term 'perfect piece of entertainment' does not exaggerate.",10,4,6,24 October 2008
