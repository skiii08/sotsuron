Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I don't get what I'm supposed to right here, sorry.
","OK, I've got to get this off my chest.......I'm sick of everyone dissing this movie. It was a great movie! Sure, It's story didn't compare to the original, but hey......That wasn't the point of this film! The Special FX in this film were unbelievable!!! The characters in this were awesome!! And the Jedi duel scene's were much better (Faster and more action). It had some other excellent scene's in it such as the podracing. So sure, I even admit it, it wasn't better (I didn't say worse though) than the originals, but it did have some improvments and over all was a Fantastic movie, so I still give it a 10!!",10,0,0,27 May 1999
