The Avengers," Like a video game: Visuals without story and character
","I don't understand how this movie succeeded in scoring so many stars. The only thing good about it were the visuals, seeing Hulk smash and all that. Story line, characters, interaction were all very flat. I've seen previous titles in this series (like the uber-horrible captain America, Hulk, Thor and Iron Man), and it seems clear what this series is about: flat visual action scene's. Pure for visuals it deserves three stars, but since so many people are exaggerating on their score I'm giving only one to compensate. It does definitely not deserve the high score it has now.Right. I need ten lines. Well, I can repeat the script to show all the silliness in this movie. Banner cannot control Hulk inside. Then suddenly he can anger himself out of will? Out of the blue Hulk suddenly evolves into a cooperating creature. What? How does that fit into his history? And then that old man who saw Hulk falling. He's reacting as if he sees it everyday. Captain America needs a suite because people can use some old-fashionedness? Huh? Then when action is required he asks Hawk Eye: 'do you have a suite?' Huhu, very important indeed. What's it with his shield anyway? Iron Man keeping a rotor running by spinning it himself? Come on please. Mythological gods as science fiction figures? No, don't mess up that! I just feel like I watched my little brother play a video game. Lots of visuals, no story.",1,11,36,14 July 2013
