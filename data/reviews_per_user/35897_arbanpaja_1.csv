War Dogs," Get the facts right
",I saw the move and I can't give more than 3/10. The story is somehow right. If you gonna show a movie played in Albania at least go into that country and film some parts there. The hotel where the guys stayed was Sheraton and not some crappy motel. And yes Alabama has a lot of guns and ammunition but those are not stored on churches and schools and hospitals. And that is not true. They do have lots of tunnels where ammunition is stored. I am surprised this movie didn't talk what happen to the Albanian contractor. And how he died. Or the big explosion that happen to that factory. And Tirana is way better than they showed in this movie. I never seen those kind of buildings in Tirana or the big church that they showed. And when he goes running those run down buildings are not in Albania. And even that magazine is not in Albanian. And maybe the movie should have talked about the 26 ppl that died and 300 injured in the explosion that happen to that factory. It wasn't worth watching it,Null,0,2,13 April 2017
