Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Spend your money on something else!
","I did not enjoy this movie. That's my review in a nutshell. Though there were a few 'belly-laugh' moments I just found it to be mostly a collection of badly put together mildly humorous scenes. There were a few scenes that were just too gross and over the top, like the naked wrestling. It was obviously there for shock value but it misfired as far as I'm concerned. Cohen's mockery (and that's what it was really, even if he is a Jew himself) of that gracious Jewish couple was a bad choice to say the least, and I found it embarrassing and offensive though I am not a Jew myself. Not many people laughed at that. I resent the claim that if you don't find this funny then you just don't get it or lack a sense of humor. I do have a sense of humor and I do 'get it'. It's just that it is not worth the effort. I wish I had spent my Saturday afternoon at another movie instead. This movie is riding the hype of it's marketing and its amazingly positive reviews. I fell for that too, and left it with a bad taste in my mouth.",1,13,28,11 November 2006
Van Helsing," Good fantasy yarn!
","I enjoyed this story and anyone who likes a good vampire flick will like it. You can't expect too much from this genre but it has a good mix of action, horror, romance and even a bit of comedy (There are some great 'tongue-in-cheek' comments) It also looks good; the sets are lavish and some scenes have a glorious over-the-top 'Hammer House of Horror atmosphere about them. The makers of this film didn't take it all too seriously - neither should those who watch it.D.",8,6,12,14 December 2004
