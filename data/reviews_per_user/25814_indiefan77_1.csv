The Hangover," Saw it in theaters (twice) will buy DVD soon!!!
","Judging from the trailer I thought this film would be pretty funny. I was wrong. It was HILARIOUS. I have never laughed so hard in a theater, never heard other people laugh so hard in the theater. There was almost so much laughter that I actually wished people would be quiet because I knew we were missing more jokes while waiting for the laughter from the previous joke to die down.The part with the masturbating baby was ridiculously funny, and the face the baby was making was just priceless. I'm pretty much to the point where I think Zach Galifianakis can do no wrong. I saw his 'Comedy Central Presents' several years ago and was hooked. I am so glad he's doing as well as he is.Ed Helms, Bradley Cooper, Justin Bartha, and Ken Jeong were all great in this film. I love the fact that none of these guys are 'superstars' yet could still carry this film beautifully. This just goes to show you that Hollywood should be focusing on stories instead of 'star power'.",10,2,4,19 December 2009
