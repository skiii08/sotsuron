Black Swan," A too simplistic comparison between White and Black/Good and Evil
","Don't get me wrong, i enjoyed Black Swan, but i can't give it a 10 full moon. I rated this movie with 7 stars, that goes to Natalie Portman, who makes a magical job in portraying Nina. She truly deserves an Oscar 2011 for Best Actress. Despite of this wonderful achievement by the gifted Natalie Portman, 'Black Swan' is too simplistic and too fast. The story is way to modest, compared with amazing special effects and cinema (probably Best Picture 2011...probably, because of '127 Hours'...). What i'm trying to say is that the plot is too basic. White, Black, Good, Evil, with some great acting, dance and cinematography. The screenplay is good, but nothing memorable. You see, the only elements that resides from Black Swan, for me, as a truly film lover, is Natalie's perfect acting performance, Vincent's deep role and a wonderful cinematography. The rest is just a simple plot, evolving across a ballerina, her dreams, her hallucinations, her mentor, a basic fight, good vs evil and white vs black, on a stage. Nothing more. 7 stars of 10 for Black Swan.",7,4,8,21 December 2010
127 Hours," Give this man an Oscar!
","I can't believe what i just saw. '127 Hours' is truly a masterpiece. Danny Boyle did it again. Period. This lesson about surviving can be teach in schools. We can learn from mistakes. For me, Aron Ralston isn't a hero. Aron is a survivor. Mankind is based on surviving in the hardest conditions. James Franco truly deserves an Oscar this year. His performance cannot be anything but perfect. It demonstrates a really courage in acting. It takes a lot of motivation and talent to go through the most difficult role, taking over the movie by himself, with a help of the extraordinary direction of Danny Boyle. In this film, James Franco is 'solo'. With the exception of some minor, but solid roles, he owns '127 Hours'. You can feel Aron's desperation and also you can see the long string of decisions that leads him to amputate the damaged arm. The hand of Aron becomes his worst enemy. So he cut it, to set free. Danny Boyle's unique style of directing is getting more and more amazing, from start to end. '127 Hours' is simply great. With this role, James Franco gets in to the big league of newly actors. He did a lot of great acting jobs, but this is masterful. He can put natural feelings in his role, and the transformation is very visible. James Franco is not acting, is living the drama of Aron Ralston at a permitted level of understanding. Give this man an Oscar! He really deserve the golden statue! '127 Hours' can easily be the film of 2011. You did it again, Mr. Danny Boyle! As of Mr. James Franco, you can steal the Oscar and still remain innocent! Why? You deserve it!",10,2,6,9 January 2011
Capote," Capote is a part of everyone of us
","Wow! What a great movie! Perfect acting by all actors, a great plot, because it's coming from reality, from the life of someone and a lesson of how to make a movie with soul. Capote is everyone of us. Tell me, aren't you fascinated by the unknown? By the people who did something good or bad, right or wrong? By their minds? Well, maybe you're not so addicted to this kind of knowledge and it's nothing bad. Capote is a journalist, in the first place. His relation with Perry Smith, the bastard that killed four people, it's the same relation that the mass-media from our present time it's using with their news-subjects. Capote it's a great writer, no doubt about it, but this movie isn't a simple frame from a great man's life, the most important picture from his biography. It represents more than that. The job of Truman Capote has been continued by the today's media...'In cold blood' it's what people wants, the watchers, the readers, the listeners, they are all 'slaves' in this brainwashing program initiated by the media from almost any place in the world. We like killers, violence, blood. Just to see it, not to feel it. That's OK, but there are many more things to watch...Good things, great things. Back to 'Capote'...I'll say that the relation between Capote and Perry Smith it's the same with the relation between media and their sources of news. Exploited? Yes, Capote has exploited Perry Smith, but never left him alone. Even when Smith was executed, Capote was there. Actually, i didn't read 'In cold blood'. Any book that describes the crimes of a young thief isn't my style...Inside the mind of a criminal? The movie doesn't want to show Perry Smith's real face, or that even a 'in cold blood' killer has his 'good side'. Truman Capote it's a man that discover his masterpiece in writing in the eyes of a killer. Perry Smith's life isn't special. A thief that become a killer. There are many others bastards that follow the same black direction. The line between stiling and killing it's so thin! The regrets are useless. This movie evocate a person with the gift from God. A writer that could transform the banal story of a killer in something special, in something remarkable, in a lesson for the others it deserves RESPECT. So they given to Truman Capote, the writer of 'In cold blood', perhaps the most known book from the United States literature a lot of respect, a great commemoration-A movie for the Oscar 2006-Go CAPOTE!(Capote...sounds a little Italian-Mobster-Godfather-Name?)-Escuse my bad English, i'm an amateur!",10,0,0,12 February 2006
