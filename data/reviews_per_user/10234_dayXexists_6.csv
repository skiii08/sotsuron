Moneyball," Moneyball: Solid and Entertaining, Brad Pitt really shines
","Pretty good. Probably a little over-rated; I found the whole thing too 'level' throughout- there was no point where I really felt a connection to the story or characters. Yeah I wanted them to succeed but not for any particular reason other than I was watching the movie; it all felt a bit mundane with it being a movie about sports' economics and statistical analysis; but then it does say something about Aaron Sorkin and the director that they were able to take such a boring topic and turn it into something entertaining and easy to follow on film.Brad Pitt definitely carries the film and he does a great job in the role; at this point in his career he really can't go wrong- he consistently picks interesting characters and quality projects and Moneyball is no exception. I usually can't stand Jonah Hill but I thought he was excellent in this and he and Pitt had great chemistry together- there were a lot of funny moments between the two of them, and Pitt in general was pretty funny throughout the movie, eliciting some big laughs from the crowd. The guy is one of the most charismatic actors in the business. Also it's nice to see Chris Pratt in another high profile project, I thought he was great in his supporting role in Wanted.While I don't have any complaints about the movie, I can't quite call it 'great', so for me it gets a strong B+ .",8,0,3,25 September 2011
Salt," Angelina Jolie Proves Why She's the World's Biggest Action Star
","SALT was a complete adrenaline rush. It's not Bourne but it's not quite Bond- it's got elements of both. Somewhere in between, like Bourne on speed. I don't want to give anything away, but no, the plot is not as complex as Inception. However there are enough twists and turns to keep you satisfied. The story is intriguing and will keep your interest but first and foremost this is an action film. And the action is top notch. There's a lot of new sequences that we haven't seen before in film. No, the movie is not overly realistic but it's not trying to be.But let's be honest, this is the Angelina Jolie show. Her presence just makes the movie and she is perfect as Evelyn Salt- who is a complete badass. After audiences see SALT there will be no denying that Angelina Jolie is ultimate female action star. Evelyn Salt gets really ruthless as the movie goes on. Look for some cool action sequences, and especially be on the lookout for what she does with a pair of cuffs.Overall if you're looking for a good time at the movies and nothing too serious, check out Salt. It's not perfect, but I loved it.A-",10,33,66,22 July 2010
Drive," Drive is quiet, tense, and extremely violent. In another word- fantastic.
","Ahhh. I have to let this simmer for a little while but I simply loved this film. Refn made a movie that was high on style and beautifully shot, the way the colors and lighting complemented each other, it's not something I usually notice when watching a movie but there were some seriously nice photography in this film. I loved the score- it was musical and pretty unique and for me it helped take the film to another level- it coddles the viewer and makes you feel secure before the story turns around and b**slaps you right in the face. The way the film transitioned from quiet love story and self reflection to extremely violent crime heist movie, and back again, was seamless and pretty shocking. I was so not expecting any Tarantino-esque violence and then all of a sudden I'm asking myself 'Did I just witness Ryan Gosling 'out-curb-stomp' Ed Norton?'. Speaking of, Gosling continues to establish himself as an excellent actor and held your attention without saying much. Loved the cameo from Christina Hendricks, too. But what a great effort overall and has shot right into one of my favorite movies of the year.",10,3,7,22 September 2011
Into the Wild," Pretentious and Smug. Salvaged by beautiful cinematography and fantastic acting
","So I finally got around to seeing this and well, it looks like I'm going to have to disagree with the majority on this one.First there are several things I did like about it. The cinematography is absolutely stunning. The various shots of nature around different parts of the country are beautiful. I think Sean Penn's direction was great- he really captured the essence of the wanderer's lifestyle and even makes the viewer a little envious of some of those people. I thought the supporting cast was fantastic, and I found myself caring about those characters much more than I did the main character. Especially Hal Holbrook and Katherine Creener. I think she is a very underrated and talented actress. Even Kristen Stewart was OK in her small part.That said, I thought the movie was extremely pretentious and smug. If people thought The Blind Side was a white-guilt film, then this is a societal-guilt film. It's one thing if a movie lets the story convey the message for you, but Into the Wild jams that message down your throat. After a while it's like, okay, I get it. Society is rigid and restricting, free your spirit, etc. Well sorry Alexander Supertramp, but not everyone can just ditch their responsibilities to loaf around the country and get in touch with nature.Which brings me to the main character, Chris, who I thought was completely selfish and melodramatic. His 'tragic' back story really wasn't all that tragic. So his Dad screwed around and his parents didn't get along. Welcome to life. That kid's parents gave him everything he ever needed and asked for and yet he acts like he's some damaged, abused child. And then he leaves, never contacts them again, and goes and gets himself killed. I don't have any sympathy for that and I stopped caring for the character pretty shortly into the film. The 2 and a half hour run time was a bit long for me, and like I said, after a while I got tired of Chris complaining about society. I did like that in the final minutes the character does seem to feel a little remorse with the 'happiness is not true unless it is shared' bit though.Emile Hirsch for his part did a good job. I wasn't crazy about his performance like others seem to be, but it's a very challenging role and he deserves credit. I don't remember who else was nominated that year, but he probably deserved at least a nomination.Anyway while there were many positive things that I enjoyed about the movie, I just can't get past the pretentiousness of it all. It is a good message but this just felt like 2.5 hours worth of teen angst to me.C+ (for the acting, direction, and photography)",5,3,5,22 June 2010
"Girl, Interrupted"," Jolie Stuns in Solid Story
","Angelina Jolie makes you fall in love with, hate, and feel bad for Lisa all at the same time. I loved the scene right at the end where Susana was like 'What are you doing? Why are you doing this?' and she goes, full of attitude, 'I'm just playin' the villain baby.. just like you want me to'.. It was like a nod to her future mega-celebrity self. Winona Ryder did a really good job too and this movie really reminded me of some people in my life who like to create or invent problems for themselves. It lets you know that yes there are some girls in that institution with legitimate problems, but then there are people like Susana who really don't belong there in the first place but try to make themselves believe that they actually are crazy. I think the movie as a whole was pretty good. B+/A-",8,1,1,19 October 2010
Inception," Fresh Plot and Amazing Ensemble Cast Help Cement Nolan as Hottest Director in Hollywood
","This is exactly the kind of movie I love. Thought provoking but also very exciting and entertaining. Has an absolute dream cast- probably my favorite ensemble cast I've seen in a film. Tom Hardy, this has gotta be a star turn for him. He's one of my favorites. Joseph Gordon Levitt is one cool guy. Marion Cottilard is gorgeous and very talented, gave a great performance in this movie. Cillian Murphy is an awesome underrated actor. I wasn't expecting his role to be so large in the movie but I'm happy it was. I'm normally not a fan of Ellen Page but I thought she was great here, and Leo- what can you say about him? He is the ultimate movie star.I had some reservations going in. Just based on the pre-release buzz. All of the critics that were beating the 'not accessible' drum. Well I went in knowing very little about the plot, I hadn't read any of the reviews and I was expecting the complexity of the plot to possibly interfere with the viewing experience. I will say this was not the case at all. As long as you pay close attention and stay focused from the beginning, then the plot is not very difficult to follow. Yes it is complex, but confusing? Not really. Which is the way it should be! I don't really want to get into plot details and there's not much more I can say that probably hasn't already been said, but this was just one of the ultimate movie experiences. Captivating from start to finish. Complex but not out of reach. A great cast. Leonardo DiCaprio strikes again. Inception and Shutter Island are 1-2 for me this year. The score was very Nolan. Sometimes I felt like it was a little fast, that it wouldn't let the movie slow down, but I was OK with it. And of course, Nolan seals his place as the hottest director in Hollywood right now. This has definitely lived up to the hype and my expectations. And I loved how the final scene leaves you hanging.A",10,3,7,19 July 2010
