Casablanca," Casablanca helped make the Golden Age magical!
","Michael Curtiz's Casablanca (1942) has quite the reputation as we all know! After watching this film I fell in love, I was enchanted and dazzled by its beauty. Humphrey Bogart stars as Rick, a complicated man with a heart breaking past.The scenes that took place in Rick's restaurant were especially stunning because they look and feel so different at times depending on the situation. During business hours the restaurant is a happening place and these scenes were always loud, bright, high in contrast and flashy. The scenes in Rick's office and when the restaurant was closed were usually dark and quiet; feeling more personal. The focus of the camera also had a different feel while shooting certain characters. A soft focus was used while shooting Ingrid Bergman's character Ilsa, making her even more gorgeous.The ending of Casablanca is really quite amazing because it is meant to feel incomplete. This opens so many doors for each character and I wondered what happened to these people while the war continued on.",9,2,3,1 December 2009
Citizen Kane," A timeless classic!
","Orson Welles' Citizen Kane (1941) is easily the most beautiful movie I've ever seen for so many reasons. It is visually stunning, the composition is amazing. I loved the focus techniques of a wide range of depth of field and the massive sets the most. It's a gorgeous film to look at but it also tells a great story.Charles Foster Kane lived an incredible life and the most important and significant thing in his whole world was tragically destroyed. Kane lived a successful life, he made a great fortune out of the poor lifestyle he was born into. Hidden deep behind the fame and fortune of Kane's life was a sad man who never found true happiness. The only thing that ever mattered to him in his entire life was tosses aside and burned without a second glance. The last scene was so painful, and as a viewer I felt so helpless for Kane. The writing was great, I loved that it made me feel so strongly.The camera work was wonderful in this film, a different way of focusing was introduced. In certain scenes the foreground, middleground and background were all in perfect focus. In other scenes everything would be in focus but the middleground. Unusual camera views were also used that had not been seen much before. Extreme high and low shots were often used, seeming disorienting to the viewer.I believe this film will continue to blow away viewers of any age no matter how old the movie gets. The cinematography is so beautiful, even by today's standards, which makes Citizen Kane timeless.",10,10,14,1 December 2009
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A hilarious anti-war flick!
","Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove (1964) is all about the Cold War on the outside. But on the inside it's anti-war theme is filled with social issues and hilarity.The scenes which took place in the war room were chaotic, everyone was running around like a bunch of chickens with their heads cut off. These men working for the government who were supposed to be protecting our country and making important decisions were portrayed as idiots! I really enjoyed the space and symmetry of the war room. The huge round table where the men sat had a matching row of lights that hung above. High shots were often used, showing the action through the circle of lights. Low close-up camera shots were used when tensions rose. This was useful because it make the scene feel more dramatic.The technical aspect of the film was also enjoyable. I loved the inside of the plane and the top secret to-do list. After Plan R was put into affect every scene involving the plane was equipped with a marching-into-battle tune.",10,1,2,14 December 2009
The Graduate," The Graduate
","Mike Nichols' The Graduate (1967) is filled with memorable quotes and witty dialog, a great soundtrack and introduction of the young Dustin Hoffman. The use of color was becoming a more prominent part of movie making. The color usage in The Graduate gives such life and thrill to the film. The colors were soft when they needed to be and also vibrant when the story picked up.The camera-work in this film is noteworthy because of the angles and focus. The dolly shots stood out the most for me. The scene where Mrs. Robinson tells her daughter of her relations with Ben Braddock wouldn't have been the same without the drastic zoom out technique. Mrs. Robinson is standing across the room from Ben and the camera is close up on her face and then it pulls back in a fast motion making her seem so distance from not only the camera but from Ben and the world. As a viewer I even felt alone for her.",10,1,1,16 December 2009
Psycho," Much-too-human monsters
","Alfred Hitchcock has been considered a master of suspense and an artist of anxiety. In 1960 Hitchcock directed one on the most famous movies of all time, Psycho. Psycho starred Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles and John Gavin. This film helped set the stage for future horror movies.In the beginning of this film, office worker Marion packs her bags and drives off with $40,000 worth of stolen cash. She stops at the Bates Motel where she meets Norman and learns of his controlling mother. Marion is stabbed to death later that night in the shower by what looks like an old woman. This shower scene was famous ever since. The use of believability and artificiality makes Hitchcock stand out because most horror movies at the time were clearly fiction. Throughout the entire film there is something going on that the audience hasn't got completely figured out. It builds up to something big and in the end it's not what the audience expected at all! Hitchcock has perfected his style of creating what is least likely to be expected. His movies are always a surprise at the end, making each one so much fun to watch.Hitchcock has perfected his style of creating much-too-human monsters!",10,0,1,14 December 2009
