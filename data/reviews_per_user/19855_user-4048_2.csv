Deja Vu," Excellent Theory Movie!
","I'd give it more, but a Financial Standards professor on conservatism would give me closer to the fail I deserved second time through. It's probably rightfully like 7.4 I'm saving up for a vote based on a conservative variance from average.How does that tie in with this fine piece of work deserving better rating of Denzel Washington? The incredible female costar? I dunno.Anyway, the 'one time through, time a constant rate of progress: first derivative fixed' with ability to relocate in virtually any zoom-in/zoom-out from any direction, including audio, is something for many to probe futures with. Perhaps that huge novelty for the tech intense world so captured that none of the stars got better than the rest of the voters somewhat lame with their savings up, possibly ending up with their savings up, low on cash, votings.",7,0,1,30 January 2007
Dreamgirls," Could Have Done Better
","How could it have done better? To get like an 8 out of 10? When I've already qualified it as a 7? A scathing indictment for one notch? That's how closely monitored this place is supposed to be?There are limitations to marks here and perhaps one is supposed to be using discrimination still these days. For an all black production, or close enough, where minority is supposed to be suffering to be so highly rated? Wishy washiness that? Cowardly hiding behind questions? Dodging answers?Maybe for a period peace, more investment in making precise scenery like cars and in number to sell the date.Cheap then for peripheral period proving.I'll just leave it at that...picky...nitpicking maybe even...",7,1,4,7 January 2007
