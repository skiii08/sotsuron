Catch Me If You Can," Believable but contains goofs
","'Catch Me If You Can' is such a meticulously crafted movie that seeing it makes me wish I had read Frank Abagnale's book first.  Leonardo DiCaprio is not only believable as the 'con man' (Frank), his character is downright impossible to dislike. Tom Hanks is excellent as the no-nonsense but somewhat inept FBI man trying to nab Frank.  When friends are anxious to hear him tell a joke, he obliges...sort of. That scene can not be told here. Unfortunately, the careful attention to re-creating the look of the 1960s failed in two places: a scene set in 1967 shows a girl singing the 1969 song 'Leaving On A Jet Plane', and in a 1969 scene Frank's dad is wearing a 'U S Postal Service' jacket depicting a horse on the sleeve, even though the 'Post Office Department' did not become 'Postal Service' until 1970, at which time an eagle logo replaced the horse.  Aside from those two goofs, the film is engrossing and enjoyable, although I'm certain that the real Frank Abagnale was not so skilled at all the fakery as the movie makes him out to be.  All the con jobs are accomplished without anyone seeming the slightest bit suspicious.  The old image of 'shooting fish in a barrel' comes to mind. The movie's character should have had more obstacles to overcome instead of achieving his cons so facilely.  At the end, a part of me was left wishing that Frank could have gotten away with all his stunts. For me, 'Catch Me If You Can' catches three and a half stars out of four.",Null,0,0,27 December 2002
Cars," Scene-Stealing Scenery
","Throughout 'Cars', the scenery (including deserts, mountains, trees, and waterfalls) looks so realistic you'd swear the cars were digitally inserted into film footage! The overhead shot of the Los Angeles raceway and the scenes of thousands of cars in the bleachers are the most elaborate scenes that Pixar has ever done. The 'starring' cars themselves are as anthropomorphic as Pixar could make them, a vast improvement over Disney's old cartoon,'Suzie, The Little Blue Coupe.' Each car has a distinct personality. The best are Tow Mater, the tow truck, and Fillmore, the 1960s Volkswagen bus who, if he were human, would be referred to as an 'old hippie.' Lots of clever car-related gags too. And the closing credits, where the cars are watching movies at the drive-in, are the best part of the film!",10,1,1,10 June 2006
Bruce Almighty," Funny but perpetuates a myth
","'Bruce Almighty' is clever, funny, thought-provoking, and filled with Bible-based sight gags that will easily be overlooked by those who aren't familiar with God's Word. Morgan Freeman's portrayal of God was done as righteously (pun intended) as a human could do it. I won't spoil the ending, but there are lessons learned about God and prayer and power, lessons that should far outweigh anyone's fears that the film is sacrilegious or blasphemous. My only complaint involved a reference to someone being 'frozen stiff' like Walt Disney. This gag just perpetuates the myth that began shortly after Walt's death in 1966. Walt's body was not frozen but was cremated and interred in a Forest Lawn cemetery. Shame on the filmmakers!",10,0,1,25 May 2003
