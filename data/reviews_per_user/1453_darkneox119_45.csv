The Devil's Advocate," not Pacino or Reeve's best
",The Devil's Advocate is about a hot shot lawyer played by Reeves who never loses a case. He was raised by a strong religious woman and is married to Charlize Theron. While he takes on a sexual harassment case with a minor and wins it he gets the offer to join Al Pacino's firm. Everything seems to fit together. Sexy women and money are around but strange things start happening which is very reminiscent of Rosemary's Baby. Soon Keanu learns the secret about the firm and who Pacino really is. Pacino is ok in this but I think the studio strived too hard to make this a blockbuster. It's predictable and not very suspenseful. **,Null,0,2,10 June 2001
The Mask," should have been more like the comic
",The Mask is a light version of the great comic but works because of the Tex Avery cartoon animation styling. Carrey stars as a naive cartoon loving banker who stumbles in the lucious Cameron Diaz's plan for her boss to get inside the bank to rob it. One night while jumping into a river he finds a mask which transforms him into a fun loving character. The mask goes crazy stuff that he couldnt do as the banker and stirs interest from an annoying cop. The boss finds out about the Mask and tries to get the mask himself. Dazzling special effects and sexy Cameron Diaz dancing are highlights. The dog's cuteness is overused. ***,Null,0,0,19 May 2001
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A humble beginning
",The much anticipated Episode One came out to backlash. I love this movie. The special effects and creativity are amazing. Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson star as two Jedis who go to end a trade dispute between The galactic senate and the trade federation. They wind up on the invaded planet of Naboo. They run into the annoying but cool looking Jar Jar Binks. Binks would have been way more tolerable if he spoke in his own language. They go to the underwater Gunga City and save Bink's life. They go to the beautiful queen played by Natalie Portman.They then flee the planet from battle droids and wind up in a blockade. Their damaged ship lands on Tatooine and soon they meet the young Darth Vader. The elder Jedi sees that the force is strong with him and wants to take him to the Jedi Council. Anakin here is a slave who is affraid to leave his friends and mother behind. Yoda then senses fear in Anakin and refuses to train him. Other plots include Darth Sidius masterminding the problems and sending Darth Maul to bring the queen to him and destroy the Jedi. The galaxy politics and Queen Amidala putting her people's trust in Senator Palpatine. The eye candy is brilliant. The pod race is great as is every frame of visuals. The end lightsaber duel is fantastic. The only problems I had is that the Anakin character was too cheesey. The movie is way too light hearted but keep in mind that all the characters die except for Obi-Wan and Yoda. **** out of ****,Null,0,1,17 August 2000
Memento," Remember Sammy Jankis
","I just saw Memento tonight and knew it was critically acclaimed but refrained from hearing anything about it. I went in and saw a breathtaking movie and I'm going to have to go with everyone else's praises. I wouldnt compare it to the sixth sense..Fight Club is more like it. We are taken through Leonard's eyes and that is a treat because we are witnessing for the first time what he actually sees. The concept of the beginning is the end fits like a glove. I can see how people couldnt get this. The performances are a feather in the cap of every actor on screen. You know the plot, go in focused and you'll walk out seeing a totally spectacular film. Instant classic, this film is to be remembered.****",Null,0,1,1 May 2001
The English Patient," decent.has the epic feel to it but suffers from boredom
","The English Patient is a multi layered story about a mapmaker (WHO'S PROFESSION IS QUESTIONABLE)who crashes into a desert and becomes badly burned. He is nursed by Juliete Binoche and tells her the story about how he loved Kristen Scott Thomas. Once he tells his story, more and more details come out. Ralph Finnes is good as the disfigured man and there is a lot of sentimental moments. The problem is that it is hideously boring. Some of the scenes feel like they drag on for eternity. Overall if you like romance tales and epic dramas you should check it out. Willem Dafoe is great in this as the thumbless man on a mission. The World War 2 backdrop works well and the cinematography is good. I don't think it was as good as people made it out to be but regardless it was ok. I'd hate to give it a low rating. I'm sure IMDB purposely doesnt post negative reviews but I have to give it **3/4.",Null,1,3,10 June 2001
Batman Returns," the bat,the cat and the penguin
","In this Tim Burton directed sequel, Batman goes against the Penguin and the Catwoman. Visually the movie is gloomy and stunning but the movie drags on. Nicholson makes the best villain and he held his own all by himself. Since the Joker's demise, the villains are doubled up. Batman also goes against the evil businessman who turned Michelle Pfeiffer into the Catwoman. The clown gang is dementedly scary. Batman returns is alot better than Batman and Robin. **1/2 out of ****",Null,0,0,21 August 2000
X-Men," Great Sci-fi movie
","X-men is in the ranks with The Crow and Batman as great comic book adaptations. Magneto believes that a war is brewing between humans and superpowered mutants. Professor X runs his school for mutants while the government is scaring the public about mutants. Rogue finds Wolverine and after they bond, Wolverine is attacked by Sabertooth and the original X-men save him. The two go to the school and learn about what they are and what they have to fight against. The movie is a showcase for Wolverine who is surpisingly done justice . Good effects and great tones of the comic are some of the plusses. The ending gives way to the possibility of sequels. Rebecca Romajn Stamos,Famke Jansen, Anna Paquin and Halle Barry all are beautiful and made the movie delightful. *** out of ****",Null,0,0,5 August 2000
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," a great ending of a series
","As a kid I watched Jedi the most out of the trilogy and always enjoyed it. The Star Wars films are extremely entertaining and are a fun series of films. I enjoy Jedi and can get past the fact that the Ewoks are cutesy overdone creatures. In this episode the robotic duo goes to Jabba the Hutt's palace and attempts to get Han Solo in his carbon frozen state. Leia is hot in this. I always thought she was very hot in her golden bikini. Once Han is rescued they get briefed on a mission to shut down the shield generator for the second Death Star. Luke must comfront the evil Darth Vader and he faces Vader and the Emperor. The Emperor was always a fave character of mine and after seeing Phantom Menace, I enjoy his role in this better. Han, Leia, Chewbacca and the droids go to the planet Endor which is a huge forest with small furry primitives. The Vader/Luke/Emperor scenes are awesome. This has it's weak lines and Solo is almost a different character but overall it is effective. I'm not about to place the order of quality in the Star Wars series but Return of the Jedi is a great ending for a trilogy. ****",Null,0,0,10 June 2001
Battleship Potemkin," classic Soviet montage
","This is one of the true greats. In the height of the Russian Revolution, a battleship filled with sailors feel poorly treated by the officers. They are served maggot filled meat as a dinner and when they work hard and get nothing but disrespect out of it, they turn against the officers. The film works well because you care about the characters and most of their names arent even given. The battleship arrives near Odessa where a crowd of people wave them on. What follows is one of the most intense scenes ever filmed. The Officers massacre people. Baby carriage and steps, mother clenching her dead child. These are images that are real and get stuck in your head. Go out and rent this. If you cant appreciate silent films then I guess you have no business being on this site. ****",Null,1,2,8 June 2001
The Godfather: Part II," one of the best sequels
","Godfather part 2 is a worthy successor to the original. It has a flashback sequence that chronicles the young Vito Corleone, magnificently played by DeNiro, coming to America and getting into crime. Then it shows how Michael runs the business and how it turns into something big. The FBI starts a trial in order to bust Corleone as the family builds tension. Pacino is explosive as Michael who's marriage is failing because of the life. He makes a hard choices in order for whats best regardless of who gets hurt.  I really dig this movie. Duvall, Diane Keaton and the whole cast goes a great job. Coppola is a cinematic god. ****",Null,0,1,4 June 2001
Fargo," good? you betcha
","Fargo is a great film about a kindnapping scheme gone wrong. Macy is the pathetic car dealer who plots to have his wife kidnapped so he can get the reward money for his own greedy prospects. He drafts Buscemi and his silent partner who in my opinion are the greatest pair of comedic criminals. Things go wrong when a body count starts and a pregnant police chief starts an investigation.

There are tons of nutty side characters such as Kiefer Sutherland and William Hurt. The big threat comes from a group of dark bald guys who want people's souls.

Man on the Moon," this is my review
","Jim Carrey plays the role of Kaufman perfectly from appearance to gesture and voice. That alone makes the movie good but the problem is the script doesnt give justice to Kaufman's live. Maybe they're trying to say that aside from his performing there wasnt much to him. But Ive read books on him and he was seriously demented. Andy starts as a child performing in front of his walls and then is on a stage performing his foreign man schtick. Next is SNL and that leads his to Taxi, which he hates. And everything happens like that, from one big scene to another. The movie seems to be designed behind each bit without any real flow. Pigvomit is very good as Bob Zmuda and the Tony Clifton scenes are great. Most of the film is uneven by Carrey carries it strongly. A must watch for people who dig comedy. Jim Carrey deserved an Oscar for this. ***",Null,0,0,19 May 2001
JFK," star studded conspiracy epic
","JFK is a film that works because we have no idea about the truth behind John F Kennedy's assasination. The books say Lee harvey Oswald did it but is that the truth? Oliver Stone paints a canvas of all sorts of clues based on Jim Garrison's book. Kevin Costner plays Garrison before he started to not care about the movies he appears in. Costner and his investigation group look for many clues involving the other options which could have lead to Kennedy's death. They think it might have something to do with the Cuban Missle Crisis and that Lee Harvery Oswald was a scapegoat for the communist party. Before they could get answers out of Oswald, Jack Ruby kills him. The viewer is entangled with finding out the truth and we watch as Costner get pulled in, making himself distanced from his family. Go out and rent this movie. Many famous faces appear. ****",Null,0,10,13 May 2001
Velvet Goldmine," glam crapple pop
",This is crap. Some of the music is great and Ewan McGregor and Toni Collette do their best but this movie goes nowhere. It is a fictionalized account of David Bowie and Iggy Pop-like characters. The look of the cinematography would have worked in a different movie. The characters try for sympathy but fail because nobody cares about them.

Empire Records," trendy garbage
","I cant believe people like this movie. This is a ripoff of Dazed and Confused and John Hughes. It shows the trials and tribulations along with the hardships of working in a record store. It is totally unrealistic and should be banned. All of the actors look like they are bored to death. I know that some of the actors have talent, with the exception of Ethan Embry but this is an embarrassment. It's only redeeming value is a cameo by Gwar and a cast of beautiful women. Too bad having gorgeous women cant save a movie. Teen dreck. Zero stars",Null,0,3,3 June 2001

Chase stars in one of his best roles as the confused millionaire golf guru, Ty Webb. Ted Knight is the rich stuck up judge who wants the country club his way and Dangerfield is the fresh breath of comedic air that's loud and offensive and steals the show. Murray is the oddball groundskeeper who has to terminate a gopher. This is a laugh a minute flick. Hilarious scenes and it keeps getting funnier. ****",Null,0,0,2 June 2001
Jerry Maguire," show me the money...sorry I couldnt resist
","I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise but I will say that he carries this movie like Bill's Movers Co. He stars as a very well respected sports agent who has everything going for him. He has a delicious Kelly Preston as his fiance,the respect of his peers, success and ties with the sports world. What he doesnt have is the relationships with the people that he wants to. He is wants so much more but cant express it. So he types up a memo for his agency addressing the goals that he wants and how everything could be better run. He is fired and his dignity is shred. The only remaining client he has is a hyped up Cuba Gooding Jr. who he promises will get the cash money that he wants. Rene Zellweger plays his secretary who believes in him and left her other job for him. Jerry's fiance leaves him and eventually he falls for Rene. The ending is sappy and predictable but you got to hand it to Cameron Crowe for making it durable. Strong performances by everyone. Jerry cantrell rocks out in a small role.*** 1/2",Null,1,4,29 April 2001
"Girl, Interrupted"," not a female One Flew Over the Cukoo's nest
","Girl, Interrupted isn't a terrible movie but it tries so hard to be edgy. A beautiful and talanted actress like Winona Ryder hasnt had exposure for years because of her choice of movies like this. This might have been a labour of love for her but to me it was just a hokey movie. Ryder stars as a troubled girl with a personality disorder who goes to a mental institution. Inside she connects with the world of the inpatients and she forms a bond of friendship with  Angelina Jolie. Jolie- well the verdict is still out on her. She might have deserved her Oscar but I dont think she'll ever live up to it. She is more of a media skank the same way phony people are.

Reservoir Dogs," great great
","Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs is a terrific movie from the opening scene were the criminals discuss tipping, Madonna's Like a Virgin, and Tobey Wong. The opening credits of them walking is awesome. The film is told in flashbacks and the heist is brilliantly never seen. We see Mr. Orange,fatally show and Mr. White at the hideout trying to figure out what went wrong. The story involves a group of criminals all brought together in annonymity to pull a job. There is an inside rat and everyone tries to figure it out as the bodies, tension, and acting charisma stacks up. Keitel, Roth, Buscemi, Madsen,..hell, the whole cast gives the performaces of their careers. Mr. Pink is the best character because he clings to his annonymity. They argue over who screwed each other over and who the rat is. This is one of the greatest modern movies as is Pulp Fiction. Great dialouge and every scene and line is classic. I love this movie and whoever doesnt like it clearly doesnt get the picture. ****",Null,1,3,1 June 2001
Titanic," decent movie
","I saw Titanic in the theater with an ex girlfriend and although I didn't cry, I could see why many people did. The film has alot of breathtaking effects and James Cameron has done a great job of replicating the doomed ship. Kate Winslet is absolutely beautiful. The movie was a little too long and the whole heart of the ocean storyline was uninspired. The acting was pretty good but Leonardo Dicaprio is an overrated candyass hack actor.

There is a island beach community that is expecting tourist season anhd Sheriff Brody must dispell rumors of shark attacks. Along with the help of a young shark expert and an old crusty shark hunter they go out for the most scary adventure on the water. I sure know Jaws made me affraid to swim in the water.

",Scream is a pretty good horror movie but the problem isnt in the film it lies with the treatment of how the american public overhyped this movie and how suits milked it for all it was worth. One scream makes fifteen other imitations. It is a self aware version of teenagers who know how to survive cheesy horror movies. The film opens with the impressive Drew Barrymore scene and soon we are taken into the life of Sydney prescott. A masked killer taunts her as every cliche in the horror vault is examined. It's ok and if people accepted it for what it was instead of making it overblown it would be long remembered. Rose McGowan is very sexy in her role.

Carrie," a horror classic regardless of what people say
","Brian DePalma directs Stephen King's first movie adaptation about an awkward girl who one day has a period in gym class. She is the butt of everyone's jokes because she is ugly and unpopular. The problem gets deeper at home because her mother, madly played by Piper Laurie, is an overbearing religious nut. Carrie descovers she has telekenetic powers which means she can move things with her mind. Once the big dance comes around, the popular girls get up the ultimate prank for her and make the most popular guy in school her date. You might as heard about the pig blood scene but see it yourself. She gets even with everyone who crosses her path. I don't think it is the greatest horror film ever but I think that Carrie appeals to everyone who has ever felt like a outcast. Sissy Spaceck is great as the tortured Carrie and John Travolta shows up as the boyfriend of one of the pretty popular girls. Scares do exist in this movie. ***1/2",Null,0,0,11 June 2001
Blow," a buzz rather than a high
",Blow is about George Jung who lived his life opposite from his poor parents. George thinks money will get him happiness and doesnt realize the consequences of selling pot for money. It's money to him and that means everything and success.  He succeeds in making tons of sales and after getting busted and free he gets hooked up with coke and lives the high life. The directing by Ted Demme is alittle sloppy and seems lengthy but he holds interest. The narration and other various similarities in the film resemble Goodfellas but eventually the film fails to be a masterpiece of the epic for which it strives. Pros- Johnny Depp's performance Paul Reubens- stole every scene he was in. Was way too brief.Lola- she is beautiful and was better than Penelope Cruz. Ray Liotta's performance. Soundtrack aside from the cheesy score camera work Cons- Hokey Mrs. Jung- way too over the top. could have worked but chose the ham instead.

Most of his movies are paranoid induced what if's of cinematic perportions but in this flick we are watching the grueling struggle of maintaining a pro football team. Al Pacino stars in a fiery performance as the coach who wants to win. Cameron Diaz is the hot snobby daughter of the teams owner. Jamie Foxx is the talented new guy on the team. Dennis Quaid is the old time has been who's crumbling physical prescence is taking it's toll on him. Do these characters sound familiar? They should cause you can find them in any other sports related movie. The difference here is that Stone handles it with care and lets the actors take their own approach to the roles.

","Episode 4 is the entry that audiences saw first. Many a child has had Star Wars as a part of their childhood.

I dont think its better than a few of Cusacks others but it is a worthy effort. ***,Null,0,1,16 May 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," visually stunning and goofy fun
",This stars Clooney as a Dapper Dan hair obsessed prisoner who with his two dim witted sidekicks escape from prison. They have a long cool journey which is loosely based on Homer's Odyssey. There are a lot of cool comedic moments but personally I didn't like the musical numbers. The acting was cool and quirky and the supporting characters made the movie. Overall I think it was a beautiful movie but not one of the Cohen brothers best. ***,Null,0,0,3 June 2001
