The Ring," Very Overrated
","After watching both versions,the original and the USA remake,all i can say is that both are very overrated,im not saying they were bad movies but just to overrated,especially the USA version. Maybe the reason of this could be that,comparing to the other 'horror' films of hollywood from the past years,like Hallowen Resurrection,Jason X,Scream,etc,almost anythyng else could be scarier,even seeing a fly pass by,and so the audiences think the Ring is so good just because is not another slasher-teen crap.The film creates a good atmosphere,but trows a lot of irrelevant plot events that made a lot of confussion,and the 'scary' moments come more from cheap editing tricks,in a very hollywood style,when they are going to understand that especial effects don´t make a movie good?I didn´t like the ending,and the ending of both versions are similar,but in the USA version,because of all the unnecesary elements they put it in(horses,bugs,nosebleeding,puting the son of Rachel in a six-sense context,etc) the ending seems more weak that in the japanese version.Also,the face of Samara doesn´t scare at all,meanwhile the face of Sadako it´s complettly more frigthening,and when she crawl out of the TV is more convincing too. Overall,The Ring is not a bad film as it´s own,but saying that is one of the most spooky movies of the last years,again,just because the other USA horror films from the last years(Scream,Blair Witch,etc) sucks a lot that doesn´t neccesarilly make this one the 'best' of all,just a little more good from the average,that´s all.At first,i gave it 2 stars of 4,but now i really aprecciatte a lil more this version,and after seeing that the Japanese version is not worthy of all the hype(but also not a bad film),i will give it 2 1/2 stars to the USA version.",7,0,0,25 December 2002
