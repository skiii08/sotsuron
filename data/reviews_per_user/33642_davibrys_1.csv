It," Oversold
","The movie wasn't even scary. Don't get me wrong I liked it but it felt like a really long episode of supernatural. It ruined all the scary moments by making them way too loud so you were distracted from the horror, the clown talked to much so he became a lot less scary, the humor ruined it as well because it relaxed you and you never got a build up of horror. Overall there were about six things they could have tweaked that would have made it pretty scary.",7,1,2,2 October 2017
