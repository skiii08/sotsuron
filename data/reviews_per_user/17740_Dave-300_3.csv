Antz," For Whom Does this Bell Toll?
","Antz!  An interesting concept.  But for whom was the film made.  Certainly not younger people. It's far too philosophical.  Certainly not older people. It's far too simplistic. Where was it intending to go?  God only knows!What a disappointment.  With the technology we have available, I was looking forward to a cinematic treat. What I got, however, was a muddled Woody Allen wringing his hands about the plight of the worker.  Nothing delightful. Nothing creative.  Nothing even close to the imagination of 'Toy Story.'",3,2,6,20 November 1998
Eyes Wide Shut," And Lead Us Not into Temptation
","In a society that often refuses to acknowledge the conflict between good and evil in our world, EYES WIDE SHUT is a refreshing if not somewhat depressing expression of the conflict that resides in each of us.  I'll not summarize the plot, for it would not do justice to the allegory that Kubrick spins as he directs his protagonist toward the abyss of his soul.  I will note, however, that he does it magnificently.  The music is hauntingly beautiful; colors merge and reflect the dissonance of the conflict; the actors are most convincing as they wrestle with their humanity...with their eyes wide shut. 
Certainly, there are problems with the film.  Kubrick is often deliberately, yet, agonizingly slow.  As is the case with all allegory, there are moments of confusion regarding the development of the plot.  Nevertheless, after having had a few days to reflect on the film, I plan to see it again...with my eyes wide open.  It is one of the best films of the year.",9,0,0,20 July 1999
The Matrix," Loud and Violent
","When my friend and I entered the theatre, we raised the average age by at least 20 years. We are over 60, you see.  Of course, the kids loved the flick. It was loud and violent, yet full of the most advanced special effects around. As my friend observed, 'It was candy for the senses!'But he liked it better than I did. Albeit, the plot was surreal. (We always knew that reality was an illusion.) But MATRIX presented details regarding the cosmos and its ontological implications in a much different manner. Humans are mere crops being fertilized by machines who have evolved as our superiors.My friend gives the movie an 8/10 for style, creativity, and sensual intensity. I looked forward to going home and listening to soft, soothing music. If MATRIX is candy for the senses, I must be a diabetic. To me the dark and stark violence was more invasive than satisfying.But, what the hell! That's why we have two thumbs.",5,0,1,26 April 1999
