Hereditary," Great film, genuine terror
","Before we start. PLEASE, hold out on seeing this movie for a few more days! The audience that is in the theater because of the hype will totally ruin it for you. Unnecessary sounds, laughing at inappropriate times and copying main characters. I know spoilers will be around every corner, but you need to see this film whilst being able to be completely absorbed by it. I promise you, you will not be disappointed. A family drama that takes disturbing turns and grabs you by the throat. Honestly, the best horror film I've ever seen! The only thing I hate, is that I don't get to see it for the first time again.",10,54,109,15 June 2018
