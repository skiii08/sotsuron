Blade Runner 2049," Dickensian
","One of the things that made BLADE RUNNER (1982) so interesting to me was it was an era when tv and movie sf seemed to be devouring all the genres, and this looked to be a fine melding of sf with film noir's sour, dour paranoia. There were other reasons to love it. If you were one of the fifty thousand people in the world who knew who Philip K. Dick actually was, then you probably knew he was as crazy as -- well, take whatever your saying for as crazy as you can get and double it. We knew he was poor and could use the money. We didn't know he was dying after decades of living in poverty, to top off the irony.Anyway, here we are, thirty-five years later and sf, like Flash Gordon, has conquered the universe, Ridley Scott has re-edited and re-issued the movie several thousand times, none of which I have ever bothered to look at. I did look at Blade Runner 2049 this afternoon and pronounce it visually stunning, and so what?If I want to stun myself visually, I can stare into a 300-watt bulb set to strobe. You want to stun me visually with a movie in a good way, show me some new stuff in a way that tells a story in a novel manner. That's a little tougher here, what with decades of MAD MAX and RED DWARF. There is one sequence that blew me away, the Dickensian sequence set around San Diego, with dust heaps out of BLEAK HOUSE, and tormented orphans hard at work and such. After that, it was musing on the fact that even Tinkerbelle wants Pinocchio to be a real boy and can something be done about Jared Leto? Will some one give him a chocolate chip cookie at least?In the end, BLADE RUNNER 2049 is a good movie not because it tells exactly same story with newer and more obnoxious special effects, but because it tells another story that arises out of the first, and not just one in which the good guys win because the good guy leaks marginally less blood and lives, while the bad guy dies, thus proving that..... good guys have better clotting? Yay for the good guys! No, Ryan Gosling actually learns a moral lesson and does a good deed as a result, for no benefit. Because in the end, if we want to be human, we must behave as humans.",9,1,6,19 March 2020
Vertigo," Here's to Love on Our Own Terms
","I feel a need to tell you a short anecdote about seeing this movie. When it was restored in the late 1990s, the New York premiere took place at the Ziegfeld. I managed to wangle my way in and saw so much in this movie I hadn't seen before, that can't really be seen except on the big screen.... and when I left the theater, I saw couples coming out..... and three or four women slapped the men they were with.Now it seemed to me clear that they felt that they had undergone some of the transformations imposed on the Kim Novak character by the Jimmy Stewart character for the sake of their relationships and bitterly resented it.... but it seemed to me that Stewart was also transformed by the relationship. In fact, he was destroyed by the relationship.... and was his acquiescence at all voluntary? Yet people do not see the sacrifices that others make for love, they only see their own, and they regret them bitterly.... and that, it seems to me, is that what this movie is about: the forces and twists and turns, the ignoring the clear signs, the self destruction at so many levels that love drives us to. This cynical, manipulative movie about absolute love.Three or four big, hairy men slapped by women. And taking it. Who had been dragged unwillingly into a different personality for the sake of love?",10,3,7,8 January 2006
In Bruges," The Profundity of Banality vs. the Banality of Profundity
","It has been my lot in life to know -- at least to the extent of taking part in conversations with -- three and a half hit men: two definitely and three who might have been killers for hire. None of them were possessed, so far as I could judge, of any great sense of moral angst, existential anguish or philosophic underpinnings to their professions, even to the extent of the 'Get 'er Done' attitude of Larry the Cable Guy. Instead they struck me as thugs who were at times gigglingly happy that people would pay them money for something they gladly did for any or no reason whatsoever. One of them was reputed to have killed his own mother by bashing her head repeatedly against a radiator -- perhaps she was not the most lovable of women. The others struck me as not much more entertaining, despite the fascinating lines of white powder they put on the table for the use of the ladies. None were possessed of the ability to quote Apocrypha at length, discourse on the shmoo or hew to moral precepts at appropriate moments. Indeed, the most accurate depiction of the type may have been Alan Ladd's turn in THIS GUN FOR HIRE: asked how he felt when he kills someone, he replies fiercely and blankly 'I feel fine.' I mention this at the start because IN BRUGES accepts at face value certain assumptions that have become rampant since Quentin Tarrantino got PULP FICTION released. In this movie we have what could have been a black comedy, except that only Ralph Fiennes and Peter Dinklage seem to think it is one. Colin Farrell plays a character similar to his recent turn in CASSANDRA'S DREAM, except that he shows his range by assuming an Irish accent, and Brendan Gleeson adds some weight -- no pun intended -- and kills any comedy by his serious and excellent acting. Bruges is very photogenic in obvious ways -- the only other time I have seen this city in a movie was one of Leonce Perret's endless tableaux epics about lace makers filmed about 95 years ago.The net result is a movie that you enjoy when you are watching it, until you go outside and think about it. All of them wind up dead? Good to hear. Except that in the real world, they don't.It would be all too easy to accept this as a great picture based on its track record: a fine cast, a writer-director who just won an Oscar for best short subject, excellent cinematography and so on. But looking at the heart of it, you should see its intellectual and artistic laziness, its acceptance of false assumptions because they enable the creator to gloss over its vacuity with fine words. But it does not use its assumptions to challenge us in any way, except to try to convince us that vicious, uncaring murderers are people just like you and me. Well, they aren't like me, and I know the difference. I hope that you do too.",4,19,51,10 February 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Topnotch Action Comedy Sequel
","Gore Verbinski has had a rocky career. Some of his movies have been very funny but commercially unsuccessful, like MOUSE HUNT, and some have just been annoying, like THE Mexican. However, here, aided with a script that never takes itself seriously and topnotch actors -- Johnny Depp repeats his astonishingly engaging off-kilter performance as Jack Sparrow -- he has turned out a fine sequel to 2003's PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE BLACK PEARL.The special effects serve this movie well and the highlight of the film, the three-way sword duel, will keep you laughing throughout. The movie times in at two and a half hours, but you won't notice.SPOILER: The only issue that might affect your enjoyment is that there is a third movie and the last ten minutes sets you up for it. You may feel some annoyance at the lack of closure. But be patient.",8,22,43,30 June 2006
Knives Out," A Fine B Movie
","The mystery writer Christopher Plummer has died. Although the police have just about wrapped up their investigation, his nurse, Ana de Armas is nervous; she knows that she had given him the wrong doses of medicine, the antidote was missing from her bag, and he had slashed his throat after arranging with her an elaborate charade so she would would not be suspected. The family and police were satisfied, yet here is the great detective Daniel Craig, holding it open. He has been hired to investigate, although he does not know by whom. The plot thickens when the will is read, and the heir to Plummer's vast fortune is Miss de Armas.Once upon a time, the movie theaters ran full programs of selected short subjects, a feature film, and quite often a second feature. The second features were generally lower-budgeted movies, meant to be rented out to the theaters at a flat rate, and often genre films.... like mystery films. Some of these second features were series, and quite popular; it was no unknown for people to go to a show specifically for the second feature, a Sherlock Holmes mystery, or a Charlie Chan mystery, featuring stars who perhaps did not shine brightly enough for the major studios' A pictures, but would bring in the customers.Eventually, the program shortened: no more selected short subjects, no more second feature. Nowadays, a movie show usually consists of a feature film and previews of coming attractions. Yet, long as it is, and with such a varied and interesting cast as it has -- Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, and half a dozen others -- this movie strikes me as a B picture, with an ornate plot, some small and gratifying witticisms.... in short, a superior example of the form.If you are wise enough to see this movie, you will be sorely confused, as mystery is piled atop mystery, and how to untangle them all. I know I was. At the end, all will be revealed, and the journey from start to finish will have turned out to be worthwhile.",8,7,16,1 December 2019
Match Point," Film Noir
","I'm always glad to see a new Woody Allen film and this is no exception. Here he returns to the dark, chaotic world he investigated in CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS -- his best straight drama, I believe -- and which he explored comically in BULLETS OVER Broadway -- his best comedy and you may disagree with both choices: a world without a god to impose a moral order which, tragically, destroys the men and women who inhabit it. A world of Film Noir that takes place across the river from London's Parliament where man's laws are made where he gives us a variation of AN American TRAGEDY. Yes, it can happen there.There is a lot less Bergman influence in this movie. Instead the influences are visual touches: Hitchcock, Truffaut and others jostle each other in this script, the effective story of how a former tennis player cold-bloodedly marries into a wealthy English family -- 'They've got nothing but money' he says trenchantly at one point -- and winds up murdering his pregnant mistress, the former fiancée of his brother-in-law. The script is brilliantly done and, even as he struggles to hide his crime, he wants himself caught. That desire to pay for his crime is the only thing that endears him to the audience, but it was enough to put the New York audience -- including me -- who sat through the showing on the first day of the new year in a similar mood. Would he be caught, which would give the universe some moral shape, or would he succeed in his quest for freedom and wealth? The script is topnotch, the cast performs admirably and the background of operatic music adds to the melodramatic tensions.If the movie has any weakness, it is purely a comparative one: Woody Allen's New York films capture New York with subtlety. Wandering the streets of Manhattan, he can finds spots of beauty that would escape the casual eye: a scrap of paper blowing in the wind on 9th Street, the warehouse where the floats for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade are stored, the cramped interior of a basement store in Chinatown. His views of London are more conventional in this movie: a river view of Parliament, the brick galleries of a London tennis club, the wood-and-leather library of a stately country home.Perhaps, in time, Mr. Allen's perspective may bring us images of London that the natives have overlooked, but I doubt it. While this movie and his next, scheduled movie, also shot in London are worthwhile experiments, Woody Allen based in London is as unthinkable as Woody Allen in Hollywood. Come home, please, Woody. We need each other.",7,5,10,1 January 2006
Moana," Autotune
","I have been a bit leery of DIsney Princess movies of late, since they seem to have fallen into rote modes. Frankly, I didn't care for Frozen at all, and was surprised when it did great business. However, I neither know nor care what most people want. I'm lucky if I know what I like after I've seen it, and I like this movie a lot. It's a real Hero's Journey, with a lot of story, and the roles of the characters keep shifting around. When I heard Maui's voice, I thought 'Is that Dwayne Johnson? And do I now know Dwayne Johnson's voice?' When he began singing the best song of the movie I was convinced I was mistaken, but I was wrong. I was not mistaken, and apparently he can sing pleasantly.The songs are decent, although not as good as they were when Ashman was doing the lyrics, but reasonably effective. The story twisted and turned quite often in unexpected ways and a good time was had by All. Isn't that what seeing a movie in the theater is all about?",8,0,0,7 July 2020
The Book Thief," Great Story and Acting -- Overfull Script
","THE BOOK THIEF is a movie full of great incidents and characters, top production values and fine acting -- Geoffrey Rush is one of those actors I believe cannot give a less than brilliant performance and Emma Watson creeps into your heart slowly and steadily throughout. The story is telling and surprisingly hopeful in the end.Unhappily, this is not a great movie and the problem can be laid squarely at the feet of the scriptwriter. Based, as it is, on a book, the first problem lies in how to translate ideas into images and what to cut without losing the movie's heart. Michael Petroni has succeeded admirably in the former endeavor, but has not been entirely successful in the latter. Roger Allam's narration of the story as Death is well performed, but ultimately pompous and a cheat.I have not read the book this movie is based on, but it seems likely to me that the narration attempts to replicate the third person omniscient narrator of the book. Sometimes it is the details like this that endear a book to us, but the translation from one medium to another requires great care and narration is rarely a good idea in a movie. The attempt by narration to make the conditions of the movie simultaneously universal and of great individual importance is miscalculated. It may work in the book. It does not work on the screen.This is a movie I took great pleasure in while in the theater. As I said, the acting and attention to detail are compelling. However, the scriptwriter was apparently too fond of the least cinematic parts of the book and the entire movies suffers thereby. It's still compelling, but far less than it might have been.",7,6,14,22 November 2013
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Frances McDormand
","I have not been very fond of earlier films by Martin McDonagh, but this movie has Frances McDormand in the lead role as a woman who puts up those three billboards. It's been a good many months since her daughter was raped while dying, then doused with kerosene and set afire, and she puts up those billboards asking sheriff Woody Harrelson why they haven't arrested anyone.With McDonagh's earlier movies, the performances have been all over the shop, as if some people are playing a scene for comedy and some for tragedy and no one is talking to anyone else. With McDormand at the center, saying what she is saying, the mood shifts in an instant from comedy to Harrelson's coughing his lungs out without anyone missing a beat. It's one of those instants in a movie that tells you that these actors are inhabiting these characters who have known each other for decades and draws me into the moment and the story far more than anything else could.I don't know if McDonagh has finally learned how to direct his own material; I suspect that he let McDormand have her own head. Several decades ago, her turn in FARGO had me convinced that Ethan Coen came in one day and said 'Joel, if you don't let Frances play this scene the way she wants, I'm going to be sleeping on the couch for a long time.'
I think she understands these characters and can show them, and McDonagh let her have her head. The proof is on the screen, if you go look at it.",10,0,0,19 March 2020
The Lost City of Z," Piffle
","No decision should ever be made without consulting women, who are each and every one wiser than any man. White men are evil, particularly those who are successful; if they have packed on some extra weight, they are vicious. Only people who live in the back of beyond and shoot anyone who shows up are possessed of true virtue. These are the accepted assumptions of modern people, who make technological constructs costing tens of millions of dollars about this, like, well, this movie.My cousin and I saw this Sunday, and I have spent the last couple of days being annoyed. I went to see a movie set in the years 1910-1924. I saw a movie about 2017 characters. Perhaps this is always the way of movies; maybe it's not just the hair style that gives away the fact that a movie set in 1478 was actually made in, say 1948. Likely as I grow older and more disjoint from this world, I see the anachronisms more clearly: not just the devices, but the attitudes.Anyway, it's based on Percy Fawcett, British Major, surveyor and general nut, and his expeditions to Amazonia. It's a hagiography.Apparently the farmers who lived and worked near where the crew shot this wrote to the papers complaining about the noise, the explosions and gunfire from where the crew was shooting. That's just like farmers, always putting their interests ahead of movies made by White men explaining how bad White men are.",5,0,0,16 March 2020
Justice League," Waiting For Godot.... I Mean Kal-El
","This movie demonstrates that the people in charge of the DC Universe have been learning the lessons of what they have been doing wrong and what Marvel has been doing right, in a mechanical fashion, if nothing else. The right things include hiring Joss Whedon to work over matters, because not everyone spends every second of every day being a miserable meanie, and that different things motivate different people. Some of the things they have learned that are wrong include 1: a dorky, brilliant teenager makes a great character, so let's make the Flash Spiderman; 2: the relationship between Paranoid Batman and everyone else doesn't work, so let's just.... gloss that over awkwardly, by having him behave awkwardly over it.That's fine, because these are all people who do not Play Well with Others. On the plus side, one thing DC figured out was how to deal with the Rock-em-Sock-em Robots battle, by putting in grades of robots, and noticing that there are actually civilians on the battlefield, and assigning some people to actually getting them out of the way of the FREAKING HOLOCAUST THAT'S APPEARING RIGHT AROUND THEM! On the other hand, the second third of the movie turns into Waiting for Superman, since once the Man of Steel shows up, neither G*d nor wombat can stand against his might.Mind you, I stopped reading comic books in 1969, and hadn't bothered with DC for half a decade before then. Still, it was more amusing and a better story than BATMAN VS SUPERMAN. They're still pinning their hopes on Gal Gadot, though.",6,1,8,19 March 2020
Duck You Sucker," Desconstruction With Explosives
","Mexican bandit Rod Steiger and his family meet ex-IRA explosives expert James Coburn when he blows up their railroad car, and falls in love. Why not rob a bank? Coburn agrees, but has more in mind. He radicalizes Steiger, makes him a hero to the followers of Pancho Villa as some grand joke.It's one of Sergio Leon's big, sprawling spaghetti westerns, in which he deconstructs more of the myths of the Old West, and tackles the fashionable revolutionary movements of the 1960s. Coburn may read Bakunin, but he is haunted by the violence of the Easter Rebellion. Steiger is driven by the desire for wealth, but he doesn't want to destroy the world he has grown up in, he wants to be part of it. Both men are adored by the Mexican revolutionaries, but Romolo Valli knows Coburn of old, and knows him for what he is. In the end, they are not creating a better world for people. They are only creating destruction.",9,1,1,17 August 2019
To Rome With Love," The warmth of banked embers
","For most of the past decade Woody Allen has been revisiting old themes in new places. He writes a witty script, hires a good cameramen, has great actors flock to him because he writes great lines for them and directs the film efficiently. So we have travel vistas that he has even been putting the city's name in, like VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA, MIDNIGHT IN Paris and now the Fellini-esque TO ROME WITH LOVE.If you get the idea that I look down on these efforts, let me say I enjoy them very much. Mr. Allen has reached an age and ability in his craft where he can do things easily and smoothly, so that the three farces that make up this anthology set in the Eternal City offer some wonderful excuses to show off the city. My favorite is the one about Roberto Benigni, an ordinary man who suddenly finds himself a celebrity upon whom the media hang. His bewilderment is a lovely, comic performance. However, if you prefer the one about the retired record producer who makes the machetunim an opera sensation in the shower or the the one about the young temptress, that's fine too.",7,6,14,30 June 2012
1917," Another Day In One Long Take
","The command has realized that the Germans have pulled back for a trap on a British offensive. The telephone lines are cut, and the only way to get the orders through to the colonel commanding the offensive is to send two soldiers through the lines. One of them has special incentive. His elder brother is a soldier in the attack. If it goes through, 1600 men, will be wiped out for no purpose.... including the soldier's brother.It's a classic story-telling format that dates back to the ANABASIS: get from point A to Point B, only here it's just two men traveling through the alternating inferno of the Great War's front lines, and the bucolic springtime of northern France. Effective as that is, director Sam Mendes and cinematographer Roger Deakins have shot it, as near as they could manage, as one long take - after I had realized what they were doing, about twenty minutes into the film, I began to look for ways of editing things together. While I spotted a few, there was really only one obvious spot, and that was after more than an hour had passed.This deliberate effort to make this movie in this manner clearly has a point. It is a constant barrage, one long cinematic sentence that must be swallowed whole. It forces the viewer to take it all in in one piece, giving, perhaps, a hint of the overwhelming sensory overload of this struggle to get through.It certainly worked on me.",8,1,3,10 January 2020
Cold War," I'm In Love With You And All That Jazz
","Joanna Kulig is recruited for a Polish folk song chorus right after the War. Tomasz Kot is the arranger/conductor, and they soon begin an affair. When the chorus begins to become popular, however, it is suggested that the folk like to sing about Stalin. When they do, they are rewarded with an appearance in East Berlin, whence they plan to escape to the West. She doesn't show up, so he goes on. It takes ten years before she shows up in Paris, where he scores movies and plays in a jazz bar.Pawel Pawlikowski's feature has been chosen as Poland's submission for this year's Best Foreign Language Movie Award, and it has a lot going for it. It has beautiful, crisp black-and-white photography - intended, no doubt to mark it as a period piece - two good looking leads and uses its musical score to cover the flowering and eventual senescence of post-war Jazz as a metaphor for the couple's relationship. However, those are the bare necessities of a good movie, which it is. As a serious contender for an Oscar, it needs to offer more than a good story, told well; at least, I would hope it should. I think it's worth seeing, if not revering.",6,6,13,20 January 2019
Singin' in the Rain," Ecstasy
","(Best read while listening to Benny Goodman's Carnegie Hall Concert)When I was a slave in Egypt (as I reminisce yearly at the Seder table), I was driven with whips and scorpions. As a young man in New York City, my father was driven with the drums of Gene Krupa, just like Benny Goodman's band. The whips and scorpions yielded only ten plagues and some pyramids. Listen to the music of Benny Goodman, and hear ecstasy. Listen to it and need to dance. Look at the word, and trace its origins to the Greek. That's what I mean: ecstasy, like a maenad high on wine and ivy and dance.That's why I love musicals. I don't know who said it, but when mere words fail you, you sing; when song fails you, you dance. Listening to Goodman play 'Sing, Sing Sing (with a Swing)' makes me want to dance. So does Singin' in the Rain. Gene Kelly drove Debbie Reynolds, sobbing, to Fred Astaire (another famous taskmaster) for sympathy. Donald O'Connor was sent home for a week's bed rest after performing 'Make 'Em Laugh' and after that, had to perform it again. When Arthur Freed asked what Gene Kelly would be doing for the title number, Kelly said 'I don't know, Arthur. All I know is it'll be raining, and I'll be singing.' Millard Mitchell based his performance on Freed; Jean Hagen was robbed of a best supporting actress Oscar; Comden & Green were still building their reputation and Kelly & Donen were taking it easy after An American in Paris.As a wiser man than I has noted the best works are often produced when the artists are slumming a bit. All I know is that when they're not making me laugh in this movie (and sometimes when they are), they are dancing joyfully, and making me wish I could dance. There are no sad numbers, and for me the song 'Moses Supposes', when Kelly & O'Connor rip the speech expert's office to shreds with a tongue twister and a tap dance, is just as exhilarating as 'Good Mornin'' or 'Singin' in the Rain'. When I'm in the depths of one of my depressive funks (as I am today), and every task seems to be impossible, it's good to look at this movie. It helps me remember that, fantasy though it is, it exists, with its performers' feet bleeding, and rising from their sickbeds to try again to make me smile. And they will succeed.According to the story my jazz maven from Toronto tells me, they were not even going to record the Carnegie Hall concert. They had more than enough air checks. At the last moment, they put a mike in its wonted spot in the ceiling, ran a wire across the street, recorded in wax and then the masters went into Benny Goodman's hall closet for a decade and a half, until his young daughter said 'Daddy, what's this?' We came close to losing that. Singin' in the Rain has remained on view for more than sixty years, a commonplace miracle of survival Let's enjoy it, separately but together, and thank all those people who made it, from Arthur Freed down to runner who fetched coffee on set. They've never done better.",10,0,0,28 March 2020
Three Colors: Blue," The Greatest Of These
","There's a car crash and a great composer and his daughter are killed. His wife, Juliet Binoche survives.... sort of. She tries to kill herself, but cannot, so she .... puts everything in trust for her mother and her husband's servants, orders the house sold and the proceeds added to the trust, has one night of passion with her husband's colleague, Benoît Régent, then leaves. She rents a cheap apartment, spends her time watching other people, and drifts.She tries to disappear into nothingness. However the world keeps intruding.Since this is the first of Krzysztof Kieslowski's TROIS COULEURS trilogy, I kept looking at the colors. He's obvious in his palette, using blue for sadness, red for life, and a general sepia wash for the anomie and observational phase of the movie.Yet to reduce a discussion of this fine movie to the technical tricks of the trade does no justice to its rich story, and the way everything in the world comes together to bring Miss Binoche to a realization of her own place in the world and her own nature. There are some startling realizations along the way, and Kieslowski and Miss Binoche are patient and deliberate in this portrait, teasing the audience into being interested in this character, who seems to be nothing without her husband and child, and desires to be nothing. In the end, I like to think, like Kieslowski and Binoche's Julie, we are all more than we seem.",10,4,5,27 November 2019
The Shape of Water," The Love Life Of The Creature From The Black Lagoon
","Guillermo del Toro is a real talent, but I think this movie asks a question that I was not that interested in: given that sexuality is an intensely personal kink, who would be turned on by the Creature from the Black Lagoon? And aren't the people who don't like the Creature from the Black Lagoon just horrid statists?My interest in the various more popular forms of scifi have never extended to K/S or such. They never brought it up; therefore it didn't happen or was none of my business, and none of yours either. The dirtier, the better, and the less your business. And mine. Good fences make good neighbors, and so do drapes for the windows. And thick walls.There are some fine images, and Del Toro has gotten some top-notch performers in to offer some wonderful performances, including Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins (a personal best performance) and Octavia Spencer. However, as is often the case with these visual stylists, the pacing becomes uneven in the middle. I get the impression the director is fighting with the editor and the pacing suffers.",6,1,3,19 March 2020
Despicable Me," Not an Animated Feature
","DESPICABLE ME is not an animated feature. It is a flat-out feature-length cartoon, a rare bird in the field, and the first really successful one since THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE. If anything, it's better.Animated features are typically fantasies, taking us to places and stories that cannot be filmed in live action. They can be dramatic, fantastic, inspirational, terrifying, all the range of emotions. Cartoons are different. Cartoons inhabit a universe that is a cross between Krazy Kat and the Keystone Kops. Walk off a cliff and you don't fall until you notice. Fall a thousand yards and hit the ground and you wheeze like an accordion until the next scene, when you're fine. Cartoons are silly.And this one is very very silly, from Steve Carell's indecisively Eastern European-voiced Grue to Julie's Andrews who, as his mom, sounds like Beaky Buzzard's mother in Bugs Bunny shorts, to the seemingly indistinguishable minions who talk like Chip and Dale on helium -- Grue knows all their names. A modern supervillain has to have people skills.The gags are all spot on in relevance and impeccably timed. The plot advances at a good clip and even the heartwarming aspects of the plot never descend into mawkishness -- the little girls whom Grue adopts to advance his plan to steal the Moon are endearing but frequently annoying.I saw the 3-D version and the question arises, should you spend the extra money to see it in 3-D? I don't think so -- but then I am happy looking at stuff in black and white and even silent films. You may get a little more out of the 3-D version, particularly the credit extras. But that's up to you. See it in whatever form you like, but see it.",10,82,122,6 July 2010
Marriage Story," Should've Been Called 'Divorce Story'
","Adam Driver is an off-Broadway director who has just won a MacArthur Grant. Scarlett Johansson is the leading player of his company. Their marriage is falling to pieces. She has just gotten a TV pilot, so she's off to California with their son. They've agreed to an amicable divorce, but she gets a lawyer in California, so he gets a lawyer in California, and things go straight to heck.Hitchcock said 'The length of a film should be directly related to the endurance of the human bladder.' Netflix has set that at naught. Once upon a time, you saw a movie in a theater, and you didn't want to duck out on a feature, so you headed for the facilities while the James Fitzpatrick Traveltalk was on. Later, you might see it on television, where the presence of 'station identifications' served as features rather than bugs. Now we have the ability to not only watch from the comfort of our homes, but to stop and start the movie at our pleasure. You can watch this movie's 136 minutes -- that's the length of a season of a British series -- in little more than two hours, or stretch it to over whatever time you wish. Go, take a bath, read WAR AND PEACE, take a trip around the world, these poor characters will be waiting to suffer for your pleasure whenever you like.Is that even a movie as we understand the word? With the constraint of time removed, there's no need to limit the length of the...show. Nor was there much evidence that the film makers had. The leads are brilliant performers; they indulge in long, one-shot monologues, they inhabit their characters, it's a brilliant supporting cast, the leads each sing a song from Sondheim's COMPANY, and by the end of it, it seemed to have gone on as long as my 18-month divorce had. As soon as I left the theater, I began to trim the movie in my own mind, and soon had taken half an hour from it without losing anything from the story. True, you wouldn't hear Miss Johanssen, Julie Hagerty and Merritt Wever sing 'You Could Drive A Person Crazy' in my version, showing the enormous range and ability necessary to winning awards. But you could go on a date, eat a meal, see the movie, and get home in time to get to work the next morning.Oh, concessions could have been made. An intermission could have been put in. It wasn't, because it was never made with that in mind. So, no, I don't think it's a movie, even if I did see it in a movie theater.Was it good? As someone who went through a bad divorce, it was too raw for me.",6,13,27,15 December 2019
Jojo Rabbit," Weird. Definitely Weird
","Roman Griffin Davis is looking forward to a week at Hitler Youth Camp. When he fails to demonstrate his dedication to ethnic purity and Nazi ideals by breaking the neck of a rabbit, the rest of the campers start call young Johannes -- that's Master Davis -- 'Jojo Rabbit'. He runs off, naturally, and confers with his goofy imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler, who informs him of the ferocity of rabbits. So Roman runs back, where Sam Rockwell is about to give all the boys a chance to throw a grenade, grabs one, and winds up scarring his face and behind. When he gets out of the hospital, his mother, Scarlett Johansson knees Rockwell in the ... well, it's not the behind.All perfectly normal in the year 1945, as the Thousand Year Reich's ever victorious army is being shredded, with Russian, American, British, and probably Chinese armies are about to march on the town. It's when Roman discovers that his mother is hiding Thomasina McKenzie, a Jew, in the floorboards behind his dead sister's room, that things begin to get odd. She takes his knife away from him, but they eventually reach a stalemate, because if Miss Johannsson finds out he's found out, then Elsie will have to go. So instead, he begins quizzing her on her diabolical schemes to take over the world, where are the horns on her head * and so forth. It gradually begins to dawn on him that he may not have understood reality perfectly up to now, which is startling for a boy who has achieved the great age of ten and a half to realize.It's a weird movie about children being asked to grow up too fast. The only movie that feels at all like it is THE DEATH OF STALIN, and this feels way weirder to me. After all, one of my grandfathers was a communist, but everyone agreed that Hitler was the worst person ever. It was so obvious that even the goyim had figured it out, although it took them a war to reach the startling conclusion that someone who had been screaming about Jews, Slavs, Blacks and homosexuals for more than twenty years, and who had killed, oh, all of them he could manage, might not be the nicest guy in the world. It's certainly upsetting to think of him as a goofy imaginary friend.I know what you're thinking. You're thinking 'here's an American Jew who grew up in the aftermath of the Second World War, when about a third of his family had been killed in the Holocaust -- which some of you deny ever happened -- so he has issues! It's not like some one vile, like Justin Trudeau, John Wayne, or Walt Disney, was a goofy imaginary friend, which is impossible, because they were evil incarnate.'Well, we all have issues, don't we? This is one weird movie. Is it a great movie? It's a weird one.

Kagemusha," Go, Bid The Soldiers Shoot
","Convicted thief Tatsuya Nakadai (Kagemusha) escapes crucifixion by virtue of his extraordinary resemble to Lord Shingen. He becomes the nobleman's double. When Shingen dies, the leaders of the clan keep up the pretense.Can I usefully say something about one of Akira Kurosawa's masterpieces? In many ways, this seems the most Shakespearean of his movies; even though he made several based on Shakespeare's plays (most notably THRONE OF BLOOD and RAN), freed from the necessity of translation, Kurosawa seems to have borrowed elements that bespeak the plays, from the motivation of the dead Shingen driving the story, to the three spies popping up to comment on the action. Indeed, if this suggests any of Shakespeare's plays, it is HAMLET.Another point I noticed is that visually, this looks the most painterly of Kurosawa's movies, that most painterly of directors. It opens on ranks of soldiers in the foggy distance, lending an impressionistic air to the proceedings; the dream sequence is on a set that has been painted with a pallette knife; the most realistically shot sequence is the battle Kagemusha incites and must remain an unmoving observer of, the deaths of the soldiers on his conscience.In the end, this is a formal Greek tragedy, although it obeys no unity of time or space; the sin that is punished is hubris. Kagemusha thinks he can fool everyone, including Shingen's horse and loses what he has come to care for; and those who now rule the domain, think they have won the victories, and can win another.There are many other things to mention in this movie, even if Kurosawa called it merely 'a dress rehearsal for RAN'. I will not presume to think I have noticed all of them or am competent to instruct you in them. As always, my comments are meant to let you know my thoughts, hoping they may be of some slight aid to you. In the end, you must decide whether any movie is good, bad or indifferent. All I can do is recommend the occasional one to your attention; I so do with this one.",10,1,1,17 November 2019
The Ugly Truth," Erratic
","I have just come from a movie theater where I saw the new romantic comedy 'The Ugly Truth' starring Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler. It was directed by Robert Luketic with three screen writers, two of whom worked with the director on an earlier hit, LEGALLY BLONDE.With a title that suggests the great Leo MacCarey comedy THE AWFUL TRUTH, this movie has been taking an awful lot of criticism, mostly directed at Miss Heigl, a beautiful and competent actress who has, it seemed, been called upon to carry a script which is mostly distinguished by the fact that her character, as written, is composed of a number of seemingly immiscible characteristics, none of which are ever sorted out; and which seems to attempt to move between standard screwball, standard romantic comedy, with occasional Farrelly-Brothers-style freak-out jokes tossed in, with no presagement, rhyme nor reason.The whole thing ends in such a predictable manner in a sky filled with balloons that the film might have been written by simply taking discarded parts of other scripts and tossing them in.In short, while Miss Heigl does not distinguish herself in this indistinguishable mess, laying the blame at her feet strikes me as cruel and foolish. While she is given an 'executive producer' credit, there are a total of eleven producers on this film, which is up near the John Woo level. Miss Heigl carries out her acting assignment competently, and she has good chemistry with Mr. Butler. While she has appeared in other romcoms to better effect -- I did enjoy 27 DRESSES -- surely her job as an actor is not to rewrite the script, nor to insist on a character that makes sense, but to perform the role in a manner as plausible as possible, to milk the funny lines for what they are worth and to be generally of interest when she is on screen. She accomplishes the last, but surely the fact that her character makes no sense and that the gags are thrown in at random cannot be laid at her feet.Mr. Butler is given a much more interesting role, that of a chauvinist pig whose TV producer Miss Heigl is forced to become. However, the audience is swiftly assured that this is simply a pose to cover a warm heart and Miss Heigl comes to recognize this gradually -- and telling the audience quickly and Miss Heigl slowly is another problem with the script. There is also the third wheel, played by Eric Winter, who plays an unattached doctor with a body that looks like he spends three or four hours a day working on his abs. Although my early assumption that he would turn out to be gay were not borne out, he serves no real impediment to Mr. Butler's and Miss Heigl's inevitable romance.The result is that this is a poor but fitfully watchable romcom, distinguished mostly by Mr. Butler's macho maundering on What Men Really Want. If you miss it, you won't miss much, but I doubt if the actively painful scenes -- including the aftermath of a discussion of masturbation that the Farrelly Brothers would reject as neither funny nor realistic --will cause you to walk out of the theater.",5,9,17,29 July 2009
