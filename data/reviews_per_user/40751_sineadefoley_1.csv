Lucky Number Slevin," how great is this film???
","this film is the best film I've seen in ages.its funny,slick and has some great dark humor.its slightly confusing at first but all of a sudden your hooked.great acting from all the cast members but extra credit to josh hartnett.hes brilliant.its like the different parts were written specifically for each actor. sir ben kingsley,morgan freeman and bruce willis all fit their roles to a tee.its also a different type of role for lucy liu.she should do more films like this one.all in all this is a brilliant brilliant film.it can be fast paced at times so make sure you keep up and listen to every word.it twists and turns so much you'll be dizzy.ill be recommending this film to everyone i talk to whether i know them or not.thats how great this film is.",10,0,4,28 June 2006
