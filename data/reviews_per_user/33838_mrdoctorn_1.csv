Requiem for a Dream," Awesome
","First off, I never heard of this movie until I by accident found it here on IMDb and rented it.Now usually I don't get so hard feelings over a movie, but after watching this movie I had to sit still for a LONG time and just consider the values of life and more! I'm a huge fan of Stanley Kubrick, and well obviously this movie isn't made by him but, it have a similar 'fobia' feeling that 'a clockwork orange' gives me. The environment is splendid, not to mention the performances of the actors. The fast clips and reoccurring pictures makes it even more gripping of, at least my, heart.I recommend this to anyone, but a warning would be it is a heavy and depressing movie.",9,0,1,16 November 2005
