First Man," What a Mess
","This could have been a great film, but it was far from that.This is another in the modern Hollywood vein of making a film/dramatisation of famous real-life events, this situation/story was a cracking one, the life of Neil Armstrong leading up to him walking on the moon. But instead the Director Damien Chazelle destroyed any chance of a good film !!The main problem was the close-up and ultra-close-up filming, I have seen this elsewhere in movies and on TV, IT DOES NOT WORK!, all it does is annoy me because you don't get to see much, you need a wider viewpoint from the camera. The editing was also rubbish, it was poorly made.I am not a fan of Ryan Gosling, having seen some of his early efforts, however I have to admit it was great acting from him, he played the part of the quiet spoken Neil Armstrong well, too well, I know NA was not a blabbermouth but he did speak more than Ryan portrayed him, but that is my only quibble with the part, other than that it was great. The other actors also did a fine job, I would be interested in hearing what they thought about what their work turned into ?.I have read other reviews of this movie and most of them refer to how boring it was, I don't think it was that boring (some people just have the attention span of a Gnat), however it did seem to drag on for a while in parts (mostly just annoying with the camera work), apart from the annoying ultra close-ups the flying/space scenes were good but the family scenes were a bit lacking, they needed more dialogue, I am sure that NA spoke to his wife a whole lot more than in this film.If you want to see a good movie of a similar vein, Apollo 13 with Tom Hanks is the one, not this one, only watch this if you are doing an History major at college.I gave it a 4 out of 10, but only for the acting and true story, if the acting was also poor it would of got a 2 from me. Ryan Gosling gets a 9 for his acting, Damien Chazelle a Zero out of 10 for his direction. I just hope someone else (with any other Director) makes a film about the first moon landing, it can't possibly be worse than this.",4,0,1,26 November 2019
Men in Black 3," Great Again
","The third in the series now, traditionally most sequels start suffering from lack of good story, poor screenplay and lamentable acting, but not this, the original was very good, the second was a little down on that but not by much, but this is up there with the first.The storyline is a bit confusing, but it works as a film, acting ok, particularly Josh Brolin as a young K, and Jermaine Clement as Boris The Animal, Will Smith is his usual Will Smith character, the same one he plays in all his films, but is very watchable, Tommy Lee Jones by way of the story is not used as much but as usual is good. Nicole Scherzinger is deliciously stunning at the start as Boris's girlfriend, she does not say much, but looks fantastic.The 60's scenes are well made, CGI is excellent good direction and good pacing, music not as good as the first but OK.Overall it is another excellent addition to the series, well worth watching.",8,0,0,22 February 2020
Skyfall," Sky High
","This is the best Bond film to date, just about everything about it was excellent, the acting, direction, photography scenery, authentic locations and music, the title song by Adele is pretty good too.No gadgets except the radio transmitter, return of the Aston Martin DB5, and a Bentley (in the Ian Fleming books he was supposed to have a Bentley) but that is M's car. There are a return of a few Bond themes too, a Casino scene and helicopters, Moneypenny is back, but not the original one, this character is called Eve Moneypenny, although it is not mentioned whether she is a relative of the old Moneypenny, she is played by the excellent Naomie Harris, and Q is back but in a younger form played by Ben Whishaw. Rory Kinnear plays Tanner again and to complete the MI6 crew, Judi Dench plays M again but her last time, she dies at the end, and the role of M is taken by Ralph Fiennes, a cracking actor. Albert Finney does a good cameo as Kincaid and Javier Bardem plays one of the creepiest villains as Silva.The locations are almost all authentic, Turkey, Istanbul, London, Scotland, Shanghai and the Island, in the film it does not refer to which territory the Island belonged to or did previously, since they sailed from Shanghai to get to it, its implied that it is a Chinese Island, but the one they used was a real Island, with real derelict buildings, but is in Japan, but opposite the East China Sea from Shanghai so would represent accuracy in the film, the only faked locations were Macao and some of the Shanghai scenes, not enough to worry about, they do need to make some stuff in the studio anyway.
Henchmen :- there seemed to be a few, working for Silva, but no one really stood out, maybe the Chinese looking guy that got dragged off by a Komodo Dragon, oh and just in case you wondered about that, Komodo Dragons do eat humans in real life!, they are a bit slow, so easy to avoid but their saliva contains a paralysing agent, so if they bite you or even just get their mouth around any part of you, it will disable you and then the creature will drag you off for its lunch!Bond Girls :- 3 in this, No.65 is a Turkish beauty in the intro, after he got shot by Moneypenny Bond has not returned and decided to go native in Turkey and she is the one he has been shagging whilst he had been away, played by Tonia Sotiropoulou (Greece), she is the most beautiful in the film. Next is the new Moneypenny, Eve Moneypenny (no.66) played by Naomie Harris, at last a Moneypenny got to shag bond, but not the original, the sex is supposed to have occurred after the shave scene, but he did not know her name at the time, she only reveals that to him at the end. No.67 is Severine played by French actor Berenice Marlohe, who had an odd looking face, she plays a baddie who meets Bond in the casino (where else) scene, and invites him back to her boat, if he survives, obviously he makes it, if Bond can kill all for Queen and Country, he can also do it if a shags in the offering, and he does her in the shower, after they get to the island Silva kills her.This is supposed to be a standalone film, it does not have much to link it to the last 2 which were a part 1 & 2 in reality, however in the next film, it is revealed that the Quantum organisation in Casino Royale & Quantum of Solace are really part of SPECTRE in that film and Silva also worked for SPECTRE, making this film as a part 3 in the series, and SPECTRE being part 4. But until that was made it looked like it was on its own and all in all an excellent film, not much to complain about, so I won't, 10 out of 10.",10,0,3,15 April 2020
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Traders of A Lost Art
","The Art of making a good movie, This film is why Steven Spielberg is a celebrated director, he knows haw to make a film,with action a bit of Drama and good acting.Harrison Ford is great as Indiana Jones, with Karen Allen doing well. The rest are good to, the fight around the airplane scene is good, and the power of god ending is good.Photogarphy and scenery are excellent, good music, and it is well paced.
You can see why they made sequels to this, Great Movie",9,1,2,10 April 2020
Spartacus," Epic True Story, Excellent Film
","This is for once a well made, reasonably accurate film made about a true story.
With True Stories what usually happens when a film is made about them, is either they look good but get panned for not being accurate and taking liberties with real events. Or they are poor but accurate, only on odd occasions do we get true stories and great films in the same sentence, this is one of them.Usually in a true story we know all the details, but by sticking to them it can create a dull movie, The good thing about this story is we don't know all the details, just the main events so Hollywood can do what it does best and fill in the details with drama, and on this occasion it does it very well.Stanley Kubrick is a renowned director, and this proves why, the screenplay by Dalton Trumbo is excellent, the photography also excellent. Kirk Douglas is brilliant as the star, with Laurence Olivier proving what everyone says about his acting in a movie, Jean Simmons is the beauty, and what a beauty. When you hear about who are the greatest beauties in movies, her name seldom comes up ? Marilyn Monroe, Joan Collins, Elizabeth Taylor, Raquel Welch, Vivien Leigh, Hedy Lamarr, Rita Hayworth etc. but Jean Simmons ? To me she is up there, one of the most beautiful and sexy of all time, and also a very good actor, and you can see why I think that with this film. The supporting cast are also excellent, Peter Ustinov easily being next best and almost steals it from Kirk and Larry, Charles Laughton, John Ireland, Woody Strode, Herbert Lom, and Charles McGraw are all very good, John Gavin is a bit wooden and unusually Tony Curtis plays it down, possibly under orders not to distract attention from the other stars, but apart from those 2 all the rest are on form.And that is why it makes a great film, because all (or most) are on the same song sheet, and everything comes together, usually the mark of a great director.With Epic films which last over 3 hours or more they can become a bit boring, but this does not, even after watching it about once a year over the last 40 years when I know the story like the back of my hand, it still is not boring.I have noticed that in films with a good guy and a bad guy, if the bad guy is a great actor it makes for a better film, and this has one of the very best as a the bad guy, also it has one of the saddest endings, other than the usual, these are 2 of the points that made it one of the very best.",10,1,2,6 December 2019
Casablanca," Here's Looking At You Kid
","What can you say that hasn't been said before.There are a few films that have a lot of sycophants that talk rubbish about so called top films when they are nothing of the sort, this is not one of those films.I am not a fan of Romantic Drama's but this is not a run of the mill film, this is Casablanca, probably the best Romantic Drama ever.Humphrey Bogart is excellent, as is Ingrid Bergman and the rest are good as well, Conrad Veidt was good as the nasty German, it was directed well and excellent dialogue, photography is poor though, but that is the nature of the times and type of film, music is spot on.It is not perfect though, the dialogue is a bit too sharp early in the film and there are several scenes where people order drinks and leave either before receiving them or after only 1 sip, so that was a bit forced, but it relaxed a bit later on, like as if the characters were getting used to each other, but the slow build works up to an excellent ending, the photography is a bit dark and it would have been nice if Peter Lorre stayed in the film a little longer, I think they could have lengthened the movie to 2hrs from the 1hr 45mins it is, and it would have been better.Nevertheless it is still a great film, worth the plaudits and its place in movie history.Bogart did say 'Here's Looking at You Kid' a few times, and the '.....not worth a hill of beans....' sentence, but never said 'Play it again Sam', however he did say 'Play it Sam, You played it for her so you can play it for me'Sam you can play this again and again.",9,0,0,16 January 2020
Finding Neverland," Found Neverland
","When I first heard about this project, I doubted it would work as a film, the life of J.M. Barrie surrounding the creation of his Peter Pan play, but then I did not know the story.I don't know how accurate the screenplay was to real events, but it doesn't matter, as it was made extremely well and was not boring like I thought it might. Johnny Depp is great as Barrie (his Scottish accent is pretty good), as is Kate Winslet. With great support from Dustin Hoffman among others, Julie Christie is class and Freddie Highmore steals the show as Peter. There are some links with Johnny Depp's 'pirates' films with McKenzie Crook and Angus Barnett, and Toby Jones pops up as 'Smee' in the play. A good cast.It is well directed, got good music and the play is put on well. Happy and Sad at the same time, in real life there was much tragedy with that family, so even though not completely accurate it reflected real events well.",8,0,0,23 December 2019
Amistad," Hypocritical American Law!
","I don't mean that about the movie, its a very good film and deserves its rating. Its just that after all the history of Europeans invading America and the slave trade, they have the audacity to pat themselves on the back by celebrating in film, one thing they tried to get right in retrospect.Its very well acted with an excellent cast, directed by Steven Spielberg superbly, its a bit of a film noir as many of the scenes are dark, but I suppose it represents the dark subject here, and it is a true story, unfortunately.They argue (in the film) if the Africans are slaves or not, this after many many years of subjecting Africans to slavery, and building and enriching their nation on the back of slavery. This film is made because Americans eventually turned their back on slavery, so is a good representation of that.But the fact that the European people of america seem to think they have jurisdiction over people of other nationalities in the first place is a bit sickening, as soon as it was discovered that they were indeed from Africa, that should of been the end of any court case, for them to be freed, apologised to and returned to Sierra Leone, and to try the owners of the ship. But they they wanted to drag it out in court for political motives, and make speeches about fairness and principles of Law,typical American Law Bullshit.This true story film is to try to show they are just and fair, when in fact they are nothing of the sort, in real life America, first they raped and pillaged America from the American Indians, then they imported slaves from Africa to work the land for them. Ok they stopped slavery and belatedly tried to settle with what is left of the American Indian population, too little and far too late. And films like this are supposed to show that they are a fair and just people now !!! Trying to show that The American Way is great and how they are trying to fix the world, the world that they ruined in the first place! How condescending, and how contrite, do they think the rest of the world is stupid and does not know history ?Just for an analogy, it is like me, going across the river to a neighbour, killing most of the family, let one or 2 live, kicking those left out to live in the woods while I burn their house down and build a new one on the land, crossing over another river abducting another family to work on the grounds, then many generations later, my great great great grandson inviting the descendants of the original family to come back and live in the shed, then letting a few of the second family to return home free, then making a story up to tell any friends we think we have, about how great we were by letting them go free !!! How ridiculous.If they want fairness, they should send all the African Americans back to Africa, with all the value they have and give them back their property and livelihoods in Africa, all the whites go back to Europe and give all the land in North America back to the Indian tribes to let them repopulate it. Of course this will never happen, the whites have already ruined the continent and it will never go back to how it should, but the good thing is we don't have to take items such as this to understand what is right and wrong. I am White British, my country is just as guilty in the same respects, as are several countries, I can't change the past, but I can be impartial and retrospective and tell it how it is/was.Back off the soapbox now, and back to the film, I gave it 8 stars because of how well it was made, and how well it was acted. If I judged it on political motives, it would get a minus 100",8,0,2,2 February 2020
Star Trek Into Darkness," Out of the Darkness

Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Cold War Spy Intrigue at its Best
","A modern classic, a re-make of the old TV series starring Alec Guinness, and that was excellent, this is even better.It includes a great cast of British actors led by Gary Oldman, who is proving to be one of the best, Mark Strong, Colin Firth, John Hurt (just at the start), Toby Jones, Ciaran Hinds, Tom Hardy, Kathy Burke, Benedict Cumberbatch, Stephen Graham, Simon McBurney and Roger Lloyd Pack, there was even a Swede David Dencik, all well used and well acted. There were Hungarians playing Hungarians and Russians playing Russians, the John Le Carre story is a classic (John Le Carre had an extra role in the movie), filmed in the correct locations, London Budapest and Istanbul, and that makes for a great base to construct the film around.It was directed sensitively, photography was excellent and gave it that 60's/70's feel, the scenes were well shot, particularly the ones in Budapest. But its the style that makes it great.This is like a 60's classic but in the millennium, brilliant.",10,3,3,24 December 2019
Oblivion," Amazing
","This is a fantastic and well thought out Sci-Fi movie.Tom Cruise is great, he seems to do his best work in sci-fi, and this is amongst his best work, Andrea Riseborough is good as his fake wife, and Morgan Freeman does his usual experienced style of acting. Olga Kurylenko just seems to go through the motions though but not affecting the film.The special effects are brilliant, with excellent photography, and great scenes, although it seems some scenes are missing, so editing is a bit out, but its still a great movie without those.I would have given it a 10 if they included the missing scenes, but a 9 because of that.",9,0,0,24 February 2020
Trouble with the Curve," Sweet & Low
","Clint Eastwood not directing, but no matter it still looks like one of his films, he must have had some input.Amy Adams, Justin Timberlake and John Goodman provide good cover and for once its not all about Clint, its well acted well directed excellent photography, music is great.I don't know anything about baseball but it seems authentic, but even if not it looked great, one of the better Drama's of recent years",8,1,1,13 December 2019
Bridge of Spies," Cold War Drama Plus
","This is similar to Funeral in Berlin and The Spy Who Came in From The Cold and is just as good if not better. Gregory Peck tried to make this in the 60's when it was more relevant, it probably would have been great, but it has been made now and it is great, but probably different than if made in the 60's, it is like a 60's film but with a post millenium style.Tom Hanks is on great form, and Mark Rylance is excellent as the Russian Spy, the supporting cast is good, but it is the cold war Berlin photography that is great.
When first viewing this I did not realise that Spielberg was the Director, I know now, but it did not matter I already thought it great without knowing that.With this and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011), it prove this format is not dead, great stuff.",9,0,1,19 December 2019
Tropic Thunder," Tropical Bull
","A spoof within a spoof, within a spoof. One spoof too many I think.Actors making a Spoof Vietnam War Film, accidentally end up in real Vietnam having to fight there way out, its all very ridiculous, Robert Downey Jnr's character is most offensive, firstly as a black man, then at the end when he reveals his Australian actor person is almost as bad.Danny McBride is possibly the best actor, alongside Tom Cruise in disguise in his cameo, the actors blending into the characters is a bit much (although a little possible), but its mostly very funny, and that is the point of the movie, so if the end result is what counts it should not matter how well the film is made or acted.Tom Cruise as a balding, plump, middle aged movie producer doing a rap dance at the end is quite good and particularly funny, and I don't even like rap.",6,0,1,27 January 2020
Quantum of Solace," Quantum of Class
","A quantum is a small amount, this has more than that, but its not the best. the screenplay is all over the place and it looks like some scenes are missing. Daniel Craig is an excellent Bond, and his performance her is as good as any. Its a well made film good photography and scenery but again some locations are wrong, Italy, England and Austria are authentic, but the Russian scenes are not, nor the Haiti and Bolivian scenes, for Bolivia they chose Chile which is as near as dammit, but a bit sandy, and what confuses me is they use Panama and Mexico for Haiti, in an earlier film they used Mexico and Florida to replace Panama, but now they go to Panama to fake other locations!This is a follow on to Casino Royale, a kind of part 2, the first time done in the franchise, maybe that is why its not as good as it could have been, its a bit slow in parts and its got a kind of anti-climax at the end.
The acting is all good, Judi Dench continues as a great M, Mathieu Amalric is a great evil bad guy, he certainly looks the part of a psychotic, the supporting cast are as usual very good led by Giancarlo Giannini and include the granddaughter of Charlie Chaplin, Oona. Still no 'Q' and Moneypenny again though, the character of Tanner returns, this time played by Rory Kinnear, and Jeffrey Wright is Felix Leiter, Wright is an excellent actor but as this is presented as a prequel (along with Casino Royale) to Dr. No, and which is supposed to be at the start of Bond's career, he is the wrong colour, it needed to be a white man for authenticity, but he is very good as Leiter.Bond Themes:- Helicopters again, but not much else, they have continued to abandon most of the Bond themes as in Casino Royale and no Gadgets which worked well in Casino Royale which centered on Drama, Acting and straight action. No really identifiable henchmen, just a collection of different bad guys.
Cars:- a great Aston Martin DBS again, with a Ford GT and a few Alfa Romeos, and a Range Rover. Bond Girls:- Just one true one in this - No. 64 Agent (Strawberry) Fields played by Brit Gemma Arterton who is an assistant to Bond but after he shags her gets killed by oil in a copy of the painted gold death scene of Shirley Eaton in Goldfinger. The main Girl in the film is Camille played by gorgeous Olga Kurylenko (Ukraine) and is definitely the best looking, but I can't count her as there is no sex or sexual chemistry between her and BondNot the best, but all in all another good edition, can't wait for the next!",7,0,0,23 December 2019
28 Days Later...," Biting Sci-fi Thriller
","This is how Sci-fi movies should be made, although this one was made cheaply, it is one that transcends its level.Superb acting, particularly from Cillian Murphy, and great directing from Danny Boyle, photography was a bit dark, but ok.My only reservations were the similarity of the virally infected chracters to the zombies of the walking dead and their like, making it appear to be - just another zombie film - when it was not, and geography, Danny Boyle should know better being a northern englishman, the military blockade was said as being 28 miles north-east of Manchester on the M602, the actual M602 is west of Manchester by about a mile to 4 miles.
Going by the motorway road signs in the film, it actually appeared to be about 40 miles north-west of Manchester, just south of Preston on the M6.Apart from that glaring error the film was excellent.",8,0,0,5 January 2020
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Rise from the Planet of The Humans
","That is what it should have been called, as the apes rise in our world, not the other way around. Although the title suggests otherwise, this film is not a sequel of, or relating to the previous Planet of The Apes films, apart from having apes that are more human like (well at least one), there is no other similarity between this film, and the original from 1968 and its sequels/TV series and the remake in 2001. They must have just wanted to garner attention, the artistry for the promotional material is even in the same style as the Planet of the apes films! So different story/film but still jumping on the bandwagon.But on the actual film, the storyline is great, but the quality of the film is not so great and the acting a bit off, the CGI effects are not so good, not rubbish but could have been better, Caesar and the other apes all in CGI do not look real or move like real apes. The rest of the make-up of the film is average, continuity is a bit of a problem as well, the editor must have been busy doing something else.I give it a 6, for the good points in the film.",6,0,0,28 February 2020
Men in Black II," Aliens'r'us
","This is not bad for a sequel, not as good as the first though, in fact quite a bit behind, but its still fun and entertaining, almost the same crew as last time, doing the same sort of stuff, Tommy Lee Jones is eating it up, but Will Smith is not far behind, and Rip Torn does his usual great support.Its the making of the film that is not great, there are a few errors and some idiotic stuff, as they are trying to make it either dafter or more kooky, the story is ok, but some of the scenes take a departure and don't work as good, it didn't have the fluidity of the first. The end song by Will is a bit poor compared to the first one.But like I said, still a lot of fun, very watchable, it would be nice if the had added out-takes at the end. But you can't have everything. I give it a 6 for the quality acting and fun.",6,0,0,9 February 2020
Men in Black," Don't Fear Us

Elysium," Possible Humankind Sci-Fi Thriller
","This sort of thing is already happening on earth, and has been for a long time, the wealthy elite fencing themselves off from the poorer in society, and hoarding all the wealth for themselves. So this is a very real possibility.The film is excellent, with great performances from Matt Damon and Sharlto Copley in particular, Jodie Foster is good if somewhat unused, as is William Fichtner, heavily using CGI though, but it looks very realistic CGI.Well directed and paced, and action scenes done well, overall a very good Sci-Fi movie.The current 6.6 average rating seems a bit low to me, it is worth an 8 out of 10 at least.",8,1,1,22 February 2020
Where Eagles Dare," Cracking War Espionage Thriller
","This is a 2 star movie with a 9 star rating, the 2 stars being Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood, not too shabby then, it is rare that you get 2 big stars such as these in one film, fortunately they did not clash.Directed by Brian G. Hutton, who did not direct many but the ones he did were very good including another Clint special Kelly's Heroes, this is his best.The acting is brilliant, with a very large supporting cast with some class actors in there also, Michael Hordern, Patrick Wymark, Donald Houston, Ferdy Mayne, Derren Nesbitt, Anton Diffring, Victor Beaumont and Peter Barkworth, with a brief glimpse of Anton Rodgers. Nesbitt despite being English does a superb Gestapo officer, the beauty is supplied by Mary Ure and Ingrid Pitt, Ingrid being the most Beautiful was actually a Polish intern in a Nazi Concentration camp for 3 years, so this role in undermining the Germans was possibly a bit of payback. Mary Ure despite her beauty does quite a lot of action scenes, so proving that women do not have to be there for the sex and romance, and can do action just as good as men, a bit of a breakthrough for the day, but it is not mentioned.The photography is great, mostly filmed in the Austrian Alps, Switzerland and Bavaria (the fictitious Schloss Adler is supposed to be in Bavaria), and is an actual Castle - Hohenwerfen Schloss in Austria. The movie is paced well with great scenes and stirring music, including a Classic theme tune. The story by Alistair MacLean is what makes it great though, with screenplay to match.Despite what a few idiotic reveiwer's say, it is not too long, in fact I believe they could fit more of the original story in and still keep it exciting all the way through, Classic",9,2,3,21 December 2019
Eyes Wide Shut," 9 Year Itch
","I looked at the reviews on here before watching this and oh my, how wrong most people are.Some are dismissing it as rubbish and others are pretending they are not looking at it as a sex film and pretend they know about its psychology and art, they looking too deeply into it and rating it higher than it deserves when really they are just getting off on the naked women in it. And what they say about it is mostly fantasy (not the sexual fantasy in the movie) but a fantasy that is in their own minds.This film is not about sexual fantasy's at all, it is a porno dressed up as a drama come thriller, about a married couple coming to a point in their relationship where its got a bit stale and it needed something like this to sort themselves out, a bit like a 7 year itch (in this case they are married for 9 years), the problem was that they were too truthful with each other. She had a sex fantasy after being 'hit on' at a party and when she told him he decided to try a bit himself, there's nothing dark or mysterious about it, with some people it happens. But they have added a lot of nakedness to spice it up a bit.The movie started out as a drama, and turned into a kind of thriller, after Cruise stumbled upon an orgy involving high up people who did not want it to be found out, but nothing too serious, they just wanted to (and succeeded) scare him off.The acting from Cruise and Kidman was very good, the cameo by the noted Director Sydney Pollak was also good, the few supporting actors were ok, you did not see a lot of them because many had masks on. Direction was average, Stanley Kubrick was on his last film, and although he has made some good films, he has also made some poor ones, this is about middle for him. The music was a bit dreary though and it moved too slow, some of the dialogue was very slow, not like real, it was trying to be over dramatic. It is 2hr 40 mins in length and was too long, it was a bit boring most of the time, they could have shortened it without losing much and it would have been better, or they could have put more in, made the thriller part a bit more thrilling with more intrigue and a bit of action, just a bit and it would have been ok for the length.Personally I believe many of the High rated reviews are because they are repressed sex pests and were just excited to see a few sexy female bodies, and did not see much else, because they were inaccurate about some of the details. Maybe its why they made it like that to attract the perverts? Another thing I noticed was that you hardly saw any naked men (blurred in distance) and all the women on this film are tall, blonde and leggy, and almost all are stripping off with good views of their bums, is this a Stanley Kubrick fetish ? Did he make this film just so he could masturbate over his favourite type of woman ? Was he a Harvey Weinstein type ?I gave it a 6 for the intrigue and good acting, if a bit shorter or more exciting, or not for the porn angle it would have been higher.I am pretty sure that the perverts who pretend it is stylistic will diss me for my comments, it's because they don't like it when someone points out the obvious.",6,2,5,16 December 2019
Beauty and the Beast," Very Entertaining
","I am not a fan of musicals, and started to watch it on TV without realising it was one until the first song kicked in, although not a great song, it got a hook on me and I continued to watch, not able to tear myself away to pack my luggage for my flight the next day, It was lovely, very entertaining, lovely pictures.Emma Watson is great as the 'Beauty' she is quite pretty, but that is not what this is about, its about inner beauty, which both she and the the 'Beast' have in bucket loads.This film is well made, well directed, great pace, lovely scenes, fantastic photography and CGI, not one actor/singer is poor, I read some people said Miss Watson can't sing, were they watching the same film ? She sings great as do all the cast, with supporting actors of the calibre of Kevin Kline and Emma Thompson, voices of Ewan McGregor, Stanley Tucci and Ian McKellen, the younger actors of Dan Stevens and Luke Evans are very good as well, as are all the rest (too many to name), not one song is poor, and one is likely to remain in the memory, the last one.For anyone reading these reviews ignore the poor ones they are not accurate, it is a very good film, and this comes from someone who does not like musicals!",8,2,2,24 December 2019

Wells is a classic, and this film does the novel justice.Although set in the modern era, and in USA rather than late 19th Century England, they do not stray to far from the main line of the story, and it is extremely well made, excellent direction, special effects, acting, and all, the only thing I can fault it with is the side story of Tom Cruise's character of his ex fatherly duties of his children and the dispute with his son, although well acted by all it does not belong in a film like this, there is enough drama with the aliens annihilation of the world to be going on with, why oh why is it that in Hollywood do we have to have more and more drama added in?If it was not for that side issue I would have given this a 10, but with that included it gets a 9 from me. One of the best From Steven & Tom.",9,1,4,12 December 2019
Inception," Fantastic Sci-Fi Action Thriller
","Firstly, The Special Effects were amazing, Secondly, The Acting was brilliant, thirdly, the storyline was spot on, the action scenes were superb, the photography was great, the direction and pace excellent.This is a great film, made very well, acted very well, with intrigue and good plot, not to slack and not to confusing, just at the right level, It starts off 'hitting the ground running' and doesn't let up, the last 30 minutes have you on the edge of your seat, yes 30 mins!, how do they do that !Leonardo di Caprio has already proved he is a good actor, here he proves he is a great actor, and good performances by everyone else, Cillian Murphy is particularly good, as is Tom Hardy and Ken Watanabe, Michael Caine and Pete Postlethwaite pop up in cameos as well, Pete Postlethwaite's character was on his deathbed, he died for real the next year!I don't think its the best Sci-Fi film, but close to it.",10,1,2,12 March 2020
Prometheus," Alien Prequel
","Yeah it should have had a title like that, because at the end that is what it revealed.It was a similar film to the first Alien film anyway, Ridley Scott directed both and it has his stamp on this. A spaceship lands on a planet where mysterious aliens might be and a horror then ensues. Also it has a robot/android involved at the same level in both, and there is one strong female survivor, another thing in common is that the alien impregnates her. even some of the other characters are similar to the characters from Alien, it even has a storm not long after they landed. Seen it all before in 1979!But on its own its not a bad film, the special effects are very good, as is the other world landscapes and structures, the direction is good, good scenes, music ok, well paced, the horror is horrible, the acting is ok, not great. and that's it really, its good but not great. It does not have the edge of your seat effect like Alien did, and its all a bit..... well.....average.And then there's the end, it could have been made a bit subtler, but it wasn't it was blatantly showing that this was the prequel to Alien, and that sort of spoilt it a bit.Normally I would be against this sort of thing, but (even if I don't believe I am writing this) if the scene showing Idris Elba porkin' Charlize Theron was included it might have picked it up a bit, uuughhh, said it, I'll regret it later!But I still give it a 7, mostly because of the other worldly scenes and special effects.",7,0,2,16 March 2020
Shrek," Jock
","That's what they should have called it, since Mike Myers accent is decidedly Scottish, but not an accurate Scots accent.Other than that I can't fault it really, it is all make-believe, so you cannot expect it to be accurate or authentic to anything, and it uses various fairy-tales for its mix of a story. The CGI Animation is excellent, the voices are good, apart from the odd dodgy accent, and the story is good, a kind of fairy-tale made from bits of other fairy-tales.Its well paced and very funny, with good (sampled) music. All it needs to be for this kind of film.",8,0,1,21 April 2020
Casino Royale," 007 Royale
","Daniel Craig's debut as Bond and its all change from the last, only Judi Dench remains, it's like when Brosnan took over, they had great casts during Brosnan's tenure, and it seems they've done it again? It's a retro change though, Casino Royale is the first Ian Fleming book, and they have made this film the same, with Bond just starting as a 00 agent, they even made the intro in Black & White as if it is in a time before colour film, so it's a prequel but made in a modern era, so conflicting with the retro feel and Judi Dench is in the role of M as she was in the last so not making it a retro fit. Felix Leiter is in it as well, but a black feller acting the part, there is no chance a black man could be a leading CIA officer in the fifties/early sixties, so that makes it a strange mix.But nevertheless it is a great film, lots of drama and intrigue, more gritty, there are a few quips, but not silly ones, not much in gadgets, and more on human interaction and dialogue, a lot more, the action scenes are good when they are there, its very well directed and excellent photography, with great scenery at Lake Como, sorry - Montenegro, yeah they faked the locations, only Venice, London and the Bahamas was authentic, Miami, Uganda, Madagascar and Montenegro were all filmed elsewhere. The music was ok, as was the title song.The acting is top notch, everyone is good, particularly Craig, Mikkelson, Dench and Green and despite my criticism of Felix Leiter being the wrong colour, Jeffery White acted a lot better than any before. And a blast from the past, Tsai Chin who played Bond Girl Ling in 'You Only Live Twice' is back, at the card tables, with a 39 year gap.Most of the Bond themes are gone, even the silhouette titles have changed to animation, however we do have a big casino scene and helicopters, the crime organisation is known as Quantum but is really SPECTRE. But no Q or Moneypenny, it is not supposed to have any gadgets, but Bond did have a miniature defibrillator.
Cars:- Aston Martin DB5, Aston Martin DBS can it get any better, and now we know how Bond got his first Aston martin, he won it off a baddie in a game of cards, and also how he discovered his Vodka Martini.
No henchmen in this, and only one Bond Girl, no.63 Vesper Lynd played by Eva Green (French) she is not the most beautiful but certainly the most passionate. Another prominent woman was Solange played by Caterina Murino (Sardinia) bond was trying to seduce her to get information but when he got what he wanted he left before the sex, so not a Bond Girl, but more beautiful than Vesper.Despite the mixed retro/modern fix and false locations it is still a great film, on a par with Goldfinger, On Her Majesty's Secret Service and Goldeneye, I would have given it a 10 if it wasn't for the false locations and confusing retro/modern angle.",9,1,1,8 April 2020
Looper," Thoughtful Sci-Fi Thriller
","This is a clever story, and makes a good sci-fi film, about looping time travel, however its a negative side to such a thing, unfortunately with humankind, it has to consist of death and greed, it couldn't just be a good time travel story could it ?
But that would be too boring. However there was a kind of positive ending.Its a very well made film, excellent photography, special effects and future cityscapes, the acting is very good as well, particularly the lead Joseph Gordon-Levitt, its well directed and put together well.I gave it a 7 out of 10, if the subject was a bit brighter maybe I would have given a higher rating.",7,1,2,14 February 2020
Spectre," Half-Brother !
","At the time the latest Bond movie, if it wasn't for the Covid-19 virus, 'No Time To Die' would have been out, but it was delayed because of that (maybe an idea for a future Bond screenplay- a deadly virus). This film makes it a 3rd part of a trilogy (and possibly a 4th) as it continues on from where 'Quantum of Solace' left off, evolving the organisation Quantum into part of SPECTRE, and it also references Silva out of 'Skyfall' as a member of SPECTRE so possibly making that film into a part 3 and this film a part 4 of 'Casino Royale', confused? So am I.Daniel Craig does another good Bond role, and it turns out that Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) is Bond's adopted half brother, who'd of thought that. Waltz is good as Blofeld, but the film is a bit slow, not as dynamic as others, in 'Skyfall' the slow periods were filled with great acting, drama and good dialogue, but not so much in this, the intro is excellent though, and there are still plenty of action scenes, its directed reasonably well, but the music is not so good, but the continuation of using authentic locations helped, only some of the Moroccan and Rome scenes were filmed elsewhere (Mexico and London).Bond Themes:- It seems they are going back to the early Bond movies with the themes which is an excellent idea, we have a Festival again, not seen in a Bond film for many years, a Cable Car scene, Helicopters as usual (I think Helicopters have been used in every Bond Film to date, but I could be wrong?), Fight in A Train Scene with Henchman (ala 'From Russia With Love', 'Live and Let Die' and 'The Spy Who Loved Me') and a full MI6 crew - M, Q, Moneypenny, Tanner and now a 'C'' (but he was a baddie so won't be returning), no Felix Leiter though.
Henchmen:- We have one new one, harking back to Odd-Job and Jaws, in Hinx (Dave Bautista an American Wrestling Artiste). Cars:- An excellent Aston Martin DB10 with a Jaguar C-X75 chasing it, and a Rolls Royce Silver Wraith from 1948, can it get any better in Automobiles. They also had a few Range Rovers that idiots with too much money buy.Bond Girls:- Just 2 in this, No.68 is Dona Lucia played by Monica Belucci (Italy) who is a widow at the start of the film and Bond seduces here to get information, Monica is reported to be the oldest Bond Girl, maybe but she looks great, and still a lot more sexy than many of the previous Bond Girls. Then the main Bond Girl - Madeleine Swann (no.69 - appropriately) played by Lea Seydoux (France), daughter of the SPECTRE employee/hitman Mr White (who finally dies in this), but she is not a baddie, Bond goes to her to find the way to get into SPECTRE, she tries to escape/avoid Bond but of course eventually he wins her over at the end. The most attractive woman in the film was Estrella, played by Mexican actress Stephanie Sigman, who was Bond's companion in the Day of The Dead intro, but he runs out on her when they get to the room where she is expecting to get shagged, so I cannot include her as Bond girl, but worthy of a mention.Anyway, it's a bit down on 'Skyfall', and too long, if the slow parts were better I might have given it a high score, but it is still one of the better Bond movies.I have done my own average rating's for Bond films to date and The 4 Daniel Craig films rate the highest at average 8.5, with Brosnan's 4 not far behind at 8.25, Connery's at 7.5 (including 'Never Say Never Again') Dalton's 2 are averaging 7, with Roger Moore's at 6.9, I rated Lazonby's one film at 9, but since he only did the one, I am not counting it in this average rating. So Daniel Craig's are generally the best overall, I hope the next and Craig's last (and possibly the last ever) is as good.",8,0,1,19 April 2020
The Runaways," Pretty Good Rock Biopic
","I like rock music, I like Joan Jett, but I didn't know much about The Runaways, I know a bit more now, and enjoyed the film. It is the best film I have seen about a rock band, ever!Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart were great, as well as the supporting cast, the film was well made, well directed and well shot, and covered the story fairly well, my only quibble is that they could have done more of the music rather than focus on the problems, however that is entertainment, people prefer to see the seedier side for some reason, and this film fills that role, but apart from that I liked it.Its called 'The Runaways' but in reality it is mostly about Cherie Currie, its a pity they did not include more of the relationships between Cherie and the rest of the band, I suppose because the others (Lita Ford and Jacki Foxx) did not want to contribute and Sandy West had died, but they covered her relationship with Joan Jett well (Joan did contribute).Well done!",8,0,1,2 December 2019
The Great Gatsby," Not so Great Gatsby
","The style is there, the 1920's costumes and period feel, and its acted well, but something seems to be missing ?The music was not great, which included some rapping ? not a 1920's music so I don't know why it was added to the music score, there was plenty of CGI in it which made it look too perfect, too much like fantasy, and the grimy sections, too grimy, and it did not flow as it should, it seemed a little stilted with too much voice over.I watched it until the end, but it went on too long, it is timed at 2hrs 22 mins but with about 15 mins of titles, not good.The original film although looking much cheaper seemed better, and that was not one of the best itself.I gave it a 6 for the style and acting.",6,0,1,17 January 2020
Valkyrie," Could Have been better
","The trouble with this film is also the reason where it was made, in Hollywood, it is also the good reason we are talking about it ! Let me explain :-This should have been made with more German actors (or at least more germanic speaking Europeans) speaking in German, but with English subtitles for the english speaking world, I watch a lot of foreign films and have always found that it is much much better to have them speaking their natural language with subtitles, you get the meaning better and it does not look crap like when dubbed.That saying, we would probably not have seen this nor be talking about it if Hollywood did not get a hold of this story, so its great that it was made (by Americans) but it could have been much better.Despite what I say it is a good film, well directed and well acted, I have always found Tom Cruise to be eminently watchable, the English actors did a good job, at least they were more Germanic, David Bamber (who played Hitler) didn't get it quite right though, the 2 actual Germans in the top cast were good (but not speaking German), the photography was very good, it could have benefited with being a bit more dramatic with the story line stretched out a bit more. I think the late Rutger Hauer (although Dutch and not looking like von Stauffenberg) would have been a better fit than Tom in the main role, maybe Tom could have played Hitler, after all he is the correct height, it would make a change for him to play a bad guy for once, I'm sure he would have done a good job.So Glad it was made but wish it was in German with more Germanic Actors.",6,0,0,25 September 2019
