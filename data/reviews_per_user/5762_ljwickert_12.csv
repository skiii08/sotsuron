Requiem for a Dream," This had me squirming a bit in my seat
","Very well done!  But I must warn all.....avoid this movie like the plague if you have a `weak constitution'!  Very, very disturbing!!  The theme of the movie??  Addiction rearing its' ugly head!!  Leto, Connelly, and Burstyn all performed well!   B",8,0,0,3 August 2001
Memento," In today's cinema...different is good!
","You have to pay attention, and stay with this movie until the end, because it is shown backwardsthat's right, from ending to beginning!  No, people aren't walking and driving cars backwards, but they show about five minute segments, starting with the end, and then overlapping a little, going backwards in time.  There's a reason for this, because the storyline is about a man who is trying to find his wife's killer.  The problem, however, is  that since the murder, he has ZERO short term memory, so he needs to snap photographs and jot notes to himself to help him the next day, or even the next five minutes.  Sounds like a movie to miss, but it actually was done pretty well, and worth it if you like flicks that make you pay attention. (Unfortunately, most movies DON'T!)  B",8,0,2,4 August 2001
Snatch," Awesome `guy' film!!
","I say this because I don't believe women like these types of flicks.  About various international thugs, crooks, and contract killers, who all end up involved in trying to sell an 84 carat diamond in some way or another.  Lots of humor and killing and swearing.....guy stuff!!  A",10,0,1,3 August 2001
Pearl Harbor," WoW! Thank you! I didn't know Pearl Harbor was a love story!
","135 million dollars to make this flick.keep reminding yourself of that while sitting through it.  I can't tell you all not to see it, because most will.  Being a little of a history buff, I will say they got one thing right..the date!! (Dec. 7th, 1941)   Other than that, this was one big pile of monkey crap!  I kept thinking of the Gilligan's Island theme song, because I was taken on a 3-hour tour.A 3-HOUR TOUR!  (I'm glad I didn't see this with my friend Phil Peterson, who is ten times the history nut I am.I think Phil's head would've exploded!).   Basically, if you want to sit through a two hour love triangle, and one hour of special effects, then this is for you.  I would love to keep on ranting about the mistakes and falsehoods, but I've already wasted enough time on this picture. D-",2,3,4,4 August 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," It was alright, but it wasn't as great as people are saying
","By default, I am not a big martial arts movie fanthis one wasn't too bad, though.  Yes, the martial arts display was fantasy-laden to the extreme, but overall, it was a decent flick.  You must `read' the whole movie (Subtitled), so if you're not into that, skip it!  Not sure if it was as good as all the hype has it, but it was an entertaining piece. B-",6,0,1,3 August 2001
Driven," F..F..F..F..F!
","Take a red hot poker and shove it in your eye, because that would be less painful than seeing this movie!  Indy Car rookie battling for a championship.at least I think that's what it was about. Having a driver, in a race, see another driver crash through a guardrail, across a grass valley, and into a pond, and then taking your own car, turning it around, driving AGAINST 200mph traffic, driving to the pond, jumping in, and turning over the upside down car to save the driver.........CMON!!!!!!!!! You would've thought the amount of money spent on this would at least have awesome special effects, but even those sucked!  Sly, it's time to hang it up!  And take Arnold and Seagal with you as well to the old age action hero home.  (Also, producing or directing is NOT an option for you either, Stallone!)  F",1,2,5,4 August 2001
Moulin Rouge!," Take in a French show for $8
","Differentyes!  I think a good pre-requisite for this flick is that you must have seen, and APPRECIATED, either a Vegas show or a musical production of some sort.  I seen a 270 lb. man storm out of this movie, cussing up a storm, while his girlfriend/wife(??) was running after him.  This is a musical.where each act inevitably breaks into song.  I thought it was pretty good, but I'm a Kidman fan, even more since she's singleanyone want to introduce me?  One more thingthe theme of this movie was summed up in one line: `It's a story about love..at the Moulin Rouge.'  Ya know, this `line' could've been used for another 2001 summer flick: `It's a story about love..at Pearl Harbor!'   (Needed to get at least one more shot at that movie!)  B-",7,0,0,4 August 2001
The Mummy Returns," Some sequels are exactly the same as the first!
","Well, they at least promoted this flick to be `The Rock's' (WWF wrestler) breakout into the movie action hero stage.  Actually, Rocky is only in this flick about five minutes!  The rest of his character is computer animation. Anyway, if you seen the first Mummy, this one is very similar.a little scarya little funny.a little of everything. but not enough to make it a really good flick.  Special effects are pretty good, so I guess that's something'.  C",5,0,0,4 August 2001
Enemy at the Gates," Every war history picture DOESN'T have to have a love story!
","Decent war flick depicting the battle for Stalingrad in World War II.  They put a love triangle in it, which really hurt the story.  If you like history and war battles, it was worth it.  Another great line in this one: `We do not have enough guns for each soldier!  Pair off in twosthe first soldier gets the gun and bulletsthe second soldier follows him.when the first soldier gets killed, the second soldier takes the gun and bullets, and keeps shooting!'  Russian commander giving orders to the new soldiers coming off the boats.  C",5,0,1,4 August 2001
Blow," Probably my favorite so far in 2001!
","Top 3 movie this year EASILY!  Great all-aroundstorylinecastmusic, etc. Based on a true-life story (almost all true), Johnny Depp plays a drug dealer during the 70s and early 80s, and the life behind the glitz, including his parents and children.  I can see this movie getting nominations next year at the Emmy's, including Depp and Ray Liotta, who is great portraying Depp's dad Don't miss this one! A+",10,0,0,4 August 2001
Thirteen Days," If you go to movies to learn about history.........
","Easy choice.if you like stories about American history, specifically American political history, you'll like this.  If not, it's a long 2.5 hours for you.  I liked it a lot!  About the Cuban missile crises of 1962, and how the government, specifically the Kennedy's, handled the situation.  Did we get as close to nuclear war as the movie depicts??  B+",8,0,0,3 August 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Worth a rental fee......
","I said I like movies that are different....this is definitely different!!  Set in the 1930's, three escaped convicts in the South run into misfortune around every corner.  Entertaining enough to see,  and the cast of characters are good, but nothing extra special",7,0,0,3 August 2001
