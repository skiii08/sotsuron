It," Loved 'It'
","'It' is a surprisingly good horror movie and a great Stephen King adaptation. Everything about the film from the script to the actors and special effects is perfect. What is great about this movie is that it takes time to develop the characters and still save a lot of fright for the movie. There is an equal amount of everything, nothing is saved towards the end and nothing is only in the beginning. The horror happens throughout. Director Andy Muschietti worked with the best child actors I've seen in a long time, and especially with Bill Skarsg√†rd who absolutely nailed and embodied the role as Pennywise. This clown is the most frightening clown I have seen. The only thing i did not like very much about the film was the language. I'm glad that there was bad language in it, making the movie and the kids more relatable and funny but this is 1989. Nobody, especially 12 and 13 year olds cursed this much back then. the f word was used sometimes but in the movie its just full. Its like 21st century cursing. I don't think it is wise to walk in this movie and compare it with the 1990s version because this film received its well deserved R rating from an explicit Stephen King novel and the Tim Curry version was aired on television where there was a limit to how much they could show. Congratulations to the director and all of the cast for making such an incredible horror movie and thank you for bringing us the 'It' movie we always wanted.",8,10,22,8 September 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A revolutionary turning point for the new trilogy of Star Wars
","Star Wars: The Last Jedi is finally here and this highly anticipated movie does not fall short on good storytelling, awesome space battles, great characterization. This movie is great in many ways, and fortunately tells a good story without having to repeat itself unlike the Force Awakens did with a New Hope. Yes, there are elements in this movie that are similar to Empire Strikes Back but it is not because of a lack of originality, it is to provide good star wars nostalgia for the older audiences, pay homage to great pop culture characters such as Luke Skywalker and also not try to be a new thing without forgetting what came before it originally. The Last Jedi seems to be its own thing in a good way and explore areas of the Star Wars universe that have not been explored before. As always, great acting from the cast especially to Mark Hamill for an excellent performance as Luke Skywalker and Carrie Fisher (Rest in Peace) who was able to portray Leia Organa in a great way for one last time.",7,16,40,15 December 2017
Wonder Woman," Wonderfully Wonderful
","'Wonder Woman' is probably the best live action DC movie i have seen since the Dark Knight Rises. Over the past few years the DCEU has been making OK movies like Batman vs. Superman, but Wonder Woman brings a whole new level of entertainment to the audience. The story is organized, the special effects are really good, Gal Gadot nails her role as Diana Prince, and its just a really good movie. The only thing that I was not to fond of was the villain, but at this point we are used to having average villains in great superhero movies.",8,3,10,11 June 2017
