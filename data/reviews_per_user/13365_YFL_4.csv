E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," I hate to say this ...
","But I still have to say, I didn't really like it very much, and I thought I did. Before watching it, I came by and read some reviews - a lot of people seemed to think it was wonderful. And no matter whether the commenters liked it or not, the consensus was that it's a 'kids' thing and that it's sentimental, both which happened to sound very appealing to me, so that I even overlooked the cynics' comments. I mean, I like kid's movies like Home Alone, and I'm a sentimental schmuck - I loved Heart and Souls. SO I decided to watch this thinking I wouldn't be disappointed.I was disappointed. I'm still not sure why. The movie sort of dragged, making me feel bored. And I found myself way too detached from the movie than I was supposed to be. A very bad experience which proves this: I was watching this scene with the flying bike, the music was beautiful and soaring, and I was saying to myself, 'Now this is supposed to be a great moment,' and I repeated some comment like that too at the last few scenes of the movie. The problem was, the moment I thought that, I knew whatever great moment it was supposed to be, I didn't feel that way. And that was how the whole movie was for me.",6,41,69,13 August 1999
Titanic," Technically masterful
","As an epic, it doesn't change, even a little, my perception of life. As a love story, I've seen better. However, I have to say - technically - and as entertainment - Titanic is great. The special effects, the replica of the ship, and all other technical details are a feast for the eyes. And it certainly entertains, as it never lapses to boredom and although it's over 3 hours long, it doesn't really register.Anyway, I'd say it is quite worth the watch. Just don't expect it to change your life.",7,5,8,10 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," It was OK
","After all I've heard about it, I didn't like it as much as I thought I would... however, it was still not a bad movie, at least I wasn't bored, and I don't think it's too slow to bear as some people did. So I guess it did entertain me, though not satisfyingly enough.But I wasn't scared in the parts where I presume is supposed to be scary, and I wasn't touched in the parts where I presume is supposed to be emotional. And believe me, it doesn't take much to do that to me.",6,0,0,23 August 1999
The Truman Show," Good, but it could've been great
","This is a good movie, and it could've been great, though unfortunately it wasn't.For one, the idea for the story was thought-provoking, intriguing. Too bad they didn't make the most out of it ... that's the feeling I got somehow. I felt it could've been better. Maybe it was the way it was written. Who knows.The acting was, well, ... it was fine enough, though I can't honestly say that it was wonderful, because I've seen a lot more which was better. Ed Harris was good, and Jim Carrey was OK. I guess perhaps all those rave reviews came because people got a revelation with another side of Jim Carrey in this movie, but I think he still has a long way to go. Still, this is a good start!This is a good movie, though it could've been great. Too bad it wasn't ... Anyway, we can hope for better movies. Get another great idea. Then make it !!!!!!!! The Truman Show got the first one down, now we need movies which follows up both.",7,3,5,3 May 1999
