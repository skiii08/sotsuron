Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Generally decent, but rewards the faithful
","Is it art?  No.  Is it enjoyable?  Yes.Decent performances from a good cast, a passable (but at times laughable) script, and extraordinary special effects make for a generally entertaining film.  Faithful fans are rewarded with heaping doses of backstory on their favorite characters complete with in-the-know in-jokes, so they get the most out of it.  Lots of kid-power stuff for the children too.  Annoying and bordering on racial vocalizations for the alien characters tempered my enjoyment of the film.",7,0,0,21 May 1999
