The Avengers," A multi-starrer of action heroes!
","Following the success of 'Iron Man' (2008) Marvel Comics came up with the idea of putting all superheroes together in 'The Avengers'. A sequel to 'Iron Man' and films like 'Thor' also played their part in building excitement in the run up to the film's release. Its biggest star, Robert Downey Jr reprises his role as Tony Stark/ Iron-Man and has Scarlett Johansson as Natalia Romanoff/ Black Widow who had a role in Iron Man 2 for company. There's Gwyneth Paltrow in a brief role as Pepper Potts. Also from the Marvel Universe, there's Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Tom Hiddleston as his brother the villain Loki, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, director of SHIELD. Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America, Mark Ruffalo as Dr. Bruce Banner / Hulk and Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye are the other first billed actors. The story starts at a secret facility where scientists are researching on an unknown energy source, the 'Tesseract'. Then, things go awry and a portal is opened up allowing Norse God Loki to come through. And evil Loki plans to use the power source, team up with an alien race called the Chitauri and subjugate Earth! With the world on the verge of falling apart, Nick Fury can only rely on his superheroes to save the world. But, getting these larger than life characters with massive egos to work together proves to be tougher than it seems. The rest of the story plays on the Good vs. Bad theme replete with action, stunts and cool gadgets. The film's selling point is not its theme, but the way they go about telling the story. For one, it doesn't have heroes coming together spontaneously, making speeches about good and bad and then going all out battling the bad guy. Here, they are shown to have their own issues, and obviously issues with one another. The altercation between characters gives us some really nice one-liners. One of my favorites was when Captain America asks Tony Stark/ Iron-man 'Big man, in a suit of armor, take that away, what are you?' to which Stark responds 'Uh, genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist' with his usual arrogance. 'The Avengers' is also a visual treat. Filmed on digital media, it was converted to 3D in post production and was digitally remastered to IMAX format. The special effects are state of the art and offer edge of the seat action. Although I watched it on a regular screen with 3D, it would definitely be worthwhile on IMAX. Since it is based on a comic-book theme and Superhero theme, there are those who may choose to skip on the pretext that comics are just for kids. Ah, get over this idea and let 'The Avengers' overwhelm you with its action and fantasy!",8,1,4,30 April 2012
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," A Fast Paced Adventure that gives a bang for the buck
","The first National Treasure movie about hidden Templar treasure and clues dating back to founding of the United States was although far-fetched, a very interesting movie. In the second adventure, Nicholas Cage, Diane Kruger and Justin Bartha reprise their roles to solve a maze of ciphers and monuments dating back to the American Civil war.Just at the end of the Civil War, John Wilkes Booth hands a cipher to Ben Gates’ great grandfather just as he heads out to shoot President Lincoln. As he deciphers, Gates learns that the cipher leads to an ancient treasure which the confederate better not lay their hands on and destroys those 18 pages.Cut to present, Ben Gates is talking about Civil War heroes when a black marketer Wilkinson (Ed Harris), quite an effective villain, produces a partly burnt page from the Booth Diary with the old Gates’ name on it as one of the architects of the assassination. Ben Gates gets into a treasure hunt and attempts to clear off his ancestor’s name.To assist Benjamin Gates are his trusted team Justin Bartha as Riley Poole and Diane Kruger as his estranged girlfriend Abagail Chase. This time the adventure takes you through Paris, Buckingham Palace, The Oval Office, yeah one at the White House and Kidnapping of the President, Library of Congress and Mount Rushmore! Whew! The movie casts three Academy Award Winners Cage and Jon Voight & Helen Mirren as Cage’s parents. While Jon Voight has got a larger role this time, Helen Mirren seemed too old for her role. The lead characters simply repeat their roles. When you see them solving clues one after another, it doesn’t surprise as you’ve seen it all before.For those who head to the movie hall with expectations just as much as its predecessor, you will come out happy. If you prefer using too much of logic, you would laugh at the idea of a city of gold under a hill. All said and done, I have all admiration for American movie makers to turn out fashionable adventures with a nationalist feel.",6,0,2,21 January 2008
Black Swan," Great concept; execution is not worth the hype
","When a movie is marketed with Oscar hype, it sure creates a lot of buzz. Darren Aronofsky's 'Black Swan' did manage the hype. But, was it worth the hype?When a New York ballet company fires an old performer, Beth (Winona Ryder), it opens up a slot for a new lead in for its next production, Pyotr Tchaikovsky's 'Swan Lake'. Its Director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) wants his new star to portray both, the Swan Queen Odette, the white swan and her evil-twin Odile, the black swan. Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman), a senior ballerina with the troupe is selected for the role. But, Leroy is still not convinced if the uptight Nina can play the sensuous Odile. She has competition in Lily (Mila Kunis) and an overbearing mother Erica (Barbara Hershey) to deal with. The pressure drives Nina to psychotic hallucinations.The theme was undoubtedly bulletproof. The idea of capturing the emotional roller coaster that an artist goes through in his/ her quest for perfection had the potential to make a great thriller. But, what you get instead is a mélange of backstage jealousy, some risqué scenes between the lead women and a touch of insanity. It's strange that a ballet themed flick doesn't actually show the lead actors performing it any more than Portman waving her emaciated arms with close ups of her woe begone face completely lacking expression. Frankly, there is very little charm about her even as the 'White Swan'. To her credit, Portman shed 20 pounds and learnt Ballet. But, barring her 'Black Swan' avatar towards the end, there wasn't much to her acting.Rather, Mila Kunis as the 'comfortable in her own skin' Lily, also Nina's substitute seemed a better candidate if someone really wanted his play to run steadily for the whole season. Incidentlally, Kunis too lost as many pounds as her friend Portman who recommended her to the role. Vincent Cassel shines as the dictatorial director who pushes Nina to do her best and instead pushes her off the edge of sanity. Having said that, 'Black Swan' isn't in fact bad; just that it falls below what I expected it to be. To make an intense film that combines sheer passion of art with the devilish depths of insanity is in itself a great challenge. Aronfsky has made intense films in the past a la 'A Requiem for a Dream'. This one is decent, but could have been better.",6,1,2,11 March 2011
Skyfall," Scores for stunts & acting, fails with its plot
","Bond is Back!! Or that's what we have been made to believe. 'Skyfall' or Bond 23 is being touted as the best James Bond movie ever. But to the purists among Bond fans, this would come across as a dull, conversational flick with occasional bursts of action sequences and the humming of the classic James Bond tune.The pre-title sequence starts with the trail of a stolen hard drive in a Turkish town, that culminates in a first-fight atop a train, as seen in the trailers. Oh yes, this was supposed to be filmed in India, but didn't happen because the requisite permissions weren't given! At the end of the sequence, Bond is shot and an obituary is written.Although the start seemed promising, the film goes downhill after wards. It turns up that the hard disk has the names of secret agents operating in the middle east; remember 'Mission Impossible' anyone? After hearing news of an attack on MI6 headquarters, Bond returns from playing dead to find the bad guy and recover the list.The bad guy, as it turns out is a hacker; Oh, when James Bond had to come out of the cold war era and appear modern, are computers and hacking the only convenient way to show modernity? What happened to the built up in the previous two Craig movies that dealt with serious themes like terror funding and natural resource monopoly.While it is tempting to write more about the plot holes, I'm holding short only because those of you who are still keen to see the movie don't get to know how it's going to end. But, all that can be said of 'Skyfall' is that it is hardly a James Bond movie.Anyone who is familiar with the 20-odd moves made in the Sean Connery to Pierce Brosnan era would agree that Daniel Craig's avatar as Bond is different from the rest. Craig seems more like a street thug in a tuxedo and lacks style and humor. Whatever happened to all those famous one- liners that bond is known for?Another quintessential missing element is gadgetry from the Q- department. This time, all that he gets is a gun that responds only to his palm-prints and a radio transmitter. The phone that Bond uses looks lousy too. But yeah, it was interesting to see the return of the famous Aston Martin DB5 that first appeared in Goldfinger.Skyfall has very little role for its lead ladies, Naomie Harris who is shown in the trailers to be taking a shot at 007, plays a fellow agent and Bérénice Marlohe is a woman who gets him to the villain looks exotic but hardly has a few minutes of screen time.There is nothing exciting on locations either. A major portion of the film is shot indoors and underground including caves, tunnels, or old houses. However, two shots stand out. One, Shanghai skyline at night and two, the deserted island lair of the villain, which is actually an abandoned coal mining colony off the coast of Nagasaki.The film scores for some extraordinary stunts. The bike chase on the rooftops of the grand bazaar in Istanbul, the train-top sequence and the one involving the London Tube. Bond films are usually good with their camera-work and Skyfall is no less. The overhead shots of Scotland stand out. But there isn't enough for action junkies either.The other plus is some good acting. Daniel Craig lacks the looks and isn't a suave Bond, but is a good actor. Judy Dench and Ralph Fiennes deliver some good performances. The Academy Award winner Javier Bardem plays a good villain. And this time, James Blond, err Bond and his enemy are both Blonds.The film's release marks 50 years from the date of the first Bond film, 'Dr No' that starred the legendary Sean Connery. This will be the last film where Judi Dench plays 'M'. If this was a farewell movie for her as it seemed from its plot, then it's an apparently a bad and boring idea. Hope they turn up with a better movie next time!",5,7,16,5 November 2012
Iron Man 3," Not overwhelming but entertaining enough
","After Batman, Iron-Man is probably the coolest one among super-heroes not just because the suits and gadgets, but because of the attitude with which they carry on their tasks of being vigilantes. Incidentally, the films made on them in this decade have had intriguing villains and have been enormously successful and have been visually stunning. Super-heroes and all the swashbuckling action is here to stay!In the third edition of 'Iron-Man', the focus is mostly on Tony Stark rather than the antics his suit can perform. It's more an effort to portray that Iron Man is more about him rather than the suit. To that extent, they have succeeded but, as a result, the movie seems rather bland as compared to the stylized effects we'd previously seen.The film flashes back to Switzerland to the New Year's celebration at the turn of the Millennium where Stark (Robert Downey Jr) is busy hanging out with botanist Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) that he ignores a crippled scientist Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce). An unexplained blast briefly disturbs their night; but this is soon forgotten. Cut to present day, America seems to be haunted by a new villain who calls himself the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) claiming responsibility for blasts that seem to be occurring just about anywhere. And, a new version of Killian, now well built and suave approaches Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) at Stark Industries seeking a partnership to advance his genetic technology called Extremis, which she refuses. A turn of events leads to Tony Stark challenging the Mandarin to a fight, at his home, to which the villain promptly responds by destroying it. Stark and Potts barely survive the attack and the former now seeks to get to the bottom of this. Some spoilers; we are told that the genetically modified bodies heat up to three thousand degrees before blowing up. And while everything around them is vaporized, their clothes are only slightly tattered. Fire resistant clothing, huh? And there is no real clarity on what can actually destroy the genetically modified villains. The most annoyingly boring scenes include those in Tennessee. Did Stark really have to go there? And what was so significant in that file that he tries to retrieve? And what was that precocious kid doing out there, all by himself! If at all an Indian film maker came up stuff like this, the audience and critics would have ripped it apart. Putting this aside, the visuals effects are spectacular. If Iron-Man 2 sported a suit that comes out of a briefcase, Iron-Man 3 has a Mark 42 suit whose parts are programmed to remotely fly down towards him and get attached to Stark. Also in the movie is Colonel Rhodes' War Machine branded as Iron Patriot in Red-Blue-White. The villain is menacing and makes Iron-Man's life difficult. He is not only physically strong but is also smart enough to be manipulative. Nothing more can be disclosed in a review without disclosing the details. Just one mention; since the villain is named the Mandarin, he is shown sporting Chinese tattoos and also breathes fire. Acting performance is on par with the previous versions with Downey Jr, Paltrow and Don Cheadle reprising their roles. Guy Pearce and Ben Kingsley do well in their respective roles while Rebecca Hall didn't have enough screen time. Some info, Gwyneth Paltrow actually has six- pack abs. How cool is that!The Verdict: Okay, granted that it has some failings and does get boring in parts; but the sheer star-power of Robert Downey Jr and some cool action keeps it alive. The post-credit scene also shows Stark meeting up with Dr Bruce Banner a.k.a Hulk. Is an Avengers movie lined up? Never mind what's in the pipeline; watch 'Iron-Man 3'.",7,1,5,28 April 2013
Rang De Basanti," Rocking film for the Youth! Delivers the message far without the usual stereotypes!
","Plot Outline: Sue (Alice Patten) is inspired by the legendary characters of Bhagat Singh, Azad et al from her grandfather's diaries during his days in the British Raj. She lands in Delhi to make a film on them and finds those characters in Sonia's (Soha) friends DJ (Aamir), Karan (Siddharth), Aslam (Kunal Kapoor) & Sukhi (Sharman Joshi). The friends belong to Gen Next who care not about values like Patriotism & Sacrifice. The accidental death of their friend Flt Lt Ajay Rathod (Madhavan) in a MIG Crash and the wrongful blame on the pilot makes them take up cudgels against the corrupt establishment.Comment: Very rarely are movies that talk of relevant values for the Youth. Most of the Patriotic movies are full of either anti-angrez or anti-Pak sentiments with heaps of Melodrama thrown in. With RDB, Rakeysh Mehra has made a significant movie from stereotypes. Unlike others, RDB does not have the typical 'hero' & 'heroine'. Aamir and his friends are people the youth can easily identify with. They are simple minded students who live care free lives and they plainly react 'normally'. Those who have disliked this movie are the ones who prefer stereotyped abnormalities.Most notable performance in RDB is that of Siddharth whose character grows as the movie progresses. Aamir, of course has been brilliant but looks too old to play a College Student. Some of the movie's best moments are Madhavan's proposal to Soha, breaking down of Aamir in Sue's apartment, Atul Kulkarni's recital of Bismil's poetry and of course the last scenes of Siddharth and Aamir. Don't miss AR Rahman's youthful and soulful music too! Quotes thrown in RDB include: 'There are two primary choices in life, to accept conditions as they exist or take upon the responsibility to change them'. Inspiring, isn't it? Watch the movie to get charged. This one is highly recommended for those who're young and those who still think themselves to be young!",9,4,8,2 March 2006
Spider-Man 2," Special effects + rona dhona like a Hindi movie = Spiderman-2
","Storyline: Spidey is back in action as a crime-fighting super hero. But this time, he seems to be grappling with his situation, struggling to strike a balance between his life as Peter Parker and Spiderman.Comment: The performances remain more or less similar to the previous movies. Tobey Maguire has done his job well. The movie makers could have definitely found someone better to play the role of MJ. In fact, in Marve's comics, MJ is shown to be a voluptuous model, a role which Kirsten Dunst fails to fit in to. She looks like a popularity seeking cheapster. James Franco as Harry Osborn and Alfred Molina as Doc Ock/Dr. Otto Octavius have done their roles well.The most notable feature of the movie is the improved special effects that leave the viewer asking for more. The action sequence on the train is especially exhilarating. The cityscapes of Newyork seem more real than the previous movie.Talking about the negatives, the movie has been turned into too much of a love story. The worst part of the movie however, is that his mask is off and he is seen by many. Since kids would be greater fans of Spiderman, I am not sure as to how well they would appreciate it.",7,1,3,12 May 2005
127 Hours," Well made! Highly intense and at times disturbing!
","Danny Boyle became a household name in India with 'Slumdog Millionarie'. As much as it attracted criticism for typecasting India, his skills at filmmaking accumulated accolades. Boyle teams up yet again with the Maestro, AR Rahman, screenwriter Simon Beaufoy and producer Christian Colson for '127 Hours'.Shot on location at Utah, it is based on true account by Aron Ralston in his book 'Between a Rock and Hard Place'. The film deal's with the protagonist's ordeal for more than 5 days after a fallen boulder crashed on his arm and trapped him in an isolated canyon. The lack of food and his dwindling water can made it worse. James Franco (Harry Osborne in 'Spiderman') plays Aron Ralston's part to perfection.The movie doesn't dwell on whether Ralston did or didn't do something right. Rather, it is his varying emotions that take the center-stage. Amidst the rocky hopelessness around him, he reminisces his family, draws recollects his last best moments with the passersby he had just met, his thirsty thoughts traveling to the half-filled drink bottle in his car, keeping his spirit alive and finally, garnering the courage to redeem himself.The biggest challenge in a solo film is zero opportunity for dialog. The writers make up for it by interspersing it with recollections, wishful thoughts and self recorded videos. That said '127 Hours' excels at dramatizing the events visually. Cutting between character's point of view and close up of the expressions and then putting in some detailed slow motion shots, the camera work is simply mind blowing. To its credit, its portrayal of events has a 'thumbs up' from the real- life Aron Ralston! But, turning what could have been a great documentary on TV into intense drama on the big-screen marks Danny Boyle's achievement. AR Rahman's ominous music contributes to intensifying the drama. And, its editing has drawn applause too. Goodies apart, '127 Hours' may not be suitable for all audiences. A certain scene (not discussed here) without which the story wouldn't have been complete could be termed 'gory'. But if you think you can stomach it, this flick is not to be missed!",8,0,2,1 February 2011
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Watch it for Special effects, flowing script & Hugh Jackman!
","A decent Hollywood movie coming around after quite a long time! The marvel comics' fictional characters from the X-Men trilogy are already popular with movie and comic fans. Set as a prequel to the trilogy, the story is centered on the origin and the life of the mutant James Howlett/ Logan/ Wolverine and his skirmishes with his half-brother Victor Creed. With not a minute wasted, rest assured that this will be an interesting watch! Beginning in 1845 Canada, young and sickly James Howlett witnesses his father being murdered by Thomas Logan who is later revealed as James' father. Fleeing home, young James and brother Victor, both wolf-like, indestructible and immortal mutants fight in the American Civil War, both World Wars and the Vietnam War. Their skills attract the attention of Major Stryker who recruits them into specially set up all-mutant Team X.The team's mutant members include shooter Agent Zero, a mercenary, a teleporter, an invincible muscleman, a technopath among others. Tired of violence and inhuman acts meted out by the group, James leaves to retire into the quiet of the Canandan woods as a lumberjack. But, the violent past just doesn't end as Victor returns to finish off Team X; instead murders James Logan's lover, thus putting the latter on the path of revenge.Stryker convinces James, now Logan to accept a bio-metallurgical reinforcement so that he can avenge his lover's death. The element is the virtually indestructible adamantium which now makes Logan, now Wolverine's bones and claws razor sharp and deadly. As the story unfolds, Stryker is also busy readying Weapon XI, a mutant-super-soldier that combines abilities of all other mutants being researched at the secret facility.Hugh Jackman as Wolverine holds the movie throughout and plays the part to perfection replete with the intensity we have been familiar with in the other X-Men movies. Liev Schreiber as the brother of the protagonist and interchangeably an adversary and ally plays his part menacingly well. Of course, there are other weird mutants designed to keep the make-up man busy on the set. Ben Kingsley's cameo is cherry on the cake.Shot mostly in Australia and New Zealand, the movie locales chosen well and the special effects ensure that your interest is kept alive throughout. Although there are action sequences that beat logic by any stretch of imagination such as Agent Zero reloading his guns in mid-air and Gambit fighting off bullets with a sword, this is just passed off as creativity. Remember, the movie is both Sci-fi and Fantasy!",7,2,5,28 June 2009
Terminator Salvation," High on octane and boredom
","Mess is what one creates when an extremely successful franchise is striped off its core elements and goes high on firepower. The fourth installment thus comes to you, sans its icon, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Disappointing from the word go, you are left waiting for a coherent thread to evolve in the story. Probably, the lack of imagination has something to do with the absence of James Cameron, who it seems neither blessed nor cursed the idea of this film.At around 2003, Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), a convict on a death row agrees to give up his body to medical research. Cut to 2018, John Connor (Christian Bale), is leading his men against a Skynet base where finds the machines researching on developing a Terminator with a human tissue exterior. The mission ends in a blast leaving him the sole survior. Back at the Command, he realizes that his name is No.2 on the Skynet hit list with No.1 being Kyle Reese.Though at first, Connor doesn't realize the importance of Reese, he soon learns from his mother's tapes that the latter, now still a teenager is the one that Connor would send into the past to protect his mother and to father him. Marcus meanwhile makes contact with downed pilot Blair Williams who brings him to the Resistance base. While treating an injured Marcus, the men realize that he is in fact a Cyborg with a metal endoskeleton sneaking into their base.Now, John is faced with an uncomfortable situation of distrusting Marcus as he is a machine, and on other, to trust him, as he could be his only chance to rescue Reese from the clutches of Skynet. The climax of the story, not revealed here, is replete with humanoid Terminators, Hunter-Killer hover-crafts, giant human collectors and eel-like Hydrobots with the highlight being the cameo of the CGI of a youngish Schwarzenegger as the freshly developed T-800.For a fact, most moviegoers have been fans of this franchise for the role portrayed by the muscle-man and to Cameron's imagination of bringing together the concepts of a holocaust, robots taking over the world, time travel, etc as far back as 1984 when the first Terminator hit the screens and when it was reprised in 1992. The third, released in 2003 sorely missed Cameron but somehow managed decent business with Schwarzenegger's presence.Differing from its predecessors, the movie is not set in the present day but nearly a decade into the future. The well done special effects in shades of grey amplify the hollowness of the future where people eat two day old coyote to survive. Also notable are the rich tributes the makers have paid to its predecessors, including a duel with a severed Terminator, grabbing of shotgun and quotes such as 'I'll be back' and 'come with me if you want to live' among others.Putting comparisons aside, fast paced action is the forte of Terminator Salvation. If mindless shows of firepower, robots, high speed bike chases are your taste, you probably won't regret watching it. However, all of its two hours sum up into nothing more than a video game set in the future. As much as I wanted to deride this disappointing movie, I have still given it a chance with 4 on 10 for its legacy value, thus putting it among the category of 'just average' flicks.",4,1,4,28 June 2009
Milk," A decent movie though. Watch it for the amazing Acting
","For those who thought that the US was always a free country, movies like this show the struggle that minority groups have had to put up in order to get their voices heard. If abolition of slavery and acceptance of darker skin took so long to come by, surely, LGBT citizens who were termed ‘queers’, must have found the climb harder, beginning with Harvey Bernard Milk being the first openly gay man elected to a public office.Being a Biopic, Milk seems more like an intense documentary. Opening in 1978 where Sean Penn who plays Harvey Milk is recording his message that is to be read out in the event of his assassination, the movie unfolds itself amidst the first person narrative. It traces back to 1970 when Milk began his journey from being an Insurance executive to a businessman, activist and a political leader to his election to the San Francisco Board.Moving into the Castro District of San Francisco, Milk starts off with a shop ‘Castro Camera’ and then moves on to be a successful businessman and also emerges as a champion of gay rights. Milk is shown trying his luck running unsuccessfully for political office thrice, but his popularity was on the rise. His election in 1977 those 11 months in power leads him to introduce bills for gay rights in the city, and also makes enemies.Towards the end, set in 1978, we are shown Milk and his Mayor being killed by Dan White, his fellow city supervisor owing to obvious conflict between the liberals and conservatives. The internet tells that Milk turned a martyr for gay rights. Well, for all his awards, Sean Penn surely had lots of guts to play gay and kiss men on screen! His keenness for Opera can remind you of Tom Hanks in the path breaking ‘Philadelphia’! Milk comes across as a neatly made absorbing movie but something still seemed amiss; probably a familiar feature in most biographies or possibly just a disconnect in nativity, from an Indian perspective. Cinematography with a 70’s touch is very well done; the shot of a reflection over a whistle was the best. Sean Penn‘s prosthetic nose and change in appearance to suit the role. But the movie’s length makes you lose track at times.One curious point! All through the movie, it’s really hard to even find a tinge of feminine glamour or even an occasional pretty face. Worse still for the ladies, the men on screen are shown Gay! So, if you’re looking for usual eye candies on screen, keep away from this one. Considering that fact that the story had to empathize for LGBT rights, the movie makers had no other choice! All that stands out though, is Sean Penn’s amazing acting!",6,2,12,2 March 2009
The Adventures of Tintin," Very enjoyable; retains the charm from the original comics
","After being used to so many of sci-fi and hi-tech films seen in Hollywood, one has to admit that while watching this, there are many 'Why don't they use Google' moments. But it takes a lot to bring these comics to life while retaining the simple charm of those old comics that most of us would have read as kids. Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson have planned this as a trilogy and this is the first of the three and based on three original comic books: The Secret of the Unicorn (1943), The Crab with the Golden Claws (1941) and partly Red Rackham's Treasure (1944) and takes you on an adventure from the city to high seas to Saharan deserts.Being a first, it establishes the characters: Tintin (Jamie Bell) as a journalist with a white fox terrier called snowy and how he meets booze loving Captain Haddock (Andy Serkins) as they attempt to thwart Ivan Sacharine's (Daniel Craig) evil plans. And, then there are the twin detectives Thomson and Thomson. Comic timing by Captain Haddock is well done. The moment when he uses his alcohol breath to restart a plane is probably the funniest. And his lines 'billions of blue blistering barnacles' are sure to evoke your memories when you read those comics. It would be nice to see a return of these characters in the sequel and the other regulars such as Professor Calculus. Hope a sequel covers Tintin's Indian adventures too.Many of the earlier versions of Tintin in motion picture or television shows haven't been impressive. Although I was skeptical about how this movie would turn out, Spielberg's genius makes it tick. Although the story deviates from the books at certain places, it doesn't affect the end product. There is a flow in the story, although it combines three books, there the thrill of non-stop adventure and a bit of drama. The special effects are its high point. Filmed using motion-capture, i.e., translating actors' real movements in a studio to characters on screen, it seemed a good decision to retain it as a comic rather than enact it live retaining the charm that Herge's comics. Also, the creator believed that only Spielberg could do it that well. Nevertheless, considering that it was an animated film, the 3D could have been much better though. While, I'm not sure whether those who have not been fans of the comics would really find the film interesting, it's still a worthwhile watch, irrespective of your age. This film works well for comic book enthusiasts and also for those with kids.",7,1,4,13 November 2011
Crash," In-your-face portrayal of LA life and racism that would churn emotions
","Plot Outline: For two days in Los Angeles, a racially and economically diverse group of people come together in unexpected incidents. Characters include a black detective looking for his brother, two car thieves always discussing racism in society, a racist cop with a sick father and his idealistic partner, a black director and his wife, a Persian immigrant shopkeeper and a Hispanic locksmith.Comment: Paul Haggis struck gold with Million Dollar Baby's adapted script and has done it again with Crash. What's better is that he's directed it himself. Crash doesn't actually narrate a story but takes a slice out of time in LA. The opening narrative about impersonal life in LA and the depiction of prejudices and preconceived notions of characters built on their own biased experiences form the foundation of the movie. The slow pace of enhances the intensity of the movie and helps audience get closer to the characters.Crash has many good moments and good dialogues. Notable ones include the Locksmith's little girl and the cloak, the second brush between Officer Ryan, a racist cop played by Matt Dillon and Thandie Newton. Lots of Good and Bad sides of people are depicted. What sets Crash apart is that it gives insights into how and why of the Good and Bad which is not a common occurrence in movies. Despite all the intensity, you wouldn't want to hate any character in the movie. Crash is recommended for those who love intense movies. So, take some time out to catch up with a slice of time from LA.Rating: 8/10",8,1,6,1 March 2006
Interstellar," Scores on effects, fails on narrative!
","Christopher Nolan is known to experiment, such as the the non-linear narrative of 'Memento' and well written characters in 'The Dark Knight'. A director of his caliber also made the disappointing pseudo- intellectual 'Inception'. Sadly, 'Interstellar' too comes across as a let-down of sorts, despite interesting science.'Interstellar' has all the ingredients of a typical space sci-fi film: spacecraft, wormholes, stasis, strange planets, time travel, a black hole, robots running on artificial intelligence, father-daughter drama, etc., in the background of a dying Earth. While these concepts aren't new to Hollywood, the big budget allowed for the visual spectacle. Still, it is marred by choppy narrative, clichéd dialog and poorly developed characters that we hardly care about.Set in unspecified future, Earth's capacity to sustain life has diminished; crops are dying and there are dust storms. Agriculture takes precedence over everything. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a former NASA test pilot turned farmer. A widowed Cooper lives with his father in law and children Tom and Murph. An inquisitive young Murph (Mackenzie Foy) is obsessed with the idea of a ghost in her bedroom and is always trying to decode signs.As it turns out, the signs are coordinates to a hidden space station of NASA, headed by Professor Brand (Michael Caine), in search of life sustaining planets so as to evacuate Earth. Predictably, our hero, Cooper is the only man who can pilot the mission to outer space, beyond our galaxy accessed through a wormhole. Damn, a trespasser at a hidden space station is suddenly asked to commandeer a spaceflight without any serious briefing or training!Joining Cooper on the mission are Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway) and two other scientists that are expendable. Their mission is finding three of the ten manned probes that went through the portal earlier and have reported seemingly positive findings. Again, don't ask why manned missions when they had advanced AI robots like TARS and CASE? That brings us to the existential question: why a manned follow-up mission, huh?The overarching premise behind the mission is that certain benevolent 'beings' have opened up a wormhole and left clues through gravity- based anomalies. The aging professor has been working on a mathematical model to evacuate Earth. The model fails since it needs data from a gravitational singularity, where space and time can be bent. If Plan- A, to evacuate fails, Plan-B to populate extraterrestrial planets with genetic samples humans.Unbeknownst to the fatality of Plan-A, the crew continues to explore planets. One Planet has time distorted to a level where an hour on it equals seven years on earth. The planet doesn't make the cut due to its shallow waters and gigantic waves. The second is an icy planet with ice-clouds (filmed in Iceland) and a crazed explorer (Matt Damon) who tries to kill Cooper so that he can execute plan B at the third planet, Miller; Result: needless drama.As with every movie involving vehicles, terrestrial or extraterrestrial, fuel shortage and damage to the craft and the need for Singularity data are key plot elements towards the climax. Apropos, they need to slingshot past the black hole to the third planet which Amelia bets on, as her loved one went there during the original Lazarus project. Oh, a movie is so incomplete without a love angle! Glad there wasn't any romance between Cooper and Ameila.And then, our hero, Cooper dives into the event horizon of the beautifully depicted super-massive black hole and reaches singularity. But what is this singularity? Just like the limbo being linked to Cobb's dreams in 'Inception', the singularity in 'Interstellar' is actually a four dimensional tesseract presenting a single location to Cooper at various points in time. And the location? You guessed it: Murph's bedroom. How convenient!So, who's the ghost in Murph's life? Cooper! And the 'beings'? Cooper again! He opened up the wormhole near Saturn that took him through the same spot half a century later. Doesn't this create an inconsistent causal loop just like 'Grandfather Paradox' or a chicken going back in time and laying an egg that it is born out of? But then, an average moviegoer doesn't care as long as there are spectacular sights and happy endings!'Interstellar' is lengthy and tiresome, narrative is patchy and has excessive inter-cuts during crucial scenes. Spoiling experience further is the jarring and ominously heavy background score by Hans Zimmer that muffles out dialog. Acting is just passable: McConaughey is hardly a fit, Jessica Chastain as the grown up Murph is decent as the scientist and Michel Caine seems to be having his fourth outing with the director.Nolan's fiction works for audiences who believe they enjoy intelligent films, but actually watch them without thought or logic. As contradictory as it sounds, truth is stranger than fiction. Nolan's 'Inception' was full of plot holes, irrespective of whether it was deliberate or inept storytelling. Usually, a good narrative should have a logical end, except that it is Nolan and he likes keeping things ambiguous. I haven't come across anyone who understood 'Inception' or 'Interstellar' fully, despite claiming that they loved it.About the science in 'Interstellar', Nolan found played it safe by bringing a scientist on board, Kip Thore, as a consultant and executive producer. This would've surely had an impact on the depiction of a spinning black hole and other stuff like the four- dimensional tesseract within the event horizon, boxy but versatile AI robots, etc. Nonetheless, I'm still amazed at how an astronaut can dive into a black hole and come out totally unhurt!!If anything, Christopher Nolan must be admired for dreaming big. Sadly, this movie is a waste of a great concept turned into an average movie that sells only the basis of special effects bankrolled by a big budget. While die-hard Nolan fans would rave over this, discerning movie connoisseurs won't appreciate the poor storytelling.",5,6,10,22 July 2015
21 Jump Street," Just another comedy; has nothing new!
","Movies like '21 Jump Street' are like the run of the mill comedies we have in Bollywood. They completely lack novelty but are worth your money for the laughs. The film is based on the TV series of the same name that launched Johnny Depp and has now turned funny-man Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum into producers. Shmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum) are from the same school but hardly ever got along. While Shmidt is plump and a nerd, the latter is a Jock. Both end up joining the police academy and emerge as buddies, helping out with each others weaknesses. Since the duo has youthful looks, they are sent undercover as students to a local school to bust a drug ring. And then follows the usual humor as they get into school plays, some romance and run-ins with the drug lords while they also deal with an expletive spewing boss, Captain Dickson (Ice Cube). In a way, it reminded me of the Bollywood movie 'Main Hoon Na' which had Shah Rukh Khan getting into college as an undercover guard to one of the students there. Just like in '21 Jump Street', the former too had humor and romance. There is also another Hollywood movie with a similar story; can't recollect the name though! Jonah Hill is best remembered for his role in 'Superbad' a comedy on a high-school party theme and his latest act in a supporting role in the Oscar nominated 'Moneyball'. But, his best achievement is shedding pounds by the dozens to suit his character. Tatum, also a regular face in collegiate humor flicks is fine, but nothing exceptional. '21 Jump Street' has already garnered good international ratings. Remember, the US release was more than a month ago. But, don't be dissuaded by those ratings or rave reviews; let me assure you that this movie has nothing new. At best, it qualifies as a pastime flick on TV; but not worth a trip to the silver screen.",5,9,19,30 April 2012
Rush," Dramatic tension and Authenticity of F1 in the 70's
","Making films about real life characters always presents a challenge; more so if one of them doesn't live to see the day his tale is made into a film. Coming from director Ron Howard, known for films like 'Apollo 13', 'A Beautiful Mind', 'Da Vinci Code', 'Rush' is about two great personalities in the high adrenalin Formula 1 racing. The story begins on the start line where Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) narrates the story of how James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) influenced his life and the days of Formula 1 in the 1970's where it was not uncommon for drivers to die in accidents. James Hunt, who in real life was known as a playboy is appropriately portrayed on screen. There's a scene from his early days where he walks into at a hospital to get his injuries treated and lo behold, he seduces the nurse in James Bond style! Then, we are introduced to his career in Formula 3 where he drives for Lord Hesketh's team. Although the film marks the meeting of Lauda and Hunt in the F3 race on a sour note, it is believed that the duo were actually friends and shared an apartment during their early days. Was this an error? Or was it deliberately avoided to bring about dramatic tension between its lead stars right from the start? We wouldn't know. The character of Niki Lauda starkly contrasts with Hunt as he is cool, calculating, working with the team on developing the car and isn't bothered about partying or popularity. In real life too, it is believed that Lauda never let the achievements get into his head and he gave away his trophies to a local garage in exchange for car wash.Discussing the story itself isn't necessary for the review as most of the critical elements of the plot are based on actual, well known events. Its most poignant moment is how Lauda returns to track merely six weeks after a near-fatal crash with bandages on his wounds and leads the championship till he pulls out of the season's last race at Fuji when the treacherous weather conditions made the race too dangerous. 'Rush' does a wonderful job in recreating the F1 races, the imagery of powerful engines, tires ready to zoom as pedal hits metal, and the infamous Nürburgring crash of 1976. In fact, Niki Lauda in his interviews has praised the filmmakers for portraying the crash and his treatments in a realistic manner and that the scenes 'shocked' him. Reportedly, the actors weren't allowed to drive real Formula 1 cars. So, the film makers are said to have used F3 cars with the bodywork of F1 cars of that era to make them look like the real deal. Still, they drove some mean machines. Wow! The actors have done a good job and look like their real life counterparts. Chris Hemsworth still seems like Thor with the long hair, but less bulky. Daniel Brühl, an acclaimed German actor embodies the role of Lauda, Olivia Wilde as Suzy Miller, Alexandra Maria Lara as Marlene Knaus and Pierfrancesco Favino as Clay Regazzoni have done a neat job and there's not a moment where it feels inauthentic. What works for the movie, other than the stunningly recreated visuals is the emphasis on its characters. At its soul is the portrayal of how Hunt and Lauda influenced each other's lives and careers. Although the two champions were very different by their outwardly lives, they shared a common passion for racing and winning and looking at each other to seek the much needed challenge and why you need enemies!Verdict: if you are one of those who like Bollywood family dramas branded as racing films, like Ta Ra Rum Pum, let me assure you that 'Rush' isn't for you. But, if you are a Formula 1 fan, don't even think twice; just go for it.",7,2,3,24 September 2013
The Aviator," Must Watch: Caprio & Blanchett have done a great Job!
","Plot Outline: The movie traces the life of millionaire movie mogul and aviator Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) from his late teens to his early forties. Set in the 1930's and 40's, the movie depicts the protagonist's mindset as he romances Hollywood's babes Katherine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale) and his wild planes with equal zest.Comment: Scorsese makes a great effort to portray a crazy genius in the best possible way anyone could. Although a lot of my friends who've seen this movie say that 'emotion' is missing in this movie in a big way, I prefer to say that Hughes was a character about whom there is very little in the public domain, especially about his childhood and old-age. Further, it is extremely difficult to portray someone's thought process, something as wild as Hughes' with accuracy and emotion. I would say that, within the given constraints, Scorsese has made his best.The Five Oscars that the movie got are really well deserved. In fact, I would say that Aviator deserved better than Million Dollar Baby. By saying this, I mean that Underdog-winner concepts have always struck the sentimental chord. It would be pertinent to recollect the success of movies such as Seabiscuit, Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar, etc. Caprio has rendered a brilliant performance which has been under-rated by many. Other stars did a great job too. Blanchett had the meatiest role of all.Rating: 4.5/5",9,2,4,12 May 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," Thank god it wraps up the trilogy. check out this review
","SPOILERS!! The Matrix was undoubtedly the best one in the series. It was captivating with all the philosophical inputs. Reloaded created new questions. Revolutions promised to answer them. How well it did that is a big question.Revolutions opens where Reloaded stops, with Neo in Coma along with Bane (whose mind is actually that of a copy of Smith). Neo's mind is held captive by the Trainman who is a follower of the Merovingian. Neo meets an Indian Family that gives him some fundas about 'Karma' Neo sees no way that he can escape from the world of the Trainman, a world that is sandwitched between the Machine-world and the Matrix. Neo wonders how he is able to separate his mind and the body. Then he is told that the powers of the one Extend beyond the Matrix. Morpheus, Trinity and Seraph meet the Merovingian at the Hell Night Club where he is with his (beautiful) persephone. After a lot of kicking around and firing, they are able to Force the Merovingian to Release Neo's mind. He then meets the Oracle and learns that Smith is his Negative double. Smith is busy copying himlself throughout the matrix.Bane too wakes up from his Coma and acts strange. He does not answer the Captian's questions. Later he kills the Doctor who was treating him. Neo and Tinity take Niobe's ship to the machine world. Niobe gives it coz of the faith she has in Neo as a person and not because he is the one or something. Meanwhile on the Ship, Bane/Smith blinds Neo and Neo can see only in Yellow/Red of what is his enemy in the machine world.One one hand, Zion prepares itself for the attack. The gigantic Robots maket it look like a Gigantic Video-game rather than serious action. Niobe and Morpheus steer the other ship back home though crevices. Anyway, Niobe looks decent in the movie. Zion is penentrated by the machines that are digging and thousands of squiddies come out of those drilled holes into zion. The infantry does its best. So does Zee's team that destroys the Drilling machines.Neo and Trinity on the surface of the Earth in the Machine City, face a lot of squiddies. But he destroys them with the power of the one. Neo and Trinity take a sharp surge into the sky, see the sun and then plunge back into the atmosphere (God knows how hovercrafs can fly in such altitudes).Back at Zion, Niobe rushes back to the Dock at Zion after a heroic stunt by the kid on the Infantry Robot and trigger the EMP that kills all squiddies. That destroys a lot of Hardware at Zion which infuriates Commander Lock. Soon, they prepare for an another attack with swarms of squiddies coming in.On the Surface, at the machine City, the hovercraft crashes, killing trinity. Later Neo meets the master of all machines that does not kill him because there is a purpose out of him. The program Smith that the machines had created in the Matrix had grown out of proportions and he was all set to destroy the matrix and achieve his verson of freedom. Only the One can confront him and the Machines promise peace on the condition that he Destroys Smith.Neo is Plugged into the Matrix and the final Showdown between Neo and Smith begins. After a lot of flying and crashing, smashing and punching, Neo tricks Smith to saying 'Everything that has a beginning has an End'. Neo lets Smith copy himself into him and then destroys it; finally killing the Smith Program.Later, the Matrix is rewritten with all people returning to their normal form. Machines leave zion peacefully. Neo is still in the Machine world and people in Zion and Matrix talk of him as if he was god. The closing credits start with the prayer 'Asatoma Satgamaya...'So, ends the Trilogy. Any further comments and discussions are welcome...",8,0,0,4 January 2004
Hugo," A poignant tale worthy of a dream bordering on fantasy!
","At the Academy awards this February, Hugo had 11 nominations (most for that evening) and five wins, including art, cinematography, visual effects and sound. The first scene where the camera swoops over Paris, a train station & to the boy in the clock is in itself spellbinding. But behold, it's not just about special effects and 3D, the story has a heart too, told in with a fairy-tale charm from 1930's Paris. Hugo Cabret is a young orphaned boy living with his uncle who winds clocks at Montparnasse station in Paris. As long as the clocks work, nobody notices him, but Hugo has to constantly escape the watchful eye of the station inspector Gustave.In the vast maze of clocks, Hugo hides a broken automaton, which he believes carries a message from his deceased father. To fix it, he steals parts from a toy shop owned by Papa Georges till he gets caught one day. But thereafter, things change between them as Hugo starts to work for Georges and befriends his goddaughter Isabelle who is about Hugo's age. The rest of the tale is better left to be watched on screen.The film is somewhat based on the real life of yesteryear French film maker Georges Méliès who made around 400 movies. During the WW-II, his studio went into losses and Méliès had destroyed most of his prints in despair while some of the negatives were melted down to recover celluloid and silver. Sadly, only a few of those films remain! As in the film, he spent his later years on meager income from toy store.The film has some moments that seem unreal, like the automatons; but those actually exist in real life. And then there are repeated shots of the rocket hitting the moon in the eye which is from the silent film 'Le Voyage dans la Lune' meaning 'A Voyage to the Moon' in a surreal style. Méliès can be considered a pioneer in science fiction movies, although they have a lot to do with fantasy, but nevertheless path breaking!Among actors, Ben Kingsley as Georges Méliès is touching, other performances are worthy too. Sacha Baron Cohen as the Station Master is probably the best of the rest with Asa Butterfield as Hugo and Chloë Grace Moretz as Isabelle do well. Although titled 'Hugo' the film has more about Méliès than about Hugo.On the whole, 'Hugo' comes across as a well made film on all quarters. Remember, it's been directed by the acclaimed Martin Scorsese. The film was a worthy Oscar nominee for other categories such as Best Picture, Director, Adapted screenplay, costume, score & editing but bagged no acting nominations.Although in 3D, this isn't a movie with action figures flying in your way. Told more like a fairy-tale, it goes on at its own slow pace as it takes you through the characters' minds and situations. There are times when one finds like a fantasy movie too. So, if you love movies, this one is absolutely worth your time. Go for it!",8,3,6,6 May 2012
The Shining," An old thriller; Jack Nicholson & Danny Lloyd make it worthwhile!
","One of those old classics among thriller/ horror genre! Nearly three decades old and over two hours long, the only thing that can keep you glued to the screen is Jack Nicholson’s mesmeric performance while the eerie setting of a lonely hotel in the hills, everything around covered in snow and an untold story of death complete the picture.Jack Torrance (Nicholson) a writer doubles up as a school teacher to make ends meet. When a position opens up as a caretaker at the Overlook Hotel in the mountains that closes down for the entire winter, Jack grabs the opportunity knowing fully well that a decade ago, one of his kind failed to handle the solitude and murdered his two daughters with an axe and then drowned his wife before shooting himself.Joining Jack in his sojourn are his wife Wendy (Shelly Duvall), a fan of horror flicks and son Danny (Danny Lloyd). The little boy though seems to have visions of Overlook’s past and flowing blood. A casual chat with Chef Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) reveals that he too like Danny can foresee things and know unspoken words, a skill that is called “shining” here and is adequately demonstrated at significant turns in the film.The long winter soon gets on Jack’s nerves as he is seen to be visibly stressed by his work and the loneliness of winter. As is must in horror flicks, he soon starts talking to the dead who tell him that he was always the hotel’s manager and compel him to ‘correct’ his son and wife who seem to guard themselves from the ominous. Hallorann, meanwhile envisions the happenings from Miami and flies down to save them.While Jack Nicholson is an accomplished performer par excellence, Danny Lloyd thoroughly shines in his role. Be it his conversations with the imaginary Tony or his curious cycling around the hotel, chance encounters with the dead girls, his visions of death and the spooky humming of ‘Red-Rum’ which is read backwards as ‘Murder’. Shelly Duvall as the mom already looks spooky and is a fine fit for her role.Based on the book by Stephen King, Stanley Kubrick the experienced Horror director makes sure that “The Shining” has its moments. Danny’s cycling scenes, sudden appearance of ghosts, conversations with them and the silent emptiness of locale are done well. The chase sequence in the snow-laden giant garden-maze is apt too. Despite its length, the performances will keep you glued to it. Worthwhile on DVD!",7,0,2,10 January 2010
Wanted," Ridiculous stunts, Glorifies Assassins! Stunts salvage the movie!
","Going by the promos, this was supposed to be a decent action movie, especially since it starred credible names like Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman. But, little did I expect ridiculous action stunts on bending bullets in a non-‘matrix’ environment! And then there is the hackneyed plot of treachery and deceit with an unsuspecting protagonist. Saving this movie is its high octane action that may also sometimes seem improbably comical.Wesley (James McAvoy) is frustrated weakling who on one hand is beleaguered by his fat shrewish boss and on the other hand swallows his pride as his girlfriend is busy sleeping with his best friend. His life is all set to change when babe Fox (Jolie) takes him to Sloan (Freeman) head of a thousand year old secret society of expert assassins who take orders from names of victims that come up from a code of the loom in the fabric.Just before he can go on assassination assignments, Wesley is put through conditioning that involves being beaten up, broken bones, getting stabbed and all injuries getting cured in a bath of liquid. Wow, if that were true, these spas could do better business than hospitals. Oh yes, and then there is a philosophy that they kill people because they can save the world from the damage that the victims could do if they were alive! Be prepared with suspended logic for the action sequences. While car chases are neat, the graphics bringing you to the shot and the gun are well done. The idea of bending bullets is the most preposterous. Well, for a fact, glorifying assassins is never really a good idea either. On performances, Freeman is wasted, Angelina is too skinny. For all the stunts and hard work, it is still not worthwhile to be watched on the big screen!",4,1,4,5 September 2008
Silver Linings Playbook," Deliciously funny script despite being a predictable romance
","Silver Linings Playbook, adapted from a novel of the same name by Mathew Quick drew acclaim and 8 Academy Award nominations. it is also the first film in 31 years to be nominated in all four acting categories. While all the performances were top-notch, Jennifer Lawrence won the Best Actress Oscar. All this is alluring enough to make a movie buff watch the film. And it turns out to be totally worthwhile. Pat/ Patrizio Solitano Jr. (Bradley Cooper) is released into the care of his parents after having spent a while at a mental health institution. Although under treatment for Bipolar Disorder, he detests pills and has a hard time dealing with the fact that his wife Nikki has now moved on after an episode when Pat beat up her paramour in fit of rage and he faces a restraining order from her and the school where he used to work. Ronnie, a friend of Pat's invites him over to his place for dinner, where he meets his sister-in-law Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence) who recently lost her husband and has her own share of psychological issues which manifests in the fact that the whole town seems to know for her freewheeling promiscuity. Oddly though, both hit of well over a conversation about the medication they have been on and bond well thereafter. The best written parts in the story are the conversations between Pat and Tiffany, in what can be described as 'no holds barred'. There's a time when Pat says 'I don't have a filter when I talk', which essentially describes their condition and bonding over the fact that they don't have to pretend with one another, unlike the rest of the society. And among the most hilarious instances is when Tiffany chases Pat, he tells her 'I'm married' to which she says 'So am I', Pat: 'But, your husband is dead', Tiffany: 'where's your wife?', Pat: 'You're crazy?' Tiffany 'I'm not the one who just got out of that hospital in Baltimore'The other characters, Pat's parents Patrizio Sr (Robert De Niro) who is probably as 'differently wired' as his son, Pat's mother (Jacki Weaver), his humorous friend from the Baltimore institution Danny (Chris Tucker) and therapist Dr Patel (Anupam Kher) also manage to leave their mark as the film allows these characters to take lives of their own without getting into unnecessary details or sub-plots.Strong script, Yes! But the film also draws its strength from powerful performances. Bradley cooper is very convincing as the man on recovery mode, taking to fitness. Tiffany as the girl who found a socially unacceptable way to deal with her loss, De Niro as the gambling addict and Anupam Kher, a serious therapist who turns out to be a crazy Eagles fan. Chris Tucker is a great addition to the film despite the small role. Well, what does the title actually refer to? The silver lining is driven by the strong belief that Pat has in happy endings. His feelings are evident in an animated conversation that Pat has with his parents in the wee hours debating on why in one of Hemingway's books does the story has to end with somebody's death. He is driven by the principle 'Excelsior', the Latin word for 'ever upwards' which he keenly lives by.Some pitfalls in the movie could be that the romance in the story is very predictable and that may not have ended in any other way. Generally, that is true for most romances that thrive on culminating in happy endings. Another is question on whether or not this role of Bradley Cooper is an accurate portrayal of Bipolar Disorder or not. And then the obsession of De Niro's character on betting all his money over superstition. The verdict: The Oscar nominated movie 'Silver Linings Playbook' is definitely worth a watch for the skillful writing and humor brought out in the oddest of circumstances. While the movie is careful enough not to poke fun of any mental condition, those that have reservations about its portrayal on screen, could better stay away.",8,0,0,25 February 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Refreshing reboot with great lead-pair chemistry!
","A decade after the last 'Spider-Man' movie series starring Tobey Maguire and Sam Raimi came up; Sony Pictures have churned up a franchise reboot. With fresh faces and a new director, Marc Webb, Spiderman has become more realistic as it gets closer to its comic book roots and hits the screens with far more exciting stunts.The story traces the character's origins, his transition from a shy, nerdy and aloof schoolboy, Peter Parker to a superhero, Spiderman. One day in the boring life of Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield), he stumbles upon a lost research piece on cross-species genetics his dead father was working on. In an effort to find out what happened to his father, he reaches his former collaborator Dr Curt Connors at Oscorp. Connors (Rhys Ifans) is working on a cure for his lost arm based on reptiles' ability to grow new limbs and is under pressure from the corporate honcho Rajit Ratha (Irrfan Khan) to deliver results. Things go terribly wrong when Connors tests the new genetic concoction on himself and turns into the 'Lizard'. Meanwhile, Parker has been bitten by a genetically altered spider and gains superhuman strength and spider skills. The bulk of the 132 minute runtime is spent on how Parker comes into terms with his new powers, how losing Uncle Ben prompts him to turn superhero, his runs-in with the law and having some fun handling school bullies; all this when he is not busy with his girlfriend Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). Towards the end, when the challenge of saving the city from the Lizard emerges, Spiderman is ready for the challenge.After watching reboots, it is impossible to resist the temptation to compare the film with the previous versions, especially since they were successful in the past. Per se, it would be unfair to compare special effects since technology improves with the passing of time. Even otherwise, the latest edition is better than its predecessor. One, better cast: Andrew Garfield (from 'Facebook' fame) gives a more realistic Peter Parker without making him look like a wimp as Maguire did. And it's great that the series bid goodbye to Kirsten Dunst who didn't look one bit like a superhero's girlfriend. Emma stone who was seen recently in 'The Help' is an apt choice as Parker's girl and confidante. The lead pair share some great on-screen chemistry. The lead pair is effectively complemented by the villain in Rhys Ifans, Martin Sheen playing the father-figure Uncle Ben, Sally Field as Aunt May and Dennis Leary as Captain Stacy. Irrfan Khan's role is best described as understated but effective. Surely, it's way better than Anil Kapoor's unfunny gig in Mission Impossible 4. The second key improvement is the emphasis on Parker's intellect as he uses technology to spin webs like in the comic books where he gets his natural web much later. Thridly, the transition from a regular kid to Spiderman is handled well. The subway train scene and the one in the abandoned shipyard are very well done. A notable absence in the new film is Parker's employer 'The Daily Bugle' and its editor who portrays spider-man negatively in the media. Here, he has a disbeliever in the local police chief Captain Stacy who also happens to be Gwen's father. The famous line by Uncle Ben 'with great power comes great responsibility' is missing too. The film is not without shortcomings. The weirdest thing is that the high-security Oscorp building seems to allow unfettered access to interns who seem to know everything that happens there; pretty amazing huh? In the climax scene, he may have lost his webbing machine, but why does he find it difficult to cling to surfaces? Every relaunch attracts a new segment of the audience and so would this latest edition of Spiderman. What's best is that the film-makers have ensured that the usual Hollywood superhero movie fans are kept happy too. For all the exciting action it has to offer with minimal drama sans sentimental garbage, 'The Amazing Spiderman' is a go!",7,1,4,4 July 2012
No Strings Attached," Same old formula with a different garnish!
","'No Strings Attached' is a rehash of a concept beaten down to pulp a zillion times in Hollywood. Countless movies have played upon the theme of a couple starting off on a strictly physical relationship but end up in love. Adam (Ashton Kutcher) and Emma (Natalie Portman) play old friends who bump into each other in Los Angeles and exchange numbers. While Adam works on a TV show and is an aspiring screenwriter, Emma works as a resident in a local hospital. On a drunken night after having found that his ex-girlfriend has hooked up with his father, Adam calls up every girl on his phone seeking the obvious. The next morning, he finds himself at Emma's apartment. Emma, who doesn't believe in relationships, has a proposition for him: to use each other as 'friends with benefits'.Interestingly, there is film titled 'Friends with Benefits' starring Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis set to release this year. So much so for rehashed concepts.While the arrangement works well in the beginning, Adam starts taking more interest in Emma, especially getting jealous when he sees her with a fellow resident. Obviously, she doesn't like it. Nevertheless, the audience is never told the reason for her aversion to relationships. Instead, it tries to thrive by bringing in some comedy.After things seem to start getting mushy, the couple part ways. But, it doesn't take too long for Emma to feel for Adam either. Then, when Adam attempts to hang out with other girls, Emma barges in and drives the girls away. While these flicks have worked in the past culminating in a romantic ending, it gets too hackneyed. Just having different faces and a different location doesn't really work. Either they had to be too emotional or plain funny; and this falls in between. You may not regret watching this on a lazy Sunday on TV when you are flipping through channels. But, taking pains to see it on big screen is a no-no.",4,5,6,28 February 2011
Quantum of Solace," Just a Good Action flick, but not at all a Bond Movie!
","Jason Bourne is back, dressed in suits! Did I say Bourne? Honestly, I am still confused whether movie makers wanted to show James Bond or someone else. Daniel Craig, less bulky this time reprises his role as an unbridled thug in the garb of the world’s favorite secret agent. This insanity of portraying favorite ‘heroes’ as ‘flawed’ has gutted 007 too! For those who have grown to love bond through the ages, this is definitely not amusing.Taking off from Casino Royale, the story opens with Bond in a car chase in Italy with Mr. White in the trunk of his Aston Martin. While the MI6 question White on the mysterious organization Quantum, a double agent fires at M causing White to escape. Clues lead Bond to Haiti where he meets Camille (Olga Kurylenko), the vengeful muse of Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric) Chairman of Greene Planet and member of Quantum.Quantum is portrayed as a dark organization with devious means having highly placed people including an adviser to the British PM as members. Older fans of the Bond series would quickly recognize the parallel with SPECTRE that featured in eight early 007 films. For the rest of the film, 007 and Camille get busy foiling Greene’s plans of monopolizing Bolivia’s water supply and of placing a corrupt General as president by staging a coup.To fit the bill of a secret agent, Craig as Bond takes in a lot of physical damage without a bit of exhaustion and is cold enough to dump a dead friend in a trash can; but is still confused at handling emotions about Vesper. The flip side is worse as he has stripped 007 of all humor and the typical one-liners that Connery, Brosnan and Moore delivered with aplomb and made bond what he is. His lack of looks makes things even terrible.Olga Kurylenko, picked from among 400 girls who auditioned for the role, is a stunner and is reasonably believable a bond girl. A young Gemma Arterton has too brief a role for any comment. Dame Judi Dench plays boss ‘M’ with perfection in a more elaborate role, thinking with her head and guided by what she believes in. Q and his gadgets are sorely missed as bond sports nothing more than silly phone with GPS and a camera.Had this starred Matt Damon, it could have easily become the fourth Bourne movie. Action sequences are breathtaking complimented by good and camera work and special effects. Despite this, Quantum of Solace is just not the James Bond movie you expect to see. If you seek clang bang action, go for it; but if you want your cherished suave secret agent, I’d rather suggest you gift yourself a DVD pack of the older twenty 007 flicks.",6,2,4,9 November 2008
Batman Begins," High budget movie with a colossal waste of talent
","Plot Outline: Disillusioned after seeing his parents murdered, millionaire heir Bruce Wayne (Bale) travels distances to unravel himself and to find means to fight injustice while, his wealth, his company has fallen into bad hands. Bruce returns to Gotham, a new man with a dark side: Batman, a caped crusader who teams up with upcoming cop Gordon to fight crime.Comment: Christopher Nolan's Batman is credited with the focus on the central character and its development with unprecedented detail. Sadly, it has been painfully overstretched. Although one would argue that there is more of Batman than the weird-villains, I would rather say that villains bring out the best in superhero movies rather than a bland portrayal of the character's mental development for 140mins. Probably, there are shades of Nolan's inexperience with Action flicks and his comfort with movies like Insomnia.Christian Bale dons the cape as the fourth Batman after Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer and George Clooney and looks like he needed to spend more time in his cape to establish himself as Batman. Liam Neeson's Jujutsu and Ninja classes reminded me of Fishburne in Matrix. Stars like Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Cutie Katie Homes are underutilized. Technical work is neat on SFX but nothing great to look for.Rating: 2/5",4,6,13,20 June 2005
Twilight," Special effects, pretty faces & some romance; nothing striking though
","While we saw Twilight being released only this Friday in India, the audience in the Americas, Europe and South East Asia saw its sequel, ‘The Twilight Saga: New Moon’ and another sequel is already under production. The first of these, based on the four book series on teenage vampire romance by Stephenie Meyer thrilled teens precisely a year ago in the West. Had they forgotten that Hollywood has a sizeable market here? Seventeen year old Isabella Swan moves to live with her father in Forks; a town near Washington State's coast after her mother is remarried. Being cute, as most thriller actresses are, many boys eye her. But, she is drawn towards Edward, the lone guy in the mysterious Cullen family teens. Initially Edward seems to detest her, but soon, both get talking. Love blossoms when he saves Bella from a crash with his bare hands.Curiosity and intrigue draws Bella to Edward whom, she discovers is a vampire. But, he is a vegetarian one, in the sense that he consumes only animal blood! Soon we are introduced his vampire family led by Carlisle Cullen, whom the town knows as a doctor. The Cullen family encounters the nomadic vampires who are keen to snack on Bella, thus bringing us to the climax of the battle between the good & bad vampires.Though I haven’t read the book, I felt that key drivers in a vampire romance would be intense passion, some lust blended with thrill seeking teenage innocence as Bella falls for Edward. But, when you see Kristen Stewart and Briton Robert Pattinson, at best, you stop at saying ‘yeah, they are a cute couple’. With the emotional metamorphosis that leads Bella to Edward completely missing, what’s left seems liked a rushed up story! Some of the characters that could have done with more depth are that of the nomadic vampire James who hunts Bella or the hunter’s consort Victoria. In the end, when you see Victoria watching over the lead couple, the viewer just doesn’t seem to care since these characters were hardly allowed to develop. Another character that deserves sympathy was Chief Swann, Bella’s father who almost had nothing to do throughout.As you sleepwalk through the story, some sporadic moments make it worthwhile. The speedy tree climbing scenes and romance in the meadows are decent. Twilight also highlights another dilemma of a movie maker. Since romances and thrillers are not a natural combination, filmmakers are somehow stuck between the two and deliver the best of neither. The lack of blood and gore helps the romance but loses on thrills.Although the movie has made more than half a billion dollars globally, including DVD sales, it lacks the spark. The teen romance plus a lot of low light special effects in blue-grey tint messes up on poor script, lack of character development. Maybe, just the scary thought of a lone girl in the company of a family of vampires probably kept the movie ticking. Despite all its misses, I’d say that you won’t really regret watching it at home.",5,1,4,23 November 2009
Meet the Fockers," Hilarious but crude. Parental Guidance must.
","Plot Outline: A sequel to the hilarious Meet the Parents (2004), after male nurse Greg Focker gets permission from this would-be father-in-law and ex-CIA Jack Byrnes (De Niro), his in-laws to-be visit Greg's parents at Miami better known as Mr. and Mrs. Focker, whose wanton lifestyle in a stark contrast to the strict and suspicious Jack Byrnes. The ensuing comedy keeps you glued to your seats.Comment: The first thought that comes to one's mind is 'Damn who would have a family whose last name would be Focker?' While one ponders over this, the ensuring comedy is even crude. Some of the sequences may be unsuitable for kids. Negatives apart, the movie is a well executed comedy where you wouldn't lose track of the story. De Niro better remembered for his role as Al Capone does great as a suspicious ex-CIA man with his ease at using the hi-tech gadgets on his RV. Among the three Fockers Durstin Hoffman has done a great job! Stiller and others are just around the average. MTF is recommended for pass-time viewing for those in a mood for some crude comedy.Rating: 3/5",6,0,0,12 May 2005
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," For all its hype, New Moon suffers with a weak story & sleepy pace!
","If you thought the first ‘twilight’ was a sleepy teen-romance, new moon sleepwalked itself to another level. Continuing from the first flick, Bella and Edward are deeply in love. With Bella turning 18, she starts to have nightmares about becoming old, while her lover remains as youthful as ever. Reluctantly, she attends the party which the Cullens have organized for her where she accidentally cuts herself and Jasper can’t resist blood.Edward becomes increasingly concerned about her continued vulnerability and his family leaves Forks. Soon our pretty lady finds solace in the adoring Jacob Black who later turns out to be a werewolf. The rest is a triangular love story and the tale of who saves Bella from the vengeful vampire Victoria. At this point, one wonders, can’t Bella really find ‘normal’ boyfriend or does she have an inclination for abnormal stuff?New Moon introduces the well dressed Volturi, the law enforcers among vampires who have lived on for thousands of years. While this may look creative for an idea in a book, there is a glaring lack of depth in the treatment of characters. Worthy of mention though is the talented 15 year old Dakota Fanning as ‘Jane’ the Volturi vampire who can cause feelings of pain. It’s anyone’s guess that her casting would keep younger teens happy! Before you can write twilight off, the bland New Moon does have a few sparks. Taylor Lautener who was just a silly long haired kid in Twlight turns into a well-chiseled Werewolf. The only efforts on visual effects are seen in the human-werewolf transformations and camera angles for chase sequences are also neat. Sadly, it doesn’t do much to redeem the damage done by its weak script and sleepy performances.Criticism apart, the books and the movies are equally successful though the meat of the story in all the four books is only good enough for one movie of two hours. But, when the movies are raking in the moolah from ticket sales to souvenirs, owing to its teen craze internationally, why bother to change anyway! Here though, the audience count on a Friday night at a leading multiplex was a mere 14! Definitely not worth it!",3,10,15,14 December 2009
Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi," A potential blockbuster concept spoilt by a half-baked screenplay!
","When King Khan and Aditya Chopra come together, you can be sure about a formulaic high budget feel-good movie that will market itself into a blockbuster. While picturesque locales, expensive sets and tears are usually a must, Rab ne though makes a departure from the first two and delivers the typical family drama that pushed the envelope a bit further. Despite all the benign intentions behind the script, the movie misses the mark.Middle aged Surinder ‘Suri’ Sahni, a square, starring King Khan in an avuncular avatar falls in love with a young and vivacious Taani, the débutante Anushka Sharma. Twists of fate lead them into sudden matrimony. Taani chooses to kill her bubbly self to become a dutiful housewife to her boring cubicle worker hubby. Deep in her mind though, she still craves for filmy romance rendering herself impervious to Suri’s unspoken love for her.‘Dancing Jodi’, a contest comes to town and Taani enrolls herself. Eager to see her happy and bubbly, Suri the square turns into Raj the dude, with a little help from buddy Bobby (Vinay Pathak) to get closer to her. Though a flirtatious brat, Taani seems to like Raj better and the twine plan to elope. But Yash Raj style drama and the concept of seeing ‘Rab’ in the loved one lead the story and the dance contest into a happy ending! The success factor for this flick was to be the middle-class portrayal the multitude could relate to. Per se, SRK does well and so does the fresh and sweet Bangalorean Anushka. So is Vinay Pathak. Despite it all, you can sense a lack of ease of expression in the narrative. The transition from Suri to Raj is unbelievably quick for comfort. A scene with lesson from Bobby to Suri may have helped. Though lengthy, it misses critical points.It’s too funny that Taani fails to recognize her own husband! Agreed, they never spent much time together nor did they consummate their marriage, but the fact that she doesn’t even show surprise at the similarity between the two faces is absurd. If this were shown in a movie that is a silly comedy or is used purely in a dramatic sense, I may have accepted it; but surely not in a movie that is supposed to be an endearing love story.And what was that song with multiple actors all about? Simply passé! Also, Suri’s stance while he receives the end reminded me of the mentally ill character of Rohit in Koi Mil Gaya! Well, there is no reason for Suri to stand like his typical self; he just won the love of his life and should actually look delighted! Among the positives, the song ‘Tujh me rab dikhta hai’ is sweet and continues to play on in your mind much after the movie is over! True, audiences have enjoyed SRK’s contrived stories, especially the likes of OSO. But, while these are the custom made ‘masala’ flicks and thus gain a license to fool you, Rab Ne was supposed to be a plausible drama involving an average middle class man in an arranged marriage. Inconsistencies, clichés and what seems to be a hurriedly written and dated screenplay make this new flick from the DDLJ makers, disappointing!",5,3,11,23 December 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Stands out for Artwork, concept and Brad Pitt’s effort!
","Not all stories flow the same way! This is one curious case where we see the life of the protagonist move backwards. It isn’t really an uncommon feeling for many of us that we don’t really want to age quicker. Also, it is sometimes funny to wonder what the world would feel like if we started growing younger! Believe me, after watching this Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett and Julia Ormond starrer, you’d feel better off living life the normal way.Born an octogenarian geriatric but the size of a baby, little Benjamin is abandoned to the care of an old age home. Unbeknownst to why he looks that way, the growing geriatric thinks that he is one among them, but has the curiosity of a child. Curiously though, as time passes, he doesn’t die as people expect him to but starts getting fitter and younger. The Oscar winning make up guys ensure that Brad Pitt unfolds on screen in a slow flow.Romance too starts there when the blue eyed grand daughter of an old woman arrives to live there. The little girl, played by Dakota Fanning’s sister too seems to recognize that Benjamin is mentally her age. Soon, a teen’s mind and a fitter body takes him places as a member of a tugboat crew where he experiments wine and women, courtesy his Captain. By World War II, he has lived through war and has had his first love in Russia.Returning home, he finds Daisy grown up into Cate Blanchett, a ballet dancer, already in love with another man. Years later and an accident wise, she finds the two to be of the same age; romance blossoms, they live together and have a child. Benjamin realizes that his age trend would make him a playmate to his daughter than a father; he gives up his material wealth, including the old Button wealth for the two and goes globe trotting.Top class art direction, make up and visual effects make the nearly three hour movie a work of art coming live in a believable way but with a touch of fantasy. Spending five hours on make up each day, Brad Pitt fit into his role seamlessly. His acting and his looks during the younger stint deserve a ‘wow’. Cate Blanchett’s act is as impressive as ever. Others like Tilda Swinton and Oscar nominated Taraji Henson stand out too! Well, if the movie is so well made, then why not more points? That’s simply because stories just go on through time on screen and lack the zing somewhere. This reminds me of ‘Bicentennial Man’ that had the accomplished actor Robin Williams playing a robot working its way towards becoming human that also has a similar flow. Putting this aside, I would still safely recommend this movie for its story creativity and visual appeal.",7,1,3,5 March 2009
Million Dollar Baby," Captivating Story and amazing handling of characters and issues
","Plot Outline: Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) a veteran boxing trainer runs a dilapidated gym along with friend Scrap (Morgan Freeman), an ex-boxer who lost his eye fighting. Personally Frankie has suffered estrangement from his daughter, and feigns atheism but has been attending mass for the past 23 years.Then Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank), a struggler requests Frankie to train her. Tired after years and with innate fear of seeing someone fatally injured, Frankie shrugs off Maggie. He tells her that she's too old and he doesn't train girls. But Maggie's determination makes Frankie agree, although grudgingly.The two come to discover a common bond that they share and loss of their families long ago. Comment: The screenplay based upon stories from 'Rope Burns' by FX Toole. The story packs two years of their lives into two hours showing the surrogate father-daughter relationship and personal/professional challenges they undergo.Direction and Acting are simply amazing (4 Oscars prove it). The characterization, plot and handling of touchy issues like euthanasia are neat. This is one movie that reiterates that Hollywood is the mecca for Movies and Superstars!Rating: 4.5/5  Highly recommended.",9,4,6,5 April 2005
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Watching the first movie 'Resident Evil' is a pre-requisite for watching 'Apocalypse'
","Outline (The brief story is for those who haven't seen the first movie, without which they might not understand the second one):In the end of the first movie Resident Evil, we see only two survivors out of the T-virus tragedy at Umbrella Corporation's hi-tech 'Hive' research facility, one of them being Alice (Milla Jovovich). For those who have not seen the first movie, the Hive is the secret underground research facility of the Umbrella Corporation, the world's most powerful commercial organization that specializes in high-end genetic research and mutation. The two survivors have been tested and have been genetically altered to gain superhuman strengths. One of them is Alice, and the other is an armed killing machine, the Nemesis.By the beginning of Apocalypse, we see that the dangerous T-virus that induces people become Zombies is out in the open in Raccoon city. The umbrella corporation loses no time in unlawfully quarantining people and leaving them to the mercy of the T-virus that spreads through zombie bites. What follows then, is a series of mindless adventures.Comment:The movie seems to be a desperate attempt to revive the success of the movie Resident Evil that had raked in a hundred million dollars. A viewer who has previously not seen the first movie would rather feel like running away from the movie hall in the middle of the movie. However, as the movie approaches the end, it gains a little better sense.One of the most seemingly realistic things projected by the film include the dangers of overtly powerful corporations that can threaten the future lives of people with their genetic experiments.Milla Jovovich's performance is purely action oriented and is exponentially better than the earlier movie (thanks to her character 'Alice' becoming genetically powerful). The other performances are just around the average performance that you would see in a usual Hollywood sci-fi thriller.Bottomline: If possible, please leave your brains outside the theatre entrance. Else, you might become a T-virus carrier Zombie ;)",3,2,8,7 December 2004
Paranormal Activity," Commendable effort & realistic feel; nothing too scary!
","This was supposed to be a movie that scared many in the Western world. If you have seen those advertisements, you can’t miss the audience yelling in theatres. But for all its hype as a realistic scary movie, honestly I wasn’t scared one bit watching this one. The likes of “Ring” or “Grudge” and their sequels were far scarier actually.The story is about a young couple Micah (Micah Sloat) and Katie (Katie Featherson) who seem to be experiencing the paranormal in their house. Strange footsteps, banging on doors, faucets and lights going on and off doors opening and closing by themselves compel Micah to capture it on camera to better understand the events.What is worth appreciating is that it has entirely been shot on Handy-cam on a shoe-string budget of USD 15,000. Having already become a successful, the ROI figures would have just gone tizzy. As long as you don’t mind the shaky & grainy pictures and unedited sound buzz and that you only see 6 human faces throughout its near 90 minute runtime, it oozes of creativity and confidence and it scared people too! So, what makes Paranormal Activity work? It’s the thought of just two people living all alone in a luxuriously huge American house. People can relate to Micah and Katie who are not stars but just commoners; the idea is to make audience feel “hey, it could’ve been us”. Then comes the western obsession with exorcism, ouija boards and yeah ‘demonologists’ to solve their problems despite their tech advances! I was told that this was to be boring in the beginning with scariness picking up slowly as the story progresses. But, barring those odd scenes of doors moving and strange sounds punctuating it, you wait endlessly for something concrete. When something really happens towards the end, you’re done with your endurance. I saw two of its 3 alternate endings, which were at best unsetting, but not unexpected.There is however no worthwhile explanation offered for the phenomena happening there and you have to be content with the abrupt ending leaving you tad cheated. And No, it’s not a real story; but, director Oran Peli has definitely made a wonderful effort at keeping it realistic. Ah yes, you have to give it to the director for casting the duo who have such great chemistry. And what more, Sloat doubles up as cameraman too! If this movie doesn’t work in India, I won’t really be surprised. In countries like ours, the sheer number of people living in a neighborhood can scare ghosts away! But, if you’re looking for a break from the lame Bollywood fare of this week, try this flick. But yeah, if are a tad weak hearted for horror or sleep alone at home, better beware!",5,0,1,10 January 2010
The Hangover Part II," Lazy piece of work that reeks of mediocrity
","Precisely two years ago, 'The Hangover' had swept the audience off their feet with its cleverly written humor and making a sequel is a humongous challenge. But Todd Phillips and his team seem to have run out of ideas and merely copy-pasted the first film. Essentially, the cast and the conflict are retained and only the setting is changed.So, what are the changes? Vegas tuns into Bangkok; the tiger is now a drug dealing monkey; instead of the groom, the bride's teenage brother goes missing; it's an old monk instead of an abandoned baby; Stu falls for a stripper then, now err, ahem, let's leave it unsaid; Stu's girlfriend was mean back then and it's his father-in-law belittling him now; spiked drink then, drugged marshmallows now; the list is endless.Stu is all set to be married to Lauren (Jamie Chung) in Bangkok. Not wanting to face another disaster, Stu limits the celebrations to a bachelor brunch and keeps Alan away, only letting him in later, albeit reluctantly. After a 'just one drink' night by the bonfire, the suddenly wake up in a seedy hotel in Bankok's by-lanes. Like the first film, the rest of the story is about finding their friend and making it to the wedding.Those who have seen the first will find nothing new in the second and newbies may miss out on humor having roots in the original. The film does have some genuinely funny moments, like Alan's dinner speech and Stu's song on the boat, but those come between long lulls. The lack of surprise is covered up with explicit scenes and dark stuff like chopped fingers and a guy losing pulse that are unfunny.The cast is the same and their roles don't change much. Zach Galifianakis as Alan, the weirdo is still the star, but hasn't he become predictable? Remember his similar role in 'Due Date', again by the same director? Bradley Cooper continues as the more balanced Phil and Ed Helms is still a wimp who manages a show of temper towards the end. Ken Jeong has a bigger role as Mr Chow that has been played over the top.Even if the movie makers were granted a benefit of doubt that the audience expected too much, it doesn't absolve them of the responsibility to come up with something good. They could have experimented with Doug in a bigger role or getting Alan married. And Bangkok is not 'some Asian city' as they call it when it is a bustling metropolis.Per se, it doesn't really hurt to watch it since it's better than many brain-dead comedies. But in giving it a chance, you could be flirting with disappointment.",4,6,13,30 May 2011
Pride & Prejudice," Feels like reading a Book out of Georgian England on Big Screen
","Plot Outline: The story is based on Jane Austen's classic love story set in 18th century England, the family of Bennets including five daughters whose future is dependent on finding well-settled husbands. The Bennets brush with high society sophistication when the eldest (Rosamund Pike) is to be engaged to a wealthy Mr. Bingley whose friends include the wealthy, handsome and snobbish Mr. Darcy. The unfolding drama portrays pride, judgmental reactions and finding real love in the perspective of the beautiful and individualistic Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightley).Comment: The thought of watching a classic had made me initially apprehensive about watching the movie. But as soon as the characters of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth start taking life, it is difficult not to get absorbed into the story. Although I haven't read Jane Austen, I must say that the screenplay is excellent and captures 18th Century England, its picturesque landscapes and formal societies well. Elizabeth is the strongest character of the movie and Keira Knighley has done a wonderful job although de-glamorized.The movie has a lot of noteworthy moments; especially the comical one's involving the poor Mr. Collins and the exchange of words between the Bennett parents. Rosamund Pike looks lovely and Keira character also considering the fact that she is 20 something is intriguing and absorbing and is the protagonist of the story. Mcfadyen has done justice to the role of Mr. Darcy a true blue-blooded gentleman. The movie is recommended for those who love well-made classics or even for just watching Keira Knighley.Rating: 7/10",7,0,1,2 March 2006
Elysium," Stupid film with one-dimensional characters
","Going by the standard Neill Blomkamp set in the Academy Award nominated 'District 9', his new offering 'Elysium' is a massive let down. While the earlier film had the powerful undercurrent of racism in South Africa, Elysium's attempt to take on the rich-poor divide comes across as flawed and executed without much thought.Since, I really don't predict many people watching this after reading this, I thought of using some liberty to include spoilers in the review. Here it goes:In the year 2154 (incidentally the same year that 'Avatar' is set in), Earth has become overpopulated, polluted and disease ridden. The elite have since escaped to a space-station style colony leaving the poor in a state of appalling health-care and sanitation standards while they dream of illegal immigration to 'Elysium'.The protagonist of the story is Max Da Costa (Matt Damon), ex-convict on parole works for a company that makes robots and dreams of saving up to buy a ticket to Elysium. Things get rough after he is exposed to radiation while at work and has only five days to live. He then urges Spider, someone who arranges illegal ships to get him there, in exchange of one last con job, that turns out to be the keys to the kingdom.Meanwhile on Elysium, Secretary of Defense Delacourt (Jodie Foster) rules with an iron hand, much to the disapproval of the rest of the administration. That includes using illegal agents to shoot down spacecraft intruding into Elysium air-space. She then urges a corporate honcho Carlyle to build an illegal program that will install her as President. It is this very program that Max unwittingly ends up stealing from Carlyle.The film tells us very little about the people in Elysium except that they are on a perpetual holiday. The film makes it appear as if anyone having access to the main program running the system, runs the Elysium and concordantly, all human population. Preposterous! And does it take only a computer program to bring down an administration? So, you see, the audience wouldn't care a damn about Elysium folks.What about earthlings then? That too, hardly evokes sympathy! In Max's neighborhood, he seems to be the only who cares about working in a proper job. So, what were the others doing? Busy enhancing the population? The view from space shows that the land surface of the planet had lost its greenery. So, how were the people still alive? Didn't the climate change affect the weather or crops?Sometimes, the portrayal of earth, with the burgeoning population and issues like crumbling health-care & sanitation shown in the film, in some way would remind you of how India could look like within a few years if the population kept growing at the current rate and with the rich-poor divide continuing to widen. Shocking nonetheless!The film is so poorly written that one hardly feels for any of its characters or care about what they seek to represent. Our hero's only motivation to reach Elysium is to fulfill his dream and the urgency comes because he is about to die. And what was Alice Braga's silly role in it? One can remember her equally pointless role in the futuristic 'Repo Men'. And Max's conversation with Braga's kid seems forced.There are numerous other inconsistencies, like how Max recovers from his injuries, and then the exoskeleton being bolted to his body using big screws and then being stabbed by a knife during fights. He seemed more like Terminator rather than a real human. And he carries the program in chip attached to his head. Duh!Joining Foster & Damon in the wasted actors list is Sharlto Copley who played the lead actor in 'District 9'. He plays the mercenary, Kruger. His character seems to have a sudden transition from an illegal, later disavowed mercenary to a President hopeful. What a sudden transition! Surely, this bit could have done with some improvement.The only thing a movie like this can brag about is special effects and some cool gadgets. The car-like space shuttles are so quick, compact and convenient, powerful weapons that are exceedingly compact. But this is hardly adequate to save the film.And lastly, let's talk about the ending: The reprogrammed code now considers all Earthlings as citizens and the system dispatches them medical facilities so that they too can live forever, and that too disease free! And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how the film ends! Seriously, that's their hare-brained plot. What a waste of time and money!!Verdict: Elysium may have bagged good ratings; but, please don't get carried away by it. Even if you are in the mood to leave your brain back home in the refrigerator, this film can still irritate you and make you feel like walking out in between. Avoidable!",3,1,3,30 September 2013
Avatar," I’m Speechless! Simply redefines cinematic experience!
","First, he gave us slimy “Aliens” that Sigourney Weaver battled hard as Ripley. Then the cult hit “Terminator” that created a new benchmark for science fiction and followed it up with the smash hit sequel “Terminator 2: Judgment Day” which initiated many in my generation to Sci-Fi and admiration of Hollywood. “Titanic” mesmerized fans of both SFX and Romance genres while it pushed the envelope for elaborate production design.More than 12 years after “Titanic” comes the most awaited movie of the recent years “Avatar” in which James Cameron has created a whole new Planet Pandora replete with new creatures, predators and humanoid aliens that in every way are beautiful! Well, it did cost him more than 300 million USD to make it and another 100 spent on promotion, but the spectacle that you see on the gigantic IMAX screen in 3D is beyond words!! Set in 2154 and 4 light years away, humans are now exploiting ‘Pandora’ an earth-like moon orbiting a gas giant in Alpha Centauri for an expensive and rare mineral appropriately called ‘unobtanium’. Coming in their way are the indigenous Na’vi who need to be relocated from their ‘home-tree’ that sits on a deposit of unobtainium.RDA, the company has already tried its best to convince the Na’vi to move. They have taught them English and tried offering infrastructure. But, being content in their natural settings, the Na’vi have no interest in what the humans have to offer. English plus business: doesn’t this remind you of European colonization in some sort? The air on Pandora is toxic to humans necessitating the wearing of gas masks outdoors. To get around this, the researchers led by Dr Grace Augustine played by good old Sigourney Weaver have developed an alien-human hybrid ‘Avatar’ that can be mentally controlled by the brain of the person whose DNA was used to build it. Here, the idea of jacking into a computer generated digital-self will surely remind you of “The Matrix”!The death of his researcher brother in the Avatar program leads to his paraplegic ex-Marine brother Jake Sully joining up the Avatar program. Played by Sam Worthington of Terminator Salvation fame, Jake is happy using his Avatar that gets him to use his legs. Soon, he befriends the tree living Na’vi and its huntress princess Neytiri. Learning their ways during the day, Jake returns to debrief his trigger-happy boss, Colonel Quaritch.Soon Jake begins to appreciate the harmony and spiritual connection the Na’vi have with nature and falls in love with Neytiri, much to the dismay of Quaritch who attacks the home-tree. Though the script was written a decade ago, I believe Cameron has subtly hit out at the recent American battles for oil that the administration justified in dubious ways. For those who say the script is poor, take this quote from Jake Sully “When people are sitting on stuff you want, you make them your enemy”. Thought provoking indeed! Visual effects are Avatar’s forte as it creates a new world before you. Filmed in blank sets with motion capture, the actors had to act out without ever knowing what it would look like on screen. Sensors on the Actors’ body and spots on their faces picked up moves and emotions bringing the CGI characters to life. To bring his actors up to speed, Cameron took them to jungles in Hawaii to bring them up to speed on jungle life. 60% of Avatar is CGI with only 40% being real footage. What you’re left with is a WOW! While you may not see Zoe Saldana as Neytiri anywhere in its 162 minutes, the nimble ballet trained actor worked hard to make her character so endearing and realistic. The scenes where she trains Jake in the art of war are its best, be it bonding with the Ikran that seems like a flyer straight from ‘Jurassic Park’ or riding Pa’li the hairless horse.The biggest blame that Avatar can take is that its story is too predictable. Man recruited to fight, falls for the local culture and turns his guns around; just as you saw in “The Last Samurai”. But, making Avatar cool are its special effects that seem so real in IMAX 3D.Emotion seekers and script blamers can’t really deny the story’s soft side when you see the Na’vi suffer human attack and they die fighting for nature we have scant respect for. For one, Na’vi lived for everything we don’t. Politically too, the battle takes a dig on the suffering the Native Red Indians went through in the country that Hollywood comes from.On Music, James Horner’s score doesn’t really stand out and has his ‘Troy’-esque feel. Probably, a score that doesn’t stick out as a sore thumb is good enough in a movie that’s all about special effects. As for Cameron and Horner, this is their third venture together after ‘Aliens’ and ‘Titanic’ with the latter giving him his first and only Oscar honors.As a director, James Cameron doesn’t need a critic’s recommendation. He dropped out of college and drove trucks, but Cameron is the super benchmark movie maker with truly gifted imagination and commitment to translate his dreams to the screen. You simply can’t ask for more from a sci-fi movie at least for a few more years to come! The least I can do with my review is to give it a 10/10. What are you waiting for? Go pull out your newspapers or log on to the web, check show times for 3D and book your tickets now! An IMAX would be even better. Believe me, it’s a bang for your buck!",10,40,66,21 December 2009
3 Idiots," Intelligent Script plus Munnabhai-esquire fun = a sure entertainer
","Coming from the director of the “Munnabhai” series, on the face of it, 3 idiots is a complete 'paisa vasool' (value for money) comedy. As with his earlier flicks, it has benign intentions at heart, and some lessons for the system. Vis-à-vis a goon do-gooder there, you have an enigmatic genius here who seems turn everything that he touches into gold; which includes smiles, encouragement, healing, love, creativity, tears and some hard lessons.The system under attack here is similar to that in Aamir’s previous masterpiece “Tare Zameen Par”: Education as he steps up his ire from schools to professional colleges that emphasize on cramming and bagging ranks. One of the gags says: “if you don't run, you'll be like a broken anda (egg)”. Facing the attack is the fictional Imperial College of Engineering, modeled on the famed IITs and shot on campus at IIM Bangalore.Drawing inspiration from Chetan Bhagat’s ‘5 point someone’, it tracks the lives of its 3 protagonists Ranchhoddas Chanchad or Rancho (Aamir Khan), Farhan Qureshi (R Madhavan) and Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) through their college days, their battles with the dictatorial Director Viru Sahasrabuddhe or ViruS (Boman Irani) and a dabbles into Rancho’s love interest and ViruS’ daughter and a doctor, Pia (Kareena Kapoor).3 Idiots also tackles issues such as pursuing a stream of education against one’s own creative interests or heart’s calling, teaching a hard lesson to ragging seniors and an odd lesson to slimy nerds. While he goes about things, he gets Pia to fall for him too. Rancho’s bold methods irk ViruS, the similar antagonist from Hirani’s Munnabhai. Of course, as must all movies end, Rancho opens up ViruS’ eyes towards the end.The funniest scene in undoubtedly is the one involving Rancho modifying Chatur’s speech. While it had to praise ViruS for his ‘chamatkar’ (miracles) in the college, the modified ‘balatkar’ (rape) brings out the reality. With Omi Vaidya delivering it to rote perfection, you’d be rolling on the floor laughing. Here, don’t also miss Hirani’s lesson that mugging up without understanding is ‘balatkar’ of knowledge.While it’s not all perfect, there are times when the drama is overdone, especially the delivery scene on a TT table! But considering its other goodies, overlooking this is quite easy. The best goodie comes in the form of editing wherein it weaves the past and present events as Farhan and Raju accompanied by a vengeful Chatur try to unearth the whereabouts of the ‘real’ Rancho who disappeared during the convocation.Aamir Khan is synonymous with quality films. It’s another thing though that I found last year’s 'Ghajini” purely average and it turned out to be a hit. But, with 3 Iditots, his sole release for this year, Aamir, in my reckoning is back to his glory days of “Tare Zameen Par”. If the rave reviews and BO collections are to be believed, 3 idiots is a Smash-Hit. If you have still not seen this meaningful laugh riot, rush now for a bite of its 'gyaan' (wisdom).",8,1,6,6 January 2010
In Time," Mixes Robin Hood theme with portrayal of time as money
","The old adage that says 'Time is Money' is literally brought to life in the Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried starrer 'In Time' that is set in a dystopian future where all human beings have been genetically altered to stop aging after turning 25.While the idea of staying young forever could be alluring, it comes at a cost. As soon as one turns 25, the timer on the arm starts counting backwards giving them just a year to live. Any more longevity needs to be earned. Since time is literally money, people pay in time, like four minutes for a cup of coffee and earn wages in time.The poor live in ghettos and always have few hours or minutes left to live and they battle for survival against rising costs and taxes. Anyone having more time is robbed by gangsters called Minutemen. Meanwhile, the rich live in elitist New Greenwich and have thousands of years in their account. The barriers between them are justified by Darwinism and are guarded by futuristic police called Timekeepers. Set in such conditions, 'In Time' is somewhat based on Robin Hood's story where the protagonist Will Salas (Timberlake) believes that there is time for everyone to live and no one should really live forever. When someone rich donates his years to Will and times himself out to die, Will heads towards New Greenwich. Meanwhile, Will is suspected of murder and is chased by timekeeper Raymond (Cillian Murphy).If our hero with a deadpan expression has to keep his audience interested, he needs an arm-candy; enter Sylvia Weis (Seyfried), the daughter of a wealthy time-lender whom Will eventually steals from. The film also has some action and special effects, some of which are especially tacky like the car crash which is a case in point.The whole idea of idea of casting everyone as 25 year olds in the film seems to be done mostly with a view to bring younger audiences to the movies. This was exactly what the 'Twilight' franchise played on. Now do you notice the connection? For the starcast, Timberlake is not entirely convincing, Amanda Seyfriend isn't glamor material. Cillian Murphy's performance as the antagonist is an exception.In a way the movie is a take on immortal youth and its flipside. While the idea itself is not bad, it leaves gaping plot-holes as to how every single human is genetically engineered and there is not a single person living normally without the countdown timer on his hand. Meanwhile the future world is portrayed with a retro touch.Coming from director Andrew Niccol who has made films like 'Gattaca', 'The Terminal' and 'The Truman Show', 'In Time' is a let down. Contrary to the usual cinematic theme of the protagonist always being right, here, Will Salas is misguided. Not worthwhile!",3,0,3,9 November 2011
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Great star-cast but screenplay falls flat.
","Plot Outline: Six years after marriage John (Pitt) and Jane (Jolie) Smiths are bored of each other. The marriage counseling too seems to fail. Unknown to each other, they lead secret lives as contract killers. The drama unfolds as they discover that their next target is their spouse.Comment: Although the plot outline and the trailers seem enticing, the biggest attraction for this movie is its star-cast. However, as the movie unfolds, it feels that it there is a void in the story-telling. The vacuum increases as the movie progresses. Some of the SFX are not up to the mark. The best of Gen-next gizmos are shown with Jolie's team on the screen as they zero in on their next targets.The only reprieve in the movie is the slick action sequences and the ready to kill looks of the stars. Jolie looks fine, but die hard fans might not find her as alluring as she was in Alexander. Nevertheless, Pitt compensates for her. Go for this movie if you have nothing else to do on the weekend.Rating: 2/5",4,5,10,13 June 2005
War of the Worlds," Alas, a Hollywood movie where American’s are not the Saviors
","Plot Outline: Ray Ferrier (Cruise) is a dockworker who’s a failure in his family life. One day, things change when strange lightning flashes storm the earth and huge Alien Tripods emerge from beneath the earth incinerating the place. The film portrays an average earthling ‘Ray’ and his kids Robbie and Rachel in their flight for safety.Comment: The story is the HG Wells classic retold to suit moviegoers. When I skimmed through the pages of this classic, I was overawed by Wells’ futuristic perspectives in a story written more than 115 years ago! The film is simple storytelling from a commoner’s viewpoint, unlike Independence Day or its kind which typically show American sophistication, a brave-heart president and wild gadgets.Although the perspective is well presented, the simplicity of Ray’s character and lack of typical gadgetry marks a lack-of-pace beginning; but later picks up in the later half. Performances do not leave much for discussion either. What defines the movie is neat SFX which makes it recommended for audiences thirsty for SFX flicks.",4,1,3,26 December 2008
Hancock," Nice new theme; but the handling could have surely been better!
","Looks like we have been having a deluge of superheroes off late; while Superman, Batman & Spiderman have lived well for long on large screen and in our memories, Fantastic Four, Iron man, etc made good entries; cat woman and other pretenders came too. Hancock is the new kid on the block. Unkempt, drunk and lost, but with immense powers, invulnerability, immortality and a good heart characterize the protagonist here.Not being the typical superhero, John Hancok saves lives, but unintentionally creates civic losses running into millions which leads to disdain for him among locals and the authorities. Just when he is busy doing his usual stuff, he saves a struggling PR agent from a sure death. The latter then offers his services to Hancock to make him acceptable to the society, much to the displeasure of his wife. Hancock too reluctantly accepts.Hancock then learns his ways from Ray, the PR guy and works towards making himself acceptable to the society. But things take a strange turn when he starts to feel long lost things about Ray’s wife Mary who then reveals that they were angels created in pairs and that they lose powers and be mortal if they got close. She begs him to leave her so that he can do the world good. Oh well, they had to show some vulnerability, right? Hancock is a very short a film at 80 minutes, which makes you feel as if you flew through it. You barely realize that the story is going somewhere, and lo, you have an interval break. The rest of the movie finishes in a flash. I really don’t call this piece of work as ‘tight screenplay’ as some may do. On the tech stuff, though it had its share of action sequences, the camera work and the SFX don’t seem too convincing.With Will Smith, this year’s earning actor according to Forbes can surely bring in the draw at the box office. Surely, he has the charm in him that makes you feel for a character who is so clumsy for a large part of the film and usually messes up stuff. Charlize Theron, well, at first I wondered ‘what’s she doing in here?’ till the time it is revealed that she too is Hancock type. Phew; the story gets tiresome after that! The villains too weren’t really imposing enough to really challenge someone who is shown a superhero. The editing feels as if someone wanted to hurriedly wrap up. The script begins with a promise but makes you feel that there was a lot of room for improvement. Despite it having brilliant leads in Will Smith and older but is still lovely Theron, it falls flat. Surely, I wouldn’t recommend that you burn your bucks on this!",4,4,7,24 July 2008
The Lion King," A fine animated story with lively characters and lovely music!
","One of those 90’s classics that I had enjoyed during my schooldays was a beauty to watch again recently. Though the story is just an odd family drama where the less capable brother overthrows the king by deceit while his son runs away; only to return years later to undo the injustice and regain his throne. Where “Lion King” excels is getting this story out of animated animals and put in a way that kids would love.Pride Rock in Africa is where the earth is green and animals live in peace in the reign of the great lion Mufasa (James Earl Jones) who is assisted by an old wise monkey Rafiki and a loyal bird Zazu (Rowan Atkinson). Plotting with the hyenas, Scar (Jeremy Irons) causes a wildebeest stampede and kills Mufasa while Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas/ Matthew Broderick) takes the blame for putting his father in fatality’s way.Consequently, Simba runs away to a distant land where he grows up in the company of Timon, a meerkat and Pumba a warthog, characters so lively that their “Hakuna Matata”, the no-worry song is one of its biggest hits with its infectious positivity. In a chance encounter with his former playmate and destined lover Nala reminds him of his unfinished business at home. Wiser now, Simba returns to claim his due!Made in times that can nostalgically be remembered as the days when animation still had the old artistic beauty with just the right mix of CGI. “Beauty and the Beast” and “Anastasia” too come from a similar time and won accolades for their Music. Though its sequels or games weren’t too appealing, the original is still a masterpiece. You can’t just miss those adorable characters, each filled with life and character! No description of “Lion King” can be complete without a befitting praise to its songs. While Hans Zimmer won the Oscar for the best score, Elton John’s Can You Feel the Love Tonight in the credits is its best song. The judicious mix of African vocals in “Circle of Life” the deep darkness of “Be Prepared” and childish fun of “Can’t wait to be king” keep ringing much after the movie is over and even after years pass by! With its short runtime of just over an hour, it doesn’t take away much of your time but doesn’t at all fail to take you into itself. Neatly edited, there is never a time that you get bored with it. Though technology has moved light years after Lion King, I’d still say that if you have missed watching it back then, better run and grab the DVD!",8,2,2,10 January 2010
Prometheus," Totally confused plot that leaves you yawning!
","In theory, 'Prometheus' should have been an engaging sci-fi film. It had none less than Ridley Scott, the creator of the original 1979 'Alien' and it sought to find answers to intriguing questions about humanity's origins and had talented actors like Michael Fassbender and Charlize Theron. But alas, the result is totally unimpressive. The film opens with a sequence where a proto-humanoid alien drinks a mysterious potion and disintegrates into a waterfall just as a spacecraft hovers away. Cut to late 21st century, archaeologists discover a cave painting of a star map. Cut to two years hence, we are aboard a spaceship named 'Prometheus' in search of a superior race on a mysterious planet as they believe that these aliens 'engineered' humans. Funded by a rich old man Peter Wayland (Guy Pearce) and under the watchful eye of Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) the chief crew members are archaeologist and lead character Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace), Pilot Captain Janek (Idris Elba) and a curious android David (Michael Fassbender). What happens to the crew when they land on a mysterious satellite to a planet forms the plot of the film. While the thought of traveling through space is an exciting proposition in itself, the crew members of 'Prometheus' seem so disinterested. They wear an expression as if they were woken up from a night long bus journey from Mumbai to Hyderabad. What's worse is that nobody remembers a thing about why they are on that trip till the briefing! And who are these crew members? They are a motley bunch of 17 so called specialists who aren't introduced to one another despite being on an expensive inter-galactic project. Were they recruited in 'stasis' mode? And there's a guy who snaps back when a crew member says a customary 'Hello'. Would someone really behave so badly when they are a small isolated team light years away from earth?Logically, any expedition is bound to follow certain protocols and chain of command. But here, we have people who behave like school kids on a picnic and a couple of them want to walk back to the ship! If they are so disinterested, why did they sign up in the first place? We're talking about a geologist who is not bothered about alien rocks and a biologist who wants to pet an alien snake-like thing and gets killed doing so!The mother of all goofs is when Shaw undergoes abdominal surgery in an automated machine. One moment, she is writhing in pain having her wounds stapled like paper and within no time is up and running all over the place! How can that be even remotely possible? Even when she shows up with blood all over, the remaining crew members are not surprised at all and are not even bothered to ask what happened. The only saving grace is some good acting by Fassbender. The scene where the sentient robot passes time reading dreams of those in stasis, learning languages, playing solo games, etc., is simply fascinating. While it portrays loneliness in space, it effectively introduces the spaceship to the audience. It is the film's best scene. But the promising start withers away when the crew wakes up from stasis. One may argue that movies are all about entertainment and one must leave their brains back home in a freezer. Such assumptions hold true for bollywood's assembly line comedies. But, logical inconsistencies are unpardonable when the creator of 'Alien' series is the one wielding the megaphone. Just what were you thinking Ridley Scott? C'mon, stereoscopic 3D cannot make up for a poor script. It's a let down.",2,49,94,13 June 2012
X-Men: First Class," Quality acting and a fresh story!
","The success of the prequel, X-Men Origins: Wolverine in 2009 seems to have prompted the movie makers to shift focus to prequels. In First Class, the story goes back even further and traces the lives of Professor-X/ Charles Xavier and Magneto/ Erik Lehnsherr, their friendship and their eventual fallout. Although the X-Men trilogy had done good business in the last decade, prolonging the same would have meant more battles between Xavier's X-men and Magneto's Brotherhood of mutants on their differences on how to deal with humans. But, in a prequel, the story can be altered; which is conveniently explained as a 'reboot'. The film introduces us to young Erik Lenhsherr who loses his parents during the holocaust. The rage triggers his mutant powers of magnetism which the Nazis seek to tame. Cut to his adulthood, a grown up Erik (Michael Fassbender) seeks revenge. Simultaneously, we are shown Charles Xavier's (James McAvoy) opulent childhood, his gift for mind-control and growing up with Raven/ Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence).Set in the 60's during the Cuban missile crisis, it involves a fictional plot with Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) who is keen to trigger World War III and usher in a mutant rule. We are shown that Shaw was formerly the German official who spotted Erik's powers and is a mutant supervillian. The CIA seeks Xavier's help to tackle Shwaw. Erik and Xavier's paths converge as they join hands to thwart Shaw. In a way, the story belongs to Magneto. He's not shown to be a villain but someone who carries scars of the holocaust which, in a way, has desensitized him from connecting with humans. Fassbender's lone-wolf portrayal, Machiavellian approach, styling and a Cold War backdrop bear an uncanny resemblance to James Bond flicks. Needless to say, he's done exceedingly well to carry off his role.James McAvoy is credible as the mentor to his creed and also helping Erik harness his powers sans rage. Curiously, barring Xavier's British accent, none of the others, especially Erik & Shaw seem to speak with an accent reflecting their ancestry. Other characters like Raven, Emma Frost or Hank had the potential but weren't emphasized. As much as the story took its liberties, the end couldn't have been anything else. Magneto had to turn against humans and Xavier had to end up in a wheelchair. The problem is that the ending looks rushed and hardly spends much time on the 'why' of things, and that too parting ways when their mentor, Xavier was badly hit.First Class also differs from its predecessors since it doesn't rely excessively on special effects or high octane thrills associated with this genre. Still, it has people flying, disappearing, a bit of fire, ships and people levitated, etc., all without a minute being wasted. It offers enough to satiate action-hungry fans. In all, it's a worthwhile watch.",7,6,9,14 June 2011
Casino Royale," The new Bond falls short of filling the shoes of Connery or Brosnan
","It had been a long wait for a Bond movie after Die Another Day four years ago. After Pierce Brosnan had done his job deftly and established himself possibly as the best Bond after Sean Connery, newcomer Daniel Craig had very big shoes to fill. Four years had raised the expectations and the fact that this movie is the last of the Fleming originals to be screened made the wait even more difficult. Well, who knew that this would be a forgettable flick for the Bond Fans! Casino Royale, incidentally the first Bond story is being rehashed after there were 20 predecessors. Here, bond is introduced as a new promotee to '00' status. Tracking terrorists leads him to many operators and then to their banker Le Chiffre who bet in the stock market just went bad is planning to raise $150Mn in a poker game. MI6 assigns 007 to play the game with a view that if Le Chiffre lost, his clients would hunt him down. He is joined in his mission by the pretty government agent Vesper Lynd.To begin with Casino Royale had a bad script. No, I aren't pointing fingers at Fleming who gave to the world the larger than life bond, but the scriptwriters who modified it to suit the present world, i.e., post cold-war and post 9/11 terrorist attacks, the writers have definitely forgotten to keep the story in track. Firstly, a story of a card game makes the story devoid of gadgets & guns. Secondly, too much of romance is injurious to the image of the Bond we all know. Third, a mix-up of these two leaves the story nowhere. Music sucks too! The signature Bond tune of Monty Norman was grossly missing too! Coming to the New Bond, the rugged & blonde Bond, I felt he was a let down from all the earlier Bonds who were stylish and smooth operators with both gadgets & women. True, Craig has a better chiseled body than his older counterparts, but did the producers miss out that brawn over brain doesn't make a Bond. I guess there are numerous other men in Hollywood with a similar body and better looks. Why only Daniel Craig; Plain luck? Well this movie has a rating of 8.2 on IMDb, highest rating for a Bond flick, the closest being 7.8 for Connery's Goldfinger. Well, if it's working this well at the BO, I'm sure there must be many who must have liked Bond's ruggedness, his skills without the assistance of gadgets or just his body or the romance element! I don't know what to say. The discerning audience needs to rethink before they dish out their cash to see this flick!",6,3,7,23 November 2006
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Wins you over with its narrative; a must watch!
","Though having been a movie buff for a long time, I hadn’t watched much of Woody Allen’s movies till recently when “Vicky Cristina Barcelona” was telecast on Zee Studio that opened my eyes to this gem of a movie and the great man behind it. It went without saying that I followed this up watching “Match Point”, “Scoop” and “Hollywood Ending”. The sheer beauty of storytelling without the frills runs through them all.In this movie, he dissects relationships and lays bare the feelings, physical, emotional and circumstantial that affects romance. The trick is to watch it without making value judgments. Love could blossom in the most unpredictable situations and between unlikely partners. And, in the end, it could all be just so transient! Set in a summer at Barcelona, the story traces the two months spent by two friends Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson). While Vicky is interested in Catalan culture in which she was doing her masters, Cristina looked for a change of scenery after giving up on a short film and breaking up with a boyfriend. Despite similar views on most issues, the duo had absolutely divergent views on love! The girls bump into an artist Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) at an art gallery. Later at dinner he propositions them for a weekend of fun at Oviedo. Shot to precision, this is my favorite scene. As the offer is made, the two girls react differently. While Cristina finds Juan Antonio interesting, Vicky detests the idea of following him to Oviedo. But, strange as things turn out, Vicky and Juan Antonio make love eventually.Vicky is drawn to the artist who still loves his ex-wife Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz, Oscar winner for a Supporting role) who believes that only unfulfilled love can be romantic and had stabbed Juan Antonio. As the days pass, Cristina and Juan Antonio’s are in love and start living together. Vicky then gets married to Doug, her betrothed but her life has changed forever after what she’d experienced in Oviedo.Maria Elena re-enters the scene. Though having gone green over Juan Antonio initially, Cristina and Maria Elena start their own romance with Antonio joining in later. They discover that Cristina was the missing ingredient in their romance. Though the going is good, Cristina is soon over with Juan Antonio and Maria Elena and falls out. Vicky then tries to take Cristina’s place and ends up getting shot.In the end, the girls Vicky and Cristina leave Spain, Vicky back to Doug and Cristina back to nowhere ad the artist couple break up. All are back where they started. And you are left wiser to world cinema. Well, if you wondered why Barcelona? The city offered to support the budget if it were short there. Hence, Woody Allen’s original draft for San Francisco was changed to fit Barcelona. The result is a masterpiece.The story, screenplay and performances are amazing. The Oscar wins and nominations say enough already. It’s a testimony to the superiority of art over high budgets. If you are in a mood for some classy cinema, I recommend this for your DVD collection.",8,2,5,10 January 2010
Munich," Meaningful movie but dragged to the limit of patience!
","Steven Spielberg's name on the promos initially seemed like a stamp of quality. But soon, my curiosity faded when Munich which munched on and on for nearly three hours which really let me down. But, it's not too bad either. The gusto with which the movie begins makes it seem like re-creation of an action flick from history. The impeccable Spielberg stuff is seen in the film's technical stuff which can transport a viewer to the 1970's and makes one empathize the deaths of the athletes at the games.Munich is the story of the aftermath of 11 Israeli athletes being killed by a Palestinian terrorist group called Black September during the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. Four Agents of Mossad which is the Israeli version of CIA are under the leadership of Avner, (played by Eric Bana better known for his role as Hector in Troy) are sent for assassination of those responsible for the Munich massacre in what was historically called the 'Operation Wrath of God'. These men who are chosen by the Prime Minister Golda Meir herself are to leave their families for an indefinite time till their job is done.The movie shows some gruesome assassinations and the errors that they make which actually make the movie far more realistic than the usual smooth action flicks. You see, Spielberg had a historical story to stick to. But in his eagerness to portray the feelings of the protagonist about the assassinations and his pining for his family, the movie was at least stretched by 20 minutes. The worst thing is that the movie's best points are made in those stretched parts. This one is only for those who love watching slow movies.Rating: 6/10",6,1,5,27 April 2006
The Hangover Part III," Befitting Finale to the trendsetter theme
","The Wolf Pack is Back! Four years after the 2009 film 'The Hangover' that set the trend of bachelors party gone awry, which was in turn copy- pasted in a Bangkok sequel in 2011; now comes the grand finale to the trilogy! Contrary to what one would expect, the story has no bachelor parties, no one gets drugged or goes missing and there are no tigers or monkeys. Just the good old bunch of three best friends reprising their roles and the amusingly criminal Chow.The film opens with Chow staging a prison break in Bangkok. Cut to Alan who off his meds and letting his mind take off on its own as he grabs headlines for causing a highway accident. His stressed father passes away and his family decides to put Alan into a rehab in Arizona. Obviously, the duty falls on Phil, Stu & Doug to drive him there. Enroute, they are intercepted by a drug lord Marshall and Doug is taken hostage. In return, they are told to find Chow and retrieve the gold that the latter stole from Marshall. The film then turns into an adventure-comedy as they find Chow and participate in a heist, which predictably goes wrong. Since we know that the other films in the series have happy endings, the third one too ends with everyone being happy. But, it is the journey that makes the film interesting. While not being an outright comedy, it dabbles with deliberate drama to deviate from the predictable styles which marred the second film. And they succeed at that.Shock value, which was the key theme in the series has also been toned down. There are no mind-numbing 'Oh My God moments' like the photographs in the credits we are used to either. By the way, if it is not much of a spoiler, Alan finds his true love in the end! But well, yeah, be prepared for one surprise from Stu in the end. With the same star cast, the acting efforts are the same and convincing enough. Zach Galifianakis is definitely the funniest of them all, playing the man-child we are so used to seeing him as. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms & Ken Jeong as Phil, Stu & Chow do a good job. But, it would have been a nice experiment a bigger role for Justin Bartha and allow his character to develop. And, Heather Graham makes a brief appearance.Verdict: The second film had definitely disappointed us by aping the first. But the film makers have shaped up their act with the third installment. 'The Hangover Part III' is not extremely funny as one would have wanted but still qualifies as a decent finale.",6,0,0,5 June 2013
Rockstar," Ranbir's stellar performance nearly makes up for the movie's flaws
","Even if you ignore his surname for a moment, Ranbir Kapoor is arguably one of the most naturally talented actors in today's Bollywood. In addition to this, his good looks ensure female fan following, read: rake in more moolah. His 'Rockstar' may have just been his most intense and splendid performance till date. 'Rockstar' begins at a concert in Rome and someone scuffling with ruffians. It is soon revealed that the 'someone' is Jordan, a major rockstar, labeled a bad-boy by the media and someone who hardly smiles. Cut to his college days, there's the simple Janardan Jahkar or JJ strumming his guitar and singing for the local audience and his days in the college canteen gorging samosas and idolizing Jim Morrison.When his well-wisher and canteen manager Katana, played impressively by Kumud Mishra tells him that a true artist needs to be driven by hurt and anguish, JJ curses his simple and incident-free life. Just to get his heart broken, he chases the college bombshell, Heer Kaul (Nargis Fakhri). Eventually, it turns out that under the prim and proper exterior Heer is thrill-seeker and the two become wild friends. What begins as a fun-filled friendship takes different shades as the time passes. On one hand, Heer drowns into depression without our hero, whom she re-christens as 'Jordan'. And, Jordan's yearning for her company brings out the performer in him.In what is probably the best portrayal of what goes on in a creative head, the story brings depth and makes its audience feel for JJ. Despite the negative publicity he gets as Jordan, he's a simple guy who yearns for love. Noticeably, it is only after his tryst with Heer that his motive in life changes from chasing success to something else. During the process, success merely becomes a byproduct he is least interested in. Director Imtiaz Ali plays around with the story's chronology. It is likely that the editors too may have actually lost track in between. Repeated scenes, songs and too much of flash-back or forth gets annoying after a point. The restlessness among the audience was very apparent as the movie seemed to go on forever. Talking of performances, Ranbir surely has a line of awards waiting for him. Nargis Fakhri, the American with Pakistani antecedents who plays the leading lady is truly beautiful and has been a Kingfisher calendar girl; but not as gifted with acting skills. The film also marks Shammi Kapoor's last screen appearance as he plays an Ustaad who recognizes JJ's talent. Aditi Rao Hydari plays a small role as a Journalist.AR Rahman's music is integral to the story and songs have already become runaway hits. 'Sadda Haq', 'Kun Faya Kun', 'Jo Bhi Main', with Mohit Chauhan as the Rockstar's voice and 'Katiya Karun' give the album an eclectic blend of rock, desi flavor and Sufi mysticism. Again, some more awards are in the waiting here.Cinematography too is well done, especially the jerky shots and quirky angles that capture the actors' emotions effectively. Be it the by lanes of Delhi, picturesque Europe or Breathtaking beautiful Kashmir winter, the excellence with the camera is undeniable. The realistic costumes complement the camera work. The dialog is very smart and the first half evokes laughter and stands up ably as things turn serious in the second half. You may blame the script for some of its flaws, but asking for perfection when portraying emotions and out of the ordinary relationships is a monumental challenge. So, to say, it's a job moderately well done.So, should you be watching this movie? The answer is a resounding 'Yes'! Granted, the story gets a little lost in the second half, but the rest of the goodies will make you overlook its flaws. The movie is powerful enough to keep you thinking much after you are out of the movie hall. If you still haven't seen it, go for it!",8,36,46,13 November 2011
Slumdog Millionaire," Improbable instances, but scores on quality storytelling
","The word ‘slumdog’ really doesn’t exist, or is it, especially after the movie’s success at getting itself nominated at the academy awards! Probably, the usage has to do with the context of the story that emphasizes fate in the case of a boy from the scum of the society winning twenty million rupees in ‘Kaun Banega Crorepati’; our very own desi version of ‘Who wants to be a Millionaire?’ The story emphasizes destiny’s power.The protagonist Jamal is seen in Police custody, being interrogated over his successful run in the game show up to the penultimate question. While the inspector (Irrfan Khan) plays the questions on TV, the boy narrates the bizarre and sometimes touching stories about the past involved with each such question based on his years in the underbelly of the country’s economic capital. Some stories seem highly improbable though.Three actors portray the youngest, adolescent and adults for Jamal, his brother Salim and his love interest Latika. That makes it 9 actors! In my opinion the youngest three were the best, in their effective portrayal of life in slums and nursing dreams of a decent life. The trio are effective in scenes where they lose their family and the one in which they are captured by the local begging cartel from where they make a close escape.What makes the movie impressive its emphasis on the story rather on the usual stuff on individual performances. While specific performance of actors is nothing amazing, each plays his part in the story. However, none of the hosts on TV today would be as rude as Anil Kapoor is to the boy, when he says ‘we have a chaiwala here’ sarcastically. Such brashness is usually seen only in MTV Roadies! What did Boyle really want to show? Showing India to be full of slums seems to be an obsession for foreign filmmakers. Barring a mention by one of them that India is the centre of the world, the film is full of stereotypes. First, the slums, then the slumlords, filth, goons running rife and of course, the call centers. When will Hollywood ever learn that the very same city also has Nariman Point and Bandra Kurla Complex that really look and feel truly global! The movie has really hit the headlines for the simple fact that it has bagged nominations in key categories including the coveted best picture and director. Our desi Maestro AR Rahman is on the verge of getting an Oscar with two of three compositions being nominated! While Rahman has given better hits than ‘Jai Ho’, I am really glad that the international recognition has come last. And there are others for the technical awards.Despite bitter disagreements on the stereotyped portrayal of poverty, why do I rate this as a well made movie? Is it because of the ‘phoren’ tag? Surely not! If you want to see plain story telling with perfect editing, no redundant scenes explaining every little detail, go for it. For the Oscars though, I believe Indian films could have made history long ago; if only the powers that be didn’t succumb to lobbying that led to sending lousy films.",8,0,2,29 January 2009
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Scores for action and special effects alone
","Live-action Transformers movies make great business sense not just at the box office but also for Hasbro's merchandise. With the action getting bigger in every version, 'Dark of the Moon' aka Transformers-3 is a typical Micheal Bay movie, which promises loads of action which, as usual is scantily clad with a semblance of a story.Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), the central character in the first two films has now finished schooling and looking for a job. He has also moved cities and also to a new girlfriend Carly (Rosie Huntington- Whitley). Sam and the Autobots dive into the thick of the plot when the truth behind moon explorations is apparently revealed as an investigation into a crashed Cybertronian spacecraft on the dark side of the moon.Sentinel Prime is a key character inclusion as Optimus' mentor and Cybertronian genius who his keen on using advanced technology to revive his planet and also brings a twist in the story. The one-eyed serpentine cannon bot Shockwave is TF3's most formidable antagonist. Old enemy Megatron has lost his edge but not his ambitions and moves around as a rusty old truck with a cowl covering the injury inflicted by Optimus in TF2. The film's selling point is its special effects, largely shot in stereoscopic 3D which deserves unreserved applause for the resultant spectacle. Intricate action sequences are slowed down for detail and camera angles are simply great. The freeway chase that features in most of Bay's movies is seen again though. With more bots and the threat of imminent global danger make the climax worthwhile. Nevertheless, there is a lot missing with the script and acting. The flow is also affected by poor transitions between action and storytelling. Sudden cuts in some action sequences and the lucky bunny romance scene that suddenly pops up from nowhere are just a few examples. Also, some of its humor is downright silly.Sam's character that was central to the story in the earlier movies as he held maps or clues that either group was chasing. Here, the battle has nothing to do with him and all that LaBeouf has to do is to play his usual scared hero. Megan Fox's replacement, Rosie brings in her charm, but none too comparable to Fox. Both something in common though; they're both equally awful at acting.And, nearly everyone else is just a caricature. Be it those reprising their roles such as Josh Duhamel as the army commander or John Torturro as the former Agent turned author who aren't critical to the story or new new faces such as the largely wasted John Malkovich or a nervous Ken Jeong of Hangover fame. A significant exception is, Patrick Dempsey as Carly's moneyed boss with a deeper secret to his role.Clearly, it's a case of special effects donning the role of a back-seat driver. But, full marks for special effects, the lone pillar on which the Transormers edifice stands.",6,2,6,29 June 2011
Up in the Air," Crisp script and comical moments are its miles!
","In times of recession, a movie about a guy who fires people for a living is not exactly anyone's idea of entertainment! But, the devilishly charming Ryan Bingham, played by George Clooney just does that, making things oddly comical. Enjoying around 300 days on-board, at lounges and hotels, he laments the 40 days at home between trips. When he isn't firing, Ryan peddles his 'Baggage free' ideals at motivational lectures and occasionally has a 'good time' with fellow travel buff, Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) who hit off on a common ground of loyalty card vanity. As Alex calls terms herself as a feminine version of Ryan, the twosome often plan their sojourn across America.Things change when greenhorn Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) leads his company to a new policy of firing people via internet. Ryan is grounded and dismayed at the prospect of missing his secret ambition of 10 million frequent flier miles. Adding to his woes, his boss Craig Gregory puts Natalie under Ryan's tutelage to lean the business! Natalie and Ryan are opposites; while the former hates airports and loves to get back to 'home and family', Ryan loves his unreal life but wants to fire people 'with a personal touch', allowing the story its exploratory flight-path of mutual self discovery of emotional connections, love, family and propriety. While it is easy to portray such themes in gloom, Up in the Air is light hearted, sprinkled liberally with humor while keeping up its pace.Though, at first, it comes across as a movie on Ryan and his miles, it's not! His conflict is rather within himself, his fear of intimacy, family and commitment. Clooney actually makes you feel for the middle aged and lonely Ryan who fires people but is really not a grown-up within. To their credit, the filmmakers have worked well to create seemingly unreal characters but still leaving enough to imagination and things to relate to! Natalie and Alex have their issues too. While the Anna Kendrick plays a pretty, uptight and ambitious girl whose nervousness is situations is comic relief. Poor Natalie is eventually dumped over an SMS. Vera Farmiga as Alex adds her own shades of grey; she has a stable family but seeks out some fun. Do our characters get what they want? Typical to Hollywood style, some answers are direct while some are subtle. To bring out the best from those 'fired', the filmmakers actually cast people who had recently lost jobs! Their brief was to look into the camera and say what it felt like being 'fired'! Portraying multiple locales without actually filming there was intelligent production design. The Airport scenes were crisp and realistic. One of the best scenes is Ryan's slick passage through the security check, portraying a seasoned business traveler.Coming from the Oscar nominated directed by Jason Rietman of 'Juno' fame, Up in the Air, adapted from a novel of the same name by Walter Kim is worth watching!",7,5,8,23 February 2010
The Island," Minus Michael Bay, it could have been a great Sci-Fi flick!
","If Michael Bay had not directed this movie, probably, it had the potential to stand out as one of the best films on moral and scientific issues related to cloning and stem cell research that were raging around the time the film was made. Instead, what you get out of it is a lot of clanging metal, flying bullets and choppers that completely knock off the subtlety aspect that the subject was meant to portray and sensitivity involved.Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) is among the few survivors of a global contamination who now live in a controlled environment with their diet, clothing and activity following a strict plan. The only thing that all residents there wish for is to win the lottery and go to ‘The Island’, said to be the last inhabitable place on earth. In what appears as utopia, Lincoln finds a live bug that leads him to question the oft told contamination theory.Obviously, our hero needs a girl and who can get better than the young favorite Scarlett Johansson who plays Jordan Two Delta who has just won a lottery to the island. Just before she is whisked away to the purported island, Lincoln grabs her and flees. The outside world was just the trigger that Bay needed to add the unnecessary clang to the whole story, making the rest of the story a predictable second grade action film.Despite starring Sean Bean one of the most effective villains who plays Dr. Merrick, the brain behind Merrick Laboratories that owns the facility, the film rarely delves into issues that actually strike the moral chord on cloning. The reference by henchman Albert Laurent (Djimon Hounsou) on the African genocide and his qualms about killing agnates despite him being a baddie was a mere touch and go on the humane aspects.Despites all its flaws, it makes quite a decent watch if shown on Television anytime. At the very least, the idea of such a facility for cloning is in itself a worthy concept however but marred by mindless action. From the star cast, McGregor still doesn’t seem in the role and Scarlett could probably have been given a bigger role than being a blonde eye candy. A wee bit of sensitivity and sensibility could have made the film memorable!",6,0,2,3 October 2008
