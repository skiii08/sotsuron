Iron Man 3," Excellent Sequel to the Franchisee
","Not caring about the review of other critics that the movie was average, In my view the movie was fantastic, from the viewpoint of all the movie- buffs and viewers out there who are seeking for some sneak peak into the softer side of Tony Strark viz the Iron man, playboy, tech geek, the movie does that remarkably well with the way he handles the anxiety in the aftermath of recent events and heightened concerns being faced on account of his deteriorating health which is elegantly balanced by humor, hats off to Robert Downey Jr for the excellent acting on that part. Viewers finally get to see more romance between tony and miss peppers.The script and storyline is fantastic and is full of a lot of surprises which will keep you hooked and guessing till the last moment. And with all the different elements combined, action, thriller, little bit of drama, the movie turns out to be a great view for all the Iron man fans out there.Verdict : Very Good, You'll have to see it to believe it",10,10,27,26 April 2013
