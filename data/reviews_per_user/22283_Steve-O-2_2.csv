Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good looking but boring
","The effects were great, but the acting was wooden and the plot was way too serious.  I was bored out of my mind through most of it.  And I love the old Star Wars movies.  The fun seems to be gone.  No Chewie and the droids reduced to cameos made it even harder for me to enjoy.",1,0,2,19 May 1999
The Matrix Reloaded," Looks good, but...
","First of all, there's a lot of councel meeting with boring speeches by men and women in flowing robes.  That is one of the most overused Sci-fi scenes in movies.  'The enemy is coming!  But we should wait for word from the Enterprise... er....  Neo!'Neo fights Agent Smith then remembers he can fly... why didn't he do that in the first place?The 2nd overused Sci-Fi scene:  Living underground in a Mad Max, Blade Runner world.  And what's with the rave party after the political speech? It would have been cool if they were worshiping a bomb too!And having Anthony Zerbe in it made me chuckle.  I heard they wanted Connery, but he turned them down.  At least Zerbe's a good guy, but man this is one B-movie actor that never goes away!  Remember him in 'KISS Meets The Phantom?' or how about 'The Omega Man?'   Come to think about it, the Omega Man looks kind of like this movie.I know geeks love the Matrix (you're not a computer geek but really a superhero out to save the world!  That's the dream of every fat loser computer geek.)  But this movie even abandons that idea.  It's just a action movie with very cool special effects.  It's about as deep as one of those bad 'Star Trek' films.  How about a Sci-Fi film where the lighting is good everywhere?  Why is the future dank?Instead everyone runs around in the dark with sunglasses (why?  did all those Lasek procedures go bad?  Maybe that's the message of the film...  in the future invest in the Sunglass Hut.  You'll make a fourtune.) and gives great speeches.  If the Machines were really coming to kill all humans, do you think there would be so much in fighting?  I don't.  They'd do everything and anything to stop them.I hope, God I hope, they tack on a wedding at the end of the last one... and eat Solent Green at the reception.  This is a classic bad 70's flick.",Null,0,0,26 May 2003
