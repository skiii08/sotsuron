Ghost," A couple of things to notice...
","There are a couple of artful touches in the movie that might go unnoticed at first.  For example, the show Mollie and Sam were out to see that fateful night was Macbeth, which of course, is about murder for ambition.  Another funny touch is when Sam sings, 'I'm Henry the VIII I am..., we've got that line, 'wouldn't have a Willie or a Sam,' who are two of the main characters in the story.",Null,1,2,15 April 1999
