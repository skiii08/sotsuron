The Blair Witch Project," A load of ill conceived baloney
","I can't remember in a lifetime of seeing a movie a week anything so trashy and dull. Trashy because the camera work was worse than amateur it was appalling. Dull because the hack performances of the cast made me wince with embarrassment. The close up of our heroine desperately trying to squeeze out a tear as she farewells her family was painful. I was bored from the start of this collection of blurred, shaky, out of focus, unrelated and technically ghastly images. Half the way through I felt the film had to be going somewhere as it hadn't shown any forward momentum up to that time. I was sadly mistaken. It didn't.It shows what people are willing to tolerate in their suspension of disbelief",1,2,4,15 December 1999
Pitch Black," Crikey, it just missed out! Matrix it ain't.
","I feel that Pitch Black just missed out. Character building: I didn't feel any affinity for the characters. The Hero was a murderer and all the likeable people were predictably killed.  Editing: Was effective but the main problem was that there was a little too much jerky jumping from image to image. They could do it digitally so why not? Cinematography: I felt that the images were OK and the sets and the special effects worked OK. To sum up, it just didn't quite grab me or any of the other three with me. It'll make money though you can be sure.",5,0,0,26 May 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," A long winded drab final curtain for a great Director.
","I found 'Eyes wide shut' a long winded drab final curtain for a great Director. I have to agree with those who attended the Premier. This film failed on so many levels, especially as entertainment.Yes the camera work and direction were masterly but what about enjoyment? I fell asleep three times and had to be nudged awake.The stacatto musical score harked back to a minimalist period well before Vitaphone. The slow, drawn out dialogue. Film for the hearing impaired?The derivative Fellini style 'Orgy Scene' was this meant to be reminiscent of Sweden circa 1955? Maybe one of Lucretia Borgia's more lurid masked evenings? Yes, I'll admit that Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman were attractive but what is the point of a 20 carat diamond set in mud? My opinion? Not worth the entrance cost. In a word Yawn!!!!",Null,0,0,11 August 1999
