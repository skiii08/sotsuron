Source Code," Extremely Well Done
","This is a film that defies genre labels. It's not a time travel film, but it does seem to be able to change the recent past. It's a unique blend of science fiction and thriller, with a little bit of romance thrown in. For me the connection between Colter and Christina really clicked and made me want more of these two characters. I've seen some reviews that panned the ending as being unnecessary, but after the stunning revelation a little more than midway through, they had to provide more of a kick in the pants for the end. Definitely worked for me. Towards the end, it seemed it would end with Colter dying in a virtual reality fairy tale, and Goodwin throwing her career away to make it happen. But we then get left with a completely altered reality that actually works. I enjoyed this immensely.",8,1,3,6 September 2011
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Kind of like bait and switch
","When I first saw the trailer for this, I was very intrigued. It (the trailer) reminded me a lot of 'Burn After Reading' which Clooney was very good in and which I enjoyed a greatly. What I found was a film that was slightly amusing, but also tried to be dramatic and was only mediocre in that context. While there were plenty of amusing moments in this film. they were only mildly amusing, and not well placed. Unfortunately the attempts at drama only dragged down the story. There were good performances by Clooney, Spacey, and Bridges, but the simply couldn't elevate the story sufficiently. I might have given it a higher rating if the film had just tried to be amusing, but after seeing the trailer and then seeing the film, I felt somewhat disappointed.",5,0,1,9 May 2010
2012," Why Has Emerrich only made one good disaster movie?
","The answer to that question is, that that movie (Independence Day) didn't take itself seriously. Everything he has done since has been much more straight faced and that has been there downfall. I know what your going to say, ID4 wasn't a parody. No it wasn't, but it made so many sly references to other films and TV series in a wonderful eye winking way, that it made it much more enjoyable than it otherwise would have been. Maybe that's the point here? Maybe Emmerich might have a better track record with comedy merged with gigantic special effects. Maybe he should have done that awful 'Disaster Movie'? Granted. there was one part of the movie that seemed to gravitate towards that sly wink. That would be Woody Harrelson's over the top performance as the conspiracy radio talk jock covering the crisis while waiting for the Yellowstone caldera to erupt. Alas, it was far from enough to even make it entertaining. The special effects are well done, but all that does is make this a grand clich√©.",3,1,2,31 July 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Overloaded, Ponderous, and Tedious
","I found it difficult to keep my eyes on this waste of time. Downey was OK as Holmes, and I did enjoy Law as Watson. However the movie kept throwing all manner of plot devices at you it became extremely difficult to actually follow the story. The habit of having Holmes visualize his deductions might have worked, if it weren't for your mind being assaulted by all manner of other effects and unnecessary bits of dramatic filling. Don't get me wrong. My complaint isn't too much action or too many stunts. It's too much everything. Instead of making it fast paced, the Director winds up slowing everything down. It's not like watching paint dry. It's like watching paint dry and every few minutes someone comes along and throws on a new coat of paint.",4,3,5,24 May 2010
Flight," Well Done Character Study
","Flight is the study of a man who in a moment of crisis, saves over ninety lives. But as a result winds up having to save himself. What sets it apart from other films dealing with substance abuse is that it sets up an interesting point of view. At one point Don Cheadle's character points out to Denzel Washingtons character Whit Whitaker, that several pilots had tried to duplicate his actions in averting the total loss of every passenger and crew member in the simulator, and all failed. This leads to an inference that if Whit hadn't been stoned out, he might not have been able to pull the maneuver off. This is reinforced at the hearing where Whitaker says his actions were instinctual in reply to a question questionfrom the hearing officer. This of course leads to ask does this excuse his behavior? Of course not. Whitaker's own statements at the end point out the futility of that line of thought. This is the the truly remarkable beauty of this story. We are allowed to come to the same conclusion that Whitaker comes to. But we come to it of our own volition. The same as our protagonist. We come to it without preaching or being led by the nose. It is an excellent study of a man who must in the end, save his self respect in addition to a plane full of people.",8,0,2,13 February 2013
The Cabin in the Woods," H P Lovecraft Meets Mission Control
","I found this film to be the most original horror flick I have seen in over a decade. The writing, effects, and plot all make it worth watching, but just barely. The basic flaws are in the performances. None of the actors in this movie looked as if they gave a damm. However it is a very original premise that both pays homage to, and makes fun of the genre at the same time. The scene where the spooky old guy from the gas station asks if he's on speakerphone is really funny. If they had just gotten some better acting I would have given it more stars. But if you are a fan of the genre, you may find it well worth your time.",6,2,5,22 September 2012
