The Lobster," Interesting Movie
","This was a very interesting movie because I do not recall seeing anything quite like it. The idea that people would be turned into animals for failing to find partners is as original as it is absurd. There is simply no reason for any society t be set up this way. If anything, due to the treat of overpopulation, people in a society would be more likely be encouraged to be loners. Even in a society where there not enough kids, people would not need to have partners or be couples to procreate. The movie simply makes no sense whatsoever but somehow I kept watching it to the very end. So,obviously the people who made it did something right. However, the ending was so insane I had to deduct a lot of points for that. They had hardly nothing in common before she was blinded but they clicked as a couple. Plus, their clicking as a couple had nothing to do with them both not being able to see well. After all, they relied on their vision to communicate without words. Shared poor vision was not essential to their relationship. So, it made no sense for him to blind himself because she was blind. It especially made no sense for him to stab himself in the eyes with a steak knife when he could have had the same doctor who blinded his woman blind him. Hell, he probably would have felt obligated to do it free of charge. Also, I feel the movie dragged on too long. Nevertheless, it was interesting, and hence my rating.",5,1,2,12 December 2018
Bird Box," Great Movie
","Yes, it is similar to 'A Quiet Place' in the sense that people cannot look instead of people not being able to make a sound in order to be safe. However, it is still a good movie in its own right. A movie does not have to be totally original or like no other movie in order to be excellent. The writing, the acting, the cinematography, the suspense, the terror, the unpredictably, etc are all on point in this movie. It has enough tragedy and death to make you sad but not enough to make you feel bad at the end of the movie. Every death, in some way or another, was unavoidable given the circumstances. When acts of kindness lead to death, you could easily see that there was no other way for the people to behave differently and still be good people or not lose their humanity. The ending of the movie was great or not unrealistic at all. The only thing that could make this movie better is a sequel in which it is explained just what the creatures were.P.S. Someone said the character, Tom, made the dumbest decisions in the movie. I disagree. He made decisions any good human being would have made, especially one who had served in the military. Perhaps their real problem is that he was black and on top of that was romantically involved with Marjorie, who was white.P.S.S. Marjorie was not too old to be a new mother, given her tendency to not connect with people or connect with them the right way and the fact she was around 48 or 49 when she got pregnant.",10,15,45,18 December 2018
