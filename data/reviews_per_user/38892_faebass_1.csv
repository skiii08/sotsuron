Hereditary," This is what horror has been lacking
","There are very few times I can recall having a visceral feeling while watching a horror movie. Hereditary excels at creating an environment that continuously makes your stomach churn. Most of the negative reviews for this title complain about the slow pace. The constant avalanche of odd interactions and world building are what set this movie apart from other horror flicks. You can just feel in your gut that something isn't right.A perfect example of this is the scene where Charlie meets her demise. She's coughing, struggling for air and writhing in the back seat while Peter is speeding home. She finally puts her head out of the window to force air down her closing windpipe when BAM. Her head is severed by a light pole. I distinctly remember the theaters audible gasp; you could cut the tension in the room with a knife. To top it all off, Alex Wolf puts on a phenomenal performance. He continues to drive home in complete shock from what just happened.Whats most amazing to me about this movie is that every bit of information means something. The amount of depth to Hereditary's story is unlike any other horror movie. Everything you learn about the characters and the world culminate into an absolutely terrifying ending. If you didn't feel anything while watching this movie, you just might be a sociopath.",10,5,9,16 July 2019
