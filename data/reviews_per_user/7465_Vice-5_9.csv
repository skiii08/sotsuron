Raiders of the Lost Ark," 'Snakes. Why did it have to be snakes?'
","Indiana Jones, alongside Rambo, the Terminator, Dirty Harry, James Bond, and Conan the Barbarian, has to be the greatest movie hero of all time, thanks to Harrison Ford's cool and calculating performance as the daredevil archaeologist. Indy must find the lost Ark, the container that holds the 10 Commandments, before his worst enemies, the Nazis, could get ahold of it first. 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' has everything to offer for action fans. It has a wisecracking and very realistic hero, his spunky girlfriend (Karen Allen), a trusty sidekick (John Rhys-Davies), sick bad guys, lots of shootouts, and adrenline-pumped action-sequences. In other words, it's the perfect image of what every adventure flick should be!!",Null,0,0,2 January 2000
12 Angry Men," Hey, juror #3, LIGHTEN UP!!!
","Undoubtedly a true classic, '12 Angry Men' is one of the best dramas ever filmed. In this movie, everybody can feel the tension, not just by the jurors themselves, but the viewers as well. Henry Fonda does a great job as the good-hearted juror #8, and Lee J. Cobb is equally great as the bad-tempered eight juror. As juror 8 is trying his best to find the reasonable doubt to spring off the young defendent accused of murder off the guilty seat, juror 3 and a few other jurors want to see the kid hang.
'12 Angry Men' is practically my favorite old movie (I like a lot of new stuff), because even though its atmosphere is very old-school, its got the same dramatic intensity found in current dramas.",Null,0,1,9 January 2000
Predator," Hunting season starts now!!
","Ever have the feeling that you're being watched? That's the feeling Dutch Schaefer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his team of commandoes (Carl Weathers and soon-to-be governor of Minnesota Jesse 'the Body' Ventura) are going through with in the classy kill-or-be-killed sci-fi flick 'Predator'. Sort of like a mix between 'Alien' and 'The Most Dangerous Game', Arnie and the gang are out busting Latino guerillas while a sly extra-terrestrial armed to the teeth are picking off are heroes one by one, until he meets the big Austrian, who really picks a good fight with the galactic and more violent version of Elmer Fudd! 'Predator' is a great flick, with great effects and cool lines ('You are one, ugly, mother------,' and 'Anytime'). The actors are great, too. Catch famous screen-writer Shane Black in the movie, as the 4-eyed trooper Hawkins.",Null,0,0,11 December 1999
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Obviously, it's Schwarzeneggar's greatest movie
","If you take all of the best action movies of all time, 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' would be at the top of the list. Ah-nold is back as the deadly robot who must save John Connor (Eddie Furlong, in a tailor-made role) and Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) from the dreaded, slimy T-1000 (the quite laconic Robert Patrick!). The great action scenes, the witty banter between the heroes, and even the moral message this movie delivers will recharge anyone's batteries. 'T2' is what practically lifted Arnold into sole stardom. All it takes is a couple of bullets and fancy one-liners!",Null,1,1,20 November 1999
Face_Off," 'Wheeeeee!! HA HA!! What a predicament!!'
","Just how far would you go to kill your worst enemy? That's the question FBI agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) ponders about nailing the sleazebag terrorist Castor Troy (Nicholas Cage) who shot his son with a hard-powered rifle. So, our hero literally puts on his foe's face and surgically implants it on his own!! That is what makes this a good action thriller: good, raw action with an intriguing motive!Travolta and Cage make an unbeatable force in this flick, directed by action wizard John Woo, who makes dodging bullets look like a Barishnikov ballet! The character development is great, too, with Cage and Travolta switching sides and complexions. Though a bit bloody, 'Face/Off' is a thinking man's movie, not just some two-bit rag with nothing but guns and ammo!",Null,1,2,8 October 1999
From Dusk Till Dawn," 'No thanks... I already had a wife!!' -- Seth Gecko
","Forget 'The Lost Boys' or 'Interview with a Vampire'!! 'From Dusk till Dawn' is the best vampire movie that doesn't add Dracula into the lineup! > >Just like 'Army of Darkness', 'FDTD' brilliantly blends the action flick with the horror genre, adding with the atmosphere of a spaghetti western. George Clooney and Quentin Tarentino make a great team as Seth and Richie Gecko, a couple of ruthless bank robbers who, along with the Fuller family (led by Harvey Keitel, in a change of pace role for the former 'Resevoir Dog'!) and a Vietnam vet named Frost (Fred Williamson), take on a bunch of blood-thirsty vampires, who one of them is portrayed by the ultra-sexy Salma Hayek. From then on, it's a long, gory fight to the death. Anyone in the mood for exploding guts and blood? > >Even though it's not completely scary, 'From Dusk till Dawn' would make a great film to watch on Halloween night. Obviously, this movie ain't for little kids, but it's the ultimate treat for both horror and action fans.",Null,0,0,27 October 1999
Rocky," Sly Stallone in his only Oscar-winning movie ever!!!
","Sylvester Stallone makes his breakthrough performance as the underdog Italian boxer Rocky Balboa in 'Rocky.' This flick inspired all underdog movies, and thanks to Sly's rugged performance, that's what makes this film go 'round! Along with his meek wife Adrian (Talia Shire), and his gruff-but-trusting coach Mickey (Burgess 'The Penguin' Meredith), Rocky prepares for the big fight against the macho up-start Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers). Though I didn't like the ending that much and the film seemed a bit overlong, 'Rocky' is an all-time winner because of the heart and soul this flick delivers. All the main stars of this movie do great, and it paved the road of fame for good 'ol Sly himself. YO ADDRIIIIANNNNNN!!! I DID ITTTTT!",Null,0,0,8 January 2000
It's a Wonderful Life," It sure is....
","You know, there are times I wish I was never born. But, after watching 'It's a Wonderful Life', it made me change my views on how life can be a real b****! Jimmy Stewart plays the good-hearted guy named George who rides on an emotional roller coaster after getting his dreams thwarted by the rich jerk Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore, Drew's grandfather). But after a nightmarish visit to a parallel world thanks to his silly-but kind guardian angel named Clarence (Henry Travers). Soon, George learns to love life as it is, no matter how screwed up it is. 'It's A Wonderful Life' is one of the greatest Christmas flicks ever made, and a good stress-reliever, too.",Null,0,3,31 December 1999
Army of Darkness," Campbell and Raimi: the dynamic duo of cult movies!
","Need a good haircut? Ash Williams and his trusty chainsaw is your trusty barber and slicer!! Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi come back with a bloody vengeance in 'Army of Darkness', the long awaited 2nd sequel to the cult hit 'The Evil Dead', and this version is what put the whole series into the whole perspective! This time around, S-mart housewares clerk Ash is sent back to a medieval and dices every freak he meets, and he still has time to get the chicks. This films has the most legendary one-liners of all time, including 'Come get some', 'Hail to the king, baby,' and 'Good, bad, I'm the guy with the gun!!'. 'Army of Darkness' and the other 'Evil Dead' movies are obviously the best in cult flicks. Rumor has it that they're making an 'Evil Dead' video game for Playstation. Imagine the uproar that products gonna make!!",Null,1,1,22 November 1999
