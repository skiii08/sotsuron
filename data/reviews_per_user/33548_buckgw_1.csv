3:10 to Yuma," Not true to the original movie's ending
","I grew up on westerns and have been a fan of the genre since childhood. This remake is well acted, but the ending is completely different than the original movie's. The essence of the western is the triumph of good over evil. In this remake, the person who walks away is the psychopathic outlaw, Wade, while the rancher, Evans, is killed. In the original, the rancher survives to return to his family. Once Wade starts helping Evans get Wade to the train, why doesn't he call out to his gang to stop firing - especially since he tells Evans that he has already been to the prison in Yuma twice and escaped both times?Although Evans starts the trip with Wade for the money, it is obvious that he is ending it to earn his son's respect. He certainly does that, but the ending does not require that he die.I suppose that the change in ending was made to accommodate our current cynical popular culture. If so, that is the right of the screenwriter and director. However, the movie as remade in 2007 isn't '3:10 to Yuma'. Perhaps they should rename it '4:29 to Tucson' or whatever. If you want to see a outstanding modern western that is truer to the western genre, try 'Open Range'.",1,4,7,5 December 2010
