The New World," Review on movie 4B
","I am watching this movie for a history class to understand what it felt like to live in this time period. The plot of this movie is mostly just explaining how they used to live and how hard it to live different ways. The Native Americans lived with no electricity or any kind of easy out life like it is today or in our modern world. The English had a lot for them, they had better guns food and even better armor. I feel that the film maker is trying to tell us that there are two different kinds of lives and that not everybody in the world always has it easy. The time period that it was in was pretty noticeable from they way that they were talking and their surrounding, When you looked at what they owned was also pretty easy to tell that it was probably 1600s. The way that they dressed, spoke, and even how they still had queens and kings. My only question that I felt like asking was if they didn't care about how women were treated and that if they were still just meant to do what the male asked them to do. A few thing that I liked about this movie was how it actually showed us how it was like especially how the kids in the movie actually were struggle not to see them suffer but how the movie actually was truthful. The violence in the movie is also interesting like how the English had guns and the Native american had stick and arrows. I didn't like how the movie didnt really give that much interesting it was mostly a movie that you had to pay attention to understand. I kind of liked it. Its not a movie that I would probably watch again but just for expedience. I dont really blame the movie on the director because all movies are different and not the same.",2,0,1,30 August 2018
