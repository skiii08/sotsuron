Knives Out," Follow it and get it
","No spoilingThe movie is well done. Actors are great. The story is awesome. There are a lot of evidences.The final is superlative and is there where as all 'yellow movies' you get in. Typical Agata Christy style but this time is depicted in America.But as usual the spectator has all the tools and the info to get the truth before the end.

The Irishman," What a great movie
","The cast is definitely stellar.This movie is history.So many great actors, probably the best ever. All together. I found it just a little slow, but at the cinema the effect is breathless.",8,2,8,18 January 2020
Point Break," Omg - a spineless plot
",They could have cartoonized it. The story would have been more credible.Is a total noon sense series of extreme sport actions.Frankly even 1 is too much. 'Point Break' is a sacre movie: this is the apology of the ridiculous.,1,1,1,21 February 2019
Ready Player One," B movie. Maybe even C or D...
",Another computer made only movie claiming to predict the future but resulting pathetically idiot. A sort of Second Life at the cinemas,1,0,2,4 August 2018
"I, Tonya"," Another good performance from Margot
","She's very good and talented. And finally the truth about the poor unlucky skater cheated by many imposters.
They movie is long and takes the audience really glued on the seat. Not fast not slow, the speed is proportioned. The structure of the film is well directed.
A movie that I suggest.",8,2,3,17 January 2019
Molly's Game," She's very talented
","It's a very nice movie. I really enjoyed it.
I think they she's very gifted and her role is perfect for her.

Avengers: Endgame," Even not for nerds. But 7 as I felt a tribute to Stan
","I won't spoil. All those who love that genre should have already seen it. But if you didn't, save some bucks and time.There only 1 moment, probably lasting few minutes, where I felt something: I took this as a tribute to Stan Lee and so I increased my final score. That part is touching. Really.
For the rest, you may read below. No spoil.The most boring yawning film ever.
Nothing really happens.
It's a movie with no spine no plot and actors act less than mediocrely.
Maybe good for children for the presence of animals speaking to humans.",9,1,7,22 May 2019
Joker," Joaquin deserves
","The movie is so greatIt's another view of Joker. But so true and well done.Joaquin deserves the Oscar. Will see if tomorrow they'll assign it to him.The film is s crescendo of pathos and actions. Picture, music, photography, scenes, plot, all is great.Frankly I suggest you to watch it.",9,3,5,9 February 2020
Parasite," Over rated
",A normal film with a non-credible story that has been idolized by the masses for frankly no reason.2 hours where the best parts are one only: a beautiful italian song from the 60s.Assigning a 6 as total score I'm generous.,6,1,4,10 May 2020
Life," Moronic
",Really really really an idiot movie.Seriously? I've never thought our a_s_s-tronauts could be so idiot.A total childish film.,2,2,5,21 November 2019
