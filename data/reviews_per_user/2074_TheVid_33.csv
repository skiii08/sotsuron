Catch Me If You Can," Far from interesting, cat-and-mouse story, based on fact, full of blatant, boring observations about broken homes and authoritarianism.
","An inconsequential true story of a teenage con man directed by Spielberg, with absolutely no real insight into his motivation or his game, except that he's a product of a broken family.  DeCaprio works in the lead, but Hanks puts on a New England accent that's pretty hard to take as the ineffectual FBI agent on his trail.  It's all very flat and filled with many stupid incidents, particularly a ridiculous relationship between the law and the criminal, true or not.  The sixties atmosphere is standardly evoked via costumes and pop music.  Bland stuff.",Null,0,1,7 May 2003
The Ring," Another lackluster American remake of a foreign film, something Hollywood should just give up on.
","It's been said in earlier reviews and I'll repeat it: this is a pale comparison to the original Japanese version.  I wonder how long Hollywood will continue to greenlight second-rate, American ripoffs of first-rate, foreign films.  This one was as poorly done as most of the others, which include THE VANISHING, NIGHTWATCH, INSOMNIA, and most recently, SOLARIS. It's strictly for adolescents who find reading subtitles difficult.",Null,0,3,26 November 2002
Minority Report," Overblown futuristic potboiler from two of the biggest egos currently working in Hollywood.
","This science-fiction blockbuster is a conglomeration of pastiche moments from any number of similar films from the past (all instantly recognizable). Spielberg still seems to be on a Kubrick jag (even after his dismal attempt to make something out of A.I.); and Cruise comes off worse, still dressed in black and looking shrimpier than ever as a duped action hero.  For the all the high-tech imagery and blabber, it's still a cornball conspiracy thriller, with our hero's prime motivation being his loss of family.  Yawn. It all adds up to more big-budget mediocrity from a gang of uninspired Hollywood power players.  Just the thought of putting in the 2nd DVD of extras, and listening to Spielberg's spiel and Cruise's commentary, turned me off for the evening.",Null,0,0,18 December 2002
Chinatown," An American mood piece so refined that it has become a major masterwork of cinematic craftsmanship.
","This film is so masterful in virtually every aspect that it's rightfully become both a genre masterpiece and one of the most rightfully acclaimed films ever to come out of the US.  The sublime highlights: Polanski's sinister cynicism; Towne's intricate scenario; Goldsmith's haunting score; and Sylbert's uncanny production design.  Huston and Dunaway are superb, but Jack Nicholson here proves that he's the greatest actor of his generation. An uncommonly beautiful film.",Null,0,2,22 April 2003
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Cute in the worse sense of the word; romantic porno for adolescent daters.
","It's hard to assess why McConnaughey and Hudson would agree to work in this kind of film project.  It only hints that a career turn to sitcom TV is probably an inevitability for the likes of both of them.  It's hard not to bring up Hollywood nepotism while watching Kate Hudson perform in crap like this, and, as for McConnaughey, he's quickly becoming chick-flick fodder faster than you can say: THE WEDDING PLANNER.  A horror flick.",Null,0,1,24 March 2003
We Were Soldiers," Surprisingly old-fashioned for a contemporary war movie about Vietnam; with an overt deification of the Mel Gibson character.
","There's not much new with this typical-for-the-times, gung-ho tribute to Viet-nam vets.  The combat scenes display the up-front, cinematic tactics currently on display in most recent war films, but the emphasis on the John-Wayne qualities of the Gibson character (and his family) are corny in the worse way.  The script jams the sentiments down your throat, and the music score sounds like judgment day.  Absolutely no new insights are presented in another movie that will make you glad you missed that war!",Null,0,1,18 September 2002
The Bourne Identity," The kind of old-fashioned thriller movie that's been done so often in Hollywood; you'd swear you've seen every scene countless times before.
","This new adaptation of Robert Ludlum's reasonably famous book as a vehicle for Matt Damon might work for you if you were born yesterday, otherwise it's all going to be overtly familiar stuff.  As for Damon in the lead, he's adequate at best in what's basically a mechanical character.  Franka Potenta is well cast as Matt's love interest, but again, it's a one-dimensional, sex-interest role.  It's all bleak and austere and could have benefitted from a dose of humor or dark wit.  The director should have studied Hitchcock's NORTH BY NORTHWEST for a little inspiration.  Too late the hero.",Null,0,1,22 January 2003
The Italian Job," A lame remake of a sophisticated 60's caper movie thanks to an amazingly lackluster script and drab direction.
","The saddest thing about this unnecessary remake is that the mini-coopers provide all the personality in it.  A good cast is left expressionless, without any witticisms or even a chance to exploit their charms. Unforgivable, when you think about how much money they spent on this unoriginal crime flick.  It's way worse than a lot of the straight-to-cable Cinemax actioners.  Marky's becoming the king of remakes; not a good career move, since most remakes tend to stink like this one.  The fact that they released Michael Caine's charming original version on DVD the same day only enhances this remake's blunders.",Null,0,1,10 October 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Amazingly, the extended version offers you over 15 minutes of end-title credits, acknowledging the charter members of a website, and providing an exit-music showcase for Howard Shore's score!
","I found Peter Jackson's epic visual interpretation of Tolkien's elaborate-but-simplistic story to be one of the best film spectacles since the days of Samuel Bronston and the old Hollywood Biblical epics. Like the grandiose epics of the mid-twentieth century (CLEOPATRA, FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, BEN-HUR), THE LORD OF THE RINGS creates visual ecstasy (even in an era of overworked, stale CGI bombardment).  Peter Jackson is obviously in control of his craft.  He got convincing performances from everyone in his cast, and the overall production design and scope of FELLOWSHIP is much more awe-inspiring than any of the latest space operas from Lucasfilm.  The legendary status of the Tolkien books precludes me from caring how faithful a movie version of them needs to be; indeed, it's arguable whether a film has any obligation to remain faithful to a literary version of a story.  In that same light, the extended version of FELLOWSHIP, is merely that, more material added to an already intricate storyline.  It doesn't hurt to have it; and it doesn't hurt to miss it.  Jackson has crafted one of the screen's best epics using current, state-of-the-art techniques, and that, based on the recent glut of blockbuster competition, is apparently difficult to do these days! He's captured the spirit of Tolkien and provides his audience with one of the best epic spectaculars in years!",Null,0,0,18 November 2002
American Psycho," Semi-successful film version of the Easton-Ellis novel would have been better done by the likes of David Cronenberg, Oliver Stone or even Lucio Fulci.
","With all the controversy surrounding this story, it was no surprise that it would eventually be made into a film.  It's also no surprise that the extreme graphic violence in the story would be missing from any contemporary attempt at releasing it as a movie.  In any event, the picture does capture a lot of the satire of Ellis' story and Christian Bale goes all out to capture the emotionless persona of the self-obsessed killer.  I think the essence of the picture, though, is compromised without the outrageous, sadistic violence of the book.  AMERICAN PSYCHO is not just a mean-spirited study of self-absorption and emotional dysfunction, it's also a view of an alternate moral satisfaction, one based on murder and mayhem and one that was much more successfully presented in film's like Oliver Stone's NATURAL BORN KILLERS or Pasolini's SALO.  This mainstream film from the Bret Easton Ellis story is rather cowardly; a daring, disturbing film from courageous filmmakers like Cronenberg or Stone would have been much more admirable.",Null,0,1,21 June 2002
Spider-Man," Hollywood couldn't have made a better decision than to put Sam Raimi in charge of this costly comic-book movie.
","Raimi proved he had the stuff to make a great comic-book movie when he wowed audiences with his diabolically delightful DARKMAN.  Now with a budget of over a hundred-million dollars, he gets to wow comic afficionados and suburban PG-13'ers with SPIDERMAN.  He succeeds, although SPIDERMAN doesn't have the daring intensity or originality that DARKMAN had, nor does it offer a highlight like Jack Nicholson's performance in BATMAN.  I'm sure the studio-committee dictated some demigraphic preferences to Raimi with a project this big because it shows.  It's strictly state-of-the-art CGI, which is getting pretty routine lately, particularly after LORD OF THE RINGS and before ATTACK OF THE CLONES, but with a nicely-done screenplay and some passable performances.  I think everyone will accept the miscast, limp-wristed McGuire as Spiderman because he does a decent job here with what he's given.  DaFoe is fine as usual, but the Green Goblin (and to a lesser degree, the Spiderman action pieces) have the hokey look that was evident in the preview trailers.  SPIDERMAN is about as entertaining as a summer blockbuster currently gets.",Null,0,0,7 May 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Slick is the word for this, but it's still just another Hollywood remake to cash in on latest batch of pop movie stars.
","Everything about this jazzy heist film is generally enjoyable and waiting for the DVD release with it's assortment of extras made better sense to me than seeing this one with the suburban crowds.  There's talent behind and in front of the camera and the script has enough pizzazz to keep even the shortest attention spans interested.  The Julia Roberts character throws an unnecessary degree of schmaltz into the macho brew and weakened the piece quite a bit; of course, leaving out a sex interest for at least one of the boys would have been bad for box-office demigraphics.  Relax and enjoy this wishful-thinking piece of fluff.  It won't be difficult, and, by the way, it's way better than the campy old rat-pack potboiler it's based on.",Null,0,0,8 May 2002
Tigerland," There's nothing new here, with Tigerland boot camp serving as an allegory for the actual war.
","Director Schumacher gets on the war-movie bandwagon with the same, hand-held, choppy-frame visual style that seems to be par for the course when Hollywood deals with gunfire or battle.  What you get here is a contemporary look at Army boot camp and how it prepares the surplus population for battle.  The philosophical dialogue is tried and true, and the characters are literally plucked from Kubrick's definitive boot- camp movie, FULL METAL JACKET.  Many reviewers seem to be surprised by Schumacher's involvement with this project.  I imagine he wanted to give star Colin Farrell some big Hollywood exposure (if you know what I mean) because Farrell mainly comes across as cute and perky, a recruit presented as far more noble and intelligent than his predicament.  TIGERLAND is predictable enough to skip, unless you're anxious to see Colin's star-making vehicle.",Null,0,0,21 February 2002
Blue Crush," A surfer girl flick that should appeal to jock-sniffin' adolescents.
","The only originality here is that the surfer dudes are chicks, otherwise this is as contrived and cliched as these athletic sagas come.  Of course, it's all very photogenic with Hawaiian locations and some sweet, nubile ingenues, but even an amateur can make the breathtaking dusks and awesome surf of the Hawaiian Islands look magnificent.  Director John Stockwell made an unwise choice not to use the scope format in a picture that cries out for it.  Based on a magazine article, this one's a simpleminded tribute to showcase women surfers with nothing substantial or enlightening to say about the sport or the competition.",Null,0,0,1 April 2003
The Pianist," Polanski's clinical, straightforward vision of Nazi atrocities is far more mature and involving than Spielberg's overrated, overbearing attempt at the same thing.
","Having dealt firsthand with Nazi terrors, it was perhaps inevitable that director Roman Polanski would finally present his interpretation of it.  His film offers a strong, clinical take on the Nazi inhumanities with a relatively detached emotionalism, personifying some key elements to understanding how individuals managed to deal with the horrors of the time. Adrien Brody is absorbing as an artist overwhelmed in the escalating nightmare; his characteristically expressive mug reminding me very much of the Giancarlo Giannini protagonist in Lina Wertmuller's SEVEN BEAUTIES (still my favorite movie dealing with Nazi persecution).  THE PIANIST is another great film by Roman Polanski.  From the resoundingly ominous explosion at it's start,to the tragic vista of Warsaw as a devastated wasteland, THE PIANIST turns out to be another unique chiller from a film-making master.",Null,0,1,23 June 2003
The Transporter," A quality action set-piece of the Hong Kong variety that effectively showcases action man Jason Statham.
","There's not much for action fans to complain about here.  Everything is assuredly set up to capitalize on Statham, and he pays off.  Those looking for more substance in story and support will probably be disappointed, but taken as Statham's show, it's more than satisfying.  As for Statham, he's a breath of fresh air compared to the recent doses of fey leading men like Colin Farrell, Ben Affleck and Matthew McConaughey.",Null,0,1,11 April 2003
Seabiscuit," A nicely produced slice of history, in spite of its ponderous feel-good politics and tediously overwrought good intentions..
","I recommend this one simply because it's got a degree of class, features Jeff Bridges and is visually striking.  There aren't many contemporary films in it's class, so it's a prime example of how these things are best done in Hollywood today.  It does jam Americana down your throat less subtly than I'd like, but that's a matter of opinion.  It doesn't let the horse theme become overbearing, so good for that.  As a well-meaning history lesson, you can do a lot worse.  As an animal movie, it's not as good as Born Free. Generally old-fashioned in a good way, though.",Null,0,0,9 January 2004
28 Days Later...," Stark, mean-spirited zombie movie with the kind of gruesome gratification generally missing in American horror films.
","This well-paced creepshow by Danny Boyle works on a visceral level and it's basic 'bad blood' premise is presented stylishly right from the start, beginning with a terrific prologue.  The turn of events where the military squadron is revealed as interested in nothing but firing their guns and getting a woman is a high point midway through the picture, and carries it in a welcome new level right up until the rather too-pleasant conclusion...only minor quibbles with this generally smart take on an old formula.",Null,0,0,3 November 2003
8 Mile," Urban melodrama of the old-fashioned sort, spiced up with hip-hop...and Kim Basinger as the Mom.
","Curtis Hanson applies a suitable amount of craftsmenship to an old formula and gets decent performances from his cast, and a relatively watchable film for those in the mood.  Eminem has a rather lackluster appearance and demeanor for someone associated with middle-class paranoia and political incorrectness.  The music is underwhelming, and most non-adolescents feel like any 19 year old and their brother can do it.  A much more interesting film could be made of the rap-record business and the racketeering associated with hip-hop record producers and artists.",Null,0,0,27 March 2003
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Pasolini's desperate attempt to define an anti-morality; a brutal film, brutally made.
","This is Pier Paolo Pasolini's last film, deliberate in it's intent to off put moviegoers with an experience that definitely lives up to it's reputation (as few films have ever done).  On first viewing, the picture mainly comes off as a test of tolerance, unearthing a reasonable amount of curiosity about it's creator, a controversial, political artist with a significant reputation in his own country.  With subsequent viewings and some study, the film often can be seen as a morality tale with implications that go beyond the sensational coprophilia and violence.  A rare, courageous film, albeit with dubious intent, a fact which makes it far from uninteresting!",Null,0,2,17 October 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," A geek epic, and perhaps the definitive example of everything that is wrong with new millenium moviemaking.
","This CGI experiment is less a movie than a crass commercial for a video game.  The high-tech visuals are stupid and the nature of the picture makes you wonder if any of the characters included are actual people or reasonable computer facsimiles.  This is big-budget, brainless entertainment that's virtually unbearable; no wonder the box-office fell so drastically and quickly after the first weekend of it's release!  So much of it is so bad that it's hard to pick a low point, but I'd say it's the grotesquely pretentious dance sequence that's so ridiculous as to be laughable; as if everyone was infected with the Debbie-Allen-Fame bug.  Carrie Ann Moss looks like Cloris Leachman, making the stuporific Keanu Reeves a perfect love interest for her (and intercutting their love scene with the Debbie-Allen dance number struck the perfect balance).  This is the pits!",Null,0,0,20 October 2003
A Beautiful Mind," An overrated biopic created as an audience pleaser by a director better known as Opie.
","This biopic is about as over-hyped as a Hollywood melodrama can be.  It's a look at a real-life genius victimized by delusions of grandeur, but it really ends up being just another sentimental 'love-conquers-all' romance from the dream factory.  The clever presentation of the hero's fantasies is derivative and manipulative at best, and the wholesome vision of the Nash character is as sickeningly correct as the studio system demands.  This is just a typical, so-called prestige, crowd pleaser that's simplistic and sentimental instead of intelligent and disturbing.  A bourgeoise blockbuster with a sweet performance from Crowe.  Connelly comes across as miscast.  David Cronenberg or Oliver Stone could have had a field day with this material!",Null,0,2,8 July 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Another well executed children's fantasy, livelier and with a better script than the first.
","A good children's fantasy is a difficult feat, and luckily the team putting together the Harry Potter movies is sticking to the formula and spending what it takes to deliver the stories as imaginatively as the current state of special effects arts can deliver.  Daniel Radcliffe capably carries the pictures in the lead and was well cast.  These Harry Potter things lack wit and inventiveness when compared to classic children's fantasy movies like THE WIZARD OF OZ, MARY POPPINS, WILLY WONKA and most of the Ray Harryhausen pictures, but they're still very nice efforts in a most difficult of genres. Rises high above the usual crap that's currently being hawked to the kiddie crowd.",Null,0,0,14 April 2003
Vanilla Sky," Crowe and Cruise team up for a pretentious, minor mind trip for the easily satisfied.
","This big-budget exercise ends up being another American hack job on a foreign film.  The original Spanish version (OPEN YOUR EYES) was only moderately interesting, so I ended up waiting for the VANILLA version on DVD.  It's trippy in a nostalgic way that explains why Crowe got excited over it all.  All the performances are flat and much of the dialogue is as annoying and pretentious as most reviewers say it is.  The addition to the DVD of a couple of featurettes on the making and publicizing of the film make the feature seem over-hyped and self-congratulatory and should probably have been left off the disc.  VANILLA SKY is a mediocre diversion at best.",Null,1,2,28 May 2002
Bruce Almighty," Hardy Har Har...a high-concept comedy for the masses that will surely make money and is good for some minor laughs.
","The fact that the premise here gives Carrey and his writers virtually limitless crowd-pleasing joke opportunities doesn't take away from the fact that this is witless, crass, middle-class comedy of the most common and manipulative variety.  Add to that a dose of good-measure, preachy sentimentality and you have a typical garden-variety summer movie hit that the whole nuclear family can enjoy.  Practically speaking, this is another Hollywood turd that reeks of big boxoffice potential. Hallelujah!",Null,0,0,30 May 2003
Signs," A 50's style, alien invasion movie undermined with hokey family drama and childish spirituality.
","This entertaining enough, attack-of-the-space-monsters movie has a couple of good things going for it: an appropriately catchy music score (by James Newton Howard) and some nicely staged suspense sequences.  It's got a certain B-movie appeal, but the dreadful philosophics and the turgid family issues that arise are completely unnatural and overripe.  Mel Gibson and family seem to have been invaded by body snatchers long before the aliens arrive to wreak havoc.  A little more dark humor and a lot less preachy enlightenment would have gone a long way in making this project more enjoyable.  And who's not tired of Mel Gibson playing the stalwart, fatherly-figure type.",Null,0,1,8 January 2003
Identity," A gimmicky thriller that's nicely staged and performed for a change.
","Thanks to a first-rate cast and witty production design, this silly thriller is a generally pleasing diversion.  It does go from very good to fair by the end, but it's far more engaging than adolescent frighteners like THE SIXTH SENSE, without any of the pretentious sentiment or moralistic blabber of that potboiler.  Fun Friday night fright.",Null,0,2,8 September 2003
X2: X-Men United," A piecemeal rehash of the original X Men movie; same old conflicts, and less humorous than it's predecessor.
","More X-Men politics, and obnoxiously correct ones at that.  This simplistic, over-produced sequel takes it's allegorical drama of racist politics so seriously that it loses momentum after the first ten minutes.  It's strictly for those who consider comic books high art, and another tedious exercise in franchise cinema.  The trailers for MATRIX RELOADED and THE HULK which preceded the film only made the experience more mundane.",Null,0,0,5 May 2003
Hart's War," Entertaining enough prison camp movie; lots of big issues; capped by the usual soldier-boy to soldier-man preachiness.
","A decent cast, loaded plot and preachy dialogue about duty, honor and the like.  It's OK as these things go, with Colin Farrell's soldier boy becoming a soldier man, thanks to the heroics of Officer Bruce Willis. There's a lot of fashionable heroics and good taste (for what that's worth).  It's definitely not as good as STALAG 17 or THE GREAT ESCAPE.",Null,1,2,1 August 2002
Thirteen Days," Stupid lapses into cheesy sentimentality mar a mostly interesting scenario.
",This relatively objective look at the Cuban missile crises is constructed well enough to be intriguing political drama and a fascinating look at alarmist notions and confrontational ethics.  The addition of scenes about Kevin O'Donnell's familial concerns should have been left on the cutting room floor and cheapen the entire flow.  The characterizations/performances range from the sublime (Kennedy/Greenwood) to the ridiculous (O'Donnell/Costner).  Not nearly as tedious as you might expect.,Null,0,1,8 May 2003
Gangs of New York," The intriguing counterpoint to Scorsese's other masterful view of historic New York.
","Martin Scorsese offers GANGS OF NEW YORK as an historic picture of New York as a brutal, primitive wasteland, and it's a perfect complement to the elaborate, highly civilized New York city wasteland he so vividly brought to life in AGE OF INNOCENCE.  Scorsese brings his definitive style and deep, personal conviction to both films, elaborately exploring cultural and historic upheavels at intriguing moments in the history of a city which has had a profound place in the artist's body of work.  GANGS is a magnificent production and a superior epic in the sense that it envisions and embodies a relatively unknown period of historic significance and establishes a barbarous and treacherous atmosphere that should stimulate and intrigue inquisitive and intelligent viewers right from the start.  A fine achievement by one of America's best filmmakers.",Null,0,0,1 July 2003
Windtalkers," Just the premise of the Navajo code talkers should have been fair enough warning to stay away from this one!
","Talk about a stupid-but-true premise as an excuse for a blood-and-guts war movie!  Yes, Woo is the king of action, but another WW II movie as a showcase for his talent was a bad decision (as noted by the glut of poor reviews and poor boxoffice for this movie).  With virtually every director of note getting big budgets to show off the latest state-of-the-art methods for recreating battle, this Woo effort is too little, too late.  Male bonding at it's worst; although not as dumb a movie as WE WERE SOLDIERS, another sappy, based-on-truth, veteran's wet dream.",Null,0,1,26 November 2002
Donnie Darko," Alternate realities, suburban ethics and teenage angst are combined to bewilder in this humorous sci-fi movie.
","Donnie Darko, if nothing else, has a sense of humor, and that, if nothing else, keeps it intriguing.  An alternately funny and poignant troubled-teen story is threaded together by a sci-fi time-travel theory and a central conceit based on variable realities.  Donnie's story is fun stuff, handled well, and delivered with a satiric edge that generally amuses and intrigues. A remarkably good genre film by a first-time writer/director, particularly when you consider the competition that's out there.",Null,0,1,7 April 2003
