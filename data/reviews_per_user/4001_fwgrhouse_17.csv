Miracle," Do you believe in Miracles? You Will
","When I first heard of this movie I knew that I was going to like it be for two reasons, one, I'm a big sports fan and secondly, it told the story about one of the greatest moments in the history of sports. If you don't believe in miracles you will after seeing this movie. I say that the main lesson of this movie is that anything is possible because in the movie the youthful team USA was going up agents the heavily favored, 43-0, 4 time gold medalist Soviet Union. No one thought that they could do it, but they did beat them to go on for the gold. It also teaches the power of teamwork and loyalty to one another. I would recommend this movie for anyone because I can't see any reason why you wouldn't be moved by this.",10,1,2,1 May 2006
The Notebook," Great Film
","First off, I want to say that I am not a very big romance movie fan at all, and at times I am rather annoyed by that kind of stuff. However, when i saw this movie, I loved it. To tell you the truth it actually kind of touched my heart a bit because of the plot. To tell you the truth, this does make you feel a bit mushy inside. The plot is very nice and a classic plot in my opinion, the actors did a very good job of portraying their characters (especially Ryan Gosling playing Noah Calhon), and the writers wrote a very good script.Anyone who is a fan of romantic movies has to see this movie and I will guarantee that if you like romance movies, you will love this film.",10,0,2,20 January 2007
Forrest Gump," An Instant Classic
","This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is a very memorable film for anyone. The plot is excellent, a young boy who has an I.Q. of 75 and braces on his legs ends up meeting a girl named Jinny. After that he looses his braces and is able to run. After that he achieves a lot of things that other people wouldn't be able to like be on the All-American football team, receive a congressional medal of honor,run a shrimping business,be on the All-American ping-pong team, and to top it off he runs 15 times across America. The funny thing about it is that all of these events happened by coincidence. This is a must see film for everyone and you will fall in love with this when you see it for the first time.",10,1,3,6 May 2006
Remember the Titans," One of the Best Sports Movies Ever
",When I first saw this movie I immediately fell in love with it. I saw that this movie had a profound impact and a lot of it comes from the fact that this was based on a true story. It teaches us to respect people and to judge them from their character and not by the color of their skin. It also shows how difficult obstacles that are on both the playing field and off of the playing field can be over coned through the powerful bond of teamwork. It also shows how a small group of young men playing football influenced an entire community on how to respect and work together with people of another race. This is a must see film for anyone and if you are not moved by this then I don't know what to say to you.,10,1,2,5 May 2006
Saving Private Ryan," Greatest War Fim Ever
","I got this film on DVD for my birthday and I couldn't wait to watch it because I had heard some stuff about the movie being very good. After I saw it I had a much better understanding of how bad war really is. I mean you show a seen at Omaha beach on Jun 6,1944 and the moment the ramps go down already the first three or four rows of solider literally get blown to bits. After that you see more solider get shot, killed, and wounded until some solider finally get up to the bunkers and take out the Nazis's, and to top all that off you see the beach after it covered with dead bodies and big puddles of blood. then you hear that 8 men have to save 1 man who lost all three of his brothers and after more violence you see that of the 8 men sent out only 2 are still alive. I can't think of any reason why you couldn't be moved by this film. This is a must see film for anyone interested in war films.",10,3,5,30 April 2006
Schindler's List," Best Movie about the Holocust
","I saw this movie on DVD afew months ago and when I saw it it just grabbed me by the heart. I gave it a 10 because for one reason, it grabs people's attention and makes you think about the Holocaust and what the Jew's and other people went through during that horrible time. Another reason is because it shows what a great sacrifice a man made to save a bunch of people that he didn't know. It also takes you inside the Holocust and the terrible things those people went through like having to strip naked in front of people, then have their heads shaved, and be forced to do hard labor with little or no food until they were too weak to work and were sent to the gas chambers. I would recommend this film for anyone over the age of 13 because of all the realistic violence, language, strong nudity and sexual activity. But I can guarantee you that once you have seen this film, you will think differently about the Holocust.",10,9,13,30 April 2006
World Trade Center," Bravo
","When I first heard about this movie, I immediately wanted to see it. I saw it in a theater with my dad. I had heard a lot of good stuff about this film and was wanting to see if it lived up to the reviews. It did in my opinion. The actors did an excellent job of portraying how the lives of the people were affected by 9/11. It does a great job of showing how people were able to come together and work as one to recover from this disaster. Seeing this has gotten me to think differently about 9/11 and the people who were affected by it.Everybody has to see this as a reminder of why we are fighting the terrorists.",7,1,4,3 April 2007
Black Hawk Down," One of the Best
",After I this movie I had more respect for the military than I ever had before in my life. I also had a better understanding of what combat is like in this day in age. The plot is very good and is also based on an actual event that happened. It also shows the bad things the people of the military go through on a daily basis while fighting a war and it also shows that war is a terrible thing regardless of the cause. I also feel that the people who made this movie made good choices in the cast because it was made-up of mainly actors that starred in other war films like Tom Siezmon form Saving Private Ryan. This is a must-see film for anyone interested in war films and I guarantee you that you will be moved by this film.,10,3,6,1 May 2006
The Greatest Game Ever Played," Excellent
","I play golf in school and I am pretty good at it. I know how tuff it is to play and learn. When I first heard of this movie I wanted to see it, and when I did, I loved it.It is like Remember the Titans, Glory Road, and Miracle only it deals with golf. It is an inspirational movie and it not only tells a true story but it also teaches good morals such as always judge someone by who they are and never give up. It is also based on a true story and is about an underdog coming back to win the U.S. Open This is a must-see for anyone who loves sports movies (golf in particular)or inspirational movies.",10,3,5,3 August 2006
Hoosiers," Great Sports Movie
","I first saw this movie in one of my bible studies, I heard quite a bit about this film before hand and I heard from everyone that it was good. When we were done with it I saw that it lives up to its reputation. It is a classic movie based on a true story about a small school in rural Indiana were basketball is big. It follows the journey of a coach who has a very good reputation for his coaching skills, but hasn't coached in a very long time. This movie teaches you what can happen if you work hard and never give up on anything. I also saw about a year later that this movie made AFI's list of 100 most inspirational films of all time, I say that it was a well earned spot.",10,0,0,2 April 2007
Titanic," I was Touched
","When I was in the third grade I learned about the Titanic. The moment after I first heard of it, I immediately got interested in it. Then awhile later, I heard of the movie. I wanted to see it, so I rented it and watched it with my parents (they already saw it so I knew how it ended) and when it was done, I was crying. I'm 15 right now and when I see it I still at times hold back tears. I couldn't imagine anyone who wouldn't be touched by this. The plot is excellent, the actors play the roles very well, and the special effects are excellent. It also shows that the disaster could have been less tragic if they put more lifeboats and put more people in them. This is a film which is a defenet must-see film.",10,2,3,9 June 2006
Glory Road," One of the Best Sports Movies
",The first time I saw this movie I immediately fell in love with it.It was pretty much like Remember the Titans only it delt with basketball. The movie is about a basketball coach that is given a job at a small college in Texas in 1965. He is told to recruit players and while doing it he recruits seven black players. The people and the school are upset but he does what he feels is right and he ends up starting three black players in the first game. They win all of the regular season games except for one. They end up winning the NCAA Championship and the coach only plays the black players. It is an excellent movie and it teaches us a very important lesson and that is that we should judge a person by who they are and not by the color of their skin.,10,0,1,4 July 2006
All Quiet on the Western Front," Very Good Film
","I saw this movie in my AP History class when we were studying about World War one. When I saw it I knew that this was one of the most memorable war films of all time. It does a very good job of depicting the lifestyle of the German soldiers during the war, especially considering this was made during the thirties. The acting is also superb. I believe that this is also one of the films that paved way for other memorable war films to follow on. I also think that it also does a good job of showing that even though the Germans were the enemy, they were still human beings just like you and me and that for once it shows their point of view on the war. Anyone interested in war films has to see this one.",10,3,4,30 March 2007
Casino Royale," Best Bond Film in Years
","I am a huge Bond fan. I have seen all of the movies, know all the different Bond actors, villains, and girls. When I first heard that the producers were hiring Craig to play Bond I had my doubts, but I have to say that this is the best Bond movie in years. Daniel Craig did an excellent job and I would have to say that the only other actor who did better than was Sean Connery. Another thing I really love bout the film is that it cuts down on boring scenes and replaces them with more exciting scenes and that is something which is hard to get in a movie these days. I also love the action sequences a lot and the fact that this movie shows how James became Bond. If you are a Bond fan, you would be insane to not see this one.",9,1,4,2 April 2007
Space Jam," Very Entertaining
","I first saw this movie back when I was 7. I had just got it for my birthday. I could not wait to watch it and when I did I loved it. It is a very good movie for anyone at any age (though it does have some language in it) especially if you are a looney tunes fan. It has great laughs and gestures, has everybody's favorite looney tune characters(like Bugs, Daffy, Porky, and Elmer), it also stars the famous basketball player Michal Jordan and some other basketball players like Charles Barkly, and it even introduces a new female character,Lola Bunny(who acts as Bug's new girlfriend), with a little sex-appeal. Space Jam is a very good movie for anyone, especially for loony tune fans or kids who love cartoons.",7,2,2,30 April 2006
The Thin Red Line," Like Saving Private Ryan in the Pacific
","This movie is as good as Saving Private Ryan and from the way I see it it is just like it only it takes place in the pacific. It really shows you the hell which the men of the army in the Pacific Theater went through to liberate the islands from the Japanese army, and it also shows the gruesome reality of the war and even at times shows it from the Japanese point of view.I really think that the director should have chosen a better year to release this movie because it was the same year Saving Private Ryan was released, and I would have to say that if he did, they probably would have won some of the Oscars they were nominated for.",10,2,5,31 March 2007
The Pursuit of Happyness," Excellent
","I have to say that this is one of Will Smith's most memorable movies. The plot is very simple to understand, a man who's life is going down with his bad job, failing marriage, and extremely short on cash looks for a better job as a stock broker and to make things tougher his wife leaves him and his son and they end up on the streets for a brief time period. However eventually he gets the job and a better life and he and his son live happily ever after. I feel that what makes this film very good is that it's based on a true story. The acting is done very well, the script was well written, and even has good humor in some parts. This is inspirational, uplifting, and a must-see.",10,1,1,8 June 2007
