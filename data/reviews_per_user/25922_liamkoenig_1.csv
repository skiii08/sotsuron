One Hundred and One Dalmatians," One of my first Disney - Movies, an old Classic
","One of the Disney Classics, it's so different painted than actual Movies, really beautiful Style. I also like it that the historical London is darkcouloured. The movie has some funny Moments, which makes adulds laughing as well as Kids.
One of my first Disney memorys!
I like some storytelling moments, for example the beginning, when you realise who is telling the story.
A good old classic Disney movie!",7,0,0,27 March 2020
