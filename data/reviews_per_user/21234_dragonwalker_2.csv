National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Too Cocky
","I am sorry, but this just makes me sad.First of all, a man named after one of my favorite comic character doing something very bad with his career, second of all... Why?USA is like three hundred years old (I know it is not so accurate, but that is not the point) and so it happens that during these few years all history just concluded right there... In the first movie Templaras just moved all the treasures of the the World to USA. Why? I mean, why not hide it in China? It is a bit more crowded so it is just the perfect spot. And now this... I don't know... It is just like someone would shoot a movie where president of Slovakia is the most powerful man in the World.Sorry, but... Something very itchy about this movie. It is your choice.",Null,0,0,9 February 2009
Taken," Not the best, but sure great.
","The first thing I do after watching the movie I liked is reading comments of those who hated it. Just to see what might I miss and you know... to get the other opinion. And I have to say, some of you are right. All these things in the movie just sort of a happen. Rich step-father, spy father, ice-cold mother... And so on.So... Why ten? Because I can even imagine what would I have done when receiving such a phone call from my daughter. So I was just watching this unstoppable daddy going through the thing like a razor. That is what I would like to do. I could definitely feel the fury of this character. I guess that is why.Plus it somehow reminded me of Die Hard. Plus Liam Neeson... Plus the speed an the thrill.I think it is a great movie of it's kind.",9,1,4,9 February 2009
