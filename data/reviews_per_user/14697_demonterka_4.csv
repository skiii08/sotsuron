Black Swan," Black Dawn, Black Lawn, or was it Swan?
","Behind an epic name, and an attractive poster, there hides a visually interesting, but lacking film.There aren't many films about ballet, and this one had a lot of potential, but... The camera was good, some nice effects, but this film never crosses the line of good. And the ballet scenes weren't very convincing.My opinion is that, although infused with a slight breeze, this movie relies too much on horror/psychological cliché and gross scenes. Too much of the movie passes on anticipating the next mutilating scene, whereas the psychological side, the key one, isn't at all that convincing or developed. ,,Fight Club'' has done it already, and this is a similar movie in a different setting, but...It has some moments where it almost succeeds to be beautiful or moving, but it remains mostly in boundaries of disturbing. It has an impact, but altogether it's Déjà Vu and it's score on IMDb, like with many other titles is just ridiculous.",1,34,65,15 January 2011
Clash of the Titans," Hey, lets make a movie!
","O.K.! What'll it be about? Whateever, but it MUST be 3-D and sound cool! Like ''Clash of The Titans'', or ''Zeus meets Godzilla Scorpion''.I guess you pretty much get the picture. Hollywood by its tradition takes a story, a myth, wait...no, my bad, (this has actually nothing in common with Greek mythology) a few names of Greek pantheon and makes the same corny cliché out of a movie.The plot is terrible. Famous actors act... act? There is no place for acting here and the big names are pretty much unnecessary considering the simple archetype roles. So I wonder why did they even bother to sell us the story anyway, they could have put more action sequences instead, perhaps it wouldn't be so boring. But I had a laugh or two seeing the ridiculous and shameful shredding of mythology, some hilarious action scenes and the amazingly bad plot. Plus I was very glad it was over.My free interpretation of a flashback: ''Zeus liked humans too much. So instead of defeating the human army that besieged mount Olympus, he deflowered the king's wife and the war was over.'' Did he make a threat that he will do the same to anyone who opposes him? God's might in all it's glory. Some of you might say: ''What is he talking about?! The movie was O.K. and the effects were top notch...'' No. It wasn't. I have nothing against action movies, but they needn't be stupefying. If you like American Greek mythology watch Disney's ''Hercules''. I really liked it when I was a kid and it's way better than this.",2,3,5,24 April 2010
Avatar," A true Hollywood epic... disaster
","It may have costed 300,000,000 $, but it's still cheap. I got a feeling that the Dark Empire of Hollywood does it best to utterly destroy movie as an art form. All it does most of the time is amassing less than average movies every year. 'Avatar' is no exception. If Hollywood is (and it most definitely is) The DARK Empire, Lord Cameron is it's...well Lord Destroyer-of-good-movies type.Saw it in 3-D and I still don't know why all the hype. 300 million greens was a complete waste of money which could have been used to feed hungry Americans or something. $$$ Wasted.The effects are nothing special, but excel in comparison with the terrible unoriginal plot chewed over, and over, and over (you get the point) by Hollywood. 'Avatar' may be 3-D, alas all the characters are in 1-D stereotype archetypes with whom no one in their right mind could relate. It's cheesy, cheap and way too long (the middle is actually very boring and unnecessary). It has revolutionized WHAT? Except for those special cameras it hasn't made any breakthrough whatsoever. The setting with characters in it looks like it's from a video game, only amplified by live action actors. Actors cannot really ACT in these shallow roles. Sad and tragic only achieves to be pathetic and nauseating in this movie. Cameron tries to sell us a deep ecological story of cowboys-mecha-spaceship humans vs blue Indians-USB/optic cable forest-dinosaur nature. And he fails in all aspects, but I guess the hype, the Cameron BRAND and the budget MADE many believe this movie is ripe for the top 10 of all times, although it has none of the qualities to be even considered. Look up some real good movies, older ones perhaps that really revolutionized the film industry, and not just that, movies that are art. Don't spend all your life looking for fools gold and passing entertainment and if you are, accept it as such and don't try to idealize it. When have we become so unhappy to look solace and fun in cheap movies like 'Avatar'?",1,8,14,25 April 2010
Inception," Deception
","Boring. Overlong. Stupefying. Cheap.It's easy to fool a sheep. Take an idea with great potential and then throw it in a barrel and burn it. Then throw a banal senseless story that barely looks complex, mix it with cheap action and waste over 2 hours of everyones lives. And the sheep rejoice because they think it is intelligent, daring, original and emotional. The truth is sad; it's just another generic Hollywood blockbuster action set in a ,,fantastic'' setting. It insults intelligence and anyone with an IQ > 70 gets it, and the majority praises it for it's emptiness because only that can they understand. These types of movies make me wonder if we really deserved a comet in 2012.",1,74,149,27 August 2010
