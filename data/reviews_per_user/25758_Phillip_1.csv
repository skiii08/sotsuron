The Blair Witch Project," A piece of crap
",This is the most disappointing movie I have ever seen.  It was a total waste of money and I hate that I spent it on this garbage. I admire a movie that can scare you with the power of suggestion but this movie is NOT scary. The three characters are total morons and I have never heard the 'F' word so many times since seeing 'Goodfellas'. I wish that this had been a true story and the three WERE missing!,1,0,2,12 August 1999
