Scarface," stylish but ultimately pointless
","The good points are that Al Pacino looks very cool in this film, it's shot quite interestingly and is an interesting tale of one hard-done-by and hard-man's tale in a tough world of bad men, drugs and drug barons. To be honest, it's almost like an episode of Miami Vice, but it's just very very thin overall, one of those movies that if you watch it late at night, while drunk and half asleep it sort of makes sense, but actually it's full of plot holes, awful dialogue, nice suits, terrible special effects and very very forgettable supporting roles.I've just finished watching it, and my overriding impression is that of a coffee advert with guns and drugs. MMMmm, shmells good? ya well, nein, actually. Al is fantastic, and I'd like some of his suits, and possibly even his haircut, but the rest - forget about it",6,0,1,14 November 2005
Lost in Translation," Tried to give it a chance
","I like Bill Murray, but (sigh) this was one tedious film. I know that this was meant to be tender and sensitive, thoughtful and so forth, but unlike something like say American beauty, which seemed to capture that mood in a gripping and interesting unexpected way.This was just like a documentary of a miserable lonely exhausted man that has a few brief moments of interest and fun in an otherwise stale trip abroad.If you're in anything other than a really good mood, I'd give this one a wide berth..sorry Bill.",4,2,5,4 July 2004
