The Ring," frightening
","Did You Make a Copy? The Ring, directed by Gore Verbinski, redefines the horror storyline many people expect in movies today. This film is a remake of the Japan film The Ringu and exceeds it by far. The Ring is creepy, haunting, and mesmerizing all while staying within the PG-13 rating standards. Audiences leave the movie with a genuine feeling of fright and unease. The story follows a young woman and her son discovering a VCR tape which appears to be the cause of many frightening deaths, including the niece of the central character. After discovering her niece's boyfriend died the same night and in a similar fashion, Rachel (Naomi Watts) begins to question the nature of their fatalities. Her inquiries lead her to a mysterious tape she soon watches.Rachel then begins to research the origin of the tape, and discovers she is experiencing many of the same things she viewed on the tape. Her son Aidan (David Keller) and her close friend Noah (Martin Henderson) watch the tape also. The movie includes a viewing of the tape, and it is frightening. The images are disturbing, and the tape is grainy and surreal. It creates an overall feeling of fright. Rachel, Aidan, and Noah work towards discovering an answer for their impending deaths. This includes visiting a mental hospital and the area the tape was filmed at.The Ring is truly a unique viewing experience. I was scared of the dark for several nights after watching it. The movie depicts a frightening, unnerving story without using the usual amounts of blood, gore, and extreme frontal nudity-- all of which have become standard practice when creating a horror show. I believe this movie is astounding and should be regarded as a major motion-picture breakthrough. The Ring is in a genre of its own, delivering great screams and still staying easy on the stomachs of the viewers.",8,0,1,3 April 2006
Signs," Which Type Are You?
","'Signs,' directed by M. Night Shyamalan, is an intense science fiction thriller. This film has two central themes: one being the impending invasion of aliens on Earth, the second is the story of the main characters' personal lives and traumas. The basic storyline is of a farmer, his two children, and his brother who awaken one morning to discover mysterious crop circles in their cornfield. Throughout the movie, the audience is given glimpses into the characters lives and begins to relate the history to the present day situation. The film soon shows its true colors as the man and his brother face their frightening situation at home. Faith becomes a very real part of the movie as the aliens make their approach.Reverend Hess Graham (Mel Gibson) is our central character, although Merrill Graham (Joaquin Phoenix), the younger brother of Hess, puts in an astounding performance. We learn through these two characters conversations and flashbacks, the personal grief and struggle they have already seen. The Reverend is referred to as father and through a sequence of events we learn that he is not only the children's father, but also a former leader of a church. The question of faith is touched upon in a conversation between the two men: 'Which type are you? do you believe everything is for a reason or do you believe in signs?' Hess Graham asks his young brother while they anxiously await the arrival of the visitors from another world. M. Night Shayamalan cleverly invents a small, but important, role in the film for himself. The children are brilliant as they deal with the horror of an alien invasion.'Signs' has a profound effect on the audience. The plot is frightening in ways that many movies fail to be. The aliens are not huge graphics which overrule the theme. Instead we are given just enough to make it feel real and become afraid for the world and its characters. The overall feeling of the movie is excellent with two amazing themes running into each other at just the right moments. The visuals are good, the acting is superb and the movie shines. M. Night Shayamalan has taken us to a critical place in movie-making--there is humor,drama,intensity and fear among the characters.",Null,0,2,20 February 2006
