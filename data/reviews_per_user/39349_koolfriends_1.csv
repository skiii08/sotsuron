Hereditary," Graphic
","An ok movie overall, however there are a few points that keep me from giving this movie a high rating.The story was very interesting minus the weird laughable ending and the acting was very good. The movie was overly long, however the most concerning aspect was the graphic content. Some scenes might be questionably disturbing to others but I was only bothered by one scene. The severed head crawling with ants. This made me dizzy and nauseated and two people left the theatre due to it. Although it was alluded to, the scene cut to it very unexpectedly and it lasted for a ridiculously long time. I spent the rest of the movie tense thinking that something this bad would be shown again. Nothing else bothered me too bad graphically however, I came for a creepy interesting story with scares. Be prepared for some of the unneeded and unexpected gore.",4,0,2,20 June 2018
