Skyfall," Skyfall will be considered one of the best Bond films.
","Skyfall is Bond at his best and will later be rated as one of the top films. Superb script, Great direction and excellent performances. Daniel Craig is an excellent accomplished, modern day Bond. He is what Bond needed. Rugged and sophisticated and a real person. The film has no silly over-the-top gadgets, its back to basics and the film is reminiscent of the great Terence Young Bonds. In the early Bonds, he had no fancy gadgets. I liked Connery and Craig is equal to him. The story is excellent and Bardem is sublime as the crazy baddie. It is also nice to see some of the action take place in Great Britain. Go and enjoy. People should stop hugging the past and move on. The old films were great but this release is really excellent!",10,1,9,10 November 2012
