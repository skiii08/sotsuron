The Avengers," The Avengers Assemble ... Only to Disappoint
","Don't get me wrong. I liked 'Iron Man', 'The Incredible Hulk', and 'Captain America: The First Avenger'. 'Iron Man 2' and 'Thor' were disappointing in my opinion, but I was still anxiously awaiting 'The Avengers'. Now, after having watched a couple of times, I can soundly say that 'The Avengers' is a disappointment.While 'The Avengers' isn't all bad, it fails in many departments. For starters, Loki is a terrible villain. He never felt like a threat and neither did the Chitauri Army which appears in the film's final act without explanation. There is lack of suspense and the film suffers as a result.Meanwhile, the plot is also contrived and clichéd. The death of Agent Coulson kind of fails to evoke any emotion as he isn't fully developed as a character. For some strange reason, Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner can now control his powers for the sake of the story. The main heroes fight among themselves before finally realizing that they're all being selfish. The story here is nothing more than the good guys versus the bad guys, something that has been seen countless times before.The performances, meanwhile, are passable, but not commendable. Robert Downey, Jr. has the pleasure of saying some of the film's best lines, but at times, it feels like the movie revolves around him. Mark Ruffalo does an okay job as Bruce Banner, but I dare say that I would've preferred Edward Norton. Meanwhile, the two Chrises do the best with what their given, compared to Scarlett Johansson (who merely serves as eye candy) and Jeremy Renner (who is largely forgotten as Hawkeye.)The movie ends with the same action-packed explosion-fest that has ended so many past Hollywood blockbusters. Yet, despite the caliber of the people involved with 'The Avengers', the finale feels like something out of the 'Transformers' movies, which isn't really a comparison to be proud of.All in all, 'The Avengers' is a disappointing entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Although it offers some witty dialogue every now and then, along with the occasionally exciting action sequence, it is bogged down by clichéd storytelling and a remarkably weak villain. Considering this film cost $225 million, it could've been much better.5/10",5,3,8,13 July 2014
The Secret in Their Eyes," A Modern Classic of the Genre
","Only the second Argentinian film to win the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, The Secret in Their Eyes is equal parts a slow-burning crime thriller and a forbidden love story that affects everyone involved for over a quarter of a century, following two separate timelines. In 1974, Judiciary employee Benjamín Espósito begins investigating the rape and murder of a young woman named Liliana Coloto. Assisting him in the investigation are his assistant Pablo Sandoval and his superior Irene Menéndez Hastings. Twenty-five years later, Espósito decides to use the case as the basis for his first novel, leading to a reunion with Hastings and the revelations that arise from discovering events that were set in motion twenty-five years prior. Although the majority of the film's runtime is devoted to the 1970s timeline, director Juan José Campanella, who also served as the film's co-writer and editor, finds a masterful balance between the two, crafting a non-linear narrative that provides a satisfying resolution to both threads.Admittedly, the film takes a while to get going, with the initial back- and-forth between the two timelines feeling a bit jarring. However, as the story begins to unfold and we delve deeper into the investigation, the film simply captivates, as Campanella delivers an engrossing crime drama with an ending that left me breathless. I will say, however, that I found it difficult at times to keep up with the film's rapid-fire dialogue. Even though I speak Spanish myself, some of the film's dialogue-heavy scenes demand the full attention of the viewer. While I don't know how this problem might play out for someone watching the film with the English subtitles as they might be simplified, but it is a problem that I found worth noting.The film's engrossing nature rests on the strengths of its performers, which include Ricardo Darín as Espósito, Guillermo Francella as Sandoval, and Soledad Villamil as Hastings. Darín does magnificent work in the lead role, expertly capturing Espósito's growing obsession in regards to the case. Francella, in his after first dramatic film role after an established career as a comedic performer, turns the alcoholic Sandoval into a fascinating character. Sandoval, whose relationship problems and drinking habits often conflict with his occupation, could have easily been a one-note stereotype, but Francella (who bears an uncanny similarity to Steve Carrell) manages to make him a likable character. Sandoval's friendship with Espósito leads to one of the film's most emotionally charged scenes. Villamil also delivers a mesmerizing performance. Much like the film's title implies, the eyes of these characters play an important role, serving as a method of non- verbal communication. And none of the other performers use their eyes to their advantage as much as Villamil does. Through her beautiful gaze, we see the complex relationship she forms with Espósito, whose eyes convey a buried, unspoken love for her.The film also benefits from more than just Campanella's storytelling abilities. This is a marvelously well-composed film, one that takes full advantage of the cinematic medium. Each frame feels tightly constructed, with Campanella sometimes telling two different stories in the same frame or obfuscating characters behind chairs or piles of documents and folders. In regards to the latter, by framing his characters in such a way, Campanella subtly communicates the growing obsession that they feel as the investigation begins to unravel. The film's technical prowess doesn't end there though. The film contains an enthralling five-minute long take set in a soccer stadium that ends with Espósito and Sandoval chasing their primary suspect, one Isidoro Gómez (acted to chilling perfection by Javier Godino), on foot. Campanella isn't just concerned with ideas of obsession, however. The film's conclusion allows for it become a meditation on justice and to what ends someone will go to punish a guilty individual. And Pablo Rago, who plays the deceased's husband, shines in these scenes as he delivers a haunting performance.Campanella's The Secret in Their Eyes is a thoroughly compelling film that benefits from a well-executed screenplay, skillful direction, and a host of strong performances. It's a shame that Hollywood couldn't resist the urge to remake the film years later with Billy Ray's Secret in Their Eyes, which ended up being a decidedly inferior production. Campanella's original, however, stands on its own as a modern classic.Rating: 9/10 (Amazing)",9,4,4,9 August 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," A Triumphant Return for Marvel's Favorite Hero
","Jon Watts' Spider-Man: Homecoming reboots the series for the second time in the past five years, with Tom Holland taking over the role of Peter Parker. Unlike the Spider-Man we meet in the films of Sam Raimi and Marc Webb, however, this Spider-Man has already been in costume for a while, ditching the origin story and moving right on to the neighborhood heroics. With Holland in the lead role, Homecoming provides us with the best interpretation of the classic superhero thus far. Holland perfectly captures the spirit of the character, awkward, charming, and humorous in equal measure. While Spider-Man 2 still remains the cinematic high point of Marvel's iconic wall-crawling webslinger, Homecoming comes close to knocking it off that perch.The film works because it's not concerned with over-the-top heroics of other MCU films where thousands of lives are at stake because of some nefarious plot. Watts' film is much more grounded and instead, Homecoming is content to masquerade as the 16th entry in this cinematic universe when it actually functions as more of a high school coming-of-age film in the vein of John Hughes' seminal '80s classics. The film serves as a breath of a fresh air in a post-The Dark Knight world, a fun lighthearted feature that provides as many laughs as it does thrills. Holland, whose work in J.A. Bayona's The Impossible convinced me that he was a great choice for the role, not only carries the film, but also pulls off the feat of being both a great Peter Parker and Spider-Man.Meanwhile, Michael Keaton's turn as the Vulture gives Spider-Man his best villain since Doc Ock, and a third act twist allows for the character to achieve a semblance of complexity rarely seen in most of the MCU's other films. Indeed, the Vulture works as a villain because he is cut from the same cloth as Spider-Man, an ordinary man whose life changes because of an unforeseen event. While other rogues in the MCU have been concerned with destroying the world or tearing the Avengers apart, the Vulture's main concern lies with protecting his family. Keaton's characterization allows for the Vulture to retain a sense of humanity that the audience can empathize with, even if his actions are indeed criminal.The rest of the cast remains strong all across the board. Zendaya makes the most of her role as Michelle, one of Peter's classmates, despite her limited screen time. Laura Harrier does a solid job as Liz, Parker's love interest, but the relationship between the two feels underdeveloped despite the couple of solid scenes that they share together. Meanwhile, Jacob Batalon serves as excellent comic relief in the role of Ned, Peter's best friend. The friendship between him and Peter is wholly believable, as the two of them struggle together to fit in. The characters that populate the high school all feel like genuine teenagers, including Tony Revolori's take on Flash Thompson. No longer a jock, Thompson instead serves as Parker's academic rival. While the portrayal of the character might anger long-term purists, it works for the film, even if Thompson can't quite be described as intimidating. On the other hand, Jon Favreau reprises his role as Happy Hogan, and his performance is one of the film's many highlights. Hogan's sarcastic demeanor opposite Parker's unbridled enthusiasm makes for some hilarious exchanges between the two. As for Robert Downey, Jr., I was glad to see that he truly was relegated to a supporting role. I enjoy the character of Tony Stark, but I felt that too much focus on his character could have potentially taken away from the film. However, unlike Captain America: Civil War, which could have easily been titled Avengers 2.5 despite being the third entry in the Captain America trilogy, this is first and foremost a Spider-Man film. While Downey, Jr. still plays an important role, he mainly functions as a sort of mentor for Parker, who still struggles to find his place in the world after the events of Civil War. And lastly, Marisa Tomei delivers a solid performance as Aunt May. Portraying the youngest interpretation of the character on screen thus far, she serves in equal doses as both a motherly figure and a friend to Parker.As for the film's action sequences, Watts allows for a great variety to them, straying away from the typical skyscraper action that has dominated prior Spider-Man films. Taking place anywhere from a bank to the Staten Island ferry and even the Washington Monument, each of these sequences proves thrilling while demonstrating that other films in the MCU need not put thousands of lives in danger to create tension. By grounding the action and the characters, Watts differentiates the film from the rest of the MCU and allows it to somewhat break free from the corporate mold by giving it a sense of purpose. The film functions as Parker's continuing struggles to grow as both a superhero and a high school student, and so Watts wisely relegates the action to the background.However, as previously mentioned, Homecoming only somewhat breaks from the corporate mold. The prologue, while necessary for understanding the development of the Vulture, feels awkwardly disconnected from the rest of the feature because it takes place directly after the Battle of New York in The Avengers. For the most part the Avengers material in the film works, and while I recognize it as a necessity, this material can't help but feel a bit tacked on in the greater scheme of the film.Overall, however, Homecoming delivers the wall-crawling webslinger's best outing on the silver screen since Spider-Man 2. In the hands of director Jon Watts and Tom Holland, Spider-Man once again becomes a joy to watch in this lighthearted feature that makes the most of its existence. Featuring one of the MCU's best villains in Michael Keaton's Vulture and a strong supporting cast, Homecoming continues 2017's trend of stellar superhero films.Rating: 8/10 (Great)",8,2,7,12 July 2017
Ant-Man," You'll Believe A Man Can Shrink
","Going into Ant-Man, I didn't know what to expect. Coming out, however, I was left pleasantly surprised. Ant-Man isn't the tightest or most well-made film in the MCU, but still manages to be quite entertaining. Deftly mixing humor and action, Ant-Man largely succeeds because of its leading man's performance, as well as its more personal and intimate focus, which reminds the audience that not every superhero/comic- book movie needs to end with a bombastic finale. First off, Paul Rudd delivers a charismatic performance that elevates the whole film which cements him as Scott Lang. Rudd makes the role his, proving the naysayers wrong by demonstrating that no one else could've been better for the role. Michael Douglas also shines in his role as Dr. Hank Pym, the creator of the Ant-Man suit and tech. Decades since his big-screen debut, Douglas continues to be an enjoyable presence in the films he stars in. Pym's daughter, Hope van Dyne, is played by Evangeline Lilly, who is quite solid and manages to be one of the better leading ladies in a Marvel production. The rest of the cast is also quite enjoyable, especially Michael Peña as Lang's former cellmate Luis, who manages to steal almost every scene that he is in. Although the supporting cast is solid, some of the characters feel underdeveloped, namely Corey Stoll's Darren Cross/Yellowjacket. Stoll's performance is actually quite solid, and he manages to make Yellowjacket a better villain than say, Christopher Eccleston's Malekith from Thor: The Dark World. However, as is the case for the majority of the films in the MCU, Yellowjacket simply doesn't compare to the rest of the film. His motivations for evil are murky at best and he deserved some more development to prevent him from feeling one- note. However, Yellowjacket is partially redeemed for the role he plays in one of Ant-Man's best aspects: its action sequences. Inventive and playing off of Ant-Man's powers wonderfully, these sequences help Ant-Man avoid the cut-and-paste feeling that now plague action movies and are genuinely captivating, despite the film's smaller scope. The action sequences also help the film establish its distinct identity in the ever-expanding MCU and it will be interesting to see how Ant- Man's powers are shown in future installments. The plot, which has been described as Marvel's first heist, is straightforward and simple, but not to the film's detriment. Instead of being bogged down by backstory and mythology, the film manages to keep its focus clear until its finale. The heist aspect manages to keep the film fresh compared to the other films in the MCU, and the actual heist is exciting to watch. The film wouldn't work quite as well as it does, however, if it weren't for its comedic side. Sure, not all the jokes land, but the majority do and there are quite a few laughs to be had during the two hours the film lasts. The balance between action, comedy, and drama struck by director Peyton Reed works very well.Being a fan of director Edgar Wright, I still do question how Ant- Man would've turned out if he had stayed in the director's chair. Reed does a nice job, but if Wright had stayed on board, I wonder if the film would've challenged Guardians of the Galaxy for the top spot in my rankings of the films in the MCU. Alas, Ant-Man manages to impress due to the strength of the performances, its inventive action, and its witty sense of humor.",8,3,7,26 July 2015
Watchmen," An Underrated Graphic Novel Masterpiece
","Director Zack Snyder did the impossible when he made 'Watchmen'. The critically acclaimed 1980s graphic novel the film is based off had been once been deemed 'unfilmable.' As I myself had read the graphic novel beforehand, I wondered how the complex and layered storyline of the novel would translate onto the screen. But as the end credits rolled before my eyes, I realized that my worries had been nonsensical, for Snyder had created one of the best superhero films of all time.Before I go any further into my review, I must say that I fully recommend reading the graphic novel first. It makes the film infinitely better and one is able to catch many small details throughout the film. Another recommendation I make is watching the Director's Cut (which I did for the review) or The Ultimate Cut. They both contain more scenes from the graphic novel, including the death of a notable character.Now, as I continue with my review, I must applaud the film's soundtrack. Featuring tracks such as Nat King Cole's 'Unforgettable' and Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah', 'Watchmen''s soundtrack is fantastic and one-of-a- kind, considering that fact that it's for a comic book movie. An opening credits scene set to the tune of Bob Dylan's 'The Times They Are A-Changin'' is downright incredible as well.The majority of the performances deserve praise as well. Jackie Earle Haley gives the performance of a lifetime as the vigilante Rorschach. After watching his performance, I can't imagine anyone else wearing the ever-changing inkblot mask. Patrick Wilson and Jeffrey Dean Morgan are superb as Nite Owl II and The Comedian. Billy Crudup and Malin Akerman also do a great job bringing their characters, Dr. Manhattan and Silk Spectre II to life. However, if the film does have a minor flaw, it's the casting of Matthew Goode in the role of Ozymandias. He is in no way bad, but sometimes lacks the screen presence that the world's smartest man commands.However, we now move on the plot, which unlike most adaptations, has remained mostly intact on film. The changes that have been made (particularly in the final act) do not hinder the film, and are ultimately for the better. Some of the graphic novel's content is just too weird for the big screen, but the changes made keep the spirit. In fact, I would dare say that 'Watchmen' is one of the most faithful adaptations I've ever seen. Although I feared that some of the best scenes from the graphic novel might not have included for whatever reason, the scenes were all there, and just as thrilling. If you've read the graphic novel, the plot keeps you just as enthralled, as the mystery is slowly uncovered.Props must again be given to Zack Snyder for doing the impossible and bringing the world of Alan Moore's fantastic graphic novel to life. The approaching peak of the Cold War and the countdown of the Doomsday Clock give the film a sense of background tension that stays with us until the conclusion closes. The world is interesting and visually striking, as it imagines a world where superheroes have existed for nearly 50 years. In the same way that Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons made 'Watchmen' appear unique and unlike any other graphic novel, Snyder has done the same thing with the film, making it stand out in a crowded genre.'Watchmen' is, without a doubt, Zack Snyder's masterpiece. A masterful adaptation of an already superb graphic novel, 'Watchmen' is unlike no other superhero movie. Deftly blending an iconic soundtrack with a complex, layered plot featuring some great performances and some visceral action sequences, 'Watchmen' is one of the greatest superhero films out there.And yet, even five years after its release, 'Watchmen' is still massively underrated. If you've already seen 'The Dark Knight' and you're looking for a thought-provoking film that has people dressed up in costumes, than look no further. 'Watchmen' is your best bet.10/10",10,2,4,8 August 2014
Baby Driver," Wright Delivers Another Winner
","Wow. Baby Driver might just be the best film director Edgar Wright has ever crafted. An exhilarating ride, Baby Driver serves as a showcase for Wright to combine everything he's learned in the director's chair up to this point, from quick-witted humor to high-octane action sequences and everything in between. Over twenty years in the making, from the first frame to the last, Wright's film fires on all cylinders in a glorious exercise of style.The film follows Baby (Ansel Elgort), a young getaway driver with tinnitus who constantly plays music to drown out the sound. To be fair, I wasn't quite sold on the film when I first heard about it. While I was intrigued by the premise, I didn't know quite how Wright would pull it off. But after the fantastic Three Flavors Cornetto trilogy and the criminally underrated Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Wright has knocked it out of the park for a fifth straight time, something I should have never doubted was possible. While I've heard other compare the film to 2011's Drive (but funnier) or 2016's La La Land (but with car chases), I actually think they're doing the film a disservice. Only Wright, a unique talent who continues to solidify himself as one of today's best directors, could have conceived of the spectacle featured in the film.Gone are the quirky British settings of Wright's previous films, with the whole of Baby Driver set in Atlanta. While I was a bit skeptical about this change, seeing as how a major part of my love for the films of the Three Flavors Cornetto trilogy had been their setting in England, Wright immediately sets the tone from the get-go, opening with a thrilling bank robbery sequence that includes a well-executed long take. The pressure just builds from there, as Wright crafts chases and shootouts with technical flair and superb skill. Bill Pope, who previously collaborated with Wright on The World's End and Scott Pilgrim, captures the proceedings beautifully, his superb camera-work showing through every scene. Visually stunning, Baby Driver is a wonder to behold on the big screen.Perhaps the most impressive of the film's many technical aspects is the editing, handled expertly by the duo of Jonathan Amoss and Paul Machliss. Wright's carefully curated soundtrack works perfectly in conjunction with whatever's on screen, allowing for the film to develop a unique, energetic rhythm unlike anything I've seen. And as for the soundtrack itself, it's one of the film's many assets, with Wright mixing songs both new and old to great sonic effect. Additionally, Wright makes sure that every song serves a purpose, allowing each one of them to shine.Baby Driver, however, isn't a conventional action film by any means. Remember, this an Edgar Wright film after all. The way the story unfolds allows for more than a few twists and turns that managed to keep me enthralled. Additionally, I was surprised that a supporting character's presence was entirely left out of the trailers. Considering marketing's propensity to leave no stone unturned when it comes to a film's trailers, it was refreshing to see that was not the case here. While I won't spoil who that character is, I will say that they help ground the story by providing an emotional tether for both Elgort and the audience that becomes indispensable the more I think about it.While the film undoubtedly belongs to Elgort in the lead role, who does a tremendous job acting opposite so many established stars, I was thoroughly surprised by how much I enjoyed Jon Hamm's role. Hamm simply owns it as Buddy. While Jamie Foxx might be more of a scene- stealer as the unpredictable Bats, it's Buddy that truly kept me on the edge of my seat. However, Foxx shines as well, delivering a performance entirely unhinged and yet, wholly believable. As for the rest of the cast, Lily James shines as well, bringing a lightness to the proceedings that provides a nice balance to the hardened criminals that make up the rest of the cast. Kevin Spacey atones for the sins of Nine Lives here, as the leader of the criminal outfit that Baby drives for. Spacey makes for a great criminal leader, delivering another electric performance in a career full of them. And Eiza González, who plays Buddy's wife Darling, turns in a solid turn as well, fierce and sensual in equal measure. While a slight part of me wishes that certain cast members had received more screen time, I do commend Wright for presenting a straightforward story that does not stumble over its own excess.As for the story itself, some might be surprised to find that Wright's focus here isn't so much on the humor, with the film having perhaps the darkest tone of all of his films. Whereas in his previous films, the death of a character was usually treated with humor and levity, the stakes here are definitely higher. However, make no mistake, the clever writing that has shaped each of Wright's previous films remains intact. While Wright's emphasis does shift a bit more towards delivering genuine thrills than I was expecting, he succeeds graciously. But both the thrills and humor are all in service of one thing: Wright's script. And with his script, Wright accomplishes his goal of delivering an entertaining, rollicking crime romp complete with a fantastic soundtrack and well-rounded characters.Wright is simply at the top of his directorial game here. His directorial trademarks, from the way he handles transitions to the sublime usage of visual storytelling, are all here and put to splendid use. But above all, Baby Driver is kinetic entertainment, a bright spot in an otherwise mediocre summer movie season. I walked out of the theater feeling electrified, eager for another opportunity to see the film again. Simply put, Baby Driver is the most fun I've had at the theater in a long, long time.Rating: 10/10 (Masterpiece)",10,25,50,22 June 2017
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," The Best Spider-Man Film Since SPIDER-MAN 2
","The best Spider-Man film since SPIDER-MAN 2. An animated spectacle that not only invigorates, but transcends the superhero genre, resulting in not just the best superhero film of the year, but one of the best films of the year. This films understands the idea of Spider-Man better than any other Spider-Man film before it, recognizing the factors that have allowed this character to have become one of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's most beloved creations. At the end of the day, whether you're talking about Miles Morales or Peter Parker, Spider-Man's 'just a kid,' as a bystander once said during SPIDER-MAN 2's most emotionally resonant scene. He might be 'just a kid', but he's a kid endowed with superhuman powers who endeavors to use them for good, who represents not only the best of what humanity should be, but what the best of humanity can be. The original SPIDER-MAN is the first film that I can remember seeing in a movie theater, and although there are a quite a few films that I would deem superior to any take on the famed webslinger, the character will nonetheless always hold a special place in my heart.While I'm not very familiar with the story of Miles Morales, Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, and Rodney Rothman's film does an excellent job introducing the audience to a character every bit as compelling as Peter Parker, with Shameik Moore bringing Morales to life with oodles of heart and charm. However, what most surprised me about the film was Jake Johnson's take on Peter Parker. Tom Holland might have finally captured the essence of the character better than both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield before him, but Johnson delivers my favorite take on the character thus far as a 40-year-old Parker stuck in a midlife crisis. Superheroes have a tendency to either not age or age very slowly, but Johnson's Parker is a man who has spent over half his life being a superhero, as who has thus seen the unavoidable toll such a life takes on the people around you. These ideas provide Parker with a fascinating character arc, but they thankfully don't overshadow that of Morales, as we watch him grow into New York's friendly neighborhood Spider-Man right before our very eyes.This might be yet another origin story in a genre that has seen more than its fair share of them, but SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE feels different and fresh, which is a testament to Phil Lord and Rodney Rothman's script, which infuses Morales' journey with plenty of heart and wit. There are some poignant scenes in the film on par with anything in Raimi's original trilogy, from a death scene in the first act that sets the stage for Morales' story to a scene between Morales and his father (voiced to perfection by Brian Tyree Henry) at the end of the second act. Additionally the other 'Spider-Men,' including Nicolas Cage's 1930s Spider-Noir and John Mulaney's Spider-Ham, are an absolute riot. I definitely wouldn't have minded spending some more time with those characters. Watching INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE was a cinematic experience like few others, thanks in part to the absolutely dazzling and dynamic 3D animation, which descends into a mesmerizing explosion of color during the final act and is unlike anything I have ever seen. That the film contains one of Stan Lee's best cameos to date is simply the cherry on top.And the post-credits scene is seriously an all-timer. Might be the best one of these since *checks notes* FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF.",8,4,38,10 December 2018
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," 19 Years And Counting
","The first Mission: Impossible movie I ever saw was Ghost Protocol. I left the theater exhilarated, and as I waited for Rogue Nation to make its big-screen debut, I watched the three other films in the series. Now, having seen Rogue Nation, I can easily say that it is one of the series' best films, and almost matches the high bar that Ghost Protocol set a couple years back. What makes the Mission: Impossible series so distinct is that each film has had a different director, making them all feel unique and fresh. Surely, it's a given that some of the directors have been better than others, but Christopher McQuarrie, the director of this fifth entry, manages to craft a slick film that is better than it has any right to be. Set shortly after Ghost Protocol, Rogue Nation continues the ongoing spy escapades of IMF agent Ethan Hunt, as he searches for evidence of a criminal organization known as the Syndicate. Hunt is suddenly caught by the same people he is looking for, but escapes from being killed with the help of Syndicate member Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson, replacing Paula Patton as our lead female) and the stage is set for another globe- trotting adventure, as Hunt is cut off from the now defunct IMF and is left on his own. With Rogue Nation, Tom Cruise continues to prove that there isn't an action star in Hollywood quite like him. Even though he's 53 years old, Cruise continues to be do many of his own stunts, with the results being quite spectacular. The airplane stunt featured in many of the film's promotional materials is simply incredible, even if it doesn't quite top the Burj Khalifa setpiece of the previous film. Apart from Cruise, the rest of the cast is also quite stellar. Ferguson makes for a compelling presence on the screen opposite Cruise and I hope she bucks the trend of each Mission: Impossible film having a different leading lady by appearing in the inevitable Mission: Impossible 6. Simon Pegg continues to steal every scene he's in as computer expert Benji. The unusual pairing of Jeremy Renner and Ving Rhames also works to a surprising degree, as the two of them play off each other very well. Alec Baldwin also gets a few moments of greatness in his small role as the director of the CIA. Sean Harris, who plays the film's villain, Solomon Lane, also gives a solid performance. However, his performance is undercut by one of the film's weaknesses - his character simply isn't that developed. Harris does the best with what he's given, but what's given isn't enough. However, he isn't the worst villain in the franchise, for that honor still belongs to Dougray Scott's from Mission: Impossible II. On the flip side, Christopher McQuarrie does a great job pulling double-duty by having both written and directed the film. His direction is precise and he keeps the tension throughout, especially during the film's action sequences, which always manage to impress. In particular, a motorcycle chase through Morocco is a highlight. Robert Elswit's cinematography takes advantage of the film's spectacular vistas and locations, and McQuarrie's direction always makes the action easy to follow. His script is simple, yet still has enough twists and turns to prevent the film from ever feeling generic. Sure, plot holes are sure to pop up if one looks closely, but while watching, the film makes us forget about all that. McQuarrie also deserves credit for mixing action and humor successfully, and always keeps the atmosphere fun. In the end, Rogue Nation proves to be one of the better popcorn flicks of this summer. In my opinion, it doesn't quite match Ghost Protocol, but it didn't leave me disappointed in the slightest. Everyone involved, from the cast to the crew, is at the top of their games here. Filled with humor, action, and spectacle, Rogue Nation proves that even though 19 years have passed since the first Mission: Impossible premiered, the series still hasn't lost a step.",7,2,4,2 August 2015
Dunkirk," Nolan's Latest is His Greatest
","Viewed in IMAX 70MM.Dunkirk arrives with a bang, further solidifying writer-director Christopher Nolan as one of the best filmmakers working today. Nolan presents the tense World War II thriller as a triptych, detailing the evacuation of Dunkirk from the perspectives of land, sea, and air. Perhaps the film's most astounding achievement is that we never see the Germans. The film's focus remains entirely on the evacuating Allied soldiers and those sent to support their efforts. By never showing the Germans on screen, Nolan presents them as a looming specter over the Allied forces, an invisible presence that can surprise them at every turn. This only adds another level of tension to a film that manages to sustain a taut, uneasy atmosphere for nearly its entire runtime. Nolan's main concern lies with answering the question of whether or not these soldiers will manage to escape. As such, we never once are transported to a war room to watch military leaders quarrel about what the next move should be. Instead, we follow three distinct groups: soldiers that include newcomer Fionn Whitehead's Tommy, a couple of RAF pilots led by Tom Hardy's Farrier, and a small boat crew led by Mark Rylance's Mr. Dawson.I got the opportunity to see Dunkirk in IMAX 70mm and I only wish more people could as well. The enormous screen and earth-rattling sound place you right in the center of the action to potent effect. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema again teams up with Nolan after previously collaborating on Interstellar to awe-inspiring results. Around 90% of the film makes full usage of the towering screen, with only a few sequences presented in a more traditional letterboxed style. Nolan and Hoytema use the larger frame to their advantage, crafting spell- binding shots at every junction, whether it be a close-up shot of a pilot's face or the sweeping image of thousands of soldiers waiting on a beach. Dunkirk demands to be seen on the largest screen possible.The film also marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and composer Hans Zimmer. The explosive, ever-present score from Zimmer serves as the model accompaniment for the film, the stirring urgency of the music matched effortlessly with the harrowing images of war and escape. Another Oscar nomination for Zimmer would not be a surprise. But the way that the score mixes with the sounds of the battlefield is an achievement in its own right. Explosions boom and gunshots ring, fighter planes and bullets whizzing by. But through all the chaos, all the madness, Zimmer's score serves as a ticking stopwatch, counting down the minutes as the palpable threat from the Germans grows.Despite the relative simplicity of its storyline, Dunkirk is perhaps Nolan's most experimental feature. His three stages of war all unfold over various time frames, which are interwoven by Lee Smith's masterful editing, creating a non-linear narrative that astounds with both its sweeping scope and intimate, poignant emotional beats. The sparse use of dialogue also stands out. Nolan revels in visual storytelling, employing dialogue only when necessary, with the soldiers communicating their fears through their actions rather than through conversation. Admittedly, the characters that populate the world of Dunkirk are not the most developed, but they are all defined by their desire to make it back home. They are all tethered by this longing, and we can feel their mutual trepidation and hope as they struggle to find a way out of Dunkirk.Unconventionally, the majority of the soldiers of Nolan's film are not heroic figures, especially those on land. The event that Nolan uses as the basis for his film is historic not because it marked a major victory for Allied forces, but because the British suffered an ignominious rout. As such, some of these men are terrified for their lives, while others, knowing very well that any moment could be their last, subsist solely on their love of country. Every actor across the board, from established British stars like Kenneth Branagh to newcomers like Whitehead expertly bring their characters to life. Whitehead and Harry Styles both deliver great performances as two inexperienced soldiers determined to survive. Meanwhile, in the air, Hardy simply dominates the screen, his steely gaze working wonders as a substitute for conventional dialogue. The film's best performance belongs to the magnificently understated Rylance, who delivers a heroic performance as a sailor who navigates his yacht towards Dunkirk to save lives, despite the danger that awaits.This danger manifests itself in a manifold of ways. A soldier stranded at sea remarks that he is the lone survivor of a U-boat attack. Farrier and his fellow pilots engage German fighters over the Channel. In a haunting opening sequence, Tommy runs desperately through the streets of Dunkirk, evading enemy fire. The film's action sequences benefit from Nolan's skillful direction, and the aerial dogfights, in particular, stand out amongst the rest. Hoytema's camera captures the proceedings with such precision that it puts the action in most Hollywood blockbusters to shame. While his camera hardly ever lingers on the carnage of war, Hoytema knows when to draw out the tension, creating sequences that left me breathless.With his latest, Nolan delivers another masterpiece that might just be his best film yet. It works as a demonstration of bravery, a celebration of courage, and an acknowledgment of fear in the face of adversity. While not my favorite Nolan flick , Dunkirk delivers a cinematic experience unlike anything I've ever seen. The way Nolan so adeptly sustains the tension throughout is simply mesmerizing and a testament to his directorial prowess. Packed with stunning IMAX camera-work from Hoytema, some of Zimmer's best work to date, a talented cast giving it their all, and an underlying message that underscores the need for hope, Dunkirk is a rousing spectacle from a director at the top of his game, and the best film of 2017 thus far.Rating: 10/10 (Masterpiece)",10,5,15,22 July 2017
The Favourite," Lanthimos Delivers... But The Ending Could Use Some Work
","Sumptuous and stunning. With THE FAVOURITE, director Yorgos Lanthimos delivers his best film yet - one that works as both a historical drama and a sex comedy that features beautiful cinematography courtesy of Robbie Ryan (Lanthimos really loves him some fisheye lenses) and gorgeous costume design courtesy of Sandy Powell (just give her the Oscar already because wow). Lanthimos, working for the first time with a screenplay that he didn't co-write, deals primarily with themes of power and the way it impacts the three women at the center of the film. Despite not having had a hand in writing the screenplay, Lanthimos seems to be in his wheelhouse, crafting a stirring yet (darkly) humorous rumination on humankind's innate desire to posses power, whether it be political, sexual, or anything in between. Granted, Lanthimos is also working with some of the most talented actresses working today and the big three (Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz, and Emma Stone) all deliver some of the best work of their career. As crazy as it might sound, however, and despite Colman's Best Actress win at Venice for her portrayal of Queen Anne, this is Stone's film. I'm already frustrated by the fact that she will be campaigned in the Best Supporting Actress field despite the fact that the film wholly follows her arc. That's not to take anything from Colman, whose performance is likely the most impressive of the three, but I do feel it's something to take note of.However, the film isn't flawless, and it once again demonstrates that Lanthimos' greatest weakness as a director is his inability to deliver a satisfying conclusion. I loved THE LOBSTER, but the last ten minutes left a bitter taste in my mouth that I detested. I was a bit cooler on THE KILLING OF A SACRED DEER, and the last ten minutes proved a bit too dark for me. This time, even a great final shot isn't enough to save the last fifteen minutes of the film from seeming necessary. The film simply (and suddenly) runs out of steam before it crosses the finish line - an unfortunate occurrence considering the fact that nearly everything before it proved wickedly entertaining. That being said, I'm excited to see what Lanthimos does next. I just hope he nails the ending.",8,454,663,22 September 2018
The Mist," Darabont Loses Some of The Film's Potential In the Titular Mist...
","Writer-director Frank Darabont's The Mist is a film I wanted to like a lot more than I ended up liking. This is, after all, another Stephen King adaptation from the same director who brought to the screen the greatest King adaptation of all, The Shawshank Redemption (it edges The Shining by a hair.) But instead, I was left with a certain feeling of dissatisfaction when the credits started rolling, a feeling that was likely compounded by the film's absolute sucker punch of an ending. The film follows a group of individuals taking refuge in a grocery store after an unnatural mist covers the town after a violent thunderstorm the night prior. Inside the mist, hide supernatural monsters that threaten the residents' existence. King used the original story to tell a story about human beings in the face of extreme odds, a concept that Darabont entertains to generally successful results. There's a lot to admire here, but there's also a handful of flaws that hold it back from reaching greatness.For one, Thomas Jane feels miscast as the film's protagonist, David Drayton, a freelance artist. In fact, he almost single-handedly ruins the film's ending because he makes it nearly impossible to take him seriously. The misfire of his casting stands out both because of his somewhat wooden performance and for the simple reason that everyone else in the cast fits their role like a glove. Marcia Gay Harden delivers an excellent performance as Mrs. Carmody, a fanatical Christian who believes that the mist signifies the coming of the apocalypse. Playing the film's despicable antagonist, Harden delivers stellar work, demonstrating that sometimes the real monster isn't lurking around in the shadows, but rather standing right next to you. Toby Jones also turns in a solid performance as Ollie Weeks, the assistant manager of the store, gradually transforming from a seemingly meek individual to one of Drayton's essential allies as the rift between Drayton's group and Carmody's followers grows. Even Laurie Holden, who has often been slighted for her role as Andrea in AMC's The Walking Dead manages to deliver. Playing Amanda Dumfries, an elementary school teacher, Holden makes the most of her somewhat limited material. Apart from Drayton, the rest of these characters lack depth, but the performers make for a saving grace.The film does tackle some thought-provoking ideas and themes, examining the way human beings react to extreme situations. Considering the film's release a decade ago, Darabont prominently focuses on the rift that forms between the aforementioned groups, which serves as an obvious parallel for the Bush-era conflict between Christian, right-wing thinking and more secular, left-wing ideology. While it wouldn't have hurt to portray the groups with a bit more nuance (the division between the two becomes entirely too clear), Darabont deserves credit for his willingness to make a horror film with more than just scares on its mind. But as for the horror, that's where Darabont's film excels. There are genuine moments of dread and terror throughout, as the groups in the supermarket deal with both the creatures of the mist and themselves. And Darabont accomplishes this by establishing a convincingly ominous atmosphere rather than relying on jump scares. The film feels like a monster movie from the '50s, and I really wish I could have been able to watch the B&W version.However, Darabont's writing falters when compared to his directing. About halfway through the film, a romance scene occurred between two minor characters that felt incredibly jarring considering that the majority of the film had focused on Drayton up to that point. Furthermore, the next time we see these characters, one of them immediately dies at the hands of the creatures, as Darabont seems to believe that a shoehorned romance scene mere moments prior will be enough to raise the emotional stakes of their death. It just doesn't work though and feels more like lazy storytelling than anything else. Now I can't comment on how much development King's original novella offers for these two characters, but considering Darabont's willingness to tweak the ending, he could have fleshed out the relationships between these characters more. And as for that ending, I can't say that I necessarily agree with it. Darabont's conclusion delves into far darker territory than that of the novella's, creating a genuinely shocking moment. I do appreciate that he didn't deliver a forced happy ending. But his ending, one so ruthlessly bleak and nihilistic, probably should have been scrapped in favor of the ambiguity that the original ending provides.I wish that I hadn't been left slightly disappointed by The Mist. While there's plenty to enjoy, from the taut scares to the retro '50s vibe and the generally solid performances, storytelling problems and the soul-crushing ending hold it back from entering the upper echelon of King adaptations.Rating: 7/10 (Good)",7,0,1,8 August 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," The Spider Can't Save Everything
","Although it was completely unnecessary, I enjoyed 'The Amazing Spider- Man' and thought it to be a good, if not great, addition to the franchise. However, I don't feel the same way regarding the latest installment, 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2'.After a prologue that showcases the ultimate fate of Peter's parents, 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' picks up shortly after where the first one let off. Our hero, Peter Parker has hooked up with Gwen Stacy yet again, despite the promise that Peter made at the end of 'The Amazing Spider-Man'. This promise, however, is a source of inner turmoil for Peter as he struggles between being Spider-Man and loving Gwen. Gwen soon breaks up with him and Peter is left alone.It is this relationship between Peter and Gwen that prevents the film from being an outright disaster. Their relationship is one of the film's sole bright spots, and is way better than the relationship between MJ and Peter in the original trilogy. They share strong chemistry, which is in no doubt due to the fact that they are a couple off the set as well. Emma Stone gives a strong performance as Gwen and Andrew Garfield is also a good Peter/Spider-Man (although it is debatable whether or not he is better than Tobey Maguire.)The rest of the cast is a mixed bag. Sally Field is a good, but underutilized, Aunt May. The truth of the matter, however, is that there are simply too many villains. The film has 'Spider-Man 3 syndrome' and as a result, it suffers. Even though Jamie Foxx's Electro is the main villain, his motivations for wanting to plunge the Big Apple into eternal darkness are simply non-existent. His transformation from office nerd to super-villain is hardly believable. Meanwhile, Dane DeHann's Harry Osborn is initially a strong character but is then given some of the film's most laughable scenes in which he overacts. And just like Electro, his transformation to super-villain occurs way too fast. Paul Giamatti's Russian gangster is laughable and I could barely understand anything that he said during his brief appearances in the film. The only reason he is shoehorned in is to setup the upcoming Sinister Six film.The villains aren't the films only weak point. The plot is a bit disjointed and unevenly paced, as it sags in the middle. The soundtrack, despite being composed by Hans Zimmer (who composed the soundtrack for 'The Dark Knight' and 'Inception'), is uneven as well, with some of the music working well and the rest being some of his most unremarkable work. Meanwhile, the action scenes are fairly entertaining with a sequence in Times Square being the standout.However, the film concludes in what is arguably one of the most heartbreaking scenes in a Spider-Man film. As our hero tries to save the girl he loves he inadvertently snaps her neck with he suddenly breaks her fall. The resulting scenes of mourning showcase true emotion as our hero is heartbroken and in anguish. Although Gwen's death is one of the best scenes in the movie, it is also one of the worst. Her relationship with Peter, as stated before, was one of the film's sole highlights, and now, subsequent films will suffer for it. What might have seemed as a great idea during the production of this film might not seem like such a great one if Peter and any subsequent love interest lack chemistry.Despite an uneven plot and soundtrack, as well as an assortment of underdeveloped villains, 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' is somewhat saved by the relationship between our eponymous hero and Gwen Stacy, as well as the emotional scenes they share, and by some thrilling action sequences (even if I feel that the special effects weren't all there for this $200 million film.)All in all, this film could have been worse. It could have been 'Spider-Man 3'.6/10",5,1,4,26 July 2014
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Boldest Blockbuster in Years
","9/10Audacious and even somewhat bizarre, yet ultimately incredibly rewarding, THE LAST JEDI definitely feels like a film in which director Rian Johnson had complete directorial control and more often than not that is a very, very good thing. The film isn't perfect, and not by a long shot. After opening with a blisteringly thrilling forty-five minutes that features one of the series' best dogfights and the resolution of the infamous cliffhanger at the end of THE FORCE AWAKENS, the film begins to creak under the weight of multiple ongoing subplots, none so more than the unfocused casino storyline, which has received the brunt of fan criticism thus far, and rightly so. But before things get too out of hand, Johnson brings everything together with an unpredictable and astonishing final hour that delivers momentous sequence after momentous sequence, cementing Johnson as a master storyteller who could care less about fan expectations. While THE FORCE AWAKENS was criticized for being 'too derivative' of A NEW HOPE, one of the main criticisms THE LAST JEDI has received thus far is that it skews too far from any previous STAR WARS film. To fans of the franchise: you can't have it both ways.Did I enjoy it more than THE FORCE AWAKENS? It's hard to say, and I don't think I'll have the answer to that question even after a rewatch. Compared to its predecessor, THE LAST JEDI definitely has more than its fair share of flaws. It's overlong, although I admittedly have trouble finding what, if anything, should be cut, and the moment in which one of the characters briefly turns into Neo from THE MATRIX RELOADED left me scratching my head. But the stuff in here that works, works. The relationship between Rey and Luke (Mark Hamill's performance is easily the best in any STAR WARS film thus far), the further development of Kylo Ren, the revelations regarding the background of one the main characters, the thrilling action sequences (one of the film's lightsaber duels left me stunned), Steve Yedlin's series-best cinematography (those reds!), and as always, John Williams' magnificent score. Even the humor mostly works, thanks to Johnson's own idiosyncratic tendencies (would any other filmmaker have included that close-up shot of the iron?), and the fact that porgs are infinitely better than ewoks.And simply put, there hasn't been any other film this year that I walked out of and immediately said 'I want to see that again as soon as possible.' And that one shot where the sound drops out is pure cinematic brilliance. Definitely the boldest blockbuster in years.",9,0,2,17 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," One of the MCU's Better Sequels
","In 2014, Guardians of the Galaxy arrived in theaters as the biggest creative risk that Marvel Studios had undertaken at the time. A ragtag group of superheroes comprised of aliens, a talking tree, and a cybernetic raccoon surely couldn't have been the easiest sell at the office. But the film ended up being an absolute blast, a refreshing blast of fresh air that still holds its place as my favorite film in the MCU. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 isn't the blast of fresh air that its predecessor was, but it is an entertaining sequel that further develops the relationships between these characters while providing more of its predecessor's trademark humor and colorful action. Make no mistake, director James Gunn takes full advantage of the color spectrum here, crafting a film with loads of visual splendor. This is a gorgeous film to look at, the bleak gray color palettes of the DCEU be gone.The film takes a place a few months after the events of its predecessor as we find the Guardians working for the egotistical Sovereign, a golden, space-faring race. However, when Rocket steals something he shouldn't have, the gang takes off on an adventure that leads them to Ego, Star-Lord's long-lost father, all while being pursued by Yondu's Ravagers, the Sovereign, Nebula, and having to once again save the galaxy. Sound like a lot? Well, it is. While Gunn does his best to handle the multiple plot threads, the film isn't as tightly-focused as the first, the story relegated to the background in favor of action, characters, and humor. The film doesn't suffer entirely because of its character-centric focus, however. The tense relationship between Gamora and Nebula receives some much-needed fleshing-out, while we also learn more about Rocket's struggle to come to terms with his own existence. These developments are welcome, but I can't help but think that they would have worked better had Gunn cut down on the sheer number of characters in his screenplay.However, the ending provides a much-needed emotional punch that seems like a rarity in today's superhero films. While the climactic third act action bonanza doesn't do much more than provide an explosion of colors and sound, the film's final ten minutes are truly emotional. There are actual stakes in this film, which is something that cannot be said for a majority of the films in the MCU. It gets tiring watching the heroes just pack it up after the fight and call it a day, but that's not the case here.If there's one area where Gunn succeeds in his screenplay, it comes in the humor. He cranks the humor dial up to eleven and the overwhelming majority land with flying colors. I was genuinely surprised with the number of raunchy jokes that Disney allowed. And not only is Drax's comedic timing impeccable, but so is his laugh. Dave Bautista can act (Drax's scene with Mantis on Ego's planet in which they both look out over the landscape is beautifully touching.) Three years after the Guardians' first adventure, I couldn't help but smile seeing them again on the big screen. Bradley Cooper remains a delight playing Rocket Raccoon, who's likely still my favorite member of the Guardians. Zoë Saldana continues her sci-fi domination with yet another strong performance as Gamora, who has some of the film's more emotional moments opposite Karen Gillan's wonderful Nebula. Chris Pratt remains as charismatic as ever as Star-Lord, but I did feel that a couple of his lines could have been delivered with a bit more nuance. And I will say that although I enjoyed Baby Groot's presence in the film, I did find myself feeling that Gunn was trying a bit too much at times to capture the magic of the first film.The real stars of the show here, however, are Kurt Russell as Ego and Michael Rooker as Yondu. Ego makes for a complex individual and Russell handles his overall arc with skill. Rooker, who has long been an underrated character actor, actually delivers the best performance in the film. Unexpectedly winding up as the film's emotional core, Yondu makes for a fascinating character. Above all, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a film about family. Sure, during a scene or two I thought to myself 'Wow, when I did start watching a Fast and the Furious movie?' but Gunn does a bang-up job exploring his ideas by way of Star-Lord's two fathers: Yondu and Ego. Reflected against the Guardians, who have found a family amongst themselves, the film manages to explore some admittedly well-trodden territory, but in a way that feels somewhat fresh and allows for a majority of the questions that were posed in its predecessor to receive a satisfactory answer.While Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 doesn't reinvent the wheel when it comes to superhero sequels, I couldn't help but leave the theater in a happy mood (and I'm pretty sure I was the last one to leave because I don't think anyone was expecting 5 whole mid-/post-credits scenes.) It doesn't quite match the freshness of its predecessor, but it does succeed at being more than your run-of-the-mill blockbuster thanks to Gunn's wildly imaginative mind. Armed with another fantastic soundtrack, vibrant action sequences, solid performances and quite a bit of wit, the film manages to make up for its somewhat uneven storyline. And if there's anything in this film that's an absolutely unquestionable improvement from its predecessor, it's the villain. Give us more villains like this one, Marvel.Rating: 8/10 (Great)",8,2,6,4 August 2017
The Cabin in the Woods," Goddard & Whedon Craft an Entertaining Yet Uneven Horror Satire
","It's hard to write about The Cabin in the Woods without spoiling parts of the narrative, but that's what the spoiler tag is for, right? The film knows exactly what it wants to be: a horror film focusing on the classic 'college kids in a cabin' trope that simultaneously riffs on the genre as a whole with a biting satirical edge. But it doesn't quite reach its lofty aspirations. It's obvious that director and co- writer Drew Goddard, as well as his fellow co-writer Joss Whedon, are attempting to put a new spin on a genre that has become stale, inundated with cheap jump scares and cardboard characters. In that regard, the film succeeds masterfully by taking a well-trodden premise and turning the film into a refreshingly original genre exercise. Sure, the film begins like many other horror films, with a group of five college kids venturing out into the woods to stay in a cabin, but the story soon manifests itself into something entirely. Yet the inherent nature of the film's story causes some problems.The film contains a secondary narrative parallel to that of the college students, in which a secret organization manipulates the environment around the cabin in an attempt to lead the kids to their eventual doom. Because of this, however, the film unavoidably telegraphs some of its scares. Perhaps this was Goddard and Whedon's intention, but it prevents the film's scares from reaching their full potential. Some good does come from this secondary storyline though. Goddard and Whedon give Bradley Whitford and Richard Jenkins quite a few of the film's best jokes and the seasoned actors take full advantage of the opportunity. Portraying the two technicians in charge of the operation, Whitford and Jenkins fully buy into the film's strange vision and play off each other wonderfully. However, the principal characters make for a decidedly more uneven bunch. Kristen Connolly delivers the best performance of the five as the classic female horror heroine while Chris Hemsworth makes for an amusing sight as the typical American jock. But while Goddard and Whedon acknowledge that these characters are purposefully stereotypes, that doesn't change the fact that they're still stereotypes. And let me tell you, Fran Kranz's stoner-shtick gets quite tiresome.Ultimately, both story lines coalesce in a climactic (and bloody) final act that proves inventive and yet screams 'look at everything we know about horror films!' I do enjoy the ultimate meta-idea that Goddard and Whedon present: that every slasher movie ever made functions as a way to appease The Ancient Ones, towering deities that can only be satisfied through annual ritual sacrifices around the world. However, it's a bit unfortunate that the tightly composed scares and eerie atmosphere of the film's first two acts give way to an uproarious bloodbath, even if it does pay homage to a multitude of horror classics. The last few minutes of the film lost me completely though. I'm fine with horror films having bleak endings (despite their weaknesses, this year's Life and Alien: Covenant both had satisfyingly bleak endings that fit the tone of their story), but Goddard and Whedon seriously put the fate of the entire planet into the hands of a perpetually baked stoner who ultimately decides that humanity isn't worth saving. Quite the selfish call, if you ask me.While Goddard and Whedon don't quite pull off the tricky balancing act of dark humor and horror that The Cabin in the Woods requires, the film still makes for a deliriously entertaining time as it simultaneously pays homage to horror films while critiquing everything from their characters to their story lines. The film's biggest success, however, might be in how it implores horror filmmakers to take creative risks. If the failure of the other rituals around the world signifies anything, it's that we have become overly familiarized with the immutable horror tropes that have dominated the genre in the past several decades. It's time for a change. And when Goddard and Whedon can create something this original from age-old ideas, who's to argue?Rating: 7/10 (Good)",7,0,1,16 August 2017
Up in the Air," An Unexpectedly Moving Dramedy
","I wasn't expecting Up in the Air's last fifteen minutes to hit me like they did. But writer-director Jason Reitman's film packs a punch. The film follows Ryan Bingham, a corporate 'downsizer' who spends the majority of his time traveling from city to city. Contrary to what one might think, Bingham enjoys the constant traveling. His Omaha apartment is bare and the 43 days that he had to spend there the year prior are described as 'miserable.' One night in Dallas, he meets Alex Goran, a traveling businesswoman, and the two immediately hit it off due to their similar lifestyles. George Clooney is in top form as the cynical Bingham, whose career has insulated him from human contact. His chemistry with Alex is palpable, exemplified by the twinkle in their eyes when they look at each other for the first time to the way that they interact when Bingham gives her a tour of his old high school.Reitman's writing establishes the connection between these characters but Clooney and Vera Farmiga bring it to life. Farmiga herself delivers a performance that rivals Clooney's, magnificently capturing the sensuality and tenacity required to make her character work. And as a recent Cornell grad named Natalie Keener who has big plans for the future of the company that Bingham works for, Anna Kendrick delivers her best work to date. Keener accompanies Bingham on his travels in order to learn about the difficulties that he faces in telling workers that the company that they are working for has decided to unemploy them. In the process, Kendrick captures Keener's naivety remarkably, and we watch her wide-eyed enthusiasm fade away because of the draining task at hand.Reitman succeeds brilliantly at transporting the audience right back to the late-2000s, bringing memories of the economic downturn back to the forefront. In a stroke of genius, Reitman interviewed dozens of recently laid-off workers and included segments of these interviews in the film. While they don't take up too much time, they do touch on the bitter realities of unemployment and the recession. However, the film is primarily a character study focused on Bingham, with existential undertones and moments of genuine hilarity. Because of his relationship with Alex (and to a lesser degree, his relationship with Keener), Bingham begins to let his cynical exterior fade away and falls in love, despite his aversion to marriage and lack of human connection. I suspect that it's this subtle shift in character that Reitman and Clooney so expertly portray that allowed for the last fifteen minutes of the film to land with such a brute emotional impact.Up in the Air proved a more difficult watch than I was expecting. Not because it requires superior intellect to decode its jokes or anything of the like, but because it's deviously complex. The relationships between our three leads are one thing, but Reitman's willingness to comment on mass unemployment and human connection, all with an existential touch, is something else entirely. And all the way up to its unexpectedly moving (and somewhat devastating) conclusion, the film manages to delight and entertain.Rating: 8/10 (Great)",8,1,2,18 August 2017
