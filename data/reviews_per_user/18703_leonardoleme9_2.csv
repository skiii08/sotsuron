The Avengers," What's the hype all about?
","I've just come back from the movies and I don't understand what's the hype all about (i seriously want my money back). The trailers showed lots of action scenes with fights and everything so that's what I was expecting. What I get? 1 hour and a half of pointless dialogs and discussions among childish Iron Man and Captain America (just to say the ones that are worse).After this 1 and a half hour, I was actually rooting for Loki, even though he was a very poor character with not much of a personality or anything that can differentiate him from the clich√© villain. Towards the end, the movie gets a little bit better with lots of action (plus the fact that I love the idea of the superheroes together). But thats all! And it's nothing really different from other films that I've seen lately.There was one last problem about the movie and all it's hype: the movie theater was crowded and everyone was laughing so hard at scenes that weren't funny at all! They should really decide between an action movie or a comedy and make a good one.*The ending scene, right before the last credits, makes a reference to a possible sequel, I presume. I can just imagine how bad it'll be if they follow the same pattern as this one!",5,7,24,5 May 2012
12 Angry Men," just brilliant!
","A movie with 1 hour and a half showing 12 men arguing inside a room is what one would expect to be a big failure. This one is not. It may be the best movie I've seen in my life. The actors work beautifully and the dialogs are placed in a both intriguing and, sometimes, funny way. Henry Fonda does a great job convincing the other 11 men that a boy is innocent (or at least, not surely guilty) of the murder of his father. I was amazed at how he and some other men, as they dispose of their original opinion, arrange their arguments in order to show that the boy may be innocent - and that is another beautiful thing: there is no way one can determine, from the arguments given, whether the boy is or is not guilty. That's where the viewer's imagination takes part.I only imagine how it is to be a lawyer and watch this movie. It must be one the best jury experiences one can ever witness. A perfect 10.",10,0,0,26 May 2012
