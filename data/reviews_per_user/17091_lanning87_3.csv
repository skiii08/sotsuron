Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Jagshemash!
","Well, how can I start? This movie is AWESOME!! Well, I give you more details. First: I have to admit that although I live in Hungary, I don't know much about Kazahstan. But does it matter? Does it matter when I can see two guys who are scared of a Jewish man and his wife? Or the rodeo scene? Nooooooooo! With this movie, Sacha Baron Cohen gave us a perfect comedy, which is clearly one of this year's best. Even if it's filled with rude and disgusting, but also extremely not PC jokes, everybody can just go, see and enjoy it - if it won't be success, he'll be execute!! But I must tell, that there was one scene which was very bad: the naked chase, of course. This was simply too much! Wrestling (naked) on the bed because the producer is masturbating to the Baywatch magazine, then run into the hall... But simultaneously, everybody who enjoyed this film must admit: he is a complete idiot!'Kazahstan is the greatest country in the world....'Long live Borat!",9,3,9,15 November 2006
Akira," Akira-sama banzai!
","It's been almost a year since I've first seen this movie. At first, I couldn't understand why is this such a big anime, so I decided that I will give it another chance. After second time, I gave it another. And another. Now I've seen it about 15 times, I can tell: it worths the trouble. Especially after I could see it in a movie theater (THANK YOU ODEON!!), I was simply blown away by it. At the end even closing my mouth felt difficult. Sot this movie is itself an experience, and no animated feature could compete against it.The story takes place 30 years after World War III, when Tokyo is finally rebuilt as Neo-Tokyo. Motor gangs rule the streets, fighting each other, until one night one of them, Tetsuo runs into a strange kid, who looks like an old man. After this, he gets supernatural power, and destroys half of the city. His best friend, Kaneda tries to stop him, but they even have to deal with the army and politicians with different interests.If you want to know, more watch the movie, because it is simply awesome!",10,2,5,16 November 2006
Spider-Man 3," No more sequels, please, Mr Raimi!!
","Before last night, I trusted all of this movie's creators. Sam Raimi, director of the Evil Dead? Cool! Tobey Maguire from the Cider House Rules? We love him! Kirsten Dunst from Interview with a vampire? Awesome! Bryce Dallas Howard from The village? She's the best! Well, last night everything turned 180 degrees about them for me. Now my trust is over. Sorry, but this movie was nothing for me just 2 and a half wasted hours. But I think I'll tell my opinion with my reaction to one scene.When Harry Osborn/New Goblin (James Franco is still the best!!!) is dying at the end of the movie, I just couldn't stop laughing - sunrise, last touching word, crying, et cetera. What is it, damn it? I think at that point nobody cried - so, almost everybody laughed. I think this tells everything about the dramatic scenes of this movie. Even the worst comic movies had better scenes sometimes - even Daredevil or Hulk, too! This is not even the worst scene I think. When Tobey Maguire gets infected and evil, and plays the cool guy everywhere...That' not cool, not cute, not everything, just awful! Or Bryce Dallas Howard - she gave me the creeps... And the new villains...maybe there were too much of them for the director to control: Thomas Haden Church (Sandman), Topher Grace (Venom) and James Franco as New Goblin - they just became pieces of CGI near a CGI Spider - Man. The villains of the first two movies was much-much better (and there were one of them for each film...) But I think I should tell some stuff what I liked in this movie. J. K. Simmons is still awesome, Ted Raimi, with his clumsy attitude still made me laugh, James Franco was the best, and STAN LEE! When he showed up, I unconsciously shouted 'F**k it, it's Stan Lee!' So, to sum it all up: I don't want more sequels. Let him go, Mr Raimi, and try to do something else. But please, choose wisely!",4,1,3,18 May 2007
