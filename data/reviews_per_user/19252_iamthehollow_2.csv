Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," This film is disgusting tripe.
","I'd heard the hype but having seen/suffered S B Cohen's previous work I just couldn't buy it. Needless to say its really awful, dire at times, and just plain boring all the rest, this is supposed to be a fly-on-the-wall style documentary, its all so staged and obviously so. It has zero plot and is severely lacking in laughs. What it doesn't lack however is hate, Sacha Baron Cohen really hates Muslims, his previous 'creation' Ali G was dripping in derision and bile but was on the right side of criminal, just. Borat is different, to portray a whole group of people as casual rapists and backward is wrong and the fact this film got made in the first place is a testament to the all round wrongness of our world. Its a hit-piece with a sly smile. Disgusting X 1,000,000.",1,5,12,2 March 2007
Bird Box," A great film...very suspenseful and taut...usual Bullock greatness.
","Bird box is a film that spent it's running time surprising me, from the usually foreboding 'Dur Duuuur' that announces a 'Netflix' film, (they aren't usually the best). as I source my viewing independently shall we say? the sight and that sound never usually means good things, usually.This is a cool end of the world film...lots of atmosphere and i can forgive the way progressive politics injected into it as it was very entertaining throughout...Sandra Bullock is excellent as ever and continues to be my favourite leading lady.Good stuff.",9,10,33,16 December 2018
