Iron Man 3," Not worth the wait
","I found this film to be very disappointing. I have been a huge Iron man fan since I was very young, so I have been looking forward to this film for about a year and a half. The main issue I had with this film, was It's misuse of key characters: like the Mandarin, James Rhodes, and Maya Hansen. The film instead focuses on a stupid kid sidekick, 'super pepper' and a fire breathing Aldrich Killian. The lack of including S.H.I.E.L.D or the Avengers was also an ill advised decision made by the newly appointed director Shane Black who you may remember from predator or the end credits from the lethal weapon films. I would suggest seeing this movie if you have already seen: Place beyond the pines, 42, Oblivion, and Pain and gain. Which are all far better films, but If you must see Iron man 3 immediately, see it cheap. Because otherwise you will be upset for spending more then about 10 dollars on this film. Robert Downey jr. gives another strong performance as Tony Stark, and made me decide to give this movie a seven instead of five. Don't expect to see much of the main man in his metal suit though. Except during the last action scene which is very redeeming, and seems to have made most reviewers forget about the films flaws. Like I said this film is okay, but there are far better films out right now, and this one just isn't worth the ticket price. Thanks for your time, and happy movie-going.",7,1,2,5 May 2013
