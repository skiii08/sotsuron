The Avengers," A fun romp through comic books, expertly done
","One of the keystrokes of genius in Joss Whedon's Avengers movie was how he managed to introduce the characters fast, fun, and without boring the old timers or losing the interest of the newbies. I didn't know anything about Thor, Captain Hammer, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Iron Man, or Fury, but I got them enough for the film. I think that's one of Joss' strengths. He did that in Serenity as well.The dialogue was amusing, the pace fast and usually the objective clear. It's easy to see why this fun action movie made about a billion and a half at the box office. And personally, Marvel characters aren't really my favourites.(14 June 2013 - 1 out of 4 users found this review helpful.)",10,1,3,7 March 2016
