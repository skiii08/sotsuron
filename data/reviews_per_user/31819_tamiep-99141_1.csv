10 Cloverfield Lane," Really Dumb
","So, I watched the first one knowing nothing about it and walked out of the theater with even less knowledge of what it was supposed to be about. This one is exactly the same. I didn't put 2 + 2 together about this movie being a sequel (kinda) to the other one. Had I known that, I would not have wasted my money.These people need to choose a plot and stick with it. The first part was going along pretty well, it could have been a good movie, then the end ruined it. It was like someone taped the end of another movie to the reel. And the end was ridiculously dumb, just like the 1st movie. I will never see another movie with the word 'Cloverfield' in the title. I mean, the least they could have done is tied up all of the loose ends from the first movie.",1,51,96,2 April 2016
