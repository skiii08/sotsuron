Blade Runner 2049," Amazing movie!
","Really liked it. does justice with the books, great decision by ford. Good acting, good soundtrack. This movie is going to win Oscars for sure. There is a something to think about here, a fair amount to feel and even more to see. Mr. Villeneuve has conspired with the cinematographer, Roger A. Deakins; the production designer, Dennis Gassner; and the special effects team to create zones of strangeness that occasionally rise to the level of sublimity. The movies Mr. Villeneuve has directed — his recent English-language features include 'Sicario,' 'Prisoners' and 'Arrival' — are full of violence and psychological intensity, but what distinguishes them from other high- end genre spectacles is an unnerving calm, as if he were exploring and trying to synthesize the human and mechanical sides of his own sensibility.",6,0,4,9 October 2017
