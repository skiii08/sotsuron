The New World," Absolutely Awful
","I can't believe this politically correct tripe ever made it to the screen. It was so boring I actually FF through almost all the movie. The story was incomprehensible. The Indians were illogical, random and seemingly running around like chickens with their heads cut off, just like the colonists. Colin Farrel is trying to follow in the James Dean mold; sullen rebel without a discrenable cause. He looks around, he sulks, he looks, he glances at the ground, he stares, and does more staring, he whispers and then looks into the sunset.This goes on for the whole movie.The director was obviously a fan of Fitzcaraldo, that idiot German director of those soulful incomprehensible boring movies about troubled men and their troubled lives...who cares?",1,2,9,8 May 2006
The Day After Tomorrow," Another movie about smart people acting stupid
","It's a Hollywood scripted movie, by the numbers. Oh my gosh! The world is ending! Now lets talk, walk around, discuss, kiss, hold hands, wander around some more, get easily diverted into silly pursuits and you're screaming at the movie screen 'Go south you morons, go south!'.And oh so politically correct....The Mexicans graciously let us into their country when we forgive their debts. Like, we have 4 bazillion tanks, F-16s and millions of Americans are fleeing for their lives, and most of them own guns and we're going to sit around and discuss debt repayments with the Mexicans???? Maybe a nice game of bocci balls while we wait to freeze to death, eh Senor Pablo? I know it's siesta time, but hey! It's -150 degrees here and could we hurry this along a bit?Dennis Quaid goes to rescue his moronic son, who, despite his really really high IQ, doesn't seem to watch the news, and when he does, he promptly forgets the fact that NEW YORK IS GOING UNDER!!!!! So, he wanders around, hold hands, thinks about kissing...no wonder more females liked this silly movie than males! So, Dennis goes to rescue said moron, so two OTHER moron friends of his decide to go North with him, for some unknown reason, into the a sure death, and one dies and one almost dies, but hey! They really like this guy, who's going to rescue his moron son who...well, you get the picture.Another movie where you root for the bad guy, the 'heros' to die and when the mother decides to stay behind to take care of a very prettty and cute little boy dying of cancer (Jeezzz, what happened to the PC meter running on this movie? Couldn't they find a cute little black kid to be dying?), so instead of saving herself for her family and herself and her doctor skills, which will be desperately needed for millions in the time to come, she curls up with the oh so cute little boy in his bed and promises not to leave him, despite the fact that everyone else ssems to have been afflicted by rampant common sense in the hospital and already left.Of course, somehow by some miracle (or silly Hollywood fantasy writing) oh boy! There she is waiting for valiant hubby in the end.I wish they'd had all died and made the movie more about special effects. One of these days they'll make a movie of Lucifer's Hammer and destroy that excellent book by stupid politically correct writing aimed towards morons and women.Very disappointing.Mapanari",4,0,2,31 August 2004
