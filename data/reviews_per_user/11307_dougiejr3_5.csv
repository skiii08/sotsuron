The Blair Witch Project," BAD BAD BAD!
","This movie was one of the worst I've ever seen!  I can't believe I wasted my money and saw it in the movie theatres!  There were three words in the whole movie - 'Lost', 'Witch', and 'F--k' I don't care about the breakthrough of a handheld movie making millions, it was a horrible movie from start to finish.  I thought that Nightmare on Elmstreet was scarier that this movie was, when I was like 7 or 8 years old!",1,21,42,3 March 2003
Juno," Great Movie
","I saw this movie and was really looking forward to it, because I liked the director's last offering, 'Thank You For Smoking'. I was completely knocked off of my feet! The humor was completely entertaining and didn't dwindle into a perverted cuss fest like some other comedy offerings of late (Superbad). The actors did a tremendous job - J.K. Simmons (no longer will he just be remembered for Spiderman), Ellen Page was incredible (finally a movie to like her in - Hard Candy was just too creepy, sorry), and Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner are paired up once again (also paired in The Kingdom) and play the embattled parents to be of this new child while facing their own demons in their struggling marriage. The movie was just very real, and also gives anyone hope that good things can come out of seemingly bad and insurmountable odds. Go and see this film!",10,111,222,13 November 2007
American Beauty," It's a sad fact.
","But most American men who are either fathers or not fantasize at least sometimes about teenage girls that are either their daughters friends, or son's girlfriends, etc.  This movie was actually very disturbing, but like most of the guys on imdb.com, they voted for this pretty much not because they liked the movie, but because they liked the drug content as well as Mena Suvari baring her breasts at the near conclusion to the film.  As a movie this movie really disturbed me as I saw it Oscar week before it won, and I was all by my lonesome in the huge theatre on a week night.  It pictured the American Family as screwed up beyond all hope, and I have a hard time believing that every seemingly nice person I meet is either a drug dealer, adultress, or pedophile.  It just once again causes the entire world to look at America and say, ugh!",10,0,0,3 March 2003
The Fast and the Furious," loved it!
","This was a great movie, definitely one of Vin Diesel's best in light of XXX which was HORRIBLE!  This movie, along with Pitch Black and Saving Private Ryan are definitely the three high point for Vin Diesel so far, which Knockaround Guys coming in a close fourth.  I am guessing that A Man Apart will be pretty good since it has him back in a believable role, and a chance for him to display his acting talents once again.",10,2,5,3 March 2003
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," great movie - better than the first!
","This movie consistently flowed better along its story lines than the first installment did. First of all, you've got to remember that it's an action movie - and a sci-fi action movie at that - so there's going to be some pieces that everyone would change. Especially the people who have played the video games. For one example - the Nemesis, should have been bigger, but again, it's a fantasy movie. As with all fantasy movies, you've got your small selection of cheesy lines, but overall, the movie was great - better than its predecessor. Milla did a fantastic job and they had a great supporting cast. I will definitely look forward to RE3, as long as Anderson directs that one as well.",10,2,3,10 September 2004
