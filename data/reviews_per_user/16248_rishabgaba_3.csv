The Lobster," Most awful movie
","This is the most dreadful outcome of a script. There is not an inch of comedy/romance/drama in this movie.Talk about story line, its utter nonsense. Any scene or concept makes no sense whatsoever. I stayed till the end in hope of some twist or some meaningful conclusion but the movie makers wanted to end it in shutter island style. Instead of leaving people spellbound, it leaves the watcher thinking this is the stupidest movie I ever chose to see. A few disturbing- totally unnecessary and do not add to any charm of the movie. In short, the only good thing about it is the good camera work, but totally worthless to see given that absolutely nothing else is good about the movie. Do not go by its high ratings, if I could give it a -10 rating, I'd go with it.",1,42,73,19 January 2016
Blade Runner 2049," Hair pulling torture
","I have not seen such a badly made movie in a really long time. The only thing good about this movie is the actors. who did a good job in doing what they were told to. But the story is a pathetic layering of a typical family drama projected onto flying cars that is supposed to be our future. The jest of story, we industrialize ruthlessly to shred nature and then struggle to find a human emotion within ourselves and wage a war to hold on to it. Pathetic, heard many times, over and over. I am not sure if the theme was disguised as to give a facade of art or was so poorly directed that it was not even strongly projected. Either way, it gave me headaches. And the music was so grossly out of sync with the picture, it made no sense remotely. The unnecessary loud noises had not 1% context with what was happening on screen. Ridiculously long, out of context, poor direction, senseless sound effects, sorry picture of the story. sheer torture to sit through it.",1,107,213,12 October 2017
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Emotionally challenging film
","Its a highly emotional film and certainly not for the weak heart-ed. It is about the Holocaust fiction or not, people tend to argue. However, the real point is missed which the movie depicts so brilliantly that the world through the eyes of a child is all pure and good and he knows no evil. As we grow old, all is forgotten as we make perceptions and stop asking questions. There is no point in arguing the historical accuracy of the film because that is not the point. As a film, it is brilliantly directed and acted. It touches an extremely sensitive issue and by the end of it something in you will implode. A real life changing film. It teaches a very important lesson of history, text maybe exaggerated but again, the point is hatred in any form is vile. People with power have done all sorts of good and bad things. This movie shows a mirror to all on the life choices you are making.",10,0,0,18 July 2016
