The Sound of Music," Classic musical.
","A movie made in a time when directors like Robert Wise who knew how to craft a musical were still around. Suffers terribly when viewed on a small screen since the brilliant cinematography is such an integral factor of the movie. Get the newer THX widescreen video version and you will see a glimpse of what the film would be like on a big screen. The movie still holds up well to nineties standards but may be a little sugary for hardened modern moviegoers, used to a diet of violence and profanity. Wise manages to make Julie Andrews look both virginal and alluring at the same time, which is essential for the plot to work. It is hard to imagine the movie with any other actress than Andrews playing Maria's part. Some may criticize Roger and Hammerstein as not being in the same league as other noted movie composers, but here the combination of composers/director/actors all comes together in a way seldom matched.",7,10,23,30 September 1999
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Terrific Comedy/Western 'Who are those guys?'
","Still as fresh to day as it was when it came out (1969 wow ). Newman and Redford look as though they are having a great time and their interaction is a key factor in the movies sparkle. An enjoyable romp with lot's of one-line comedy but still has enough action and bitter-sweet moments to add grit. The movie owes a lot to the terrific screen-play but added together with the fine cast and able direction it's a winner. If Butch and the Kid were really like they are shown here then you kind of wish you could have been around to get robbed by them. Fun and fabulous, if you see the video then grab it.",8,1,2,5 October 1999
Mission: Impossible," One movie course: Turn winning formula into losing formula.
","It would seem the 'Impossible' mission is to find as many ways as possible to degrade an original inspired series/idea. First let's get rid of the Jim Phelps character so that Tom Cruise's ego has no competitors and he can take over the lead spot in any unfortunate spin offs from this mess. Second let's forget clever story lines and substitute ridiculous unbelievable special effects. Cruise must have been made of asbestos to survive the train explosion scene. Brian de Palma 'directed' this ? The (original)I.M.F force was a team effort lead by the uncorruptible Jim Phelps and they relied on brains plus meticulous planning to succeed in their missions. Each member had his part to play in order for the team to survive and they were the good guys saving us from the bad guys. This movie will do nothing for de Palma's reputation. The final result is a disappointment , more so because in places the movie does get it right and it becomes evident what could have been and should have been.",4,6,12,2 October 1999
Where Eagles Dare," Terrific war movie with plenty of plot twists
",This is one of those movies that you can watch over and again. Richard Burton is great and Clint Eastwood is excellent. Great action and cinematography with lot's of plot twists and turns and a crisp script. The movie never falters. The cable car scenes are terrific.,Null,1,1,29 September 1999
Titanic," Big budget depiction of Titanic sinking
","Whoever makes a movie about the most famous shipwreck of all time will inevitably run the gauntlet of criticism for this part or that part being correct/not correct. In general Cameron's version is a reasonably correct version of the known facts ( not including the two fictional lead roles ). Some points about the crews behaviour ( particularly Lightoller ), as shown in the movie are open to debate, however the whole truth will never be fully known. One fact that never seems to have been mentioned in any movie to date (that I know of) is that the White Star line was part of the American I.M.M shipping combine owned by American tycoon John Pierpont Morgan. The vessel was crewed by British officers to give the impression of a British operation. Therefore Morgan ( who was extremely proud of Titanic  and devastated by her loss ) would have taken a great interest in her specifications. Of course ultimately Captain Smith and those on board issuing orders must shoulder any blame for Titanic's sinking. Apart from disputes over historical facts the film is magnificent. Few directors would be able to control such a huge production as Cameron has. The set's are stunning and the computer graphics top of the line. The movie's 3 hours seem to pass very quickly. The love sub-plot is well constructed and ably acted ( although Leonardo Di Caprio seems a touch lightweight in places ). Billy Zane and David Warner both stand out as villains and of course there is the lovely Kate Winslet in fine acting form. A must for any video library.",8,1,2,30 September 1999
