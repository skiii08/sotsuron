The Blair Witch Project," REAL WORLD goes to the woods?
","Although I'm sure that not many films could live up to the hype that this film has received, I was disappointed in the movie.  While the last 10 minutes were intense, I cannot believe that anyone could compare this movie to 'The Exorcist', or even 'Scream', as far as being a scary movie.  The movie was only about 90 minutes long, and was only mildly frightening for a few minutes.  I've seen many comments written about people sitting in their theater seats after the credits started rolling, and I must admit, I was one of them, trying to figure out how this movie had gotten past the first sold out week without having the word get out that it sucks!  MTV will be running this flick during the wee hours of the morning soon, so maybe the drunks that come in at 3am will turn on the TV and think that they're seeing a horror film.  I don't see what all the fuss is about...",Null,1,2,15 August 1999
