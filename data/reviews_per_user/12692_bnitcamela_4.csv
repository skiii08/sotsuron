Hereditary," Overhyped, Overlong, Underachieving, Underhanded Nonsense
","This film is not credible, not scary, and not recommended unless you're bored and streaming it at home. Do not waste your money or risk an accident where you or a family member might be decapitated while traveling to or from a theater. Seriously though, this is a clear case of the hype machine being cynically manipulated to drive box office performance but an utterly forgettable movie. Stay with me here - I know I haven't even made a single specific complaint about the film, and I will - but Ari Aster can't seem to resist these endings that even MNS might be ashamed of. It kind of worked with 'The VVitch' in 2015, but this time it's just too-much-nonsense-icing on top of an already unbelievable cake that failed to rise. OK enough of the metaphors. The positives: This film is very nicely shot. The lighting is perfect and for about 15 minutes the director does a good job of ratcheting up a somewhat believable tension. The cinematography is great. The acting is just OK in the aggregate - Collette is very good, but I don't even see why Gabriel Byrne signed up for this. The kids have the difficult job of making otherwise ridiculous and totally unbelievable scenarios and behaviors seem as though they might be possible. Now to the negatives (SPOILERS AHEAD): 
People simply do not behave in the ways that are depicted in this movie. You don't send a 10 year old (I know she was 13 or 14 during filming, but she doesn't look it at all) to a high school party with a senior. A high school senior who plans on smoking some dube doesn't take his 10 year old sister along at his mom's bizarre request without an argument. Further, you don't do that - even if you're grieving-but-not-grieving over your recently departed mother - when the girl suffers from a severe nut allergy and you don't do it without sending an Epi Pen along with your son. People who just decapitated their sibling in an auto accident don't simply drive home, go to bed, and leave a human head on the ground (much less your own sister's) then wait for their parents to discover the headless body in one of the family's two Volvos the next morning - presumably after bleeding out in the back seat. Additionally, when this kind of thing happens, the cops tend to get involved, amirite? In this movie, however, that's exactly what happens and no police, no cleanup and they're driving the car in the very next scene. Hmmm...When your son, who has weeks or days earlier killed your daughter, resumes going to school almost immediately, without therapy or counseling, has a seizure and bashes his own face in on the desk, you don't load his lifeless body into the same Volvo, drive him home, and deposit him into his bed - still unconscious - without any kind of medical consultation or observation at all. Laughably ridiculous. The reaction of the family to the mother's dalliances into the world of seances and such is just not believable. I don't know how else to say it. And the problem with all of the above is that what little plot there is absolutely requires the audience to suspend disbelief in the very essence of human nature and behavior and accept without any question that these kinds of things are likely or possible.In addition, the whole convoluted idea is just ridiculous and unnecessary. So the evil, manipulative matriarch wanted to get a suitable male host for her demon lover, but in the process screws up several attempts over a generation, and puts him into a little girl's body instead - meaning that she has to be killed and then he can possess the boy. OMG..SMH...WOWFinally there's the underlying conceit to the way the whole picture was made. When you have to rely on an unnerving soundtrack to create a mood in a movie like this, you're not doing it right. In any case, it didn't work. At no point was anyone in the audience frightened or unnerved and I heard several laughs and scoffs during moments that apparently were supposed to be scary or meaningful. I suppose I should have seen this sophistry coming when, prior to the movie, the theater showed an interview with the director who made the ridiculous claim that he views 'The Shining' as a comedy movie - and that's it's more effective as such than it is a horror movie. The guy is clearly delusional and making movies only for himself and his industry/film school buddies. Avoid. I'm not kidding - wait for it to hit Netflix. There are better ways to spend 2 hours.",5,1347,2541,10 June 2018
Sicario," Irresponsible in the way it depicts sicarios and drug war violence
","This movie gets way too much hype for the fantasy that it actually is. The vast majority of murders and kidnappings in the Mexico cartel wars are carried out by males in their 20s and in mostly amateur fashion. The depiction of the Super Sicario here is pure Hollywood. The idea of a Super Sicario who expertly hunts down American agents and moves within their ranks is absolutely ridiculous. Also, the idea that there are delta force (type) raids and assassinations going on with U.S. military or covert assets is simply not accurate. When a Mexican cartel boss or lieutenant is brought down in real life, it's generally in boring fashion while they hide in a hotel room or get involved in a shootout with a rival cartel. Finally, illegal practices such as torture are glamorized and depicted as effective, when all real-world intel gathering professionals will tell you otherwise. Cross border tunnel raids in which dozens are killed is just the icing on the Hollywood cake. In any case, this is obviously fiction and the film does try to depict the nebulous nature of the war on drugs near the U.S.-Mexico border. The story is taut and very well directed by Villeneuve. The film does not take a stand on one side or the other - the drug trade and all the violence that it entails, especially in the 2000's, is the direct result of American demand for the product. Further, the movie attempts to demonstrate that the volume of drugs passing through (or under) our border crossings simply would not be possible without massive corruption on both sides. All in all I was disappointed because I am very familiar with the areas in which it was set and the U.S-Mexico dialectic concerning the war on (some) drugs and horrific cartel violence in Juarez, MX. I thought that while the direction was more than competent, it wasn't Villeneuve's best work and that Taylor Sheridan took way too much creative license and that the end result was a highly stylized flick that doesn't capture the boring and even more horrifying aspects of the situation in Mexico. I suppose my main problem with the movie, however, was the idea of a super assassin and that it depicts the U.S. as way more interested in what is going on down there than it actually is.",6,27,49,22 September 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Fun for the first hour and a half but sloppy, all over the place and too long
","I really liked the first one. Very well done, amazing effects and set/landscape design, not to mention cool battle sequences and interesting characters. This one failed to capitalize on virtually any of that. It was just missing the 'WOW' factor that made last summer's original so much fun. The dialogue and wit, while snappy at first, isn't as novel this time around and begins to wear thin about half way through the picture. Hey, it's a comic book movie, right? But the ridiculousness of how powerful/deadly Yondu's little whistle arrow thing is (he's basically invincible when he has it? It can fly through inches thick solid metal? How does it make calculations so fast and know exactly where to go?) and the stupidity of the Sovereign Race pursuit story-line, complete impossibility of the way the Guardians evade multiple attacks on their ship by huge flying armies, and the over-sized, over-long funeral party for Yondu, attended by literally every Ravager in the galaxy, at the end really ruined it for me. It was just too long and too messy. And really - why do we need Sylvester Stallone? I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it as a light summer popcorn action, sci-fi flick. It's an entertaining ride and you could do much worse on a summer afternoon or night. But the expectations generated by the first one were just too much to overcome, unfortunately and this one did absolutely no improvements or upstaging of the original. Ultimately it's a bloated, piecemeal mess predicated on a thin plot with lots of cheap machinations to ensure that all of our heros, and even some people we don't like that much, end up being fine in what looked like impossible situations to get out of. 5.7/10",5,10,22,28 May 2017
Prometheus," Disappointing prequel with sloppy story writing
","Was very much looking forward to this film when it was released in 2012, but sadly it was quite the let down for me, a long-time fan of the Alien franchise, especially, of course, the first two films.This one invokes a little too much deus ex machina and open ended story arcs to really satisfy as a sci-fi marvel like the first two were, and on a much more limited budget I should add.All in all this was a fun watch if a bit too long in duration, but it's good enough in this age of lackluster sci-fi movies and endless, usually disappointing (Last Jedi - UGGHHHH!!!!) comic book and Star Wars movie remakes/prequels/sequels.My personal belief is that 7.0 is too high for this Ridley Scott offering but I'm not complaining even if I do feel a bit betrayed as a fan of his earlier work.",6,2,3,7 June 2019
