Walk the Line," Not a great movie
","SPOILER ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE!! Walk the Line started out great, with Cash getting ready to perform in Folsom Prison and a palpable sense of growing excitement. Unfortunately, this was the climax of the movie.Reese Witherspoon shines every time she's on screen. She oozes charisma. Some have complained about her singing, but I thought she was fine. Then again, I'm not a June Carter fan. Unfortunately, while Joaquin Phoenix did a great cardboard cutout of Cash, aping the looks and the moves, he has none of the charisma. He has no spark. The actor who played Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Payne) blew Phoenix off the stage and the screen.Overlooked in all the undeserved hype about Joaquin Phoenix were excellent jobs by Shelby Lynne as Cash's mom and Robert Patrick as his Dad. Especially impressive was Lynne. She did more simply with a look than all of Phoenix's hysterics combined.Ginnifer Goodwin also turned in a great performance as Vivian Cash, Johnny's first wife.Walk the Line was not a bad movie. It's just easily forgettable, boring, and joyless.",3,16,36,22 November 2005
United 93," The best movie of the past several years
","United 93 is not perfect. I can quibble with the acting and directing, but why bother? This movie grabbed me from the first frame and totally involved me until the last credit rolled and the house lights came up.Everyone should see this movie.It's not too early to see it. If anything, it was cathartic and healing.I can't believe Napoleon Dynamite and My Big Fat Greek Wedding played for over a year, while audiences seem to be overlooking this excellent movie.The people on the flight are not presented as either heroes or villains. We do not have Darth Vader and Luke, Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef. We simply have people, which makes everything more real - the terrorists are truly terrifying, and the people on the flight are truly heroic.See this movie!!If it does not win Best Picture of 2006, then there is no justice.",10,1,3,26 May 2006
In Bruges," Not as good as I had hoped
","I had high hopes for this movie. Roeper and Whoever made it sound as though it was one of the best movies of the year, and hilarious.It was pretty good, but it was not great, and I don't know exactly why.It had a few laughs, but it was not a comedy.Two hit men go to Bruges (pronounced Brooj) after a hit. The person who hired them sends them there, supposedly for a little r & r after a hit. One of the hit men, played by Brendan Gleeson, soaks in the history. The other, played by Collin Farrell, is bored to tears, until he meets a local woman. She has an ex-boyfriend. She also deals drugs to a movie cast and crew, who are filming in Bruges.We don't know why the hit men (well, actually, the hit man - Farrell was the hit man, Gleeson was the person who recruited him) were hired to do the job, or why the hit was commissioned, but this was not important anyway. Ralph Fiennes plays the guy who called for the hit.oh - there's also the hostess of the hotel (or was it a b & b) where Farrell and Gleason are staying in Bruges. She's pregnant.I'm not going to say too much more, because to do so would give away too much of the plot.The acting was fine. Gleeson especially shines. Ralph Fiennes is properly menacing. Farrell does a pretty good job as a novice hit man. The women are fine, although they really aren't given much to do with their parts.The movie was entertaining, and it held my interest, and it was a nice change of pace from a Hollywood story, but I can't highly recommend the movie.It was worth the price of a matin√©e, plus a medium popcorn and soda.",6,3,7,11 May 2008
