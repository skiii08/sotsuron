Minority Report," The best sci-fi movie ever!!!
","Although I am a fan of Spielberg's last film: A.I., I feel this movie is much better.  Besides, Spielberg and Cruise are a match made in heaven (as it has been said before).  I saw this one on opening day, and I still remember it vividly.  All in all, Minority Report has everything that a great sci-fi thriller needs:  drama, suspense, non-stop action, awesome special-effects, great acting, and brilliant story-telling.  I really enjoyed this movie with my family.  If you still have an opportunity to see this movie in theaters, GO SEE IT.  Otherwise, atleast rent it on video. I give this one a 10/10.",Null,0,0,16 August 2002
"Monsters, Inc."," A beautiful, funny and heart-warming animated feature
","I really enjoyed this film.  I've already seen it more than once, and it has found its way into my DVD collection.  The storytelling was awesome and so was the pace of the film.  I really liked all the characters in the movie and found myself laughing quite often.  Out of all the movies I had seen in 2001, I think this one was the best, and I believe it did surpass Shrek at least in some aspects.  If Disney & Pixar create another feature, I'll definitely be in the theaters to see it.",10,0,1,14 October 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Could have been better, for people who didn't read the book
","I felt that the movie was bogged down quite a bit by small scenes, such as the birthday party scene...too much emphasis is given on little details. The action was good, when it happened.  But, character development was not as good as it could've been (perhaps this requires a lot of skill).  The acting (other than Elijah Wood's) could've been better.  The actor, who played Count Duku in Star Wars: Episode II, plays the villain in this film -- by which I was most dissappointed.  I felt his acting was one-dimensional.  Don't get me wrong.  There are some good things in this movie.  I LIKED the mystery surrounding the ring, and the foreshadowing. Special effects are great.  Kate Blanchett does a great job with her role, as always.  There is more action than drama, however....All said, those, expecting a great story, who have NOT read the book and/or those who have NOT liked fantasy movies before, will not enjoy this movie as much as those who have.",6,0,0,11 August 2002
Lilo & Stitch," Brilliant!
","I think this is the best Disney movie that has come out so far.  Although the movie doesn't have the animation style as its predecessors, it has a lot to say.  The animators have taken a bold step.  Yes, that is to incorporate a very serious theme in a children's movie.  But, it still works great, and it is brilliant.  Stitch is an alien being, who was put into exile due to his destructive capabilities and his inability to adapt to a normal life.  But, he escapes and lands on earth (in the state of Hawaii).  He is, then, discovered in a dog pen by a Hawaiian girl who adopts him as her pet.  It is really touching to watch how stitch learns to become a part of her family.  The essence of the movie, however, is that 'Ohana means family, and family means nobody gets left behind'.  This is mentioned again and again.  If you're sensitive enough, you might even find yourself crying, because the animators do an exceptional job of portraying feelings of guilt, loneliness and belonging. But, don't hesitate to take the kids.  This is a comedy, and they might even learn something important.All in all, great film, I give it a 10/10, although I am an adult.",9,4,5,24 August 2002
The Hurricane," The best drama of 1999
","I've seen this movie more than once, and I've gotta hand it to you.  This movie is superb!  There is no better way to say it.  I didn't know much about Rubin Hurricane Carter, so I came to find out about him through this movie.  If you enjoy emotional dramas, you will love this film.  Denzel Washington's acting is superb!  I am wondering how this movie did not make it to IMDB's top 250.",9,0,2,16 August 2002
Signs," What's your point of view? (Spoiler Warning)
","Overall, I think Signs is a great movie.  But, there are a some of minor points to consider:A.)  There is definitely a great dispute over what the aliens should have looked like, but the argument is futile because of point B.  Also, this is primarily a horror movie. The fact that it contains sci-fi elements is secondary. B.)  This is a movie about faith, NOT alien invasion or crop circles.  The crop circles are just a sign of aliens invading, and the alien invasion is just a diversion from the main theme.  Thus, for people to argue about how absurd and unbelievable the aliens were is beside the point.  Moreover, if the aliens were reasonable or believable, they would NOT be as scary.C.)  The movie is all about suspense and build-up.  The plot is secondary. Think about the plot of Sixth Sense, about a boy who sees ghosts and finally overcomes his fear.  This movie is about man's triumph over evil.  It is about a man who has lost his faith, who finds reason to believe again.D.)  For people who enjoy really scary theme-park roller-coaster rides, this movie will not be scary, it will be a joke.  So, if you fall in this category, you should not go to the theaters expecting a scary movie. Instead, rent the exorcist.I have to disagree with people who say that this movie does not fall into any genre.  I think it has elements of many genres: drama, sci-fi, horror, suspense.  There are enough funny scenes to make some people think that this is a comedy.  However, what you consider it to be, depends on your point of view.  For me, it was a good drama.So after having said all that, I'd give Signs at least a 3/4 stars in my book.  Not only did I like the ending, but I thought it was great.  (I might be in the minority here).  I thought the last 20 mins of the movie were the best.  When I walked out of the theater, I was satisfied that I had seen a good movie.",8,0,1,16 August 2002
The Sixth Sense," AWESOME!
","I have seen this movie more than once, and I still think it's great...However, it is not talent that makes this film great, it is the ability to communicate to the audience with body language and signs rather than the use of many words.  If you analyze the dialog, the characters don't have a whole lot to say.  But, if you're seeing this for the first time, you'll be glued to your seat, in anticipation of what's coming next. That's the beauty!! Suspense.  This film has a great deal of suspense.  Thus, you may or may not enjoy it the second time around.  It's also one of those few movies which everybody has seen...So if you happen to be in a theater watching a random play, and an actor comments: 'I see dead people!' Don't be surprised if everybody laughs -- because everybody understands the reference.",Null,0,0,15 August 2002
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Great Movie!!!
","If you're young at heart, you'll find this a very entertaining and surprising film.  Yes, there are many plot twists and funny scenes.  George Clooney does a great job with his role.  Bottom line, the story is original. It is set in Mississippi, where three prisoners escape in search of buried treasure.  What happens next? Well, you can find out for yourself. Oh, and the music is just awesome.  Overall, wonderful movie in all aspects.  I give it at least a 9/10.",9,1,2,25 August 2002
