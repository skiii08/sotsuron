Requiem for a Dream," Don't flatter yourself...
","There's a lot to like in this movie.  Afonwhatever's style keeps things moving and peppy but sometimes you have to ask 'why?'  Why do MTV style fast-forward shots of turning off the television and popping pills OVER and OVER?  There's apparently little meaning behind it - it's just a piece of visual flash.Second the shock value is effective but tired.  The good girl gone bad and then having sex with black men thing is cliche at this point.  We saw it in Traffic.  Of course, they're always gross, nasty black men, right?  Gimme a break.Much rawer than trainspotting, this film leaves out most of the style elements.  The choice of location - Coney Island - is perfect to this end.That said, the real genius of this flick is how despite the main characters' additions things seem more or less under control for 2/3 of the film, in some ways even prosperous.  The drugs are shown as recreational and stress relieving.  But without any warning to them, or the viewer, we quickly realize that things are definately not in control.  And if you watch the film again you would be hard pressed to point to a particular scene where things pass the point of no return.Hopefully this film will make a few conservative 'it's your own fault/why don't you just quit?' types think twice before they condemn a social outcast or someone addicted to drugs.",Null,0,0,9 September 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Fanboys rejoice! It sucks less!
","Superior to the Phantom Menace in many ways but still bogged down - way down - by a script that makes Passover cuisine seem exciting and a director who can't hit the stop button.It's really hard to blame the actors here, or at least be accurate in one's criticisms of their performances, due to the horrific script and storyline. But bottom line they do nothing to get the viewer engaged and more often do the opposite.  How many times did I mouth 'shut up Anaken!' while watching this film.  No, it wasn't that Hayden Christensen did a good job of building Anaken Skywalker into a character I could later love to hate, it was because the very sound of his whiney teenage voice made me want to stab the nearest person in the neck with a pencil.Like the Phantom Menace, the computer animation is overdone to the point that it's pounded into our heads over and over that nothing is real or even lifelike.  We stop caring and the film drags on...Also like the Phantom Menace you can expect extremely flat characters and performances, seemingly going through the motions of their dialogs with less life th--Sorry, just thinking about it almost caused me to slip into a coma.Even the comic relief from R2 and 3PO falls flat - humor about something we're only minorly interested in has a steep, uphill battle.If I had to sum this film up I'd say take any crappy sci-fi flick and infuse it with a massive budget.  Voila - Star Wars: Episode 2.  Pray that Lucas wises up and turns the directorial and editorial duties over to someone with an ounce of technical acumen...",3,0,0,13 June 2002
Velvet Goldmine," Definately not for everyone...
","If you liked 'The Linguini Incident' you might be in the niche for this movie.Velvet Goldmine is completely about visual style.  The characters are driven by looks and moves more than anything else, trampling over emotions and any other humanistic qualities in many cases.  That's about the only thing this movie can be praised for delivering effectively.  The film itself is done the same way, unashamedly it would seem, and the audience for whom it was intended for likely doesn't care.  Again, image means everything.  Who needs a plot?  In a nutshell, take the quirky characters from The Linguini Incident and imagine who those characters would idolize, then make a movie about them. That's pretty much what Velvet Goldmine is.  If that's your cup of tea this might be worth a look.  Otherwise, I recommend you stay far far away.",Null,0,1,12 May 2002
