Black Swan," Unpleasant without a cause
","Black Swan is almost the same as 'Requiem for a Dream (2000)', another of Darren Aronofsky's work. We saw the characters in 'Requiem for a Dream' slowly spiraling downwards because of their heroine addiction.Black Swan tells the story of a girl spiraling down because she is obsessed.I really 'liked' Requiem for a Dream, drug addiction really deserves the 'unpleasant' card to be played, and because the spiral is so slow, we the audience, keep hoping everything still might turn out fine. Drugs really work on a persons instincts (like it or not, people are still fundamentally governed by their instincts), that's why the 'artistic' unpleasantness works so well in Requiem for a Dream, we understand and feel how the characters are driven to full-fill their 'instincts', the need to get drugs again. However, this doesn't work so well when showing, and visualizing, an obsessed girl in Black Swan. It was just... very very unpleasant. Obsession is not an instinct, it's a self-taught (or indoctrinated) defect (in the same manner as people can be religious, or start stalking someone). I had a hard time relating to Natalie Portman's character. I'm a reasoning man, and I can't for the life of me fathom being so obsessed without alarm bells ringing in my head. She doesn't have any alarm bells whatsoever, even when it's all too clear (even to her!) she's being schizophrenic. I know it is my own fault that I don't like this movie, I can't relate to nor do I respect unreasoning people. That leaves only pity. So out of pity I give this movie 6 points out of 10.",6,3,5,7 February 2011
The Reader," Thought provoking!
","The Plot: A teenage boy finds himself in a (sexual) relation with an older woman. Part of their relation is based on the boy reading to the older woman. However one day the woman disappears, leaving the teenage boy heartbroken.Several years later he finds her again as he witnesses (as a spectator) her trial where she is charged for war crimes.As society passes moral judgement over the woman, so does he. Whether he is right or wrong in doing so is left to the viewer to decide, the movie merely shows us what happens given the choices the characters made.The acting: Although I don't think anyone could've acted any better than Kate Winslet in this movie, speaking English with a German accent to portray Germans is very disappointing. However, the characters don't speak out every emotion they are experiencing (unlike most US of A movies) which challenges the viewer to think for themselves, is it love, fear, sense of duty, hate, misunderstanding, shame (and i could go on) that motivates the characters actions? Very difficult to pull off, but all actors pull this off magnificently. They force you to look at the complexities of a human being and (rightfully so) deny you the easy way out by simply putting people in 'good' or ' bad' categories and be done with it. (Note: see those reviews that think bad of this movie? Written by people who love doing this and find themselves confronted with their own shallow mind, better to disregard the movie then!)To sum it up, a very nice thought provoking movie about morals and love. Definitely worth a watch!",8,1,1,13 August 2010
Inception," Deceivingly excellent
","When film-makers make a movie that deals with the human subconscious like inception, they have millions of trinkets to play with. Literally, the film-makers own imagination is the limit.Inception does this very nicely, it creates rules for which the inception (-planting an idea in someone's subconscious while they sleep) takes place, and tries to get the absolute most out of the story, action and graphics within the rules it created for itself for this inception to take place.Even though I found the movie very entertaining, in the end I felt a bit conned. This was because the movie kept telling me over and over again how brilliant it was, and how superbly complex it was, while in fact, it wasn't complex at all. The basic story is very simple actually. It's just made complex with a lot of gimmicks.This isn't really a bad thing, all movies do it. So I wondered whether 'feeling conned' is a good argument. I guess it mainly had to do with the ending of the movie. The ending is a cheap way to have your audience question whether it was real or not. Of course, there is no correct answer. And that's OK. But why ask the question than? If it all w√°s real in end, the movie is that much better. Now they choose to be oh so 'deep' and 'thoughtful'. Where yet again, it really is not.I guess the 'feeling conned' sentiment comes from all the 'this movie is oh so complex, oh so deep, oh so thoughtful' gestures it makes. But it fails to deliver actual arguments (for me at least)to back that claim up. The gimmicks are (needlessly) complex indeed, the basic story itself is not, not by a long shot.This all sounds very negative, and the movie doesn't deserve it, it's a very good movie and to all the people I know I recommended watching it. Mainly because it spawned interesting conversations. However, that bitter after-taste of 'feeling conned' has made me come to feel this is a movie without heart. To me it seems they didn't want to make this movie so 'complex' and 'deep' because they loved doing so or because the story deserved it. They only did it to try and trick me to think this was a brilliant movie. And when you try to do that with me, I tend to back away.All in all, a very good movie, which left a cheesy after-taste. But at least it was a lot better than the Dark Knight (the directors previous blockbuster) which I found horrendously bad (and over-hyped). So, Final Verdict: 7 It would have been 1 or 2 points higher if the movie had more heart. A lame argument I know, but I don't know how else to put in words.",7,4,7,21 December 2010
