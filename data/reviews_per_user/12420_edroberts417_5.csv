Captain Phillips," Captain Phillips
","Swashbuckling pirates, the kind with gold earrings, long hair and parrots, possessed of some of the greatest names in history—names like Blackbeard, Calico Jack, and Black Bart—are a staple of moviedom. Savage murderers and thieves though they were, what with cutting off people's parts and all, we love to watch them and like to think of them as living by some code of pirate honor. After all, it is the movies.'Captain Phillips' the story of a real life hijacking by Somali pirates, this time toting AK-47's rather than sabers and without the flashy nicknames, of a cargo ship plying the waters off East Africa. Captain Richard Phillips, (Tom Hanks) is a competent and conscientious captain who knows his ship well and runs it tight. Hanks is, as always, Hanks. He's just not a transformative actor. Competent and usually engaging, not hard to watch, but never impressive—more of a star than an actor. But here Hanks should be given some leeway—his character just isn't very interesting and some of the dialogue is notably awkward. (Scriptwriting credit goes to relative newcomer Billy Ray, whose only other credit is 'Hunger Games.' Draw from that what you will.) One of the more blatant instances of this comes in one of the establishing scenes, in which Phillips and his wife are driving to the airport, where he will board a plane to Oman to pick up his ship. It's a transparent effort to write that particular type of random, streaming, conversation between a husband and wife—and it doesn't work. That type of casual dialogue, the most common in real life and yet the hardest to write, almost never (outside the hands of Robert Altman) works—and Billy Ray ain't no Robert Altman. However, awkward as the dialogue is, we do get some sense of Captain Phillips. He's hard working, loves his wife, is concerned about his kids finding jobs after college And once the action starts it becomes apparent that he is a resilient and resourceful man, remaining resolute in the face of a very real threat. And that's about it. We never see anything of the interior of the man. What makes him who he is. What are his weaknesses? His foibles? What is his internal conflict? It's not there.The real star of 'Captain Phillips' is the camera of director Paul Greengrass. Best known for The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum, this is just the type of production that Greengrass does best. Most of the action takes place in confined spaces with lots of steel ladders, stairwells and places to fall from—things that could give you anything from a nasty bump on the head to a broken femur. He teams up again with editor Christopher Rouse and, like the Bourne movies, the action is non-stop and the pacing is spot-on. The camera is frenetic and close, the editing is fast and sharp, and the tension never wanes. The problem is that it's not much of a story, rather; it's a sequence of events. Expertly filmed and edited events, yes, but not much more than that. It is, essentially, a good guy/bad guy movie, with Phillips squaring off against the leader of the pirate band. Like all movies of the type, the two principles butt heads and match wits, first one on top and then the other, until one of them prevails. But, although the captain and the pirate leader are the primary characters, at least some of the supporting cast needs to be developed and brought to the forefront, for at least a moment or two, in order for any movie to work. 'Captain Phillips fails miserably in this department. Nary a one of the crew stands out from the rest. They all perform admirably. There are no backsliders or hysterical cowards. Nobody gets angry. There is no conflict about course of action. Nobody is even a diabetic whose insulin has been made unavailable, for crying out loud. They are absolutely interchangeable. Same goes for the Navy Seals, the other three pirates, the naval officers—not a single memorable character among them.The standout here is Barkhad Abdi as the leader of the pirate gang, a sinister, erratic and sleep deprived Somali named Musé. He is, by far, the most interesting character in the film. Ordered to do what he does by the local warlord, Musé is not a pirate by choice. One of the best scenes in the film is a brief conversation between him and the Captain in which Musé spits out that if there were still fish in the ocean and Somalia was still what it was generations ago, he would be a fisherman in a fishing village, which his home used to be. Musé was not born a pirate.He was made into one, and he knows it and he laments it. Captain Phillips suggests at one point that Musé release him and take the thirty thousand dollars in cash that had been in the ship's safe. Musé replies that he has gone too far to turn back—an observation that could be applied to his home as well as himself. Has Somalia been broken too badly to be repaired, to ever return to what it once was? Suddenly, this chillingly dangerous man shifts from villain to victim. However, other than that subtle comment by Musé, the script sticks to the action, never waxing blatantly allegorical and, in this pivotal scene, Abdi plays Musé as a resigned and very young man faced with a life without prospect, deftly avoiding preachiness or martyrdom—a refreshing change from so much of what is out there. He is not a swashbuckling and proud pirate captain. He is a broken man with not so much as a parrot on his shoulder.",7,0,3,24 October 2013
Gravity," 'Gravity'
","Gravity' is the story of two people who find themselves marooned on that most desolate of desert isles—outer space.Alfonso Cuaron, who wrote (along with his son, Jonas Cuaron)and directed 'Gravity,' is unarguably one of the best in the business and, by adding 'Gravity' to a list including the impressive 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' and 'Children of Men,' shows himself to be one of the most versatile, as well. Unlike the other two, which deal with relationships between, in one case humans and in the other societal forces. 'Gravity' is about the interaction between one person and the void of outer space—in other words, nothing. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), a medical researcher and space newbie, is visiting the ISS for the purpose of some experiment or other. We're never told what it is, but that doesn't matter. Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), is a veteran space man and, apparently, Stone's minder and affable tour guide on this seemingly routine mission. Other than a voice from 'Houston,' they are the only characters in the film--but make no mistake about it, this is Bullock's show, and, in large part, a one- person show. It's a risky place for an actor, or a director, to go--if it fails, it fails miserably. The dialogue must be authentic, the pacing needs to be spot on, and action sequences must be perfectly placed to keep the audience's attention and break up the monologue in the right places, and Cuaron, with the exception of a few lines of dialogue, gets it right. There are no draggy bits begging to be over with. There is no voice-over interior monologue in 'Gravity'--all of Ryan Stone's thoughts are spoken and that can be heavy burden to bear. It's always exciting to see an actor successfully step out of their comfort zone and that's what Bullock does in 'Gravity.' She's frequently played fish-out-of-water characters before—an alcoholic in '28 Days,' an undercover cop/beauty queen in 'Miss Congeniality' and an inspiring, rebellious Dallas suburbanite in 'Blind Side.' But here she is not only outside societal norms (It appears she is a wounded loner back on earth and, besides that, not many people go to outer space), but outside the realm of humanity generally. What there is of unspoken introspection is provided by Matt Kowalski's dialogue. Clooney plays Kowalski perhaps a bit over the top. Although we expect supreme competence from an astronaut, he is at times too calm, too chatty, coming off as comfortable and cheerful floating around in space, untethered to the space station, as he would be at a backyard barbecue. But that's okay—he's there mostly as a foil against which Bullock works. Not to mention, Clooney is an exceedingly likable actor and listening to his, for the most part, one-sided banter provides some much needed subtle comic relief from the tension and sense of chilling helplessness 'Gravity' is essentially a thriller and, like most thrillers, everything is going along just fine until something goes terribly awry and the protagonist is called upon, against dread and self-doubt, to rise to the occasion. In this case, Stone and Kowalski find themselves stranded in outer space—not in the space station, mind you, but floating around in space suits—without any communication with 'Houston' and a good distance from the space station. One of the most refreshing things about 'Gravity' is Cuaron's use CGI. It's unnoticeable, seamless, and he avoids falling into the pit of a CGI fest, like almost every other director who has access to a computer seems to do. He strives for an accurate portrayal of the space environment, and does it elegantly. Even the casual science geek could fine some implausibilities and downright violations of the laws of physics, but they are minor and more than made up for by what the film gets right and it's feel of authenticity. It truly seems like these two are in outer space. (Besides, much of what Jason Bourne could pull of with a broken cell phone and candy wrapper stretches notions of possibility, as well, and that doesn't seem to bother us too much.)'Gravity' is so much more than hyper-drive spaceships, photon torpedoes and Death Stars. It examines the depths of what it means to human and just where our place in the universe may, or may not, be. In spite of its plot-driven structure, it deserves a place right up there with some of the best, and smartest, outer space films, films like '2001: A Space Odyssey,' and 'Moon' Films like these are not science fiction—they are human truth, plumbing the human soul rather merely telling a fantastical story. Perhaps it is something about being so far removed from the home where we evolved that causes us to wax existential. The distinction is that whereas those two ask the basic existential question 'who are we,' on behalf of all humanity; 'Gravity' is about one person asking herself the question, 'who am I, and do I want to persist in this human life in a world so far beyond human scale?'--and answers it. But perhaps that distinction between the films is not valid—-maybe they are the same question.",8,1,3,14 October 2013
Rush," Rush
","Sure, cutting edge is sexy and gets a lot of attention from both critics and casual movie goers—it's easy to recognize and even easier to talk about. However, there is a place for supreme competence and Ron Howard is one of the most supremely competent. But just because he isn't pushing the limits of style or technique—which can sometimes be little too calculated and self conscious—doesn't mean he's not versatile. Consider the impressive Frost/Nixon and his latest effort, Rush—about as far from each other in style and scale as you can get—even if they do share a common theme. Both films are, essentially, about two men, rivals, who need each other in order to reach their full potential and self awareness. Rush is the story of one of the greatest sports rivalries of all time— the battle for title of the best Formula 1 racer in the world. The sometimes friendly, and often bitter, rivalry between Britain James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Austrian Nikki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl), captivated the racing world through much of the seventies, reaching a dramatic peak in 1976. Note here that in Europe, where Formula1 racers are accorded rock star status (something Hunt's overactive libido takes full advantage of), it captivated far more than the racing world—it captivated an entire continent. One of the best scenes in the film shows, in amusing fashion, that for Italian men the only things in the world more exciting than a beautiful woman are a fast car and Formula 1 driver.Jame Hunt, a brash and sometimes offensively arrogant playboy, navigates his McLaren 'bomb on wheels' by instinct and guts; Nikki Lauda, a calculating and sometimes offensively arrogant technician, drives his Ferrari by the book, assessing risk and reward like a bond trading statistician. When the car isn't what he wants it to be, Hunt berates his mechanics to make it better; Lauda tells his mechanics precisely what is wrong and how to fix it. Hunt is the charming bon vivant, comfortable in any social situation because he makes it his own; Lauda is an acerbic social misfit with no idea that he repels almost everyone he meets.Daniel Bruhl's portrayal of Lauda transcends the genre, elevating the film to more than just an action-filled biopic. He plays Lauda as humorless, but with a subtle, squashed wryness behind the eyes. It's a nomination quality performance. Chris Hemsworth proves himself to be better than the pretty boy roles he's had until now—much better. This guy can really act. One problem throughout the film is that Hemsworth is just too damn good-looking, distractingly so. The casting smacks of manipulation. It feels as if the film uses every angle to make us like Hunt as much as we dislike Lauda , to the extent of making Hunt overly attractive and Lauda, well, not so much, in order to set us up for self- chagrin when, later in the film, Lauda faces a personal disaster that can invoke only the most profound sympathy. But in retrospect it makes sense—actual footage of the two runs behind the final credits and it turns out that Hunt was strikingly handsome and Lauda.....Howard brings together his standing team of Anthony Dod Mantle, cinematographer, and Daniel P. Hanley as editor—and to good effect—the three work together seamlessly. The colors are bright and saturated (A red Ferrari is a damn red Ferrari) with with almost garish seventies style banners flashing on the screen announcing the location of every race—and there are a lot of races. The film does not want for road action. One of the reasons for going to a race movie is to see racing. Rush delivers, and delivers well. To the credit of Hanley, the scenes on the track are exciting and tense in just the right proportion and show in visceral detail how these machines work and just what they and their drivers are capable of—truly awesome, and not in the pop sense of the word.It's hard to come up with a criticism of Rush. After all, it is a racing movie and a story of a spirited rivalry between two of the best in their field—each a time-worn genre and somewhat limiting in their strict forms —so it gets a little room for having a few clichés, which it does. But, having said that, it is one of the absolute best of both types. It's fun, it's exciting, there are no slow spots and it's got some really cool cars in it. (Maybe the Italians have their priorities in line, after all.) It's definitely worth seeing, and worth seeing on the big screen—the racing scenes deserve far more than a small screen can deliver.",7,4,6,15 October 2013
Ender's Game," Ender's Game
","Are you ready for this? 'Ender's Game,' written and directed by Gavin Hood, and based on a 1985 novel of the same name by Orson Scott Card (incidentally, a self-professed and obnoxiously vocal pillar of general intolerance of any person not like himself, and homosexuals especially), is set in a future when humanity comes under attack by an ant-like race of aliens and the solution is to draft a bunch of prepubescent kids (all boys and a single token girl, by the way) to use their gaming skills to command the fleet that will ultimately save nothing less than humanity itself. How's that for a storyline? There's really not much good to say about 'Ender's Game,' unless you're a 14 year old boy whose greatest fantasy is to live in a video game, and there are, apparently and unfortunately, enough of those out there to make it worth spending hundreds of millions of dollars on an epic piece of crap like Ender's Game.' Your average comic book has better character development and plot.Over the past decade more and more 'blockbusters' have been little more than CGI porn fests and that has come to be accepted, but Ender's game takes it to a new level (and the CGI isn't even that good) by way of a scene in which the main character actually becomes a character in a video game—as in there is no real life actor, the main character himself being a product of CGI. Talk about turning it up to eleven.Ender Wiggin is played by Asa Butterfield, a particularly wooden young actor who has apparently mastered the ability to make his eyes water at will, a fact of which Director Hood makes great use in a failed attempt to imbue his main character with some semblance of life. Young Wiggin's greatest talent seems to be spouting such insights egarding conflict and enemy management as to humble even Sun Tzu. In between dropping these profound pearls he manages to lead to victory a team of completely interchangeable characters in a type of zero gravity, three dimensional billiards table batle ground A feat which so impresses the commander of 'battle'school, one Colonel Hyrum Graff(Harrison Ford), that Wiggin is given command of the entire fleet. Ford's character is a standard issue military hard ass, yet a noble one, who has sacrificed his own humanity for the greater good, understanding that in war there must be an acceptance of collateral damage not limited to loss of life, but including loss of innocence as well. Sound familiar? Ford tries to play Graff as gruff and ruthlessly pragmatic, but comes off as Harrison Ford trying to play gruff and ruthlessly pragmatic. For some unfathomable reason Ben Kingsley makes an appearance as a Maori warrior complete with facial tattoos and the whole bit. It's hard to know what he needed more, the money or a new agent. If he keeps doing things like this, he just may have his knighthood revoked.",3,6,17,4 November 2013
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Meet the Gang
","One of the more difficult things to get right in a movie is full and rich character development. Unlike books, movies are shorter, the plot comes faster and the elements are more immediate. A film maker has only a short time to get the characters right before the audience wants to get the plot going--about twenty minutes, certainly no more than thirty. Many films get by with only two or three fully fleshed out character and the others done in broad strokes, using the shorthand of either stock or, in some cases, downright cliché players.'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' is one of the great exceptions. One of the standout brilliant scenes, in this film of many, takes place in the first few minutes when McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) is forced to sit in a group session with all the other residents of the ward. This is where the cast of characters are introduced to the audience. With Nurse Rached (Louise Fletcher) as mediator, the personalities and quirks of all 'the crazies,' as McMurphy refers to them, come to the surface in efficient, yet subtle, fashion. Not only are the characters fully drawn, but the relationships between them are apparent.Part of this is due to Forman's ingenious camera work. By, for the most part, avoiding long shots, which tend to lend a 'third person' quality to the narrative, and placing the camera inside the circle of chairs, the audience is drawn into the action and placed in a 'second person' position and, at one point or another, occupying the place of every one of the characters. In this way, the 'second person' viewer not only sees and experiences the interrelationships of the ward, but is also called upon to form his own relationship with each character--like them or not. The audience 'investment' in the narrative is established and from there the plot takes off.",9,1,2,11 October 2013
