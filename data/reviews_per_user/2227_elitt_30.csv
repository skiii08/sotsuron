Walk the Line," Coolest Man on Film
","The story of Johnny Cash chronicling his life from when he was a young boy growing up broke on a farm in 1944 to 1968 where he had just recorded his famous live album at Folsom County Jail and a live performance where he ultimately proposed to June Carter on stage. Like the film 'Ray', the performances are outstanding and probably better than the movie.Jouquin Phoenix channels Johnny Cash like he's played him his entire life. He is amazing. He doesn't look like him much, but Jouquin did his own singing and sounded just like him. He also had all his nuances down including the way he swung that guitar around while playing live. Reese Witherspoon is just as good as June Carter. She also sang her own songs and look for both of them at Oscar time. She plays June like a little kitten, but also very strong as the woman June Carter was. Robert Patrick plays Ray Cash, John's father and boy, was he a piece of work. It's easy to see how Johnny Cash came to hate his father, but also respected the hard working man he was. Much of Cash's inner demons come from his relationship with his father and the blame that was put on him when his older brother Jack died in an accident when he was younger.A lot of this film showed Cash's struggles with pills and addiction and ultimately his time in prison. Some of this is tough to watch, but like 'Ray' a very important part of the singer's life. The best aspects of 'Walk the Line' is the music and the love story between Johnny and June. The two of them just simply belonged together.Johnny Cash was never the biggest star in the world, but he was always the coolest man in the room. Fans of his will appreciate this film for the music and capturing some of his most infamous moments during a span of his life. Other's will just enjoy a fine film and appreciate some wonderful performances. (***1/2)",8,0,1,12 December 2005
The Longest Yard," Go Rent the original Instead
","As a fan of the original, I wasn't expecting anything close to it, but this version really is pretty lame. I blame poor casting for much of the films problems and the weak writing doesn't help either. Adam Sandler brings nothing to the old Burt Reynold's role of Paul Crewe, an NFL quarterback chastised for point shaving in a game. he gets thrown into the pokey for basically acting like a big dope. There is no reason for him to go to jail except for absolutely wanting to spend some time with some very rough boys.Chris Rock is wasted in his role as 'Caretaker'. He is given nothing to do. Even Burt Reynolds shows up as the coach. He is fun, as is trying to pick out all the ex-NFL stars in the cast including Bob Sapp, Michael Ervin, and Brian Bosworth. The original film also had some former players in the cast.The warden played by James Cromwell is football obsessed and arranges a scrimmage game between his guards and the cons. His guards are a champion team and he does whatever it takes to keep it that way.Adam Sandler can be an engaging comedic actor, but he basically plays an angry unfunny puss. He isn't funny and neither is Rock. The casting is all stunted and the writing doesn't warrant the payroll. (**)",5,0,0,7 October 2005
Finding Neverland," I do believe in fairies! But 7 Oscar nominations?
","Miramax is masterful at pulling Oscar nominations out of their asses for their sweet sunny films that probably shouldn't be getting as many accolades as it should. That's not to say the movie isn't any good, but generally, it's all about marketing. 'Finding Neverland' is a good sweet film that follows writer JM Barrie's creation of 'Peter Pan'.Depp plays Barrie with a lot of tenderness and goodness. Barrie, just coming off a flop and in the midst of a stale marriage hooks up with a family while at the park with his giant dog. Kate Winslet plays a widowed mom with 4 kids and she needs help. Barrie offers it to her and eventually endears himself to her and her boys becoming an inspiration for his writing of 'Peter Pan'.The movie is well done. It flows well, it's sweet, and of course it's about the creation of a classic story. Who doesn't love Peter Pan? The movie does it's job at telling a nice story. I didn't find the performances anything special, but they were good enough. Depp is good, but I think he excels at the quirkier roles.This movie received 7 Oscar nominations. I don't see it. It's a nice sweet film that is enjoyable, but I think the nominations are more the work of the masterful Miramax marketing machine. (***)",6,0,2,5 April 2005
Friday Night Lights," Gritty Grid-Iron Action Goes a Long Way
","Based on true events, a Texas towns obsession with their high school football team is quite a little story. It's also a sad story. I'm all for getting behind your local high school athletics, but my god, get a life. Billy Bob Thornton plays the beloved football coach with daunting task to get the team to the promised land, the Texas State Championship. The problem is that he can't just get the team there. He has to win the thing along with trying to get an undefeated season out of his players.The players are all your typical colorful characters. The star player is headed to the NFL if he can just shrink his head a little bit and the supporters are all stock roles. But the film works. It works well because the writing is so good and the grid iron action is top notch. Somewhere in white trash USA, these people exist. Stores are closed because the owners go to the game instead of running their business. This is probably true in many places across the country. But in this film, the obsession is rampant. This town deserves each other.The movie does tell a compelling story and the football scenes are exceptional. It reminded me of films like 'Any Given Sunday', 'Rudy' and even 'The Program', a movie which I liked, but many others didn't. Billy Bob Thornton is made to play Coach Gaines. A man who understands the situation he is in, but also realizes that it's still just a game and this town needs to realize that. That is best stated in a scene where he is more or less threatened if his team doesn't get the big win while driving into town.This is a top notch sports film with terrific acting and tells a compelling story very well. I just wish these people would relax a bit. (***1/2)",Null,0,1,2 February 2005
Brokeback Mountain," Not Just a Gay Cowboy Movie
","Ennis and Jack are two cowboys at the same paths of their lives. Both around the same age, come from crappy lifestyles, and not much to look forward to. They take a job working as sheepherders for a season and when the elements and boredom throw each other together, the two of them begin a homosexual relationship. What starts out as a lark turns into something more. For Jack, it's something that he probably has felt for a long time. For Ennis, it's a person showing him some love and companionship that he doesn't get enough from from his girl back home, who he in fact eventually marries. The two of them, after continuing their lives, begin a sordid affair of seasonal trips to the mountains where they had their first experience together. This goes on for years. The film takes place in 1963 Wyoming, where homosexual behavior isn't exactly encouraged. They keep it a secret and live their lives as if nothing happened, but they both know the one thing that keeps them going is their trips to Brokeback. The performances by Ennis (Heath Ledger)and Jack (Jake Gyllenhall) are terrific. Ledger is Australian, and you'd think he was born to play a cowboy. He seems to say more with his eyes than his voice as he tries very hard to hids his accent which he does a very good job doing. He's a very versatile actor. The movie tells a very poignant story. It's very slow moving, but I think it needed to move at a certain pace to tell their story right. Some of the scenes are a little rough and will make some feel uncomfortable. This isn't a movie you come out of the theater smiling and thinking how much you enjoyed it, but it is a very thought provoking film and extremely well acted and well written. As many refer to this film as the gay cowboy movie, I'd hope that people would give it a chance. It's really more than that and I believe tells a very poignant story. (***1/2)",8,6,7,6 January 2006
Hotel Rwanda," Cheadle is terrific!
","'Hotel Rwanda' tells the true story of the genocide that occurred in the mid 90s between the Tutsis and the Hatu's. Don Cheadle plays Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager who housed thousands of Tutsis and Hatus in his hotel to keep them from slaughter. His story is fascinating and Cheadle is amazing.What could have been a very depressing film, what we get instead is the story told from a different point of view. Paul was considered a traitor by his people because of his efforts. Paul risked his family, his life, and his freedom to help thousands of people because he believed it was the right thing to do. The militia didn't see it that way, as Paul was constantly on the defense and risking his life. Throughout the whole ordeal, he constantly used bribery, favors, and lies to get whatever he needed.Cheadle, who has been very good before steals the whole movie. His acting covers all kinds of range. You see his pain as he tries to balance all these things and he knows that none of it may do any good. he deserved his Oscarnomination and in my book he should have won.I was worried that this movie might be a depressing film like say, 'Killing Fields'. It really isn't at all and if anything it's inspired and tells a very interesting story. There is some rough parts, but if you can make it to the end, you'll be satisfied and fulfilled.

Crash," Doesn't Get Much Better Than This
","A snooty lawyer and his angry wife are carjacked by two black men. A light skinned black director and his wife are mis-treated by a racist white cop after getting pulled over for a traffic violation. A Russian store owner who doesn't speak much English, gets broken into and blames a poor Latino locksmith for his trouble. A black cop is worried that his relationship with his Mexican female partner will upset his colleagues and mother, who he has an estranged relationship with. All these stories are intertwined to form an arc and all come together at the end to state a message about our society and how it deals with race.In the tradition of Robert Altman's fine films like 'The Player', and 'Short Cuts', as well as Lawrence Kasdan's 'Grand Canyon', 'Crash' does a wonderful job at mixing and matching a number of characters and stories and having them all come together. This film has amazing writing and performances. The characters are all real and they seem like people you've probably met before. Director Paul Haggis, who just won an Oscar for 'Million Dollar Baby' really does a great job at balancing everyone and giving each story equal screen time.This is an intense film at times and each character's story packs some emotional punch. The writing is dynamite and I highly recommend 'Crash' (****)",10,6,14,23 September 2005
The Polar Express," It's a Norman Rockwell painting Come to life, But will kids like it?
","'Polar Express' is beautifully made, extremely well done, and for adults a real engaging film, but for children, I think they'll be un-enthralled with this. Based on the book, which is only 30 short pages, Robert Zemekis seems to make this little book come to like as if you're watching a Norman Rockwell painting come to life. It's all shot like it was drawn in the 30's. The look of the movie is terrific. But that being said, I believe kids will be put off with the zombie like eyes and character generation imagery. The characters might look creepy to young children and because of the retro look it may turn them off. My 6 year old saw it and seemed to like it OK, but my 3 1/2 year old was scared by it. The story is very charming and timeless. I liked the animation and I got caught up in it. Will the film be considered a classic? Only time will tell, but my first instinct is no. Is it the disaster the critics are making it out to be? Not in the least. It's not making any money, but that doesn't mean it's a bad film. I hope people warm up it. (***)",Null,0,2,2 December 2004
Closer," Not Exactly an Uplifting Film
","As much as I appreciate good acting and good storytelling, I also want to root for somebody in a film and not feel completely depressed afterward. 'Closer' exhibits some wonderful acting indeed. The four leads are terrific and Natalie Portman in a very adult role, is especially good. My problem with this movie is that I hated everyone. These are four of the most unhappy people I've come across in a long time. They're all entwined in troubled relationships and frankly all four of them deserve each other.The acting is terrific. The story is very well written and the diologue is OK. I just didn't care. This is not a feel good story about romance and relationships. If anything, it'll make you question yours.

The Aviator," Performances and Flight Sequences soar in the Aviator, but it's a tedious ride
","Martin Scorcese's 'The Aviator' is an extremely well made and crafted film with terric performances all around. Leonardo DiCaprio gives the performance of his career and the rest of the cast is terrific as well. Cate Blanchett has Katherine Hepburn down cold and Alan Alda steals scenes when he is on screen as a seedy Maine senator. I never knew much about Howard Hughes. My only recollection of him on screen is in the film 'Melvin & Howard'. He was obviously a genius, an aviation pioneer, a difficult man to work for, a man of vision, a womanizer, and a man with many phobias and quirks that eventually would cause many of his problems. DiCaprio manages to capture all of them and he does it very well. That's the good news.The film takes Hughes career starting in the mid 1920's with the filming of his film 'Hells Angels' and goes along through the Hepburn days and ends with his feud with the American government and the Senatorial hearings when he owned TWA and fought against a monopoly with Pan Am for international flight. In between all this, we watch Hughes go from movie star to movie star, build plane after plane, and eventually crash one of them in the middle of Beverly Hills and sustain major injuries which he recovers from mighty quickly. All the aviation stuff is very interesting. It's the personal phobias that made me uncomfortable. Hughes was a germ freak almost to the point where he should be institutionalized. He also admits to Hepburn at one point of the film that he sees demons. that isn't truly explained. There are a few things that aren't explained very well, yet we get multiple scenes of his quirks and phobias that seemed to go on way too long. There is an extended scene where he locks himself in a screening room for weeks when he has a breakdown. I felt like I was going to have a breakdown he was in there so long. The film needed an edit job as I was constantly looking at my watch at about the 2 hour mark. The ending is another issue I had a problem with as I felt it could've ended 10 minutes prior than it did.I'm going to recommend 'The Aviator' because with all it's problems, it's still a good film about a guy that is about as fascinating there is. I think everyone would wish they had a little bit of Hughes'vision and drive in them. (***)",7,3,5,14 February 2005
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," You'll love this Virgin
","It's nice to know that a funny R-rated comedy is still out there. There haven't been too many anymore, but when they work, they work. Steve Carell plays Andy, a geeky 40 year old who lives by himself in an apartment with more video games than your average teenager and an ASIA poster mounted on his wall. He also has more action figures than my son. When his co-workers find out that Andy is a virgin, they make it a point to get him laid and rectify the situation. Keep in mind, that none of these guys are prizes themselves and have their own relationship issues. After all, they work in a stereo store and most of them are in their 30's and some are older than Andy. When Andy does meet a sweet woman named Trish (Catherine Keener) he keeps his secret to himself out of fear of embarrassment. Trish, herself has 3 kids of her own and is a very young grandmother.There are a lot of big laughs in this. Poor Andy endures some body waxing, a crazy drunk bar pick-up, and some other scary dates before he finally gets up the nerve to ask Trish out. The bulk of the humor is pretty adult and their is also plenty of profanity and nudity. There is a real sweetness to the film though, and Carell's performance is right on and should launch him to A status if he isn't already there.'40 Year Old Virgin', along with films like 'Wedding Crashers', 'Anchorman', 'Old School', and 'Office Space' would make a nice marathon on an evening when there isn't much to do. they're all funny, raunchy, and a really good time.

Alien vs. Predator," Nobody Wins in this Battle of the Titans
","Your enjoyment of this film will depend on whatever expectations you have going into it. As a fan of the Alien and Predator franchises, I had hopes for this one. They weren't high hopes, but I wanted something that I could at least say, 'well, that was pretty cool'. I also expected a decent kill factor. Not much of any of the above happened.Lance Henricksen, in a non 'Bishop' role plays a scientist who leads a team to Antarctica to discover what is supposed to be the first pyramid. Naturally, there is reluctance in the main expert (Sanaa Lathan). The team needs to get 300 feet underground to reach this pyramid and avoid any other explorers on the same mission. Little do they know that the other 'explorers' are about 8 feet tall and comes from outer space and carrying many sharp weapons and ugly fangs. Apparently the Predators want this pyramid as well. This pyramid is being guarded by some other bad asses. Those would be the Aliens led by big bad mama. For reasons that are explained not very well, the two species don't like each other very much.The battle scenes are few and far between. There needed to be more of them and they needed to be better. The audiences of these two franchises are very familiar with these guys and something new needed to be offered instead of the typical popping out of nowhere and showing it's big fangs. These bad guys weren't very interesting.What I did like was the pyramid that they were all stuck in. For someone as claustrophobic as me, I found the pyramid was very very creepy. The scientists all got trapped and stuck in various parts of this thing and guess who was waiting for them.This movie isn't horrible, but it isn't any good either. It falls in the middle between garbage and an OK rental. If you like either of these franchises, it's worth a look just to satisfy your curiosity (**)",4,1,2,7 February 2005
Batman Begins," You'll go Batty for this hero
","A very strong comic book film based on the Dark Knight. This film blows the Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher films out of the water. Where the previous four films were a lot of flash and money, this film is about character and story.My biggest complaints about the Batman films were the lack of character development and the poor storytelling. They all had some neat colorful villains and some great production value, but the audience never got to know anything really about them. This time director Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia)gets it right on. We get to the root of Bruce Wayne and Batman. A lot of time is spent on Bruce Wayne's childhood and his early troubles. We even get a glimpse of his family life as we learn some things about his father.The storyline is the origin of Batman and how he becomes the Dark Knight. Played very well by Christian Bale, Bruce Wayne is the reluctant socialite who balances his giant company and fights crime dressed as a bat. Gotham City is being controlled by an evil mob boss played deliciously by Tom Wilkerson. I loved his role. He has some evil cronies on his payroll including a deranged psychiatrist named Crane. He'll later be known as Scarecrow. Wilkerson has control of Gotham, but he isn't the mastermind. That's revealed later on in the film. Wayne is befriended by assistant DA and childhood friend Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes). Her role is a bit hard to take.I enjoyed the action in the film. Chicago looked great as they did some nifty things to our L' trains. The production value was good as the film wasn't spent on the cheap but it wasn't the over-produced mess of Batman & Robin either.The cast is top notch with Bale, Wilkerson, Morgan Freeman as sort of a makeshift 'Q', Gary Oldman gets to have some fun as a young Commissioner Gordon, but my favorite casting was Michael Caine as Alfred. He was perfectly cast. My only beef is the casting of Holmes as Rachel. I like Katie Holmes, but she wasn't believable in her role and quite simply too young. That's a small complaint. This film will be what many Batman films will have been waiting for. (***1/2)",9,1,3,12 July 2005
Meet the Fockers," Stunt Casting Can't Save Predictable Fockers
","This movie is a perfect rental. It's not that great and it's not un-watchable by any means. It's one of those films that is safe, cute, and you'd kick yourself in the heinie if you would've shelled out 9 bucks to see this. Basically, if you saw 'Meet the Parents', then you've seen this one already without having to sit through it because it's essentially the same movie. Greg (Ben stiller) and Amy (Teri Polo) are engaged and after surviving the Byrnes family, it's now time to meet the Fockers.Greg's folks (Barbara Streisand and Dustin Hoffman) are eccentric, loving, extremely left winged liberals and they play it to such a hilt that it's almost cartoonish at times. The Byrnes, of course are led by ex-CIA psycho dad Robert Deniro who wants nothing but the best for his daughter and family. Naturally, the two families clash and the events in the film are comical at times, but also very predictable. DeNiro brings his cute grandson along for the trip and when Greg is asked to watch the baby, you just know the first word out of the kids mouth won't be 'mama' or 'dada'.It's nice to see Hoffman and Barbra on screen together. It's obviously stunt casting, but it almost works. Streisand even has her 70's giant frizz hair that she parlayed in movies like 'Star Is Born' and 'Main Event'. Hoffman is just a left winged weirdo at times that was a bit hard to take. I think better casting might have been Ben's real dad, Jerry Stiller and Estelle Harris (Seinfeld). That way you'd still have a bit of stunt casting with a more believable and nutty set of parents. Sort of a 'Meet the Costanzas', if you will.This movie is cute, charming, and funny at times, but save this one for the video store. It's just not worth the price of admission.

The Incredibles," Pixar fights crime and comes out on top
","There is something about Pixar that puts them above all the rest. As much as I loved the two 'Shrek' films, Pixar just seems to bring things to a different level that puts Dreamworks feeling envious. 'The Incredibles' is not only about being a superhero, it's about how to deal with the hazards of being a superhero, esp. when you no longer can carry out the task. Bob Parr is Mr Incredible, and when a mishap leads to the courts ridding the world of superheros, Bob must take an ordinary day job pushing pencils. He's married to Elastigirl and they have 3 kids who are just learning their powers.Fifteen years have passed and Bob is getting a bit itchy. He's bored with his work and wants to fight crime again. After being lured into a case, Bob realizes that the whole thing is a set-up and part of a devious plan to take over the world and to create a new super human race. It's always about that, isn't it. The movie plays out as sort of an animated Bond movie, with evil female henchman, giant rocket ships, secret island hide-outs, and the music is very retro. It looks great. All the characters are shot very cartoon-like so it would play out to a wide audience and not just an animated action film. It's very funny in places esp. a montage of all the mishaps of why superheros shouldn't wear a cape. That's great stuff. If the movie has any flaws is that it's too long and drags in many places. A good editing job couldn't hurt. But the movie works in many ways and credit Brad Bird who made the under-appreciated film, 'Iron Giant' for bringing these fun characters to life.

Million Dollar Baby," 'Baby' carries a powerful punch and knock-out performances
","'Million Dollar Baby' is really two films in one. A classic underdog story about a white trash waitress who wants to be a boxer. She comes from a small poor trailer town and saves whatever money she earns to give to her thankless mother back home. Hilary Swank plays Maggie Fitzgerald and she is good natured and only wants to fulfill her dream. She knows that Frankie Dunn, an aging struggling gym owner and former trainer is the man to get her there.Clint Eastwood plays Frankie and he's fighting his own demons. He attends church every day for no apparent reason. He isn't sure why he goes everyday, but he just feels he needs to make up for his lost daughter and his empty career. When Maggie appears in his gym for guidance, he sends her on his way, but she keeps coming back because of her determination and he eventually gives in. The two of them form an unusual bond. They ultimately need each other. She needs him to help her dream come true and as a father figure. Frankie sees Maggie as the daughter who'll return his letters and be in his life.The boxing sequences aren't focal or anything special, but they're well directed and simple. Eastwood accomplishes what he needs to with these. The story is about the characters. It's not a boxing film. Naturally, Maggie gets better and better and a title match ensues.While the first portion of the film is a true underdog story, the rest of it is a tearjerker as something unexpected occurs. Both portions blend well together and you'll be weeping like a baby. The film is a story about commitment, dedication, family, and redemption.All the roles are carefully laid out and as Eastwood has gotten older and older, he has gotten better and better as a director. Like, last years 'Mystic River', he directs his scenes with simplicity and he does it carefully without being too flashy. He lets his actors carry his films. Speaking of which, Hilary Swank is nothing short of amazing. She hits every right note as the naive woman who wants nothing more than to follow her dream and have a better life than she knows she has. Eastwood is terrific too. His best roles and acting jobs are when he is playing characters his own age. He hits the right notes more times than not. Morgan Freeman narrates the film and sort of plays the conscience of the film, like he did in Shawshank Redemption.I don't know if 'Million Dollar Baby' will come home with Oscar gold. It's not as flashy as 'The Aviator', but it's a better film and it will have you talking when you leave the film. (****)",Null,3,4,21 February 2005
Garden State," Sweet Little Gem from the guy in 'Scrubs'
","Zach Braff (Scrubs) stars, wrote, and directs this little gem about a guy who returns home after many years to attend his mother's funeral. His character, 'Largeman' is one of those guys who never really understands his existence. He was blamed for his mother's initial health problems and sent away to boarding school because his father felt that he needed to be away. He is also is on every manic-depressant known to man because his father thinks he needs it. 'Largeman' (his last name) isn't sure he really does need it, but goes anyway to please his dad.He eventually hooks up with some old friends and meets a new friend, Sam (Natalie Portman. Sam is an epileptic, a liar, and also a bit of a loon, but she also understands 'Large'. The two of them, in the very short time he is back home, begin a fruitful and important friendship.This movie is very low key, but it's also very charming and very funny. It's extremely well written. These are people that are identifiable, and everyone probably knows someone like 'Largeman'. He justs simply wants to live his life and begin to understand things better. Not always do what people think is right for him. (***1/2)",8,1,2,3 January 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Sweet Success
","As a lukewarm fan of the original Gene Wilder film and knowing Tim Burton's track record for films with great production but no substance, I went into this with low expectations but I was very pleasantly surprised of how enjoyable this was.I loved a few of Burton's movies (Big Fish, Ed Wood), but he always seems to make great looking films and his problem was that he never let the audience get to know the characters. Here we get a nice background and glimpse into Wonka's upbringing and why he became such an eccentric. The rest of the film follows along with the book and the original film pretty closely sans much of the music.Wonka invites 5 kids and a guest to get a tour of the magical factory via a golden ticket. Whichever of the kids is the least irritating wins the ultimate prize. The oompa loompas, chocolate waterfall, and everything you might recall from the book are there. Burton creates everything to his imagination and employs his usual staple Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. Depp is pretty good in his role as he plays Wonka like a little kid.The original film was the very first movie I ever saw in a theater and it scared the crap out of me. Hey, it was 1971 and I was 2. There is nothing scary in this film and the whole family should get a kick out of it. (***)",7,0,3,6 December 2005
Saw," Didn't make a lot of sense, but I didn't want to saw off my limb either.
","I enjoy a good 'buckets of blood' film every now and then, and when the film carries an original concept that makes it a lot easier to watch too. 'Saw' isn't the gore fest that I thought it would be, but it's pretty close and lots of the film is disgusting and creepy. The creep factor is high in this one.The film starts out with two guys chained to a pipe in a seedy bathroom. There is a dead guy in the room with his brains blown off holding a gun on the floor. The two of them are each given a tape to listen to and follow the instructions. Cary Elwes plays one of the guys and he is instructed to kill the other guy by a time deadline or his family will be killed. The men are also given a saw. the saw won't work on the chains, but it's there to cut through their limbs to get loose. The man behind this is a serial killer named Jigsaw and until later in the film, he never actually kills anybody. He carefully picks his victims and sets them up in precarious situations, that would make them want to kill themselves. All the victims are flawed people such as prostitutes and adulterers. This aspect reminded me of the film 'Se7en'.The film is very scary at times and you never really know whats going to happen next, most of the time. It's well directed and pretty smart. My complaint is that towards the end of the film, you know whats coming. There is a twist ending that makes little sense and I suppose that most horror movies seem to all have twist endings nowadays. That's fine if they help the film. The movie also stars B-Movie horror queen Dina Meyer, Monica Potter, and in a bizarre role for him, Danny Glover. I'm recommending 'Saw' to people who like their films scary, full of blood, and creepy. If that's not your thing, you'll hate this movie. It kept my interest and I liked it. (***)",6,1,2,8 March 2005
National Treasure," A Softer Side of Bruckheimer
","When you think of a Jerry Bruckheimer action film you think of hard core stuff like 'Con Air', 'The Rock' or the 'Bad Boy' pictures. 'National Treasure' is a watered down version of those films and more in the realm of say 'Pirates of the Caribbean'.Nicolas Cage plays a treasure hunter with a deep historical background, and he travels all over the country in search for historical treasures, much like Indiana Jones. When his crew comes across some clues, he believes that there is an invisible treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence. It's suddenly a race to retrieve the document before the competition does. The competition, of course is a former member of Cage's team and a bad guy. Cage hooks up with a beautiful historian (Diane Kruger) and with his faithful sidekicks' help, the three of them try and solve the mystery.The movie is contrived and silly. It's loaded with clichéd characters and much of this has been done before. But I liked it. It's a fun film that uses a little bit of humor, some history, has some action, and really is pretty harmless. The film doesn't have any profanity, and I don't the kill counter is at a bare minimum. You can take the whole family to see this and not worry too much. Just have fun. (***)",7,1,1,19 May 2005
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," War of the Roses in Steroids
","A pretty entertaining film featuring two mega-wat stars in what could have been a major disaster. John and Jane Smith (Anjelina Jolie and Brad Pitt) play an unhappily married couple that lead separate and very secret lives as paid assassins working for different agencies. When they inadvertently get assigned the same target, they must off each other because they need to eliminate the competition. I guess it's bad for husband and wife to be competing assassins. I don't know, for about 45 minutes they spend a lot of time shooting up the house and throwing knives at one another. That stuff is actually a lot of fun.This is a pretty witty film as well as a pretty violent one minus a lot of gore and bloodshed. The plot is muddled, which is a big weakness, but Pitt and Jolie seem to be having so much fun trying to out do each other and the chemistry is terrific between the two of them. The stunts are very well choreographed and the action scenes work.This isn't a great film, but it's a fun movie that will soak up two hours and you'll enjoy it. (***)",6,4,8,6 December 2005
War of the Worlds," These Aren't Friendly Aliens
","Where the 1953 War of the Worlds movie was terrific sci-fi, this movie is more effective as a horror film. Steven Spielberg's aliens aren't the cute little E.T.s or even the mysterious invaders from Close Encounters. These aliens are here to kick some ass and destroy every little thing in sight. The aliens, which travel in giant tripod machines are relentless. They keep coming and coming and coming. Nobody knows why they are here and nobody can stop them.Tom Cruise plays Ray. He is a dock worker who is sort of a deadbeat dad. His intentions are pretty good but he can't seem to get it right. When he is left in charge of his two kids, a rebellious teen, and an innocent 10 year old girl, he must take on the responsibility he has been pushing off for so long. Cruise does a nice job as the dad trying to protect his two kids (Justin Chatwick & Dakota Fanning). The kids do everything they can to give Cruise a hard time including running off and starting arguments.What War of the Worlds accomplishes what it sets out to do and that is to entertain. The film is loaded with great special effects and terrific sound effects. The audience knows when the machines are coming. Spielberg uses loud shrieking noises and loud thunderous weans that indicate that you better run. Spielberg also has a knack when it comes to showing children in danger. Dakota Fanning is constantly in danger. Like films such as the Jurassic Park movies, Spielberg likes to use kids to get to the audience.The movie isn't without its problems. The sequence with Tim Robbins seems to go on too long and some of the movie doesn't make a whole lot of sense, esp. where the aliens intentions come to play. There were some continuity issues as well.If you can get past some of the films flaws, you'll enjoy this movie. It really is a great summer popcorn film with a lot of great things to take in.

Love Actually," If this movie doesn't put you in the mood, nothing will
","The creators of 'Notting Hill', 'About A Boy', & 'Four Weddings & a Funeral' sure know their formula. The first step is to hire Hugh Grant and the rest pretty much takes care of it self. This time around we have eight different stories taking place, some of them are intertwined, and all about conquering love and relationships. Hugh Grant plays the newly elected Prime Minister, who falls in love with the girl brings his biscuits. Emma thompson and Alan Rickman are a married couple struggling to keep the tingle. Colin Firth is a writer who falls for an Italian servant. What is it about servants? Laura Linney wants to have a relationship with her co-worker but her family struggles get in the way. The cutest story is about an 11 year-old boy who falls in love with a classmate and with the help of his widowed dad, he does whatever he can to impress her. There are three other stories going on, but the funniest has to be Bill Nighy as an aging has been rock star trying to make a comeback by remaking one of his hit songs. He is hilarious as he curses his way to the top of the charts.The casting is great, the soundtrack is terrific, and despite some corniness, this film is extremely well written. The film takes place leading up to Christmas, but I wouldn't classify this as a Christmas movie. It's a romantic comedy that is set around Christmas that'll put you in a good mood any time of the year. (****)",Null,0,2,15 November 2004
Wedding Crashers," Too long, but an enjoyable Wedding
","A very funny and entertaining R rated comedy starring Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as divorce mediators who in their spare time like to crash weddings and meet chicks. They do it as a way to scam food, get laid, and basically to have loads of fun. This aspect is fun for the audience too, as we get an extended montage of our two friends crashing about 17 weddings and getting in all kinds of conquests, eating loads of food, and getting jiggy with it with many different cultures. But when the mother of all weddings comes around, they just have to go and try and do the ultimate con. Needless to say our two heroes get way more than they bargain for.The wedding is being thrown by a Washington senator (Christopher Walken) and when Wilson first lays eyes on one of his daughters played by the pretty Rachel McAdams, it's love at first sight. When he learns that she is unavailable, he convinces Vaughn to stick around for some overtime so he can win her from her beau and soon both of them are in over their head. Vaugn's troubles only just begin when the other daughter can't keep her hands off him as well as the Senator's gay outcast son. Throw in a horny wife played by Jane Seymour and a psycho 90 year old toilet mouthed grandma.There are some big laughs and most of the film works. My complaint is that this film is about 20 minutes too long and there is a big chunk towards the end that could have been taken out because the film seems to drone on for awhile at that point. This is still a very enjoyable film that will make you laugh a lot. (***)",7,0,0,5 January 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Very Satisfying
","A very satisfying conclusion and easily the best of the pre-quels. George Lucas' previous two pre-quels both had their qualities and I actually enjoyed 'Attack of the Clones' where 'Phantom Menace' was a snore. ROTS more than makes up for the last two.The film starts out awkwardly with a rescue mission to retrieve the Chancellor Palpatine as he has been taken hostage by General Grievous, the leader of the droid army and Count Dookoo. Much of the opening sequence takes place in an elevator and resembles something out of the movie 'Speed'. Grievous' droids talk like cartoon characters and are'nt very formidable. This part of the movie plods along and seemingly takes forever but after that, the film takes off.We see more and more of Anakin's turn to the dark side and the turning point is when he is turned down the rank of 'master' by the Jedi council. The council doesn't trust the chancellor and Anakin doesn't trust the council. When the chancellor convinces Anakin to turn against the Jedi all hell breaks loose, topped out with Anakin having horrible nightmares about his secret wife Padme dying during birth. Anakin has trouble controlling his emotions which leads to his descent.The action is very good. Even though Saber fights aren't new, they're still fun. The chase sequences work and I loved seeing the Wookie village. You never know what new thing you'll discover in a Star Wars film. Whether it be the Hoth Planet, Ewoks, Jabba the Hut, Jar Jar's underwater world, or the Cloud City. Although the diologue is still lousy, its an improvement over the last couple films, as is the acting as Hayden Christensen seems to do a little better as he gets to show his chops a bit more and not act like a whiny snot. The real star is Ian McDarmid as the Chancellor. He brings some needed class to the film much like Alec Guiness did.The film succeeds in tying everything up that leads to episode IV. It'll make you want to revisit the original film if you have not already. It's certainly a fun movie and a satisfying end. (***1/2)",8,9,16,6 June 2005
Ray," The music alone is worth the price of admission
","Jamie Foxx channels Ray Charles and has him down cold in this high budget biopic that is worth watching for the music alone. Taylor Hackford takes us through Ray Charles life from his early childhood days before he lost his site and periods of his life in the 50's and 60's at the height of his stardom.Ray's life was all over the map. He suffered all his life from witnessing the death of his brother, he had an ongoing drug habit that almost wrecked his life, and he had numerous infidelities. He had two main constants going for him. His wife Bea and his music. The movie takes us through all those times and sometimes to a fault as it moves a little too slowly at times.The movie works on two levels. The amazing performance of Jamie Foxx, who put his heart and soul into this role and the music which accompanies the film. For fans of Ray Charles, you have yourself a wonderful soundtrack.I don't think this movie necessarily deserved an Oscar nomination for best picture but it is very entertaining and you'll certainly enjoy it.

Fantastic Four," Geeky Fantastic Fun
","As one of the precious few that actually saw the bootleg Roger Corman train-wreck from the early 90's, I'm glad to say that the 2005 movie is a vast improvement and is lots of fun. I'm not an expert on these Marvel heroes, but I do know the story and background and I thought they did a nice job and had some fun with it.For those of you not familiar with these characters, you have 5 scientists who all have their DNA altered when a space experiment goes haywire. Reed Richards can now stretch his body to incredible lengths, Sue Storm can become invisible, Johnny Torch (?) can fly and become fire, while poor Ben Grimm turns into a walking rock pile known as the Thing. The 5th scientist becomes evil, and Dr. Doom is born. The metamorphosis of these guys are done with humor and toung in cheek.The acting in Fantastic Four is really nothing special to say the least and the story is loaded with plot holes, but were not talking Shakespeare here. This is a popcorn film. I think if F4 was done on a more serious level, like the Corman version, this movie would be a disaster. Buts it doesn't take itself too seriously and it's more like the Spider-Man films and not as serious as the X-Men films. For the comic book geek who likes their heroes to stay true to their origins and story lines, they'll probably hate F4. For the fan of a good popcorn film, this film is a good time.

Sin City," Visually Stunning and Imaginative
","Based on the graphic novels by Frank Miller, 'Sin City' is a collection of interweaving stories all based in the crime infested back alley-ed hole of 'Basin City'. 'Basin City' looks like New York City or some other major metro city that has gone to hell in a handbag filed with hookers, corruption, and filth.Hartigan (Bruce Willis) plays a man incarcerated for a crime he didn't commit while befriending a special little girl who he keeps in his mind to always look after when he gets out of jail. Marv (Mickey Roarke) is a hulking giant who seeks the murderer of a beauty who was killed while in bed with him. Dwight (Clive Owen) is an ex-photographer who accidentally kills a hero-cop (Benicio Del-Toro) and has to try and cover it up.All the stories are connected and it eventually all comes together at the end of the film. It takes a while to get to that point as the film does go on for a long time. The movie is also not for the faint of heart as it is very violent. If you like castrations, be-headings, and numerous loss of limbs with buckets of blood, you'll like it. If that's not your thing, stay away. Keep in mind though, that this film is shot like a comic book and many of the violence is done in comic book style, with animation, CGI, and over exaggeration. The blood is yellow, white, and is used as more of a prop of style than anything else.'Sin City' is dazzling to look at. The film, shot entirely in front of a blue screen, is a tribute to film noir, comic books, and I could'nt take my eyes off the screen. All the characters are fascinating people conjured up in Frank Miller's mind. Mickey Roarke's Marv is probably the most creative character to me. I loved how this guy is this giant hulk of man drawn like he came out of a Dick Tracy cartoon with his chiseled face and giant body. He is a despicable person, but for some reason, you like him.There is a real rogues gallery of B' movie villains all over this movie. Rudger Hauer, Powers Boothe, and Michael Madsen (A Tarentino fave)are all in this. Throw in Mickey Roarke, who is unrecognizable in a slew of band-aids and covered in blood for most of the film, and you've got yourself quite some characters.'Sin City' really is quite anchievement. I think, like 'Scarface', this film will have it's audience and fans for a very long time. It's that type of film. (***1/2)",8,0,0,11 April 2005
Dodgeball," If anything, please dodge this movie
","I played a lot of dodgeball when I was in school and at day camp and I remember how much fun it was. This movie wasn't any fun. I had high hopes for it because I think Vince Vaughn is very good at picking his material and I figured watching people getting smacked in the face with a red gym ball should be good for a few laughs. It has a few laughs, but that's about it. Most of the film is un-watchable. Ben Stiller's role as an over testosterone gym owner wears very thin after a few minutes and becomes annoying after that. His character got on my nerves in a hurry. A lot of the humor I didn't find all very funny and I thought most of it was predictable. What I did like was Rip Torn as Patches, a sort of former dodgeball legend, who is now in a wheelchair barking orders like a drill sergeant. He has a very funny bit where he is tossing wrenches at his team and then forcing them to dodge traffic on a busy highway. Most of them get hit by a car. It pretty much ends there for me as the laughs go. I wasn't expecting Shakespeare, but I was hoping for something better than this. (*1/2)",Null,0,1,15 December 2004
The Island," Mis-fire
","It's the year 2019 and the age of cloning humans is reality. A colony of clones paid for by rich sponsors are living in an underground community completely oblivious to the outside world. The community is run by an evil conglomerate named Merrick and he uses the clones as holders for organs until the sponsors need them. The clones are unaware of this and believe they are only living in this community until it's their time to go to the island which is an exotic living space surrounded by ocean and paradise. When it's the clone's turn to go the 'island', they are in fact killed off and their organs are kept. Two of the clones (Ewan McGregor, Scarlet Johansen) discover the secret and ultimately escape and are now on the run. 'The Island' starts off as an interesting premise, but later becomes a typical chase film. Michael Bay, who likes his films loud and full of falling buildings, blows up lots of stuff and makes lots of noise. The action sequences are well done and you certainly won't lose interest, but the storyline gets away from the original premise and gets very routine. The acting isn't very good either as this is Scarlet Johansen's worst performance that I can remember. She's probably a lot better in 'Match Point'.This movie isn't awful. There is much worse than this. I just wish the director and writers would've stayed on track a bit more with their story because it started out pretty interesting. (**)",5,1,2,5 January 2006
