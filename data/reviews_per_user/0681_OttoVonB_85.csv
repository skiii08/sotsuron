The Rock," Vintage Bruckheimer!
","Geeky biochemist Stanley Goodpseed (Cage) and highly educated ex-SAS killing machine John Mason (Connery) have to infiltrate Alcatraz, where renegade US General Hummel (Harris) plans to use missiles armed with nerve gas to massacre the entire San Fransisco Bay area (and a host of unfortunate hostages) unless...You get the idea: it sounds ludicrous, it actually IS ludicrous... But this is truly inspired nonsense. A script which 3 different writers have worked on to cram in as many one-liners and explosive situations, an epilepsy-inducing shooting and editing style (circular travelings, sunsets and filters abound)... these are not promising ingredients, especially in retrospect. And yet, a smart dosage of the above and solid commitment from everyone involved make 'The Rock' far better than it had any right to be.If you can get past the silliness of the premise, not only is this an endlessly fun film to watch, it also has many very noteworthy components: Hans Zimmer's score is often rightfully celebrated as one of the most inspiring and bombastic of any action film, the San Fransisco car chase is among the most energetic of all time... Less commonly for a Bruckheimer/Bay production, the actors also pull their weight successfully: Nic Cage cements his action man potential, Sean Connery displays more fierceness and charisma than any star half his age, and best of all - undaunted by clunky lines - is Ed Harris as a surprisingly likable antagonist.This is the jewel of the Burckheimer/Bay crown. the pinnacle of silly explosive cinema - with a twist - done expertly right. For those of you who consider cinema to be only about art, this might even be worth a short glance. For anyone seeking entertainment, 'The Rock' delivers in spades...One of the best action films of the 90s.",10,6,10,16 June 2006
The Avengers," The secret ingredient is 'fun'
","IronMan, Captain America, The Hulk, Thor, Eagle Eye and the Black Widow unite under the SHIELD banner to face a colossal threat led by fallen god Loki.I come at this both late - the film is already one of the most financially successful films ever made as I write these lines - and relatively indifferent to the whole Avengers mythos. I am also unfamiliar with said mythos. Superman and Batman are well established in Europe, but many of Marvel's properties are much less so. With that in mind, the folks at Marvel deserve an award for long-term strategic planning.Under almost any shape, an Avengers film would have made a deal of money. So it is to the credit of the powers behind this behemoth that time was taken to establish each of the heroes individually before embarking on this group adventure. The choice of Iron Man as a starting point, particularly with the genius casting of Robert Downey Junior, proved especially savvy. Iron Man has many similarities to Batman, but where the latter, now the heart of a hugely successful rival film franchise, is at heart quite dark and brooding, Iron Man is inherently light- hearted and fun, something the first film outing captured brilliantly.Assembling the Avengers was not always a smooth process. The SHIELD line felt a bit shoehorned into the Hulk's reboot, derailed the plot or Iron Man's sequel, and frustratingly cut short Captain America's period solo potential. And now that they were finally together, supported by fresh film back-stories of varying quality for the uninitiated, you'd think the studio would sit back and enjoy an easy success.Thankfully, you'd be wrong.From the first few seconds up to the ending, the film oozes with love for its characters, giving most of them not only defining moments but also the fine small details that make you care. Downey Junior could have easily walked away with the honors regardless of the overall film's qualities. That the filmmakers try their best to create a sense of balance shows both respect and confidence in their other characters, and a strong determination to make this work as a team vehicle. The often square Captain America is thankfully done justice, and after two different attempts, the Hulk is finally spot on, Mark Ruffalo giving the film most of its heart and pathos.Until the Avengers, the world was gearing up for the Dark Knight's grand finale. A trilogy that took a mildly ridiculous premise and turned it into a dark, gritty and grand opera. And for all their admirable qualities, Nolan's masterpiece and its two companion pieces sometimes felt a tad grim. The Avengers strikes a perfect balance between serious stakes and its inherent ridiculousness. Here Joss Whedon - of whom I was no fan coming into this - proves himself ideally suited to the task. His trademark wit is perfectly attuned to the material.The biggest Summer blockbuster of 2012 is a finely crafted, rousing adventure, sparkled with humor and character, a love of its protagonists, and above all fun.Thank you Marvel and everyone involved for creating such high expectations, and then exceeding them.",8,1,3,6 September 2012
Blade Runner 2049," Imperfect but Haunting and Memorable
","It is fascinating to see parts of the audience replay reactions to the original Blade Runner. You've heard grievances about plot holes, false set pieces and style over substance, no doubt, as well as something of an open-ended ending? While all these points are true in part, they also all constitute strengths within the context of this particular film, and do justice to its forebear.Blade Runner 2049 opens as Agent K (Gosling) hunts down remaining Nexus 8+ replicants, against a backdrop of ecological collapse and mega-corporate rule. Tyrell Corp is gone and replaced by a bigger, more ominous force manufacturing a more obedient synthetic workforce. When the seemingly impossible happens, it sends K on a disturbing investigation with severe implications about whether these robots really are, as the original Tyrell tag-line promised, 'more human than human'.Much has been made of the stunningly oppressive cinematography. Is it maestro Deakins' career best? It is hard to say, given the extent to which the phenomenal production design and the cinematography complement each other, along with effects that - save for one smartly played uncanny valley-leaning revival - make you wonder what is digital and what is practical. Director Dennis Villeneuve forges another mighty link in a very impressive chain of meticulous films, and while the film can never aspire to be as era-defining as its predecessor, it does convey more emotion and manages infinitely superior chemistry between its characters.Ryan Gosling anchors and carries the film, despite the emotional distance deliberately placed between him and the audience from the onset. His is a quieter, more subdued tragedy than Rutger Hauer's fallen angel in the original, but his anguish and its pay-off resonate just as deeply. Harrison Ford bares his heart like never before, and his pairing with Gosling works wonders. The rest of the cast often acquit themselves very well despite sometimes limited screen-time or development, with the exception of a slightly underwhelming Sylvia Hoeks as the antagonist's hench-woman. For all his good work as a nightmarish version of a machine-linked Elon Musk, Jared Leto makes you wonder what original choice David Bowie might have done with the role.In terms of collaborators, the only weak link, at times, is Hans Zimmer, who goes balls-to-the-walls with the more oppressive parts of Vangelis' concepts, but fails to blend those and the quieter moments into a cohesive whole. The music is, when present, also menacingly loud in the sound mix, and while this does reenforce the oft- present and appropriate sense of dread, it sometimes sets up summer blockbuster expectations, which this decidedly - and thankfully - is not. One wishes Villeneuve regular Johan Johansson had been given a chance to play in Vangelis' sandbox.This is a rich and oppressive work, which refuses to answer all your questions, while evoking many fascinating ideas. It more than does justice to the original, and whatever throwbacks occur and, more often than not, thoughtful - even a reprise of the tears in the rain music theme, which Zimmer comes within inches or overplaying. What worked in the 1982 film still works here, and what didn't is actually improved, from the chemistry to the fact that our detective actually, you know, does some detective work for a change. It is that rare event film that has confidence in a more languid sense of pacing and textured atmosphere.Imperfect, yes, but undeniably haunting. Much like the original.",9,3,9,11 October 2017
Gremlins," Who are we supposed to root for?
","The late 70s and 80s have blessed us with bogeymen beyond count: Pinhead, Freddy, Jason, Mike Myers, Candyman... all speaking to a collective subconscious desire to watch a hapless protagonist - more often than not squeaky-clean, young, white and female - bite the dust. Gremlins is a cinematic anomaly of their weirdest variety. Part slasher film, part parody, part Christmas movie, it turns all three of these sub-genres on their heads and manages to give us the very best they can deliver. It follows Billy Peltzer and his brand new pet Mogwai, Gizmo. Gizmo is an instantly lovable creature, semi-legally imported from China, but he comes with his very strict set of rules: do not expose him to sunlight, do not get him wet, and never, ever feed him after midnight. It doesn't take a genius to imagine where things go from here, but it did take geniuses of a kind to created what we end up witnessing.The Gremlins themselves are wonderfully inventive, nasty little bastards, and watching them pillage their way through mid-80s suburban America is an unmitigated joy. Whether it's wreaking havoc at a local movie theater or hot-wiring traffic lights, their mischievousness makes them lovable and relatable in a sick, twisted way. As such, bar the core relationship between Gizmo and Billy, the human characters are efficiently but economically set up, enough so that we care when evil strikes, but never at the expense of the film's warped idea of fun.It's a cult movie, but one of the highest order, made very skillfully by people who were clearly in love with every iota of the concept. Rarely has a film been so much fun.",10,0,2,17 September 2002
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The saga begins (sort of)
","40 years before the original Star Wars, the decaying Old Republic governs the Galaxy, under the watchful eye of the Jedi Knights. A shadowy figure uses the invasion of an innocent planet to propel himself into a position of power. As two Jedi - Obi-Wan Kenobi (McGregor) and Qui-Gon Jin (Liam Neeson) - step in to save the planet's queen, Padme (Natalie Portman), they flee and encounter a young prodigy along the way. A young slave boy named Anakin Skywalker...Episode I took the planet by storm in 1999. A worldwide fan-base had scarcely dared to dream of a new Star Wars film, surviving on a diet of games, novels and comics of wide-ranging quality. Finally, the news broke, a massive - some would say unfair - hype built up, and this materialized on screens around the globe. Lucas was in full control, the cast was intriguing, what could possibly go wrong? It turns out you can throw a lot at a film: great actors, masterful visual effects, a powerful brand, all this can be undone by a script hastily scribbled on legal pad and a director utterly uninterested in the acting process. Episode I stumbles gracelessly from story point to confusing story point, somehow building on the misguided notion that a tax dispute was the grand way to open a space opera for all ages. Our bland Jedi pick up cinema's most misguided comic relief character and a 10 year-old Anakin along the way, which, with Portman's almond-paste flavored queen amounts to a leading quintet that will have you yearning for the simple but strong Han-Luke- Leia dynamic of old. It's important to note that until the very end, it is unclear who our protagonist is.Along its bumpy path, Episode I provides little of the global prequel plot but many of its narrative inconsistencies. Set on turning Star Wars into The Legend of Darth Vader, Lucas rakes up the mythical connotations as any good student of Joseph Campbell would: Anakin is given slave origins, precocious talents, and even divine conception, the latter tentatively given the silliest scientific explanation in the history of cinema. With so much wasted effort thrown at Anakin, Ewan McGregor's Obi Wan Kenobi and Liam Nesson's Qui Gon Jin are left with vague character sketches. The former defaults to an Alec Guinness impression and the latter manages to give his lines more weight and dignity than the material deserves.In this context, Jar Jar Binks is not the hateful monstrosity many would have you believe. He is almost at home in a movie with much larger problems, particularly one of tone, something even hinted at in the last moments of Lucasfilm's promotional making of doc. Episode I never knows what it wants to be: action fantasy? Political thriller? Kid flick? In trying to mix all of those, it fails in every respect, and all that is left is nostalgia value, and though it is considerable and proved easy to milk back in 1999, it goes a long way to showing why time has not been kind to the prequels or to this episode in particular.You probably don't need to see this, but if you do, take it as an interesting exposé of all that can wrong in the filmmaking process (or let the hilarious Mr Plinkett review do that for you and vindicate your wasted time). Quality is a subjective thing, so we can at least credit George Lucas with one amazing feat: he made a truly, objectively bad film.",2,0,1,27 September 2006
Ali," Michael Mann at the Crossroads
","Ali marks a break in Michael Mann's career. Only time will tell whether it is a point of return.An established master visualist with an unparalleled eye for detail, Mann had so far operated within pretty strict genre boundaries, allowing him to silently revolutionize them each in turn. Heat is up there in the pantheon of cops vs robbers epics, Last of the Mohicans is THE romantic period adventure film, and nobody can argue that the Miami Vice show is the most 80s thing ever created. A visual stylist then, and one who has been good at surrounding himself with the finest talent in the industry on both sides of the camera. What would happen, then, if the Michael Mann train, that well-oiled, slick juggernaught, were to run off the rains into the wilderness? Ali provides an interesting glimpse. It is a biographical film in that it builds on real people and events, but its structure is far removed from the standard formula. it is a character study, sometimes breaking the surface, but more often than not, staring in fascination, which is bound to delight as well as frustrate. Refreshingly though, it is a choice the film commits to 100 percent.Like all Michael Mann films, it is a present-tense film, existing in the here and now, devoid of expository flashbacks: when we meet Will Smith's Cassius Clay, he is already Mohammed Ali, though he may not fully realize it yet. It is the political significance of Clay becoming Ali that the film is more concerned with, much more-so than the actual boxing, which, expertly as it is shown, takes up relatively little of the film's running time.We follow the 'Greatest' from his discovery of Islam to his final great political stand in Zaire, all the while focusing on the little details and impressions rather than narrative beats. Throughout, well-surrounded though he is, Smith carries the full weight of the film on his shoulders, and he never lets us down once, giving his character an unparalleled aura of power and peace unparalleled. It is bewildering to thing that the Academy instead chose to crown Denzel Washington for his cartoon villain in Training Day. The care and love poured into this oozes out of every immaculate frame, and, not for the first time, Michael Mann shows us the difference between a 'movie' and a 'film'. Worth your time and consideration? You bet!",10,0,1,29 April 2002
Spartacus," Hollywood's greatest Roman epic!!!
","Spartacus has become part of pop culture. Its dialogue, characters and some of its visuals have become almost clichéd, so it is hard to imagine a time when the film was far from a sure bet. It was actually a gamble of significant proportions.Star and project shepherd Kirk Douglas, drawn as he was to martyrs, had had an eye on this story for some time, and now - 'now' being circa 1958 - at the peak of his fame and power, he decided to wrestle it into existence. Not one to ever take the easy approach to anything, Douglas secretly entrusted scripting duties to blacklisted scribe Dalton Trumbo (adapting a novel by Howard Fast), landing himself a surprisingly rich and sophisticated epic, the first Roman Epic to bear no mention of the character Jesus.He then gathered a dizzying cast of powerhouse names: Laurence Olivier, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov! Any one of those titans could of headed the bill, thus Douglas promptly lied to each one of them, promising them each the biggest part. With legal action and mutiny within reach before cameras even rolled, he chose to go one further - three being the charm - and fired veteran director Anthony Mann. His replacement? Recent Paths of Glory collaborator Stanley Kubrick.What on paper has the makings of a mad disaster magically morphed into not just a hit and Academy Award Winner, but also the greatest Roman epic of all time. The actors all turned in career-best performances, and while Kubrick was not able to enforce his will as strongly as anywhere else in his filmography, you can argue that having Douglas focusing him on the heart of the story allowed the film to have a heart of its own.After Spartacus, there was nowhere for the genre to go but down, and down it went with alarming speed, straight to a period of hibernation that lasted until Ridley Scott's Gladiator over three decades later. Despite that recent mega-hit, this is still the one to beat.",10,0,1,3 October 2002
United 93," 9/11, minute by minute
","On September 11th, 2 planes crash into the World Trade Center after being hijacked. Before news of this spreads across the country, flight 93 has taken off, carrying on board 4 terrorists intent on crashing it into the White House. As news of the other targets reached the passengers, they fought back.'United 93' is a minute-by-minute reconstruction of what happened in the tower, control room, air traffic control and - crucially, the plane itself from the security checks to the fatal crash. Fittingly, British director Paul Greengrass opts for a documentary approach, setting aside sentimentality and assembling a cast of unknowns. He also received approval from all all involved and the passengers relatives, no mean feat considering the recent nature of the events depicted on screen. The result is a fluid film that feels very authentic and is, in its final moments, unbearably tense (expect to find yourself in an unusually silent cinema at the end of this film).As respectful as 'united 93' is and as much as it is admirable for sidestepping jingoism or being manipulative, it is not without flaws. The first, that will largely affect cinema audiences, is the unpleasant photography. Fuzzy focus and (often useless) breakneck movements do a disservice to the film. If Greengrass wanted a documentary look, why not just shoot it raw and have it that way, rather than add these contrived and unpleasant elements? The film also has too broad a focus for us to be emotionally involved. Rather, we are left horrified by the last scene and the fact that it is grounded in reality. Exploring the terrorists and passengers more might have given this more human dimension. Nevertheless, it remains very interesting and well made, with great detail and effort put into scenes that do not take place on the plane. Unexpectedly rousing our sympathy is the confusion in the air traffic control center. Thankfully, the director opts for archive footage whenever possible for sights of the twin towers and silence rather than music to underline a strong scene.These strengths outweigh the weaknesses and make 'United 93' an important piece of contemporary cinema and, for non-Americans, a good insight into the confusion our American friends experienced on that surreal day.Well worth a look.",9,2,5,16 July 2006
Monty Python's Life of Brian," This Will Make You A Better Person!
","Monty Python are the grand masters of silliness, something they have elevated to an art over the course of numerous skits, shows and now a second feature film. For all the madness on display throughout this insane film, their greatest joke is that they have managed to create a genuine and priceless work of art.Life of Brian tells not the story of Jesus of Nazareth, but of the kid down the street, born on the same night in one of many hilarious twists on the the gospels. We catch up with him in his early thirties, as he gets caught up in religious fanaticism, terrorist plots and Roman repression. This sounds like the outline to a gritty historical epic, and Life of Brian's greatest strength is that it sticks pretty closely to a certain formula while exploiting the utter fundamental ridiculousness of every single situation, with an all-encompassing generosity that leaves nobody unscathed: organized religion takes a heavy hit, as do the feckless occupying Romans.The real genius of Life of Brian is that everything works on at least a dual level, and what is funny on the surface is often just as silly or even quite frightening at a deeper level. Consider one of the most classic scenes: women go to a stoning, a privilege their religion reserves to men, so they all buy fake beards in order to attend and participate... except all the actors playing women are played by men! So in that one representative example you have a biting indictment of religious double-standard, an unparalleled level of silliness, and some meta humor, all neatly bound together. The film glories in its own madness with such glee that it even manages not to rub your face in how clever it actually is, a very rare gift indeed!In this age of religious tension and political correctness, it is all the more precious to have a voice cry out and throw such well-aimed mud in all directions without discriminating. To so while being so entertaining is even more remarkable. This is essential viewing. Not only will it make you cry with laughter - one of the real pleasures worth living for - it will also raise important questions. And, however you choose to answer those, you will always have that unlikely staircase chase ending in an alien abduction, something so stupid even the Pope would have to crack a smile.",10,0,2,9 November 2002
The Big Lebowski," The Most Quotable Film of All Time
","Those Coen brothers have an ear for language. You feel it in the sing-songy banalities of Fargo, and in the noiresque machine-gun dialogue of Miller's Crossing, but neither of these can prepare you for the feast for the ears that is The Big Lebowski.Channeling the opaque mysteries of Raymond Chandler, the Coens throw LA resident bum and Bowling aficionado Jeff Lebowski ('The Dude' to his friends) into a strange triple-crossing case of kidnapping, ransoms, nihilists and urinated-upon rugs. It is the equivalent of throwing unrelenting forces at an immovable object, the Dude's bemused stoicism at constant odds with the world around him. He'd much rather be bowling with crazed Vietnam Vet Walter (John Goodman) and pure silent soul Donnie (Steve Buscemi).As with so much of the Coens' output, style is more than half the point: not just visual, though ace DP Roger Deakins paints an alluring canvas, but tonal and auditory. This is an insanely funny head-trip of a movie, with wonderfully idiosyncratic characters, down to the smallest part. Who better than the Coens to reinvent the comedy of errors?This is without a doubt one of their very best, a personal favorite, an unmissable film and the kind of experience that will plant an indelible smile on your face. Do yourself and see this now, if you haven't already.",10,69,86,5 December 2002
Citizen Kane," Groundbreaking
","Charles Foster Kane (Welles), newspaper giant and billionaire, dies alone in his huge domain Xanadu. His last word, 'Rosebud', sends news reporters and investigators on a hunt to uncover his complex past and unravel the dying legend's words.'Citizen Kane', by then first-time film director Orson Welles (then in his twenties with acclaimed radio and theater work under his belt), is still stunning and fresh today, despite containing many elements of film which we today take for granted, but were unheard of at the time. In 1941, the multiple flash-back structure, complex visual vocabulary - including angles that are still less than orthodox - and scope were truly revolutionary. What remains is an almost exhaustive film class in one movie.Orson Welles imbues the grand-standing and often vulgar Kane with undeniable charisma. His presence in his own films would soon prove to be one of their most enduring strengths: think of his jovial Falstaff in Chimes at Midnight, his repulsive Quinlan in Touch of Evil and his simmering Othello in his adaptation of Shakespeare's play. Welles's would be a career of superb roles and cameo, and Kane is no exception. As his wounded best friend, Joseph Cotten holds his own with panache and emotion, and all the supporting turns are fine, amplified by the then novel overlapping naturalistic dialogue to make this one of the most alive films of all time.Citizen Kane also marked a turning point in talkies, where they ceased to be neatly illustrated plays or books and became something else: something that is meant to work primarily on a screen. Whereas classics of the silent and later were defined by frames (like a painting) or dialogue (like a novel or play), Citizen Kane is defined by movement and editing, juxtapositions of moments and images, duration of frames and nature of cuts. It was the first film, and to this day one of the very few films to fully make use of the complete film-making arsenal. that it is endlessly entertaining as a story (kudos to screenwriter Mankiewitz) is the icing on an extremely alluring cake.'Citizen Kane' often grabs the number 1 spot in critic polls, and for all its technical and artistic excellence, its entertaining nature makes it easy to appreciate throughout the ages, something a Kubrick or a Tarkovskyhave never achieved despite their brilliance.hands down one of the best films of all time!",10,6,9,12 January 2007
Amistad," The most un-Spielberg film of his oeuvre.
","Dismissed on its release as a dry civics lesson or as 'Schindler's List with slaves', which is a shame, because there is so much intricate stuff going on here that fans of Spielberg and his normally in-your-face approach might not grasp the moral ambiguity and more subtle touches that roam beneath the surface. In a year dominated by Titanic this was publicly dismissed as too serious or arty...Why is it un-Spielberg? Ponderous pacing replaces storytelling fluidity and speed, his normally active camera is replaced by more painterly compositions.. Instead of having stuff jump at you, you have to search for it or feel it without truly realizing it: touches of genius are very present, but differ from the original style (like the brutal insurrection scenes, cargo dumping scene, etc).The story itself focuses on a mutiny aboard a transatlantic slave ship, led by Cinque. The ship is intercepted by the American navy and a messy trial ensues to see who has rights regarding the cargo, Spain, America... or are the slaves not 'legal' slaves after all? Cue abolitionists hiring young property lawyer Baldwin. These events, based on facts, occur before the Civil War.I can feel people sighing from here. 'Oh, no: not a courtroom drama...'. Labelling it as such would be missing the point by a mile. It is so much about context and moral ambiguity, and ultimately the tragic ridicule of the situation. Amistad is also a technical marvel. Janusz Kaminski's (SPR, Schindler's List, AI, Minority Report...) photography is superb, a dark study in sepia browns. The acting is magnificent, mainly two amazing performances. One by Anthony Hopkins as former president John Quincy Adams (an unusual turn for him, where he really soars), and the other by Djimon Hounsou (later cast as Juba in Gladiator) as Cinque being the true gem.Ultimately, Amistad's greatest strength is that it avoids offering any easy answers and in that sense, does to subconscious issues about race and slavery what Kubrick's 2001 did to space travel and progress, albeit with more humanity and more accessible drama. It's a shame this film is never talked about.",10,86,105,22 April 2003
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," As Misguided As It Is Redunant
","Following a motley gang of rebels on the hunt for the plans to a planet-destroying super- weapon, Rogue One, the fist 'stand-alone' Star Wars story, finally lands with a loud thud on our screens. Two films in and Disney's management of this golden franchise is already showing very troubling signs of laziness and risk-aversion. If you've come looking for something a bit more original than The Force Awakens, this will be a a very strange disappointment.By now the consensus is in that Episode VII, while entertaining, is basically a soft reboot of Episode IV, weighed down a bit by a Mary Sue heroin (despite a personable and able actress in the role). What that installment did do right, however, was nail the tone, and perform at its best when offering new ingredients. Its original characters were, for the most part, interesting and fun to be around, and you wish there were less fan-service to distract you. I mention all this because, strangely enough, Rogue One has the exact opposite problem.After a title that enigmatically promised X-Wing action, then a trailer campaign implying a kind of Dirty Dozen meets Star Wars, the resulting film is more a limp, flavorless war in space movie with bland, under-cooked characters embarking us on a mission we all know the ending to, and them peppering it very heavy-handedly with enough fan service to handicap any attempt at an original story.An intriguing new villain is introduced... but the fans want to see Darth Vader (and, supposedly Grand Moff Tarkin from episode IV), even though they have nothing to do beyond look cool and menacing and defang the main villain. Each new character stumbles in and has to be introduced with words: so much for the visual fluency of the original saga. Everyone kinda pouts their way through this, and the mood varies through different grey shades of 'subdued' in an effort to be edgy and dark... and instead coming across as completely joyless, a real first for the Star Wars saga.Unlike Episode VII, the fan service moments will be the only ones to quicken your pulse, never mind their narrative redundancy or lack of sense. Cool! That's Vader's castle... but wait, why are we here? Wasn't Vader established as kinda subordinate to Tarkin in Episode IV? Yeah! We get to see the Death Star fire the big gun up close... Except wasn't Alderaan in Episode IV meant to be a huge surprise? Hey, there's Vader again... dispatching people nobody cares about... And on, and on... Everything 'new' in between barely registers, with the exception of Alan Tudyk as K-2SO as a welcome but underused touch of vague humor.On the strength or these two films, we can expect much of the same coming up. More of the same with fan service coming at the expense of a satisfying narrative. This isn't as inept or ghastly as the prequels by any stretch of the imagination, but boy is it just bland.See it if you must, but if it's Star Wars in war mode you want, you'd be better off getting a used copy of the Battlefront video game, which probably has more character development and narrative cohesion. At least that will spare you the horrific site of dreadfully CGIed Carrie Fischer and Peter Cushing.",3,18,38,1 January 2017
Alien: Resurrection," When Aliens Met Amelie, A Case Study in How Hollywood Treats its Franchises
","Everything has pretty much been said about this film, so I would like to take this in a slightly different direction.Forget the plot. It steals left and right from the other films: the traitor from Alien, the guns and action of Aliens, the color palette of Alien 3... Joss Whedon's screenplay tries to shoehorn in character prototypes from his aborted 'Firefly', and Jeunet's bite is less fierce without Marc Caro. Forget the idea of cloning, we've seen this before, and while Sigourney Weaver takes the character to interesting places, the opportunity isn't explored as fully as one would wish.And therein lies the problem of this film. The Alien saga is unique because it has two central pillars: - strong main character - fascinating mythology left almost completely unexploredAll successful film series built around a recurring film character are either episodically built around a main conflict (Harry Potter) or inevitably are 'comedies' because there's only so much a main character can take (Indiana Jones and James Bond, we're looking at you).The Alien saga could have gone back to the roots of the mythology Ridley Scott and Giger brushed up against in part 1. Instead it tried to emulate what James Cameron did in part 2. It worked in part 2 because Ripley was playing against type, an emotionally limited intellectual having to be a soldier and a mother, and face her worst fears. We were all the better for it.And then came parts 3 and 4, and while the budgets rose, the ideas dwindled. Attempts to breathe new life in got stiffed, and however bonkers - Vincent Ward's medieval take, watch the DVD special features to believe it - original concepts were better than what landed on the screen.Maybe, more than anything, this is a perfect case-study for how badly Hollywood can treat its star franchises: with total aversion for risk-taking. Nobody expected the first film, and it reinvented horror aesthetics. Few people knew what to expect from the second one, and James Cameron turned the tables on them. But as the franchise grew in fame, so did the stakes, and for all the talented people involved behind the camera - Giger, Fincher, Jeunet, Ward... - the series lost the power to awe and terrify us.And now, after all these years, we are headed back to the darkest recesses of Scott and Giger's minds, with Prometheus.We will see what that brings. Its colossal budget might bode ill, its refusal to claim too close a relation to the Alien universe is probably wise. Until then, we will have the sometimes fascinating wreckage that are Aliens 3 and 4 to marvel at.",6,0,1,26 November 2011
12 Monkeys," Gilliam's Blockbuster
","Here's a far-fetched, stupid metaphor for you: Terry Gilliam is to film directors what an ivory, diamond-encrusted harpsichord is to a symphonic orchestra. A precious, unique artefact's, but a very impractical one, and without a doubt, an acquired taste. I love Gilliam for his relentless blending of poetry and silliness, his is a unique voice we should treasure more.Someone in the early nineties clearly thought there was enough cross-over potential in not just Gilliam, but a story based on a niche classic, experimental 60s photo-montage film La Jetee, assigned homework of film students everywhere. From this seminal piece, writer David Peoples (Blade Runner, Unforgiven) crafted a nifty time-traveling thriller which, in safe hands, would have probably been a safe investment for the Summer season.it's even nicer then, that someone threw caution to the wind and entrusted this, along with a sizable budget, to Gilliam, who not only managed to lure in heavy-hitter Bruce Willis, but draw from him unprecedented depth, pathos and commitment. Their collaboration made this a very unusual Summer blockbuster, and drew a very able supporting cast, chiefly Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt, the latter stealing every scene he appears in. Narratively-speaking, many reviewers have pointed out that this is a bit of a one-off, the 'twist' weighing so heavily over everything, but as with all Gilliam's work, the real beauty is in the small touches, many of which reward repeat viewings.",8,1,2,18 December 2002
Troy," The Mythological Epic Returns
","From Wolfgang Petersen and a huge team of international film technicians and artists comes Troy, the latest chapter in the swords-and-sandals revival. Often debated for its distortion of the source material, Troy, to a modern blasé film audiences, often hides its qualities very well...Troy is a throwback to the mythology-inspired epics of yesteryear, despite certain contemporary touches that ground it in the new millennium. It owes less to Ridley Scott's Gladiator and more to ensemble epics like Spartacus. People who favor a classic good versus evil or a simple protagonist/antagonist model will be surprised, since, for the most part, the many characters on display are surprisingly developed and layered.Many of the players give out memorable performances: Brad Pitt goes against expectations with an often unlikable Achilles, but the film's real gravitational center is Eric Bana's Hector. Rose Byrne is given her first chance to really impress in a major release, and the other supporting roles - of the kind that were formerly given to actors such as Jack Hawkins, Alec Guiness, Anthony Quinn and Omar Shariff - shine thanks to seasoned pros having a ball: be it Peter O'Toole's touching King Priam, Sean Bean as Ulysses (worthy of his own self-contained film) and Brian Cox as a mad, warmongering Agamemnon. The only bum notes, casting and writing-wise, are the very bland Orlando Bloom and Diane Kruger as the love duo that sparked a massive war.Two things annoy and stop this from being a really good movie. First, the scale is sometimes ridiculous, and you get the feeling that one pull-back shot reveals way more CG ships that all the wood in Europe could have allowed, a sad symptom of having to measure up to the Lord of the Rings level of epic audiences have grown used to. Second, this is not Homer's Illiad, but rather an attempt to reconcile that epic tale with historical probability. The Gods play no part and the interpersonal dynamics have been adapted to a late 20th century audiences in ways that are at times more progressive (the women are fleshed out a bit more), and sometimes strangely puritanical (needless to say, any homosexual undertones or relationships from the source poem are completely redacted here).John Ford once said: 'When the legend becomes fact, print the legend'. Petersen and team have tried to blend the two, and the result, while not always successful, definitely has its moments and points of interest.",6,2,4,17 May 2004
Spotlight," Oscar-Bait Crumbling Under Its Worth
","Spotlight is based on the true story of a Boston Globe editorial team's efforts to uncover systematic child abuse and abuser protection by the Catholic Church. Hardly fresh news, and a topic that will raise strong emotional reactions, and rightly so. But how does it hold up?Given the weird emotional volatility surrounding this one, allow me to qualify this review (and its writer): the scandal revisited here is unarguably heinous, as are the many people who took part in perpetuating it. My own feelings about organized religion mean I was only mildly surprised, but then perhaps the subject of the clergy's hypocrisy is worth revisiting, as it has been in entertainment since Moliere's Tartuffe. But this is a film website, the medium is narrative film, and so Spotlight should - and shall, in the longer term - be judged.This is a film that owes its success and Oscar nominations to its topic and, to a lesser extent, to its ensemble cast. It is also a throw-back to harder-nosed journalism-based films like All The President's Men - a much better, less self-righteous film. The end result however is a bit awkward: first, the structure is wobbly, throwing us in headfirst and assuming perhaps too much familiarity with the events. The character introductions are very rushed, which means it takes more time to build empathy, especially when it comes to the victims. The climax, such as it is, and ensuing denouement are a bit limp culminating in the obligatory white text on black background to tell you succinctly with words what the filmmakers could not achieve with visuals. It makes you wish, as many reviewers have, that this were a documentary.The cast are uniformly good, with Stanley Tucci and Mark Buffalo the stand-outs, but these are solid, seasoned turns, nothing that cries out 'best performance of the year'. Technical credits are closer to a TV-movie than a major Hollywood release.I can't give it credit merely for tackling an easy target from such a safe distance, but I would concede more points if it told its story more fluidly and dared to explore some of the more dangerous angles a bit more, such as police collusion, or that one memorable scene where a guilty priest rationalizes what he did in a way that hints at even worse events. Sadly, this chooses to play things way too safe.",5,16,31,19 February 2016
The Hateful Eight," Near-Pitch Perfect Tarantino
","It's 10 Little Indians in the snow, except it's a Western and there's 8 of them (so the title suggests) and, 8 films into his career Tarantino has almost made peace with the kind of films he really makes: wonderfully clever B-movies. There is no shame in that, quite the contrary, and the only blemishes on his latest - and undeniably most focuses - opus, are the moments when it tries to be something else.Hateful Eight is a very claustrophobic chamber piece, locking us up in a suffocating space with some interesting, complicated and unnerving characters that will not be to every audience member's taste. The pure innocence of Basterds' Shoshanna or Django are nowhere to be found, and the closest we come is tough-to-love Hangman Kurt Russell and a top-of-his-game Samuel L. Jackson.If you came here looking for Django's Mountain Cabin, you're in for some initial confusion. This is a much more intimate, restrained (until the bonkers last hour) beast, and all the better for it. There is dark fun to be had, but there is also a very real anger that makes it more interesting. You will laugh, but often, shortly after and by design, you will wonder whether you should have, and that is the sign of a mature, well-crafted piece of work.This being Tarantino, his overbearing swagger does intrude once or twice: first, with chapter headings that arguably serve only to break the mounting tension, and second, with the over-hyped use of the Ultra-Panavision format. Though DP Robert Richardson's work here is faultless, the use of the format itself is little more than a gimmick, and neither makes nor breaks the film (unless you've seen the roadshow version in one of several reported instances where the projectionist screwed up). Ennio Morricone's score is effective, but don't go into this expecting the great man's twilight masterpiece, particularly as his most memorable cue is recycled from 1982's The Thing.In the end, this is one of the best modern screenwriters we have embracing the range of his talent, and applying a more disciplined and patient focus than ever. The result is, in this era of dime-a-dozen prequels, sequels and reboots, a thing of beauty.",10,2,7,30 January 2016
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," So true, it almost isn't funny! Almost...
","Stanley Kubrick, not a man known for his sense of humor - The Killing is too bitingly cynical to count as comedy - had the audacity to turn his planned nuclear war project into a comedy because 'people would never believe a straight-faced version'. He proceeded to create cinema's most stunning satyr to date.The crazed (and perhaps sexually inadequate) General Jack T. Ripper (Hayden) orders his planes to go into radio silence and drop their nukes on Russia. this creates diplomatic turmoil as the inept US president (Sellers) and drunk Russian premier bicker over the phone to assign blame, knowing that unless the planes are stopped, automated retaliation systems will be activated and the world will pretty much suffer a nuclear holocaust. In step lunatic military adviser Generaé Turgidson (Scott) and former Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove (Sellers also) to try and remedy the situation. Meanwhile, efforts are made to capture Ripper - from without and within, thanks to his hapless British adviser Mandrake (sellers again) - and reach the planes.The most ironic part of the plot is that you could almost imagine it being a credible Tom Clancy novel. Yet most of its potential lies in the absurd, and it is perfectly captured by side-splitting dialogue, dead serious expressions, and stellar turns by Peter Sellers, probably the greatest chameleon of comedy ever to grace the screen.But for all the excellent cast's madness, this remains Kubrick's show throughout. Witness the atmospheric sets, gorgeous photography, and immortal shots (something regarding a cowboy and a nuclear missile). Kubrick also very aptly uses the theme of sexual repression to underline all these violent boys' aggressiveness: the film begins with planes 'fornicating' in mid-air, while something is blatantly wrong in Ripper's pants. and then there's that ending, something only Kubrick would have dared...To anyone interested in war, politics, History or even the state of humanity in general and capable of self-deprecation, I can not recommend this film strongly enough. A miraculous satyr and truly one of the best films ever made!",10,2,5,25 January 2007
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The end of the saga
","Luke Skywalker (Hamill) and his friends journey to the desert planet Tatooine to rescue Han Solo (Ford) from the evil crime-lord Jabba the Hutt before the final confrontation with the evil Empire. A three-way battle (space, forest and lightsabers) closes the narrative of the most famous saga in cinema history.This last installment in the original trilogy was always considered the weakest. To many viewers, it felt like two separate films (the Jabba episode and the Endor episode) and though the younger audience appreciated them, the cuddly Ewoks never scored highly with adult fans. In hindsight, Return of the Jedi's sins are quite meager (they only reflect the flaws inherent to the entire saga) while its merits in as a piece of entertainment are considerable. The sleazy crime-lord's den is a triumph of unease and production design (with, at the heart of it, the revolting Jabba), the space battle is unsurpassed in the entire saga (thus ranking as the best ever shot), the speeder-bike takes your breath away, the forest battle-cum Vietnam metaphor is hugely playful and inventive (almost a tribute to Errol Flynn's Robin Hood) and the climactic lightsaber duel packs an emotional punch that rivals anything in the original trilogy.What disappointed many were the less mature elements that quite rudely belied the fact that Star Wars was for the child in you. One can debate whether that even constitutes a flaw, but this is entertainment for all ages that pushes boundaries and goes unsurpassed, 3 decades on. That the new trilogy never stood a chance only serves as further proof to how demanding an audience that ad kept receiving better and better Star Wars films had become. Truth be told, Return of the Jedi, if it trounces all other prequels, fails to measure up to the truly operatic Revenge of the Sith. This is simply because of story density and the fact that George Lucas's visual flair makes a mockery of Richard Marquand's (one could also add that John Williams fantastic score for episode III is the best in the entire saga).Star Wars, the real epic quality Star Wars that begins with episode III, ends here. And a more fitting finale to this saga could not have reasonably been hoped for.",8,0,0,18 June 2006
Alien," Cinema's Greatest Monster
","It's a scholarly view that there are a very finite number of basic stories. All we do is tweak the recipes and tell the same stories over and over again. Rather than allow it do depress you, allow yourself to appreciate how great a role execution plays in this process, and how the most generic of storytelling formulas can be the basis for something completely unprecedented.Alien is, at heart, a haunted house in space, mixed with Ten Little Indians. On paper it never tries to rise above that, and you could see in its earliest stages what a clever little sci-fi horror film it would have led to (and if you care to see that version, look no further than Italian genre entry Planet of the Vampires). But bring some visionary talent to the table and you get to see alchemy at work.Picking up the pieces from Jodorowsky's aborted Dune, director Ridley Scott, despite only one feature to his credit to date, had a strong hand: a powerful visual sense, and the help of artists as diverse as visionary French illustrator Jean Giraud (Moebius, for fans) and Swiss conjurer of nightmares Hans Ruedi Giger. With such a creative trio, visually, this is as safe a bet as you could find. But visual thrills alone do not make a film: every story has to do, first and foremost, with people.Credit the writers of the original script for a solid blueprint if you must but then tell yourself that first, Scott's tireless storyboarding of the whole film convinced the studio to double his meager budget, and second, for a director seldom credited with his work with actors, he pulled a fantastic casting coup: veteran hands for the most part, happy to mostly improvise the naturalistic banter of the ship's doomed crew, anchoring this tale and making it all the more horrific for it. The masterstroke, especially in retrospect as Alien went from standalone classic to cinematic saga, was the choice of Sigourney Weaver as Ripley.Decades later, and Alien is a masterclass of both horror and science-fiction. it's that slow, agonizing build-up that enhances the effectiveness of the horror once unleashed. it's the forbidding look, and how everything is both terrifying and beautiful at the same time, from the cavernous ship itself to the titular monster, cinema's greatest without a doubt. It's in the frightful subconscious analogies from violent impregnation to rape, to the cruel meld of machine and organic that characterizes the alien and its origins. It's in the deaths themselves, each one an unforgettable, nightmare-inducing experience, none more-so that the captain's claustrophobic tunnel hunt.You'll hear people rave about sequel Aliens and how much better it is. More action- packed, sure. More epic and more likable perhaps, but better? No. Not in a million years, and given the high quality of that classic film, it says a lot about the original.This one will change you forever.",10,0,1,4 November 2002
Interstellar," A Flawed But Awe-Inspiring Film
","Christopher Nolan and CO have done it again: this is undoubtedly the event movie of the year. Hyped, magnificent to behold, brazen, emotional and filled with ideas. For all that though, and despite its many qualities, it is closer to The Dark Knight Rises than it is to Inception.First, the good, and - lucky us - that means 'great': McConnaughy effortlessly anchors this sprawling cosmic story and makes you care every inch of the way, without being too perfect a hero. Visually this is often a feast without being suffocating, due in no small part to a very clever camera-anchoring aesthetic which makes the space scenes both breathtaking and believable. You believe you are watching NASA footage of the future. Special mention to Matt Damon and Anne Hathaway, whose characters might have come across as silly caricatures in lesser hands. Emotionally too, this is an often touching, sometimes heartbreaking film.What really seems to strike a cord with audiences around the world, is how the film tackles the mind-bending issues of relativity and our insignificance as a species, while never losing track of its emotional core. To its credit it chooses to focus very intently on the idea that what is best for an individual and what is best for a species as a whole can be very strongly opposed. The film harks back to 2001 and Solaris (two very different films) in some of the ideas it addresses, but manages to have more humanity than the former, and more scope than the latter. In fact, in warning us of our folly and celebrating our ingenuity in times of desperation, it manages to have its cake and eat it to. No mean feat, and all the more satisfying an experience for it.Now, for the bad, and perhaps this takes multiple viewings to sink in: cleverly crafted as the film is, this comes more as an afterthought. If one chooses to scratch a bit beneath the surface, there are glaring plot and logic holes (one involving an obviously doomed choice of planet, the other a classic chicken/egg time travel paradox which is unfortunately central to the plot). You could look past these and even explain them away, but they could easily have been addressed, as well as one or two incredibly stupid things Nolan makes his characters say and do. Hans Zimmer's score is also at times overbearing and awkwardly loud in the mix, making one wonder what this could have been in the hands of someone like James Newton Howard or even Philip Glass.Anyone who has read Yukinobu Hoshino's peerless '2001 Nights' manga will have already seen many of the same ideas and settings explored better elsewhere, and perhaps that is partially the point, to fan the flame of curiosity, and get people to seek such sources out. A blockbuster that can make you both alarmed and proud as a species, while making you thirst for more about quantum physics, cosmology and the possibility of space travel deserves every accolade it gets.This is not the flawless masterpiece many would have you believe, but it touches brilliance more than once, and its rewards are immense. As an event movie, particularly in an age of dull sequels, this is so much more than we could hope for!",8,1,3,19 November 2014
Pacific Rim," Do You Remember...
","Do you remember what it was like to experience wonder, as a child, at the flickering images on the screen. You didn't know that's what they were back then, or that the odd plot contrivance was just that and could mean the world (internet trolling didn't exist yet...). It was imperfect, but honest, immersive fun.This is the virtue of the nostalgic underdog film. A film that smells an untapped niche and goes on a joyful rampage through it. I think it's fair to say the original Indiana Jones did just that, revive childhood memories to create a roller-coaster devoid of cynicism. Gremlins did it. More recently, District 9 did it too.The Summer of 2013 gave us many examples of modern cinema at its worst: the cynical exploitation of childhood memories, evident in one sub-par reboot/remake after another. Action cinema as a whole has been aching from an emphasis on noise and scale rather than emotion and choreography (not just of action, but design and movement, both within and before the camera). It helps to have the new film of an earnest, geeky master to look forward to.Enter Guillermo Del Toro. Enter Pacific Rim. And here, hidden under a confused marketing campaign, is what we've been waiting for. A film that balances respectful nostalgia with irreverence (something Transformers and Man of Steel did all wrong in their respective extremes), a film that makes you remember what it was like to be a kid again. Rather than washed-out, fast-cut chaos, we get a neon-colored ballet of destruction through locations and between creatures and robots that scream the love of their creators in every frame.It's a silly film brilliantly made, and just when you wonder whether it isn't throwing certain tropes of its genre at you too literally - whether it be certain sub-stellar performances, mainly from leading man Charlie Hunman, a often predictable plot, etc. - it surprises you with a moment of sheer beauty. It makes you remember what it was like to be amazed, and it makes you hope. That the Kaiju genre is back for good. That people continue shoveling money at Guillermo Del Toro. That his Hellboy III and Mountains of Madness get made. That we see more of the great Idris Elba and Rinko Kikuchi, not to mention Mana Ashida (showcased here in a phenomenal flashback scene).A solid 9, no question about it.",9,10,17,23 July 2013
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Lucas Touch
","After the frankly disappointing Episode I, Star Wars is back... only it's not the Star Wars any of us really wanted. A mythic hero is (re)-introduced and Anakin Skywalker, torn between his duties as a Jedi and impossible love, begins his path to the Dark Side. On the sidelines, a convoluted conspiracy continues to destabilize the fragile Republic...It's very important at this point to understand two fundamental points about the original Star Wars trilogy. First, their humble origins are in conveyor-belt adventure serials of the 1930s, themselves of questionable artistic merit but arguably boasting a certain storytelling economy and successful aesthetic of poverty. Second, given how few people had faith in episode 4 at the time of its making and how busy Lucas was with building his empire during production of episodes 5 and 6, many more gifted and self-questioning talents were involved in key decision-making aspects of that original saga. We can get angry about Jar Jar Binks and Hayden Christensen all we want, but the real shortcoming of the prequels is not what is in them, but what is not: gifted screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan, more actor-friendly directors (be it Kirshner or even Marquand) and especially producer Gary Kurz, along with stars who dared to question some of Lucas's decisions.Now, we get to see what Star Wars would have been like had Lucas been able to call all the shots back in the late 70s. Rushed and clumsy storytelling turned into a rushed, lazy production with an over-elaborate post-production process to top things off. First, the story. Without going into whether the story of Anakin Skywalker was one that needed to be told - it did not - Lucas manages to botch the whole set-up for his hero by having him be a completely different person from episode I's moppet, thus squandering an entire film of character-building, and by presenting him as a bad apple from the start. It's hard to enjoy the story of a good man's fall when he is shown to be a whiny creep from the get-go, and commits small-scale genocide an hour later. Not that the supporting characters fare any better, the Jedi being despairingly bland, especially a wasted Samuel L. Jackson. Ewan McGregor starts to inject a bit of fun into his character, but Yoda completely undoes his whole original trilogy image with a pointless and idiotic lightsaber duel. Beyond that, Natalie Portman is bafflingly bad, Christopher Lee is Christopher Lee, and hate him all you like, but Hayden Christensen does as much as anyone could with the lousy material thrown at him.These shortcomings would be easier to overlook if the end result truly dazzled. That it doesn't attests to Lucas's laziness as a director. Either absent or parked behind a bank of monitors, latte in hand, the great beard managed most of these prequel films in the comfort of a green-screen studio. The result speaks for itself: even when set inside majestical environments, the result feels confined and staged - the actors having only a few square feet of featureless real-world space to work with. The camera blocking in character scenes has all the grace of a cheap tele-novella. Things only pick up in space or huge all-CGI action scenes, but then the frame is so dense (not rich, mind you, just cluttered) the story so muddled and the stakes so un-involving that you will be hard-pressed to care. It is nearly impossible to invest any emotion into these films beyond nostalgia. We are interested in Anakin because we know he becomes Darth Vader. We feel for Obi Wan and Yoda because we remember them and their amazing portrayal from our childhoods. And for all its fatal shortcomings as a motion picture, it's most hateful crime exists at a conceptual level: it might have jump-started the current, exhausting prequel trend.You can skip this one altogether, and if you really want to give your kids some modern Star Wars, go straight to the Clone Wars series. Each episode of that show has more adventure, inventiveness, joy and internal logic than Lucas's prequel trilogy combined.",3,1,3,2 May 2004
Fargo," A Very White Noir
","Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) hatches an ill-conceived plan to have his wife kidnapped, and use ransom money shelled out by his wealthy father-in-law to finance his solo business venture. Human stupidity ensures that every single element of the plan fails catastrophically.Fargo marks the Coens' acceptance by the mainstream. The award nominations showered upon it and its widespread critical acclaim may have set high expectations from viewers, whom, upon inspection shrug in disappointment, failing to find either the verbal gold of Big Lebowski and Miller's Crossing, or the visual wizardry of O Brother Where Art Thou and The Man Who Wasn't There. Of all their films, Fargo might be the most palatable to mainstream sensibilities, but that does not diminish its qualities as a film.In technical terms, this marks their first collaboration with cinematographer Roger Deakins after regular DP Sonnenfeld left to pursue a directing career, and it is quite a leap from the stylish tones of Miller's Crossing to the controlled, washed out landscapes of Fargo. Just as impressive, but more understated, the sign of artists fully coming into their own and confident in the key ingredients of their product. The screenplay is a work of art, the verbal sparring and control of language beyond peer, and like the world's greatest orchestra, the cast perform this symphony to perfection. Macy is hopelessly fascinating as the least capable man in human history, and Stormare and Buscemi team up as the weirdest kidnappers ever to grace the screen. People cannot seem to lavish enough praise on Frances McDormand, and it is true that she allows a beautiful character to blossom beyond expectations. The Coens' one concession to mainstream audiences - a likable, grounded protagonist - is one of the most original main characters in cinema.Like all their films, it adds up to so much more than you might think upon first viewing, and serves as an ideal starting point to explore their work. A classic!",10,1,1,17 September 2002
Predator," 'Alien' on Earth?
","A group of commandos is sent into the South-American jungle on a rescue mission. Soon they find themselves picked off one by one by a sadistic alien creature.Putting the film in the context of the time, it is pretty obvious what it was trying to be: a fusion of Alien and Aliens, swapping out Sigourney Weaver and space for a dense jungle and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Subtlety then, was not viewed as an essential ingredient.Notwithstanding a stupid title and a 'cast' consisting mainly of overambitious bodybuilders, this is a success in more ways than it had any right to be, and in hindsight we can credit one person: director John McTiernan. The man who later reinvented the action blockbuster with Die Hard made the best of a very surreal assignment, and turned it on its head.You might not expect Arnold to deliver more than a substandard effort going in. You'd be wrong: the Austrian Oak is at his most primal and, interestingly, in the last fourth of the film, at his most human and mortal. You might expect to have trouble believing any space critter could be a match for him. You'd be wrong again: the monster is one of the finest sci-fi antagonists ever created, a fascinating counterpart to Giger's Alien, and just as mysterious. It comes with an impressive bag of tricks, a malevolent intelligence, and a messed-up sense of humor.Time has been less kind to Predator than to Alien, by association with Schwarzenegger and because of certain stylistic choices. There may not be any neon lights or fog machines in sight, but this is almost as 80s as you can get, in all the right and wrong ways. The biceps and dialogue on display clearly hark back to a different era of cinema, one that, on strength of Predator's many pleasures - be they guilty or pure - you would be right to miss.If you can make yourself overlook these elements, this is the finest that decade's mad brand of action has to offer. Arnie's showdown with the creature is a triumph - one in which he for the first time shows real and justifiable fear - the deaths in the unit are grizzly and surprising, and a mini gun-assisted deforestation can, once seen, never be forgotten.Best enjoyed in a group.",9,0,0,29 October 2002
Nightcrawler," At The Intersection of Taxi Driver and Network, You Have...
","There's something very 70s about Nightcrawler, in the best way possible: an anthropologist's fascination for a difficult protagonist (played masterfully by Gyllenhall), a seedy world where everybody is, at best, a shade of grey, and a deeply concerning look at modern consumption.While it has one foot in the gritty past, technically and thematically, Nightcrawler is very much a creature of the times, from its fascination with gory breaking news, and the technical wizardry on display. Frequent PTA-collaborator Elswitt's nocturnal photography is both stunning and a perfect fit to the story. The supporting cast are all old pros doing their best work in years, not just Paxton as a condescending rival but Renee Russo as a fading news honcho. The latter will make you mourn her recent absence from our screens.It says a lot then that for all the talent on display and refreshingly unapologetic sleaze of the story, this remains the Jake Gyllenhall show. He gives his all to this weird creature, making him unique and real, but never judging him.Definitely one of the best films of the year, and a shoo-in for best performance.",10,0,0,12 February 2016
Man of Steel," Not to be confused with Superman!
","From producer Christopher Nolan (the Dark Knight saga, Inception) and director Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen, Sucker Punch) comes this re-imagining of the Man of Steel.Kal El is shipped off from his home world Krypton as the place falls apart, amidst a last-ditch military coup by General Zod (Michael Shannon). With baby Kal El, his father (Russell Crowe) also sends the 'codex', Krypton's genetic database. He sends the child to Earth, where hopefully a better life awaits. 30 years later, Kal-El - renamed Clark Kent - faces an existential crisis, just when fellow Kryptonians Zod and co catch up, intent on terraforming Earth and taking back the codex.If you're coming at this having seen Nolan's epic Dark Knight trilogy, that should give you a good taste of the present film's strengths and failures. What it doesn't prepare you for is an unfortunate mismatch between source material and treatment. Where the Dark Knight is an inherently troubled character whom you can imagine in a real- world environment, it takes a lot of suspension of disbelief to shoehorn Clark Kent and his doppelgänger into a gritty environment. This Snyder, Nolan, Goyer and co attempt admirably in places, and watching young Clark go from one identity to the next every time a crisis forces him to use his powers is an interesting new spin on the character, Superman as a fugitive... sorry, not Superman: the Man of Steel. This is an important distinction, one very much sought by the creative trio, and one achieved through the deletion of many previous film adaptations' tropes: gone are the red underpants, but gone is also the silliness of the premise (the greatest hero on Earth hides behind a silly grin and glasses), and with it some of the conditioning that might help your suspension of disbelief, for with the ponderous tone and insistence on 'realism' - forsaken where convenient - come plot contrivances that grate all the more: Lois Lane is always in the right or wrong place at the right time, something a more light-hearted film would have just presented at face value but this film feels compelled to justify, however flimsy the premise. Young Clark sacrifices a loved one to preserve a secret that, given previous scenes, should already be severely compromised. Etc.For those of us who know - and have loved - the Dark Knight series, the expected carry- overs from that franchise are all present: naturalistic camera-work, spectacle, and structural issues with the narrative. Unfortunately the latter weighs very heavily in this instance: anyone who's ever heard of Superman knows he comes from a doomed planet. Why force us to sit through a half-hour prologue there? This not only answers questions nobody particularly cared about, but creates a number of bizarre plot holes. Several fundamental character motivations also make very little sense in light of these scenes, such as sending the Man of Steel to save a world his very presence endangers...Again, these would all be minor niggles in a more light-hearted film, but as the creative trio have insisted and make clear every step of the way, we are meant to take this film very seriously, in all its bloated Christ-allegory glory. For the parallels exist and are layer on pretty thick, and if this doesn't make Clark Kent/Jor El hard to empathize with, then his indestructibility certainly will. The spectacle is amazing, almost to the point of becoming an experimental light and sound show, but the dramatic stakes are close to inexistent, what with the two main opponents being invincible. This means that by the third time Zod or Kal El get thrown through the supporting structure of a skyscraper, you'll be looking at your watch. Speaking of urban destruction, something Hollywood seems to think we will never have enough of, rather than be targeted to intimidate, as in the Dark Knight Rises, or grandiose and silly, as in the Avengers, the chaos in this film introduces jarring 9/11 parallels that further harm the logic of the story. How are we meant to cheer Kal El for throwing Zod through a building when the director spends ages insisting on the human suffering this creates? So many times, the film's schizophrenic desires to be both an action blockbuster and a serious drama cancel each other out.This is not Superman as you knew him, but that matters little. Is this 'Man of Steel' up to the premise set by his makers, one consolidated by a brilliant, soulful first trailer? Sadly, most of the implicit promises made by the film in those trailers amount to very little: the madness of Michael Shannon's Zod is severely underused, and what few clips showed potential lack punch when played in their context; rather than give Kal El a beautiful home-world to yearn for and a tragic origin, the prologue only creates plot-holes and delays the real drama; the slight humor hinted at by the trailer's end is scarcer than you might imagine... Many have blasted this film for being so joyless, and that is a perfectly valid gripe, but then grittiness can be a virtue when we care about the characters, which is the film's most crushing shortcoming. This is something Avengers, and at the other end of the spectrum, the Dark Knight, got just right.Finally, one wonders how Man of Steel will live down mass critical appraisal now that its thunderous opening is behind it, and how well it will stand up to repeat viewing. It is brave and admirable in that it tried to take a cultural icon and transform it into something contemporary and relevant, let alone credible. That in the end it failed so dismally is more baffling than tragic.But this was all the Man of Steel. Thankfully we will always have the real Superman.",2,5,10,15 July 2013
Split," M. Night Comes Full Circle
","From prodigy to punchline, M. Night Shyamalan has had fascinating highs and lows as a filmmaker. The man once hailed as the heir to Hitchcock or Spielberg was soon compared to Ed Wood and Uwe Boll... I always found this a bit unfair, due to the tasteful notes sprinkled throughout even his most inept films. But he's finally crossed a line.Celebrated as a return to form for the creator of the Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, Split follows damaged teen Casey (Anja Taylor-Joy) and 2 cliché bitchy teenager friends, who get abducted by Kevin (James McAvoy). The catch being that his disturbed cranium houses 21 conflicting personalities, with the promise of a very sinister 22nd on the way. Intriguing concept. What might the twist be?There are - contrary to what you might have heard - two twists in Split. The first is that it mostly does exactly what it tells you it's going to do. And boy is there a lot of telling rather than showing in this overdrawn yarn! The beats are telegraphed in advance and the jumps predictable. The second twist plays squarely in the current trend of exploiting viewer nostalgia: in what might be his most forgettable film, Shyamalan dares to shove in a horribly contrived parallel to his greatest work. If Split is meant as a parallel sequel to that other film, then it shares none of the stylistic identity, which makes the forced kinship feel unnatural. Speaking of style, the filmmaker has also sadly broken with his earlier aesthetic in most of the ways you could imagine. The visual elegance and fluency of his first 3-4 films is gone - as, sadly, is longstanding collaborator James Newton Howard. After plumbing the depths of found footage in his previous film, Shyamalan delivers a film that is often bland and sometimes downright ugly to watch. Any positive commentary on this film has to do with its cast, so let's give them their due: McAvoy has a ball with his various personalities. It's never subtle stuff, but he throws himself at it and hops effortlessly between all 21 personalities in Kevin's head. Taylor-Joy, a revelation in The Witch, is, once again, luminous, transcending a half-baked part and giving these dreary proceedings what little believability they have. Her partners in confinement barely register, and, hamstrung as she is with terrible expository dialogue, poor Betty Buckly as the caring psychiatrist manages to deliver the worst performance in a M. Night Shyamalan film - yes, even one that features the customary terrible director cameo!By now the irony of this review's title - and of the situation itself - should be obvious. Shyamalan would have you believe he's come full circle, back to the glory days of his debut. The truth is much sadder: pushed to the limit and with nothing left in him, yesterday's wunderkind is left scraping the bottom of the barrel for echoes of past glories. In that sense, he is sadly representative of an entire industry with a crisis of creativity.",3,9,24,30 May 2017
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Rise of the Forgotten Hero
","Where will they go next?At the time of writing, T3 has more than made up for its mammoth budget - eclipsing even the record-setting part 2, thanks largely to a reported 30M salary for its leading man - with a considerable box office. It won't be long before the vultures pull at the carcass and find enough sustenance for a part 4, 5 and beyond... But back to 3.The Austrian Oak was in dire need of a hit in the early Naughties, and for many, reviving this particular franchise - if two films constitute a franchise that is - smelled of desperation: haven't we mined this story's potential to the core already? And what of creator James Cameron's complete lack of interest? When your main champion prefers to go deep-sea diving than having anything to do with you, you must have done something wrong...Terminator 3 raised many questions, first of which was: is this even necessary? The truth is: now that it is here, imperfect beast that it is, it is essential. For one, it cleans up narrative issues raised in part two's time travel paradoxes (if you pay attention, Skynet created itself). It also asks interesting questions about choice vs fate, and ends in what is possibly the series most arresting visual moment. It also embraces its throwback nature, not just in accepting its aging star's limitations but in incorporating them to the story, but in its brutal, real action choreography, chiefly a nasty crane-equipped car chase that puts even the computer wizardry of Matrix Reloaded to shame. At the same time, T3 allows itself to partly spoof the original, a point of contention for many, but a refreshingly sober thing for a sequel to do in this day when follow-ups, for some reason, always have to aim for darker (see Matrix and Pirates of the Caribbean).Of course, not all is perfect: after Edward Furlong, Nick Stahl is a somewhat uninspiring John Connor, and Claire Danes is given surprisingly little to do. The worst let-down, though there is interesting conceptual work at play there, is the new antagonist, dubbed the Terminatrix by a mocking audience. There is no doubt that after Robert Patrick's glacial T1000, this is a disappointment, and something more chilling, such as a worrying fusing of human and machine, would been not just more interesting, but frighteningly prophetic, a key trait of the saga as a whole. But when Arnold appears on-screen again, a lot is forgotten and more is forgiven.The first two Terminator films are solid 10s, so by that measure this can't compare, and yet, after the disappointing Hulk and the over-hyped and overindulgent Matrix Reloaded, Terminator 3 may also well be the most entertaining blockbuster you see this Summer.Nowhere near as good or as clever as its predecessors, but good fun nonetheless.",6,0,0,26 July 2003
Doctor Zhivago," Great Expectations...
","David Lean got himself into a tight corner after making movies that were larger than life and always bigger in scope: if Bridge on the River Kwai was big, Lawrence of Arabia was a true epic in every sense of the word. His carefully chosen literary adaptations seemed bound to become masterpieces, from his earlier Dickens diptych on. For his next challenge, Lean turned to Boris Pasternak's Doctor Zhivago, on the life and times of a poet in Revolutionary Russia. Before you roll your eyes at any perceived lack of risk-taking, consider how Foreign this work must have felt as opposed to all the other classics Lean had tackled. Consider also the numerous challenges: a very passive protagonist, yet another logistically complex shoot, and the season and decade sprawling narrative. Not a recipe for box office gold.Yet Zhivago the film is the apex of Lean's particular style of filmmaking. That by no means makes it his best film, not by a long shot, but it pushes his style to its limits while still avoiding self-parody. That particular threshold would be crossed on Ryan's Daughter. Here Lean guides proceedings with a sure hand, giving even the smallest moment a sense of grandeur that sits comfortably both with the romantic nature of our main character and with the themes of the film.As Zhivago, Omar Shariff makes the most of a thankless task and manages to convey our hero's yearning soul. Subtle makeup helps you forget Sheriff Ali and he generously allows the spotlight to fall on his costars. In the female court, Geraldine Chaplin and newcomer Julie Christie come across not just as cyphers but three- dimensional human beings, and to their and Lean's credit choosing one over the other is no easy task. The men are almost all scoundrels, yet hugely entertaining: Tom Courtnay is chilling as a fallen idealist and Rod Steiger oozes corruption. Alec Guinness also turns a very functional role into gold, and the icing on the cake is crazed cameo from none other than Klaus Kinski.Once more, David Lean and screenwriter Robert Bolt succeeded admirably in creating a very intimate and human story on an epic backdrop, creating the grandest cinematic love story since Gone With The Wind. What cemented this film's place into legend are the unforgettable images and melodies crafted by two returning Lean collaborators: DP Freddie Young and composer Maurice Jarre.It's one of those films that, like Ben Hur, keeps popping up around the holidays. One those widely recognized classics you can just drown in, along with the whole family. Unlike most of those types of pictures, it actually deserves every bit of praise thrown at it.",9,4,8,6 October 2002
The Shining," Terrifying...
","The Torrance family head to the vast Overlook Hotel, of which they will be the only occupants for the next months. Great for Mrs. Torrance (Duvall) who enjoys the outdoors and a house-keeping challenge. But not so good for sensitive Danny, who feels the influence of the horrors committed by the last caretaker. And definitively not good for Jack Torrance (Nicholson), whose planned seclusion to write his novel leads not to artistic inspiration but to murderous madness.In adapting Stephen King's book, Kubrick turned it and the horror genre on their heads. All the common principles of horror are twisted: things happen in the stark, white daylight rather than at dark, silence induces the terror rather than spooky sounds, and the undead are far less dangerous than members of one's own family. Rejecting the ghosts-as-frighteners theory since to him life after death was a positive prospect, Kubrick tore the film down to Jack Nicholson's slow, frightful mental unraveling. It works wonders (in the most horrible of ways imaginable): Jack Nicholson directed by Kubrick is far more terrifying than any monster could hope to be.Kubrick being Kubrick, nothing is left to chance: every frame is completely calculated. This has earned him a reputation for being cold in some quarters. One can easily imagine what effect this gives a film such as 'The Shinning'. Sweeping shots of eerie corridors (the birth of the steady-cam), slow zooms into Nicholson's crazed face, the labyrinth scene... Kubrick weaves a tapestry of cinematic tension and unease and psychological violence with every element at his disposal. Stephen King hated it of course, convinced that the 'scary' ghosts from his source novel were what made the horror work, and remade it his way two decades later. the result was a sorry dud of a film.'The Shinning' is among the best horror films ever because at its heart it holds that sordid truth that the most frightening thing out there is ourselves.",10,3,5,10 January 2007
Apocalypse Now," Journey into Hell
","Cpt Willard (Sheen), an Army assassin with serious issues, is sent up the Mekong into Laos to 'terminate with extreme prejudice' US Colonel Kurtz (Brando), who has either gone native or turned genocidal. He travels by boat through devastated Vietnam, searching through Kurtz...Apocalypse Now appears to be, on the surface at least, merely Joseph Conrad's Hearts of Darkness in the Vietnam War era, but it is so much more. It is pure chaos on film, a visceral depiction of a war that has run out of anyone's control, through which the stunned Willarde errs, encountering fascinating characters similarly disconnected from reality: the warmongering fanatic Kilgore (Duvall), who leads air raids to the sound of Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries and has a napalm fetish, a crazed US reporter (Hopper, just being himself really), an entrenched family of French colonists, and many more. And at the heart of the film, at the end of the stinking river of murder and mayhem, lies Kurtz (a god-like Brando).The making of this colossal film was long, chaotic, painful and sufficiently well chronicled in the excellent documentary 'Hearts of Darkness' not to be retold in this review. Suffice to say that it is a miracle that the film survived, and even benefited from its troubled conception. The unconventional editing and Vittorio Storraro's glorious saturated photography make this feel halfway between a nightmare and an acid trip. In short, it is a journey into hell, that begins with a storm of fire and ends in the devil's den.The most telling moment of this film is of a siege against an unseen enemy, where Willlard encounters a raving soldier and asks him who is in charge, to which the soldier shrugs: 'Ain't it you?'. Apocalypse Now is every civilization's nightmare: that a war justified in a distant past would degenerate so foully, that men are reduced to less than animals.One of the best and most unsettling films of all time.",10,0,1,11 January 2007
The Intouchables," One of the Most Unique and Beautiful Friendships ever Committed to Film
","Do not look at this through the prism of 'Foreign Films'. You'd be wasting your time and miss something far too important.Hollywood does scale like nobody else, leaving the competition gasping in its wake. France does intimacy, and brutality. Nothing is sacred. And rather than try to revive the New Wave or emulate Hollywood like most widely seen French films of late, 'Intouchables' harnesses its core strengths - ease with intimacy, willingness to ridicule anything and brutal honesty - and delivers one of the funniest, most honest and touching films I have ever seen.Sy is a failed robber, going through the motions and playing the stereotypical jobless émigré. Cluzet is a romantic and melancholy mind trapped in a useless body. The circumstances that bring them together are too funny to spoil here, but meet they do, and an awkward relationship quickly blossoms as they bring out the best in each other.The film's simplicity is delightfully misleading: the script is a masterpiece of comedy writing, and however good the rest of the cast is, the central duo is magical. Sy's comic timing will have you in stitches, but it is his honesty and vulnerability that make you fall in love with the character. Cluzet isn't your typical sad-sack, instead, much of the finest pleasures in the film consist in watching him use his keen mind to mess with the world around him (a subplot about an abstract painting really takes the biscuit, you'll know it when you see it).This is one of the most unique, beautiful and honest friendships ever committed to film. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry... a delightful celebration of everything in life that makes it worthwhile.",10,812,871,27 November 2011
Aliens," One of the best sequels in history!
","To achieve greatness, let alone relevance, a sequel has to innovate. Think of the very best and you will find they build unexpectedly on existing characters and deepen old themes while exploring new territory. The Godfather II does that, Empire Strikes Back certainly does that, and Aliens undoubtedly succeeds as well.Fresh of the first Terminator, a young writer-director James Cameron had a broad choice of follow-up projects. It says a lot about the influence and staying power of Ridley Scott's original nightmare that he chose to explore this universe. The stakes are very different, with first opus survivor Ripley (Weaver, Oscar nominated this time around and with reason) is intercepted after a long drift through space and learns that not only was the planet where she encountered the original alien later colonized, said colony has recently gone completely silent. The ominous 'company' decides to send a platoon of space marines to investigate, preferably with a corporate stooge and Ripley as an adviser along with them.You'd be forgiven for thinking 'here we go again' and expecting little in the way of novelty, but Cameron wisely innovates with the tone, knowing full well you can't put the first film's genie back in the bottle. What we have then is not a slasher film in space, but a rescue mission film than deteriorates into a fight for survival. In typical Cameron-fashion, the bad-ass military hardware is glorified at first, before proving cruelly insufficient in the face of an implacable enemy, not just one alien, but overwhelming numbers, undaunted by modern firepower: the best of horror with echoes of the Vietnam War.If Alien is the film that casts a long shadow over the genre, artistically speaking, Aliens is the one people remember for pure visceral thrills, and it is to this second outing that we owe the actual Alien phenomenon, encompassing video games, comics, toys and yet more sequels. In unleashing a strong director with his own voice it set a unique and sadly rarely imitated precedent of making films within a series wildly different from each other, with the courage to experiment with varied tones, looks and ideas in the hands of directors whose voices were quite unique (Scott and Cameron first, followed by Fincher and Jeunet). It is that, not just the monster, that makes it special, and this ingredient we owe to Cameron's caring treatment of the burgeoning saga. Speaking of monsters, we also owe it an evolving of the monster's life-cycle and, idiot savant that he is, Cameron's silliest idea - replacing the mystery of the alien's biology with a bee-hive structure and, in essence, adding the equivalent of a video game boss level to his film in the form of the queen - turns out to be a masterstroke.This film deserves its status as the most popular in the franchise and is all the validation you need for Cameron's counter to the original Alien's premise. Yes, sometimes less is more. But in this case, as the man said, more clearly was more!",10,0,0,4 November 2002
Alien vs. Predator," Science Fiction's Greatest Monsters Collide...
","What occurs isn't a merger or a union, but a true collision in the worst sense: an accident, a nasty guts-all-over-the-pavement car crash.Earth, early 2000s. A corporate giant puts together a team for a secret mission to the Arctic, where an ancient pyramid has been detected under the ice. Turns out, it's a rite- of-passage hunting facility for Predators, the main game being the nasty xenomorphs from the Alien saga...This film and its sorry sequel show that when you point to the moon, an idiot will stare at your finger. It would appear that the people in charge of this and its sorry sequel carefully studied the Aliens and Predator designs and balance-sheets, but failed to watch even a single film of either franchise. How else could you simultaneously undermine both mythologies to such an extent, while producing something so forgettable? It also blindly shrugs aside all the ideas that made its forbears great: it gives away its last survivor in the opening minutes, it forgets to create any real tension or memorable set-pieces and instead stumbles from one half-baked jump-scare to the next... And worst of all, it is ugly to behold.The Alien saga was visually designed by some of the greatest talents in the industry: Scott, Cameron, Fincher, Jeunet... even the original Predator had at its helm a master of smart action, and its follow-up had worthy moments. AVP is a combination of bland and baffling, with most of the confrontations shown in hastily edited close-ups in near-total darkness, with no sense of composition, rhythm or geography.The only piece of advice Anderson and his team have taken to heart is that 'less isn't more: more is more', a maxim James Cameron put to smart use in Aliens. Here they just go for a 'bigger is better' approach, aided by sometimes sub-par CGI. As a result, not only are proportions all over the map, but the alien queen is the size of a building, face- huggers the size of a small bathtub... What even keeps this from being enjoyable in a perverse, mocking way, is the terrible sense of waste and missed opportunity. Even one of the obvious outcomes of an alien/predator duel, a hybrid creature, is squandered, and you're left with a big loud ugly lump of a film, with no ideas and certainly no balls, one that bodes ill for both franchises given the obvious lack of respect is has for either. Do not waste your time or your money on this.",3,0,1,21 September 2004
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Less is More
","The road to the Lonely Mountain continues for our company of 15 (13 dwarfs + Gandalf + our titular Hobbit), taking them through an evil forest, a less-than-friendly encounter with the woodland elves, a mad barrel chase, and finally a confrontation with the great dragon Smaug.Two films in and it's getting harder not to keep kicking the very dead horse that is the '2 vs 3 films' debate. And yet Jackson, that lovable, fan-boy geek of a filmmaker, has finally overstretched himself to the point where seams not only show, but are sometimes downright embarrassing. Turning a 1000 page book and its dense appendices into 10 hours of film was a wise decision. Stretching a novel under 200 pages to nearly the same length might well turn out to be a folly.The Jacksonian touch is still present and strong, don't get me wrong: the main cast more than pull their weight with obvious mention to Martin Freeman's Bilbo - arguably a much better character than Frodo or Sam in the Ring epic - Ian McKellen's Gandalf and the now ubiquitous Benedict Cumberbatch as a very threatening Smaug. Certain set-pieces also up the ante on anything produced to date in the realm of adventure cinema: the nasty spider ambush, a demented barrel-chase that matches the best of Tex Avery, and the reveal of Smaug. A lot of the humorous touches are also not only welcome, but pulled off to perfection, even if they draw attention to the film's great weakness: its tone.The Hobbit is a brisk, fun, children's story. It is an adventure, Indiana Jones to Lord of the Rings' War and Peace if you will. Bar one nearly poetic encounter by Gandalf in Dol Guldur, every attempt by Jackson to bring these Hobbit installments closer to Lord of the Rings makes them lesser, longer and messier films. Did we need a romantic triangle? Not really, especially one this devoid of consequence. Did anyone really want to see Legolas again? Or Frodo and old Bilbo in part 1 for that matter? No. A certain villain's appearance might be beautifully executed but for all the confusion it creates it might have been better to skip to the meat of this particular story. We only get to Smaug or any of his desolation the title refers to until 2/3 into this movie!We all look back on the majesty and spectacle of the Lord of the Rings with genuine affection, but in the case of the Hobbit, less really would have been more, along with a more sustained focus on the elements that really work. And while we can look forward to more genius Jackson touches in part 3, given the sense of doom built up here and the number of subplots to bring to a close, intimacy probably isn't going to be that film's defining feature.More's the pity.",4,3,3,30 December 2013
Saving Private Ryan," Spielberg's War
","After the assault on Omaha beach, a group of US soldiers, led by Cpt Miller (Hanks), are sent on a mission to retrieve the sole surviving Ryan brother (Damon). Success will earn them the right to return home.After giving a definitive representation of the holocaust with the excellent 'Schindler's List' and of slavery with 'Amistad', Spielberg surprised the world again. 'Saving Private Ryan' is a synergy of old 'men on a mission' style war films, yet completely redefined how conflicts are to be portrayed on film. The film set a tone of savagery, violence and futility that has marked all war films since (and was perfected in Ridley Scott's awesome 'Black Hawk Down'). As a visualist and action director, Spielberg can count this film as yet another resounding triumph. Whenever the tension goes up, as in the horrific opening battle (cinema's most visceral 20 minutes) or the closing siege, Saving Private Ryan surpasses almost any war film in existence.the film is sadly not without its problems, and it is truly regrettable that Robert Rodat's script isn't up to the standards of Spielberg's direction. Whenever the tension dies down and leaves room for character moments, the film comes dangerously close to silliness or sappiness, ticking many of the worst genre clichés in ways that could make it seem like a flag-waiver despite the obvious overall absurdity the film tries to convey. It is a tribute to the acting talents of Damon, Burns, Ribisi, Sizemore and especially Hanks that the film survives such moments, even if a lame last scene undermines the film's power.Despite its flaws, 'Saving Private Ryan' has proved its importance and relevance through the considerable influence it has had on cinema action.",6,3,5,12 December 2006
Lawrence of Arabia," Nothing Is Written
","Lawrence of Arabia is a title people feel almost silly throwing around. It is to cinema what War and Peace is to literature: contemporary audiences have a dusty, old- fashioned idea of it, yet upon discovering it, they cannot resist its power. What more can you say about this classic?For starters, forget about its age, the awards, the reputation, none of it matters when the film starts unfolding before your eyes: this is an amazingly enduring film, one that did not aspire to art but became it nonetheless. What we have before us, is the finest that the golden age of craftsmanship in cinema had to offer.Boil it down to the essentials, and Lawrence of Arabia is a Swiss-watch of a movie: all the components - a subversive script by garlanded playwright Robert Bolt, legendary cinematography by Freddie Young, and a cast to die for led by star-in- the-making Peter O'Toole - work together in perfect unison. Of all his films it is the one that most betrays David Lean's beginnings as one of the best film editors around, judging perfectly as he does not only what to show, but also what need only be alluded to or hinted at.Its intimidating running time of over 3 hours flies by thanks to a perfectly judged pacing, and expert handling of an incredible story. It also makes a mockery of the naive reputation of classical epics by managing to fit in such broad themes as colonial oppression, the dangers and virtues of terrorism/guerrilla fighting, cultural identity and sexual repression. Not what you'd expect from a desert-bound war epic...And yet, on one point they are all right, one you cannot emphasize enough. This film is big. It is huge, and frighteningly nimble and agile for its size. It is gigantic in ways contemporary films with their reliance on CGI can only dream of, and it has the virtue of knowing exactly when to deploy the full extent of its grandeur and when to hold back: there's the invasion of the port city of Akaba, handled in one single, audacious panning shot, or the scenes of one of Lawrence's doomed riderless companions racing against the rising sun. Then there are the charging hordes as Arab forces regroup in Waadi Rum. It's more awe-inspiring and immersive than anything legions of pixel-pushers can conjure up today.In closing, to re-heat another old chestnut: 'they don't make them like this anymore'. Because they can't. Nobody in their right mind would undergo the financial risk and logistical nightmare it was to put this on the screen, and gathering the caliber of talent assembled here is the kind of miracle you can't so easily repeat. See it, and do so on the biggest screen you can find!",10,0,2,17 September 2002
Aladdin," A Dumpster-Fire
","Box office results dictate that we will be stuck with Disney's remorseless plundering of its own back-catalogue for a while to come now, and while remakes can sometimes eclipse their original counterparts, the House of Mouse's efforts so far have fallen way short of the mark. And now this!On paper this could sound passable, if you were to read only the most basic of post-it-fitting summaries. The story has potential, and there are a million ways to do it right, but remember, that's not what this is about. Oh no. The constraints are suffocating: you need to adhere as closely as possible to the animated inspiration, maintain the song and music format, hit as wide a demographic as possible, yet also pad tings out to match modern blockbuster runtime expectations. Okay then...Since the source's appeal flowed largely from a central performance, it logically followed that Disney would want to re-create that as best it could... BUT they needed someone with real-life charisma, box-office appeal, minimal singing and dancing qualifications and character. Since the inimitable Robin Williams was a bit resentful of how Disney overstepped their rights on Aladdin and is also very dead, they went with obvious replacement... Will Smith?I care nothing for Smith's beliefs or horrendous nepotism. The guy has incredible charm, and yes, he can act. But his energy is very different from Williams. It is laid back and ironic, not manic and over-the-top. Instead of adapting proceedings to his own type of charisma and humor, the filmmakers shoehorn him into a gaping Williams-shaped hole, and try as you might, you can never forget the extent to which the role was meant for - and in great part co-designed by - someone so different. The quality of Smith's blue CGI makeup is an abomination but it is kept to a minimum, and sadly, is not what truly sinks the film. It's the constant reminder of how wrong Smith is for the part as maintained by Disney, and watching him rap over Friend Like Me will make you feel sorry for the guy.Speaking of casting, the demands of finding minority actors who can appeal to mainstream American audiences AND carry a blockbuster AND sing clearly proved to much for the studio (never a problem for an animated film where you can easily cheat your way past such constraints), and it's a shame, because in the moments between doing covers of famous songs and reciting inane dialogue, Mena Massoud is rather wonderful. Other choices mostly miss the mark, with Naomi Scott being completely flavorless and burdened with a useless subplot and Marwan Kenzari giving us a ridiculously young and neutered Jafar.Other reviewers have commented on the cheap-looking visuals, and it often felt like characters were walking through the Magic Kingdom. Director Guy Ritchie brings absolutely no personality to the proceedings, and anyone involved in 'adapting' the script for this ought to be ashamed of themselves.No amount of nostalgia can save this train-wreck, and watching it I either felt embarrassed for the participants or yearning for the original. The only hope it raised was that of the perverse enjoyment some of us might soon experience at watching Disney completely butcher Lady and the Tramp.Please, find another - ANY OTHER - use for your time and money!",1,29,49,26 August 2019
Hellboy," Del Toro In Love
","It's hard not to love Guillermo Del Toro as a human being: he exudes so much giddy optimism and love of his craft as to be contagious. His love of monsters, outsiders and more recently Mike Mignola's Hellboy has informed his own films for a long time and now, he gets to go back to his roots.Hellboy is not a superhero comic, but it is a perfect world and hero for the comic medium. It has a very tricky tone, a blend of hard boiled thriller and B-movie action, mixed with Lovecraftian lore and a fascination for the occult. Its visual style, a significant part of its success, is no less difficult to translate effectively to the screen. Taken as a whole, it is easy to see why Del Toro would be instantly smitten, and it is admirable how many years of his career have been a series of strategic decisions to enable him to one day adapt this property. After showing his action chops with Blade II and horror mastery with The Devil's Backbone, he received a very timid green-light.While he has made concessions to a wider audience by anchoring his film with one completely human everyman main character - serving as a gateway - and introducing a love story absent from the source material, Del Toro's otherwise stubborn loyalty to the comic is laudable: the tone is spot on, the look and designs are a beautiful blend of Mignola's and Del Toro's very compatible sensibilities, and Guillermo Navarro's photography often evokes the comic's hard contrast and rich primary colors.The real coup is in the casting, and again we can thank Del Toro for standing his ground: he reportedly refused a significantly higher budget by turning down other potential leading men. Thank the stars, because Ron Perlman was born to be Hellboy, a transformation further aided by amazing makeup effects. He is ably supported by a very emo Selma Blair, the always wonderful John Hurt, and the Doug Jones/David Hyde Pierce combo behind fish-man Abe Sapien. On the antagonist-side, we have an inspired collection of freaks, chiefly Kroenen, cinema's finest SM-Nazi-ninja-zombie. How can a movie featuring such a delicacy not be worth a look?Story-wise, things are a bit less than elegant at times, but the love and care at play often more than compensates, and you get the feeling the people behind this film probably thought this was the only chance they'd ever get to make a Hellboy film. As it turns out, they were wrong, and this is a perfect appetizer to the wonderful part II.Much like the source comic, it is a bit of an acquire taste, but its wide-eyed, unapologetic geekiness is worth treasuring.",8,0,1,19 September 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," From Good to Bloody Fantastic
","Two films in and its now impossible not to admire what Peter Jackson and his team have pulled of in adapting Tolkien's classic.I am no die-hard fan of the books, in fact I read them only once, and while the depth and world-building seduced me, Tolkien's unconventional narrative choices made me skeptical at times. Thank Jackson and crew for painstakingly scrutinizing not only every last sentence of his work, but also for dissecting the lengthy appendices and fleshing out the core story in real time, while streamlining it, a paradox you'd think impossible to pull off: the plot keeps moving, but never at the expense of character, and fun but payoff-free side-notes (Tom Bombadil?) are left aside to focus on expanding what matters, particularly Aragorn, the main Rohan trio and Gollum.Structurally, there was a lot of work to do as the saga moved along: fans had noted deviations from book 1 in The Fellowship, and Jackson & CO had to do additional tinkering on The Two Towers, not least in interweaving its previously cleanly separated narrative strands (Aragorn/Gimli/Legolas in part 1, Sam/Frodo/Gollum in part 2) in a way that heightened the impact of both.Increasingly, it is impossible not to be contaminated by the love and care put into making these films by all involved, so breathtaking is the world on display, so lovable are its characters, and so gorgeous the execution: the melding of computer graphics, stellar model work and live action sets new, unprecedented standards, and these films are gorgeous to both look at and listen to - Howard Shore's score reaches new, hear- shattering heights - from one set-piece to the next, culminating in Helm's Deep, a battle for the ages ending in a series of shots that will have the hairs standing on your neck.Thank your lucky stars this was made into three films and not two or - shudder - just one, because our main focus, our characters, beautifully played as they are, are given time to breathe, evolve, and get under our skin in ways you'd never expect from a feature films. And speaking of characters, though this is a case of ensemble greatness, it is impossible to discuss this particular entry without mentioning Andy Serkis and Gollum. Through an award-worthy performance and digital wizardry, Weta, Serkis and Jackson pull off something unprecedented: they make Gollum not an effect - and he is a landmark - but just another character, as real as any other!And so the quest races forth to its conclusion, continued in the staggering Return of the King. As a bridge film, Two Towers has a thankless task: it has to have its own structure and ending but can neither establish everything from scratch nor end in a clean way. Most will call this their least favorite, but for the way it achieves its impossible objectives so beautifully, I would call it my personal favorite. It certainly contains enough of my favorite and very best moments of the saga, from the charge at Helm's Deep to the Ents, all the way to a wonderfully staged Gollum/Smeagol standoff.This truly is the masterpiece none of us had dared hope for.",10,0,0,6 January 2003
Schindler's List," Heart-wrenching
","World War II is raging. Sleazy socialite and entrepreneur Oscar Schindler (Liam Neeson) arrive in Poland and create his own kitchen equipment fabric with an army contract. His competitive plan? Use Jews from the ghetto: they cost less than Poles or Germans. What begins as a profitable business venture will soon suck Schindler into a dark world of madness and genocide, as he discovers not only his true nature, but also, to his horror, the full implications of the nature of his government.Spielberg had amused and thrilled crowds with a long line of blockbusters before this (few human beings with eyes don't know of E.T., Jaws or Indiana Jones), and had mostly disappointed when trying his hand at more serious material: Color Purple was fair, and Empire of the Sun felt oddly shallow. Being as they weren't really his stories to tell in any case, these films can be excused as mere experiments to prepare Spielberg for this tale which he had held close to his heart for a long time.What amazes about the story is that, in typical Spielberg fashion, it wastes no time. Each scene has a point, a place, and is maximized, and given the film's length and the nature of its story, the result is positively harrowing. Schindler grows considerably throughout the ordeal: the first cynical and opportunistic businessman starts playing a dangerous psychological game with the commanding Nazi officers, namely Amon Goethe (Fiennes). Seldom has human evil found such a frighteningly real incarnation than Fiennes's horrific officer, whose unpredictable fits of depression or violence keep the viewer constantly unbalanced. Ben Kingsley as Schindler's Jewish book-keeper then confidant gives the film a beautiful heart, and the overall acting is universally excellent. Spielberg never lets his actors down, but Steven Zaillian's screenplay truly is a miracle of character development.Shot in staggering Black and White, Schindler's List feels like re-living History. it is brutal, intense and heart-wrenching. Spielberg has returned to oppression and war since (in Amistad and Saving Private Ryan) but has never topped this, nor ave most great films in existence.For one of those rare times, a film is worthy of all the huge praise and hype surrounding it... and then some.",10,9,13,12 January 2007
Patton," Having Your Cake And Eating It...
","If you haven't yet experienced Patton - the movie, if you've experience the actual General you're probably not on this website - there might be several things stopping you: it might be that film your dad keeps going on about, or seem from afar to be a tragically outdated affair. Perhaps you don't like war films. All valid concerns, yet none need apply here.Released in 1970, Franklin J. Schaffner's Patton manages to be a mix of the very best of 60s cinema - a classy, colorful, epic affair - while heralding many traits that would define the 70s. It is as much a war film as Lawrence of Arabia, whose lofty heights it does not quite reach, because it is, first and foremost, a portrait, drawn on a huge canvas befitting such a huge man. Just as with David Lean's classic, you'd be forgiven for expecting jingoism and a romanticized portrayal, and just as with that film, you'd be wrong.Schaffner, though denied a place in the pantheon of great mid-century filmmakers, was far more than a technician. This is the man whose dedication and skill raised Planet of the Apes from silly B-movie to classic, and later gave us a surprisingly gritty vision of hell in Papillon. His gift for nuance and interesting contradictions is on solid display here, and while he peppers his film with impressively-staged and shot battle scenes, these only exist to say something new about our protagonist, all the better served by a rock-solid screenplay by Francis Ford Coppola. All this was inevitably only going to be as good as the lead actor, and in George C. Scott, a master at crafting fascinating but not necessarily likable characters, the filmmakers got more than they bargained for. Scott lights the screen in every screen, eliciting a wide range of emotional responses, but never less than fascinating. While often charismatic and charming, he does not hesitate to come off as a thug and a bully at times, creating a character of surprising depth.This great film owes its enduring appeal not to nostalgia but a rare level of excellence. Regardless what your opinion is of older films, epics or war flicks in general, this is unmissable.",10,1,4,18 January 2003
Transformers," Great Dumb Fun!
","Autobots (nice humane robots) and Decepticons (cruel psycho robots) battle to protect/massacre mankind. That's all the plot summary you need.After an insane prologue where a US base is wiped out by a crazed robot - that sneaked in in the guise of a military helicopter - Bay proceeds with the unexpectedly touching story of young Sam (Shia LaBouf, one of the film's greatest assets) getting his first car (Autobot Bumblebee in disguise), unaware that both robot factions are monitoring him, his family having ties to a mystical lost cube they are searching for. A bit of time is spent exploring Sam's life and tentative romance with school hottie Michaela (Megan Fox, generic model-actress) before everything turns increasingly violent as the Autobots show up and make their purpose known and the Decepticons give up 'the subtle approach' in favor of total carnage.Anyone showing up to see this film is in it for the spectacle and 'Transformers' delivers. That ILM have accomplished miracles is an understatement: the character design and animation is bewildering, giving us something we've never seen before while seamlessly blending it with non-CGI elements. Each revamped robots is both amazing and affecting (particularly the touching Bumblebee and a gleefully bad-ass Megatron). Bay has his faults but when it comes to lightheaded entertainment and action, he is hard to beat, and here he outdoes himself it what could well be his finest film. The funny moments work thanks to Bay's breezy direction and Shia LaBouf's astounding likability, making the dramatic and epic bits all the more effective.That the film's ending seems a bit rushed and leaves you wanting more is a testament to how gripping the preceding 140 minutes have been, and you will leave the theater thinking of indelible scenes like Sam 'hiding' Optimus Prime and company in his parents' backyard (a wonderfully absurd moment), the almost poetic arrival of the Autobots, and of course the final smack-down.The only similar event movie that comes to mind is the original Jurassic Park. You don't often hear yourself wishing for this, but 'Roll on the sequels, please!'",9,1,5,25 July 2007
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Certified 100% Pure Burton
","The Nightmare Before Christmas is the most 'Tim Burton'-y film ever made, which is slightly unfair, as it was directed by veteran animator Henry Selick. Yet it represents nothing less than the fullest, most successful expression of his style and themes, not to mention one of the finest animated feature films ever made.The citizens of Halloween Town are in a bit of a funk: they need something new. Our hero, Jack, the Pumpkin King, stumbles across a portal to Christmas Town and returns entrances, having misinterpreted everything about that other holiday, and decides to import it back home. A hilarious degree of failure ensues.Beyond it's original story and wonderful characters, It's hard to understate how important this film is: Tim Burton's style has always been distinctive but never before or since has the world of animation allowed an artist to explore his style to its limits on such a budget and scale. The animation and visuals are top-notch, a jewel in Selick's already distinguished career. The design is what really makes this endure, and the inventiveness on display sets a new standard. Also pulling more than his usual weight is Danny Elfman, who composes and performs songs more memorable than anything in Disney's recent catalog, as well as his finest score.Even if you manage to overlook the virtuoso craftsmanship on display, you are left with a great tale, and characters you will fight hard not to fall in love with, particularly as they insist on not learning from any of their mistakes.Just do yourself a favor, and see it now!",10,2,3,1 March 2002
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Star Wars 3.0 Finds Its Footing
","Star Wars has been an interesting ride since the Disney acquisition, mixing financial success with timid artistic expression. Thank George Lucas for creating a universe that is very hard to get right, and for personally demonstrate how horribly wrong it can all go when one strays too far from the winning formula of the original trilogy (by creating the lamentable prequel trilogy). Disney has struggled so far to tell a compelling new story while remaining on safe ground: episode VII captured the tone perfectly but felt like too much of a reboot in terms of plot, while Rogue One tried something new and got bogged down in a dour mood peppered with weird fan-service. Measured against those two offerings, The Last Jedi is another step in the right direction. It still contains a bit too much that is familiar, but, for the most part, succeeds best when it tries to be different.Plot-wise there is still a bit of confusion. Judging by our catch-up with Luke and Rey, we kick off the minute Force Awakens ended, but the opening crawl and action scene imply time has passed, mostly to the First Order's advantage (and on that front, there is still much confusion as to why there was a Resistance when there was a Republic, and why those resistance always allude to themselves as 'Rebels'). From the opening seconds, though, it is clear that a new hand it as the wheel, and one soon understands why Disney seemed so impressed with director Rian Johnson's work here. The visual language is more poetic and effective than Abrams' anonymous work in VII and more appropriate to the universe than Gareth Edwards' more visceral experiment. Between a kamikaze jump to light-speed and Luke Skywalker showing us what a Star Wars Mexican standoff would look like, This is the first film in Lucas' galaxy far far away to carry images that will sear themselves into your retinae. The plot, in Disney fashion, tries to offer us comforting beats from Empire Strikes Back, our reference episode from the original saga, but, more often than not, this is to subvert our corresponding expectations. A grand second-act mission does not go as one would expect, and, thankfully, potentially groan-inducing revelations are either handled very well or, thankfully, simply do not occur. Not all is perfect, and this film specifically suffers from issues with the Great Disney Plan: clarity of context, as with the First Order thing, clarity with the villains, some of which, such as Snoke and particularly Phasma, do not register as hoped... But the new ingredients, particularly the new lead trio of Rey, Finn and Poe, are definitely winners. Daisy Ridley carries most of the film's emotion on what turn out to be very solid shoulders, while Oscar Isaac is given more to do this time around. In the baddie camp, we're still missing someone with the cold killer poise of Peter Cushing (the real one, not Rogue One's CGI abomination), but Adam Driver continues to knock it out of the park in unexpected ways as Kylo Ren. It is the kind of part that could have gone either way - and, in the hands of a Lucas directed Hayden Christensen, went truly bad - so kudos to Driver for making us care for his conflicted antagonist.Just as much of the early word on Episode VII was about a great return to form from Harrison Ford, so the internet has been on fire about Mark Hamill burning through the screen. I find the comparison unfair. While Ford merely tapped into that old magic - something he can do very well, admittedly - Hamill's turn as Skywalker here is something else. There are still deep, buried traces of the earnest farm-boy many of us grew up with, but when Master Skywalker decides to throw his weight in, Hamill unleashes a presence and charisma he had never hinted at previously, and it is a jaw-dropping joy to behold. The late Carrie Fisher also glows throughout, her gentle warmth giving the film a lot of its more touching moments.All in all, this might be looked back on as the one where the new generation of Star Wars films finally decided what they wanted to be, and which language they wanted to use. It does not reach the lofty heights of Empire, nor does it slavishly adhere to that classic's structure. In fact, it offers a cleaner ending, one that opens a fresh horizon with new, established and compelling characters. It will be intriguing to see what happens next.",7,1,11,14 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," A Glimmer of Hope, However Faint...
","Despite its smart casting and often undeniable craftsmanship, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (TM) has really been testing my patience of late, and what was fresh in 2008 is starting to feel stale and contrived. Marvel has its story lines so tightly intertwined that every film feels forced to reference at least 2 others in the franchise at this point, and we've reached a point of suffocation. Not helping matters any is a sense that they're basically making the same film again and again, even if they're mostly making it very well.So, on the Guardians of the Galaxy... finally a universe mostly divorced from the Avengers (back to that in a minute) and feeling worlds away from that studio's recent output. Fun, cheeky, self-aware and with much more memorable characters (Groot and the Raccoon being the standouts) than your standard superhero fare, Guardians is at its best when it really lets go and embraces its silliness. It also boasts an endlessly hummable soundtrack. Marvel being Marvel, however, the result is much less perfect than the current IMDb rating would have you imagine. Reused plot tropes are legion, from a distant demigod underwritten super-villain (+ an arch-villain confusingly introduced with no bearing on the plot) to yet another 'destroy-a-city' climax, Guardians is often handicapped by its narrative similarity to preceding films, and you can't help but wish it had been released before all its mostly inferior cousins. Thankfully though, it is denied the cruel fate Captain America was given, force-projected as he was into the Avengers time period for the sake of corporate synergy.Is this a great film? No. But it is an often very entertaining one, with hugely likable characters, and it offers a glimmer of hope, however faint, that Marvel might relax its centralized creative hold and allow for more original ideas to break through. If that ever happens, the age of superheroes will truly be one of movie magic.",7,0,3,4 December 2014
World Trade Center," Something We Didn't Need
","Is it even possible, after the suffering, relentless media coverage and two ensuing wars to take a bit of distance and consider 9/11 without all of its symbolisms? If we do, we have a sequence of events. The hijack. the crash. The collapse. the grief... We can try to look at events in a broader context, what triggered them, but then things get politicized at an alarming speed.On 9/11, about 3000 innocent people died. This is a tragedy. as a statistic it pales in comparison to many places on this planet on any given day, yet our media amplified it and created a legend out of it. CNN, FOX and company have milked all the melodrama out of this human tragedy, and now in 2006 we have 2 films to commemorate it. That raises an important question: do these filmmakers think us so stupid as to need a reminder so soon? The only way to make this worthwhile is if the film seeks to understand these events.Paul Greengrass's 'United 93' offered a clinical observation of the hijacking and its emotionless precision made for more effective cinema, delivering raw, humbling reality when television had drowned us in melodrama, hyperbole and crassness. He gave 9/11 a sense of reality and a humanity which it had lost. Oliver Stone, unfortunately, goes to the other extreme. His tale of two firefighters trapped under the debris may be based on reality, it never feels real. Going for a more austere style than he is used to, Stone inter-cuts the plight of these men with the anguish of their wives. It is an attempt to pay tribute, but, given the massive significance of the surrounding events, you can't shake the nasty feeling that said tragedy is being exploited to wring more tears out of you.Stone's worst traits come out in the form of forced foreshadowing and symbolism, particularly an oft-mocked instance where Jesus brings water to a dehydrated fireman. Coming from the man who gave us JFK, Nixon and Bon on the Fourth of July, this is not just disappointing, but downright baffling: given how politically-charged this tragedy was, one might have expected Stone to question the media-version of events, tying American imperialism and the enemy's religious fanaticism to attacks on home soil and the resulting suffering of the innocent... But there's never even a hint of such thought. All we get is more salt in a barely cauterized wound.The symbolic significance of 9/11 crushes the film's characters and story, dooming it to only arouse emotion in those who have lost loved ones, or by playing on the national feeling associated with the event. Neither of these qualifies World Trade Center as a good film. This offensive garbage is everything we didn't need or want from a 9/11-inspired film.",1,0,4,5 December 2006
Black Hawk Down," World's most morally punishing film experience Ahoy!
","Imagine the Omaha Beach landing scene from Saving Private Ryan played over two whole hours. If that sounds like something you probably would not enjoy, than you belong to the sane majority, and deserve a cookie. It also means you might be put off watching this film, for that premise was one of its great marketing elements. The truth is, you'd be missing out.In recreating the 24 hours or so around an operation to capture a Somali warlord's top advisers, the film is a hybrid of police procedural and war movie, giving you the limited but focused scope of the former with the intensity of the latter. It also acts a horribly prescient display of a modern Western army completely underestimating a 'primitive' enemy, and making everyone pay a heavy price. On paper the mission meant minimal casualties and a deployment meant to last for less than an hour. In practice, the day-long carnage cost the lives of almost 20 elite troops and around a thousand locals. It also proved utterly futile in the grand scheme of things.Cushioned as its release was between 9/11 and the second Gulf War, BHD admirably manages to avoid the prevalent flag-waving tone and boils both sides down to nearly tribal elements, all the way to the strangely homogenous look of team America's cast: our heroes are often hard to tell from one-another, and the emphasis is on team solidarity when thrown into a living hell, not individual heroics. Josh Hartnett is wisely used as our conduit into this world, not our hero. More showy characters like Eric Bana's Delta veteran or Tom Sizemore's bullet- proof colonel manage to be both impressive for their courage and depressing for their inner hollowness and resignation.Visually, this is astounding, and once the fireworks get going, they are relentless. This is an immersive experience, in terms of both image and sound, all the way to the music, with Hans Zimmer's genre-defining score perfectly complementing the action and giving the film's rare moments of calm a haunting quality.In an age where modern warfare means ever-growing distance between a nation and the implications of its actions abroad, this comes a brutal reminder of the costs of such conflict: both to those who live in and around war-zones, but also to the young men sent to fight such battles. As a representation of modern warfare on the big screen, it has no contemporary equal.",8,0,0,27 February 2002
The Last Samurai," Shogun Redux
","Last Samurai was the first of many historical epics green-lit after the revival of the genre by Gladiator, and though it shares a screenwriter with that Oscar-winning epic, it hearkens back to something a bit older.I find myself on the fence about this one because it manages to be the very best of Hollywood and the very worst for different reasons. The same can be said of director Ed Zwick, who's brand of earnest schmaltz can result in either a perfectly tuned masterpiece - like Glory - or saccharine dreck - Blood Diamond, another film with excellent ingredients but the same antagonizing flaws found here.Drawing deep parallels with James Clavell's Shoun, and the miniseries that followed (one you quickly become convinced everyone involved with this film was made to watch at some point), Last Samurai follows disabused Westerner to the Empire of the Sun. There he will put his own life and honor code in question and become seduced by local culture - and, of course, a local woman - and redeem himself in heroic ways. Tom Cruise lays it thick as the self-loathing Captain Algren, especially in a misjudged parody of a firing lesson scene from Glory, but then the screen is lit up by Ken Watanabe, and much is forgiven, wrapped as he and everything else is in lush cinematography and a rousing score.Where the film falls flat - like Blood Diamond to a certain extent - is in underestimating our intelligence or cultural openness. Since a non-white or non-American character is apparently not enough to hold our interest, we are made to see everything through Algren's eyes, rather than merely have be our initial conduit into this unfamiliar world. Having Cruise in the role, capable actor that he is, compounds the problem: every scene that tries to make him a Hollywood hero, rather than an actual character, is unconvincing, especially the physics and culture-defying silliness of the ending.An okay Summer blockbuster, but hardly worth remembering.",5,3,6,9 December 2004
Reservoir Dogs," Cinema Reborn
","First films aren't meant it be like this, have no right to be anywhere near this good. They tend to have an academic respect for storytelling rules, to emphasize the visuals.Reservoir Dogs made Tarantino as a director. It was his first chance to truly take control of one of his zinger-laced screenplays and make it his own, and it was his first time working with actors. And with results that would kick-off one of the most revered filmmaking careers in the history of Hollywood, he faced his insecurities head-on: it's all in the performances.This film should not work because it is a heist-film where you never see the heist, where you find out more about a character's take on Madonna's lyrics than their deep-seated motivations for committing the off-screen crime. Most of it happens in a grim safe-house, and features many actors who barely registered on people's radars, led by Harvey Keitel who, immeasurably generous with his co-stars, championed this film into existence and let others keep its most memorable moments.Reservoir Dogs is an impeccably written, performed and crafted dark little gem. It kick-started a slew of new bad habits in filmmaking: self-aware dialogue, retro- soundtracks, and language that comes with its own hygienic disclaimer. Yet like all masterpieces of note, the more you see its influence applied, the more it shines for getting everything perfectly right. it's safe to say Tarantino, drowning in critical-adulation and his urge to fill every film with 70s B-movie homages, has not matched his work here since. Then again, nearly no one else has.",10,1,3,9 September 2002
Pulp Fiction," Great Expectations
","Three worlds collide. Vincent (Travolta) is an assassin for criminal king Marcelus Wallace (Rhames), whose wife Mia (Thurman) he is dangerously flirting with, against better advice from partner Jules (Jackson). Pumpkin (Roth) and Hunnie Bunnie (Plummer) are two psycho lovers, not far removed from Tarantino's creations in True Romance. Butch (Willis) is a washed-up boxer, indebted to Wallace after he refuses to fake defeat.There is one fundamental element that either makes Tarantino excellent or irritating, depending on the film: his almost nerdy knowledge of film lore. Starting off as a geeky video store clerk, Tarantino became a noted screenwriter (recicling many a conversation from his video store days in his film dialogue: culture debates, comic/film references etc.), then director (this time referencing films, mostly the French New Wave, US blacksploitation, Chinese/Hong Kong Kung Fu and Japanese samurai pics). More often than not, he injects a global coherence that is unique, which, coupled with a deft hand at directing actors, makes for awesome cinema. other times, the result is simply embarrassing.'Pulp Fiction' plays audaciously with its narrative structure, has some magnificently slick photography - though heavily inspired by the New wave - and manages the beguiling feat of uniting such a mouth-watering cast on top form. It made Samuel L. Jackson a household name and gave Travolta a chance at rebirth (before he sabotaged himself again with Battlefield Earth), and yet...For all the fine moments, Pulp Fiction is undone by its nature: it s pulp. The editing dazzles, but the story goes nowhere. Some dialogue sizzles but the overall cohesion is quite uneven. This makes Pulp Fiction a hard film to enjoy when not stoned: it is a succession of great moments that have nothing to do together, like a best-of show-reel of a TV series, so that when you try to take your distance to evaluate it as a whole, it proves dangerously wanting - and, at 160 minutes, dangerously long for its contents. The daring auteur of the brilliant 'Reservoir Dogs' has overreached himself.Perhaps Tarantino himself realized this excess: he went on to make the more controlled and muted Jackie Brown, before exploding again, this time in the action department, with Kill Bill (an amusing but suspiciously unoriginal revenge epic that rips off every established kung fu classic out there). However, he did devote time to promote Asian underdogs in the US, and help cookie mavericks make it in the US.Back to Pulp Fiction. See it at least once for its good moments. At least part of the hype is true...",9,0,1,16 January 2007
Les Misérables," Concerning Musicals...
","In this adaptation of Victor Hugo's monumental Les Miserables, released convict Jean Valjean (Jackman) travels France with a marked pass, condemning him to a life on the fringes of society, until one good soul gives him the means to start his life over - and help others. He soon encounters various poor souls: heartbroken mother Fantine (Hathaway), orphaned Cosette (Allen, then Seyfried), and malicious Tenardiers (Cohen and Carter). All the while the ghost of his past haunts him down in the form of Inspector Javert (Crowe).Many other media have tried to do Hugo's epic justice, and it is somehow inevitable that all will fall short in at least some way. This film is a direct film translation of the Broadway musical, so it is hard to comment on adaptation decisions without having seen said musical, which I never have. I came to this almost completely fresh, curious to see how the musical chose to condense Hugo's original, and above-all curious to see how Tom Hooper had applied his 'revolutionary' live-singing technique. You see, dear reader, I also came to this as not the greatest fan of the musical genre. In fact, I always find musical interludes in films awkward and a bit random, and though I can often appreciate the songs and how they are used on their own merit, the combination with a normal film always jars for me, with the exception of Dancer in The Dark, where the music is essential to the plot. Les Miserables is very different in that respect because almost every single line is sung, quite like opera. And opera's a different kettle of fish altogether, am extreme choice. Points for that, even if it doesn't make the long running time feel any shorter at all.Hooper courageously backed himself into a corner with this one: unable to go for the stage short-hand of favoring voice over acting abilities, he has to balance both, as emotions in cinema primarily work through close-ups. Kudos then for the parts of the casting that actually work. Jackman, always a dependable and sympathetic one to shoulder a film on, gives a good fight, as do many of the other secondary performers. And the film justifies its entire existence and method in Fantine's 'I dreamed a dream', sung in an extended close-up by a sublime Anne Hathaway.Elsewhere, the seams aren't always as expertly sown. Russell Crowe proves the weak link - as extensively discussed on this film's message boards - his voice unable to match his acting chops. It's never as painful as listening the Gerard Butler in Joel Schumacher's dreadful Phantom of the Opera, but it gets close. Also, the film is at its weakest when it strays from the I Dream A Dream format and goes for big wide shots, craning cameras etc, that aim to give the world scale but make it feel stagey instead, an odd contradiction with Hooper's stated intent. In the end, the film is a fascinating experiment. Tom Hooper continues what he began with The King's Speech: wide angle, hand-held close-ups and intimate rapport between the actor and the camera. It's in all those conflicted moments when he remembers that he's making a big Hollywood musical that the temptation to embrace the genre's cliché's undoes the film.Worth seeing at least once.",6,0,0,31 July 2013
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Harry Potter's Big-Screen Debut
","J.K. Rowling's phenomenally successful character's big screen debut sees Harry enter Hogwart's school of magic and meet friends and foes who will follow him throughout his quest.Nobody's idea of a visionary director, Chris Columbus landed the delicate task of setting the foundations for what Harry Potter and his world would look like on the screen. As such, the first Potter film is all bright colors and an earnest desire to be faithful to Rowling's written words. Despite Columbus's unimaginative translation, it is amazing how well Rowling's universe suits the screen, with dazzlingly visual inventions like the great hall, pivoting stair-cases and the quidditch match.The story breezes past and the young actors deliver embody their characters with satisfactory conviction, no more, no less.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Help: Series in Search of Vision
","Harry and friends solve a new mystery, while getting better acquainted with their talents. This adventure sees them tackle another quidditch match, a flying car, giant spiders and the like.Made at a time when the Harry Potter book series had been fully recognized for what it was - an unstoppable literary phenomenon - Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets, the movie, embodies a disappointing lack of courage and compromise from its ,makers: adapt as much as you can from the increasingly long books seems to be the motto du jour. The result is a lumbering 160 minute film that manages to shy away from the darker elements of the book. As such, there is little sense of threat (the aforementioned giant spiders are underused) and the numbing length and uneven pace make this a tough film to enjoy, particularly for non-Potter fans.It's time Columbus left. His greatest legacy will remain the casting an launching of the Potter machine. But still, other than aim at maximum faithfulness, the films have accomplished little so far, except fatten Rowling's and Warner Brothers' coffers.

The Departed," I Wish All Remakes Were This Good...
","In the war between the police and the local underworld, the cops have their mole with the crooks, and the crooks their insider within the police. So far, so Hong Kong hit Infernal Affairs. The Departed' broadens its focus by giving a lot of attention to the chief of police and underworld crime boss, but remains very close similarities to its model.If you really had to remake this, you might as well throw some serious star power and skill at it, so enter director Martin Scorsese, finally winning the Oscar for one of his lesser films, but one that shows considerable confidence, ease and skill. Where this really shines though, is in the characters.In th central roles, Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio pretty much play the parts as Lau and Lueng did in the original: Damon is all confident surface with a fragile foundation, while DiCaprio is an incredibly tortured soul. DiCaprio has more to work with but Damon creeps under your skin with surprising efficiency. Martin Sheen as chief of police offers a sensitive character far removed from the usual cop drama's loud supervisor, a template relegated instead to the crazed double act of Baldwin's obnoxious fed and Wallberg's foul-mouthed cop.For all this classy work though, the turn that what will have crowds reeling with horror and laughter will be Jack Nicholson's mob boss Frank Costello! He oozes perversion and violence and his improvisational riff on screenwriter Monahan's already repulsive character makes for the most spellbinding individual you will see on screen this year! That touch alone warrants this whole remake exercise. Credit a director who knows when to tweak things and when to get out of the way.It's always a huge comfort to see Scorsese work his magic, even on second-hand material. Ina year where old pros have tried to reinvent themselves with varying degrees of success (such as Ridley Scott with rom-com A Good Year and Oliver Stone with the dismal World Trade Center...), Scorsese's star shines brighter than ever.What will he do next?",8,1,2,9 December 2006
12 Years a Slave," 'Do we need to see this?'
","From 'acclaimed director of challenging films' Steve McQueen comes the tale of Solomon Northup, a free man kidnapped and sold into slavery, and the titular 12 years of torment he subsequently endured. The story survived in the form of a sometimes chillingly proper and polite autobiography that leaves a lot to the imagination. A perfect a fit as McQueen could hope for, given his short but powerful track-record of conveying a lot through an almost minimalist approach to filmmaking. His is an unflinching, yet often graceful eye (rather than the perversely voyeuristic poking of, say, Von Trier), so you'd be forgiven for at first staying clear of this film with the apprehension that it might be unbearable to endure. Slavery-film fatigue would be an understandable first reaction. And yetIt's probably safe to say that few things can prepare you for this film, but not in the ways you'd fear. Being the product of a mostly non-American cast and a black, non-American director frees it of any handicapping guilt, and allows 12 Years A Slave to use slavery not as an end in itself, but mere legal context to the tolerance of cruelty. The very nature of the plot helps in this regard too, and in retrospect one of the most chilling aspects of the story is that so many characters are outraged by protagonist Solomon's plight not because he is a human being entitled to dignity, but because he is 'illegally acquired'. With the exception of Brad Pitt's slightly distracting cameo, the same noble whites who would save Solomon do not spare a second glance at his fellow slaves, the latter born into their condition. On the intellectual plane, the film gives us something new. That is not to say that it isn't brutal, it is. Often viscerally so.While it's fair to say that on paper at least, the film presents one of the most genuine meditations on the subject of abusive servitude ever passed off as entertainment. That leaves us with execution, and this is where things arguably become even more impressive.Steve McQueen was reportedly cheered at the Director's Guild Awards when, in response to a question, he said he shot the whole film in little over a month, with only one camera. Take it how you will, there is no denying the man's virtuoso levels of economy, each of the many extended shots stretched to unnerving lengths: for all the technical prowess of some of the choreography, in a year where Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity threw us through space in 3D for 14 minutes with no cut in sight, the most memorable shot of 2013 was an unbearable wide shot of Solomon hanged to a tree, gasping for air, toes barely touching the ground, for what feels like an eternity.And if his technical mastery of his craft is at this point beyond question, his coaching of his cast more than rises to the occasion. It's a career-landmark role for Chiwetel Ejiofor, for obvious reasons, but as a mostly reactive protagonist he is at the mercy of his co-stars. Thank God for Lupita Nyong'o and Michael Fassbender. The former earns the golden statuette the hard way, while the later throws everything he has into one of the vilest creatures ever to grace the screen. There are other, dependable known faces in the mix: Benedict Cumberbatch (a ubiquitous institution these days it seems), Paul Giamatti and Alfre Woodard. Of the supporting cast Paul Dano and Sarah Paulson provide an extra edge. The only bum note is Brad Pitt's too-progressive-to-be-true foreign contractor, robbing the film of perfection by a narrow margin. The role might be pure investor gratitude, but then one must face the fact that without Pitt's initial backing the film as a whole might never have seen the light of day. Looking through the message boards, there's a lot of dialogue about the film from many who have not seen it, and are either hesitant or downright hostile to it. To the latter category, who often ask 'why do we need to see this', I would say the following: beyond the fresh elements it brings to an old issue, it remains a film, and as such, it is a masterclass in direction, in storytelling economy, and in pure tension. Damn right you need to see this.",10,5,8,6 March 2014
Man on Fire," Denzel VS Mexico City... with unexpected heart
","Alcoholic mercenary Creasy (Washington) is all washed-up, until his friend (Walken) finds him a job in Mexico City, as bodyguard for a rich family's little girl Pita (Fanning). The taciturn man and melancholy girl slowly develop a strong bond... that is utterly shattered the day that Pita is kidnapped and that negotiations are sorely mishandled.'Man on Fire''s title works against it. It proclaims an adrenaline-fueled action film, when in fact what we get is very different. What could be mistakenly thought to be a prologue (Creasy is introduced, meets Pita and the relationship is shown) constitutes a good half of the film's running time. Washington and Faning are on top form, the former tortured and angry and the latter endearing without being cloying, so it is a tribute to Scott and screenwriter Helgeland that the film takes its time showing their odd relationship. This makes things all the more hurtful and outraging when she is captured in a kidnapping that leaves Creasy severely scarred, both emotionally and physically.The film earns its title in the second half, not because of non-stop action - which it fore-goes in order to give us something more pondered and cruel - but because Creasy is literally ablaze with silent fury. As he hunts down anyone who participated or profited from Pita's kidnapping, dismantling rings of Mexico City's tower of corruption, his methods get bloodier while his movement actually get slower. Creasy races against time and his own likely death, as a tragic figure who's newfound reason to live has been taken away from him.The performances are fine, with great turns from the two leads and superb supporting turns by the always reliable Christopher Walken and Jiancarlo Giannini. What sometime detracts from the film's quality is Tony Scott's now signature messy visuals. While some shots are magnificent, reminiscent of brother Ridley's work, some are almost trashy and epilepsy-inducing (some unnecessary hyper-MTV editing). the man redeems himself by handling his actors with care, superbly illustrating his environment and creating a stark atmosphere.This is a precious oddity: a quality blockbuster.",9,64,74,10 January 2007
Downfall," The Definitive Word on the Subject
","In Oliver Hirschbiegel's 'Downfall', we follow young secretary Traudi Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara) into Hitler's bunker and witness the final days of the Third Reich through her increasingly disillusioned eyes.Finally, Germany gives us a film on the matter, and, rather unsurprisingly, it feels far more authentic that any other take on the subject. Hirschbiegel's film is taut and claustrophobic and his characters breathe and feel real. His depiction of the war above ground is harrowing and efficient... Yet, as with all such films, 'Der Untergang' will live or die by its central character: Hitler.Hitler is such a monumental figure that, if you translate him, you are unable to see anything else than the actor portraying him, however talented (Anthony Hopkins and Alec Guiness gave it a go and didn't transcend). For the most part, we have had to accept mediocre caricatures suggesting that Hitler was as seen in his speeches (overly manic/dramatic) 24/7 (most films about Hitler fall prey to this, and 'Hitler, the rise of Evil''s Robert Carlyle is just another example of getting it completely wrong!). Bruno Ganz's portrayal of Adolf Hitler crashes through these misconceptions and the heavy baggage and makes us distinguish the man from the phenomenon. To our horror, we discover that the man who sparked this wretched out-of-control ideology is also a sometimes touching and amiable father-figure, making us understand how so many people would follow him. Ganz manages to become the man, utterly believable throughout, whether showing kindness to someone, yelling at his cowardly generals, or putting his pet out of its misery (a heart-breaking scene).The film, technically admirable and boasting powerhouse performances, truly marks itself as a triumph in terms of tone and message. 'Der Untergang' shows quite rightly that it is not the misguided and ultimately tragic man, but the system and its followers, that are monstrous. Ganz's Hitler seethes with anger at what he perceives as a betrayal: the German people have failed him, putting an end to the lie that Hitler was a cunning and deceitful sorcerer who brain-washed Germany. The people deceived themselves, and in the final moments, Magda Goebbles and other underlings prove themselves to be more repugnant and evil than Hitler himself ever could be. Thus, the film attracted naive controversy because many refuse to see Hitler as a human being. They do not realize that doing so dilutes the most important message of Nazi Germany: the people, not just Hitler, made it what it was! This could all too easily happen again...You owe it to yourself to see this incredible film!",10,6,9,20 February 2007
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," The Desolation of Nostalgia
","Peter Jackson finally caps his nearly 2-decade stint in Middle Earth (not counting the odd hiatus here and there) with his shortest film since the late nineties, two and a half hours of 'pay-off'. I use brackets because the narrative foundations are much less solid than they were in The Return of the King.In terms of action, Jackson outdoes himself, mostly foregoing the epic sweep of the Rings trilogy for a big messy brawl, though with a sense of geography that helps you keep track of who is where and trying to do what. His inventiveness in these scenes also gives you glimpses of what the Hobbit could have been had it chosen to be a more compact, fun and silly adventure story: dwarf lords riding battle-pigs, war-goats climbing a mountain-fortress, Legolas using a giant bat as a parachute and a demented fight on a collapsed tower (this one is worth the price of admission alone) are all sights to behold, pure entertainment... Jackson certainly has not forgotten how to direct movies. Only how to write them.Part 1 made a whole fuss about dragons and teased us with shadows and a giant eye, while wasting time in Hobbiton and Rivendel. Part 2 committed the even greater sin of giving us a bit of dragon and denying us his titular desolation, while throwing in a useless love story and more Rings setup intrigue we didn't need - and the less said about Beorn, the better. Along comes part 3, swiftly dispatching the great Smaug before titles even appear on screen to focus on a battle right out of the book's footnotes. Even the title is disingenuous - again! - as of the five armies, two are of orcs and count as the same, and another isn't an army but a crowd of refugees.The spectacle might be near faultless, but the structure is fatally flawed, cramming in more Lord of the Rings setup and more minor characters devoid of payoff. Now that it is all said and done, making two films out of the Hobbit could have worked, and produced tight and fun experiences. Stretching it to three has resulted in a completely indulgent narrative mess, which allows itself to lose sight of its strongest assets. It's mind-boggling how little of Martin Freeman's Bilbo you actually see in films named after him...More and more, I hear people compare these films to the Star Wars prequels. While the Hobbit installments are nowhere near the complete artistic disaster that those films where, it does underline the utter pointlessness of prequels. We might want more of the same, especially if it moves the story forward and shows us new things, but we don't need setup for things we've already seen, and perhaps this was inevitable with Jackson at the helm: an irrepressible, natural desire to 'tie it all together'. Every little thing that turned the Hobbit into a prequel saga to Lord of the Rings made it suffer, and you can't help but imagine what Guillermo Del Toro and a fresh perspective might have done.",5,7,14,16 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Opera!
","Star Wars is the most popular cinematic work of all time, and the classic trilogy is almost universally regarded as the crown jewel of cinematic escapism. The prequel trilogy, however, has not fared so well.After the squandered potential of episodes I and II, episode III is left with - according to Lucas - 60% of overall prequel plot to convey, including the fall of Anakin Skywalker. In fact, you could say that given the shoddy character work of episode II and the fact that episode I could have been edited down to an opening text crawl paragraph, Revenge of the Sith IS the prequel saga. That's a lot of narrative and emotional burden for a single film to carry, especially one led by a man not especially gifted at either facet of filmmaking.The longest Star Wars film to date kicks off in high gear, nose-diving into a huge space battle and rescue mission. That the casualties are either evil robots or disposable human clones doesn't fully affect your initial enjoyment, particularly when it all builds up to Christopher Lee doing his shtick in a not-so-subtle replica of Return of the Jedi's throne room. Then we crash-land on Coruscant and the politicking, inane Jedi-speak and gag- inducing love story resume. The pacing is swifter than ever before, but, given that this is the last chance to get things right, the little touches irritate all the more. Even characters that are given more room to shine - Yoda and Obi-Wan in particular - are undone by problems of motivation and narrative consistency. It speaks volume that it is Ian McDiamrid's evil, campy Palpatine who completely steals the show in these prequels: his is the only character with a clear motivation and any passion. he lights up the screen anytime he shows up, which, thankfully, is very often in Sith. None of Lucas's attempts to ruin this character - and there are a few, including an insanely stupid explanation for his appearance later on - fully succeed.Lucas conjures up a spectacle that is more visually interesting than its predecessors, and which, coupled with an amazing score by John Williams - the unsung hero of these awful prequels - amounts to a very impressive show. On first viewing. Sadly, the aftertaste becomes increasingly bitter.The pacing is vastly improved, and watching Lucas retrofit his universe is often a lot of fun. When he manages to eschew his famously awful dialogue, he even creates moments of amazing power, particularly a speech-free turning point for Anakin, showing him and Padme a city apart, or the start of Palpatine's Jedi-genocide. Even Obi Wan's messy dust-off with new villain General Grievous packs some of the fun of the original films. The more anticipated moments, however, fall flat: the birth of Darth Vader, a protracted duel that ends in a way that betrays the characters involved, and a rush to fill certain plot-holes in the closing stretch...Episode III is what everyone feared it would be: the best of the prequels by a very wide margin, but still not up to the standard set by the originals, and by common standards, not that good an overall film. The lack of visual spark or narrative discipline of the prequel saga might have been remedied to a certain extent, but it is still undone by a clumsy self-importance and a detestable main character, one who was arguably already Darth Vader since his genocidal romp in Episode II. With this tough-to-top incident, Lucas can only seal the deal by having Vader become Vader by slaughtering children (off camera, yet in a film series which, by his own admission, is aimed at children). You could fill an encyclopedia with the conceptual miss-fires and wasted opportunities on display in these 3 films.So there it is for your consideration, or you could skip it and its sorry brethren, and go straight to the originals.",4,1,2,2 February 2006
Prometheus," Now that the dust has settled...
","A titan roams across a primitive Earth, and dies. Millennia later, a human expedition travels to a distant star to make contact with the race that might have engineered it.After promising answers to the unsolved mysteries of the Alien saga, and creating historic hype with one of the cleverest viral ad campaigns of all time, Ridley Scott's Prometheus arrived on the world's screens to somewhat mild disappointment. Some will say this was inevitable, and surely the film promised enough that it would be worth seeing whatever its flaws. To most eager fans - and I am one - the greatest mystery was: how close would Prometheus be to Alien?The reason Prometheus was at least moderately financially successful despite its rating, is the same for which many viewers were frustrated: at its core lie many very promising ideas, and in good part, the execution is excellent. The actors do not disappoint, with Fassbender, somewhat unsurprisingly, a true delight. The 3D is immersive, in fact the film is often a true visual splendor, and, this being a Ridley Scott film, the design is impressive, although....And here is the film's failing. Ridley Scott is a great visualist, but he is not an ideas man, and he does not operate in a vacuum. Whoever designed Prometheus often did a commendable job, but never touches the lofty, terrifying heights of Mobius and Giger. In fact, the film is at its best when it distances itself from the Alien saga as a whole, which is why David's subplot - refreshingly different from Ash or Bishop's - and the engineers' inner workings are its best elements, and why scenes that stray too close to Alien feel flat by comparison, particularly the unnecessary epilogue, without which the film would deserve up to two extra stars.Perhaps the biggest conceptual problem with Prometheus is its relative demystification of the Gods, a foundation for the film's theme: so much emphasis is placed from the get-go on David's relation to humans possibly echoing their relation to their makers that they lose some of their menace. A threat of Lovecraftian potential is in great part deflated by this, and rather than unspeakable and incomprehensible horror, the creators mostly frighten by their scale, their basic motives almost too easily comprehensible by the human characters. This as the risk of turning mysteries into plot holes.All in all, how much you enjoy Prometheus will depend on how familiar you are with the Alien saga, in an inversely proportional way. Since I place at least the first two on a cinematic pedestal with at least high aesthetic regard for the third and fourth installments, that should be a bad sign. In fact I appreciated some of its braver aspects. The best we can now hope is that Prometheus has the courage to branch off into not 'Alien 0', but 'Prometheus 2' and really becomes its own beast. That it finally keeps its promises.",6,0,3,27 June 2012
Raging Bull," Craft VS Content
","Raging Bull is a portrait of boxer Jake LaMotta, and is often hailed as the greatest film of the 80s. Tellingly, it is most commonly revered by people who have a certain knowledge of or interest in the craft of filmmaking. What could possibly be wrong with that? Martin Scorsese is the most enduring New Hollywood director after Steven Spielberg, and, unlike the latter, managed to more often than not succeed commercially without giving in to audience tastes and expectations, hence the higher level of respect he receives from critical circles. His earlier work in particular was a perfect combination of raw, powerful storytelling with an encyclopedic knowledge of filmmaking technique, and in Robert De Niro and Paul Schrader he found worthy, reliable collaborators with the talent to create these rage-infused films. It is strange to consider that this particular project was not one he originally wanted to make.Robert De Niro nursed a fascination with La Motta and threw years of energy into convincing both Schrader and Scorsese to make a film about him, often to the confusion of those around him. During one story meeting, a studio exec asked the dream team why they wanted to make a film lionizing this 'cockroach'. That is perhaps the heart of the divisive issue.Raging Bull is a masterpiece of direction, one of the most alluringly shot films you will ever see, and contains some of the best performances ever committed to celluloid. But, expert character study that it is, it is that of a truly repugnant individual, whom it does indeed lionize beyond reason, and upon whom it forces an awkward and undeserved absolution ('I once was blind but now I see'?), the result of a, at the time, personally burnt-out Scorsese forcing his own Christian sense of renewal onto an incompatible character.Raging Bull is, and should be, mandatory viewing for anyone interested in filmmaking or performance. However, it is more 'important' than enjoyable, almost more significant for its technical virtues and the bygone creative era it represents, easy to admire but very hard to love. Its points of contention are the same that feed such heated debate around other classics, most notoriously 2001 A Space Odyssey, worlds apart yet similar in that it succeeds as a work of art while failing as a story and piece of entertainment. Love it or hate it for what it has to say, there is beauty and artistry in how it says it.To film historians and a majority of critics, Raging Bull ended 80s cinema by opening it, saying all there was to say. But to me, its fellow black-and-white best picture nominee that year (also containing the resounding cry 'I am not an animal') is a more affecting, more enduring statement about human nature than Raging Bull turned out to be.",6,3,7,13 October 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Less Fun Than Anyone Could Have Imagined
","Five films into their stewardship of the Batman legacy and DC expanded-universe-in- waiting, and we are seeing the serious limits of Christopher Nolan and his team's abilities. What is the most striking is that those flaws stem from what, in any other genre, would constitute a strength (as evidenced by the recent Interstellar): a profound sense of pathos, and fixation with characters who are obsessive and frail.Batman V Superman is three things in one, and already that should be a bad sign for anyone expecting a satisfying experience beyond mere fan service. It is a new Batman. It is a sequel to Man of Steel. It is also the first Justice League film. it's hard enough to pull even one of these off properly, as Man of Steel sadly demonstrated, but three? Those can hardly be fair expectations, and yet, team DC believes we wanted all this in one helping.Man of Steel was the dourest Superman film ever made. You could even argue this isn't Superman at all, given his constant scowl, anger and fear, and his apparent disregard for human life, as showcased in a final city leveling rumble that was spectacular as it was non-sensical. Except without it, you could never have this film...If you thought our new Superman was an emo sad sack, wait until you meet the new raging, nightmare-crazed Batman. Ben Affleck does wonders with slim material, and at least the plot, contrived as it is, gives him genuine reasons to hate the man in the red cape. If you're even awake 90-minutes into this bleak, depressing mess there's even some joy to be had in watching them go at each other, and the moment many people had dreamed of one day seeing on the big screen often comes close to justifying all the effort and expectation... and then suddenly things veer back to a generic climax. The design is a bit of a letdown, especially an underwhelming CGI baddie with unfortunate resemblances to Lord of the Rings' trolls, but the writing is what crucifies the film: if you thought Batman's reasons for hating Superman were a bit flimsy, the moment that brings them together is beyond contrived and ridiculous.I understand this is all an attempt to go a bit darker and more realistic than the Marvel universe, a willingness to try something different that, in principle, I can only applaud. But must these films be so dull, so charmless? Batman and Superman can only play off each other if they are a bit different. Here there is so much angst on both sides they cancel each other out.The only moment that conveys any real excitement is the introduction of Gale Gadot's Wonder Woman. Not only does it ratchet up the silliness a bit but it also delivers a real sense of fun that is sadly missing from the rest of the film.A lot of that is down to Zach Snyder's confused direction, treating each scene as if it were trailer material and strangely mangling the action scenes, none of which have the precision and clarity of Nolan's outings (or even Superman Returns for that matter), but the story on display is also clumsily told. As a result, much of the fancy effects and choreography fall flat because of dramatic stakes that are either murky or downright inexistent, in a way reminiscent - frighteningly so in the case of one dream sequence - of Snyder's own vacuous Sucker Punch.Please D.C. universe, lighten the tone a bit next time.",1,7,16,24 March 2016
Blade Runner," Most influential film since Star Wars
","There is little left to be said about this seminal masterpiece, but I would like to draw your attention to something different.Books have been published about the era-defining visuals, the hellish production and confused post-production and release saga. This is THE future noire film, an entrancing world whose existence and ideas are much more interesting than any of its events. Harrison Ford serves as a conduit and Sean Young is the perfect synthetic femme fatale, but the center of gravity is and always has been Rutger Hauer's Roy Blatty, the first and last artificial aryan superman.You should see this of course, and probably already have. If so, let's consider Rutger Hauer for a while, the man revealed by fellow Dutch filmmaker Paul Verhoeven's Soldier of Orange and Flesh + Blood. Two very different films, in turn hopelessly different from Blade Runner. Three different characters than nonetheless all reach a state of grace, of distant peace and that sense of withholding secrets from us. That is what Rutger Hauer was at that point in time, perhaps the only male star to ever give us a flesh and blood version of the Mona Lisa's enigmatic smile, and never was that complex smile so fraught with significance than in the last minutes of Blade Runner. I hold Blade Runner before not as one of the most influential and best films of all time. it is. I would like you, for the briefest of moments, to consider how it was so successful in capturing and redefining many of our subconscious artistic reference points, not just of what a modern cityscape might look like, but what modern humans and their artificial progeny might experience and feel. What Ridley Scott has done here, is not show us the future, as many people suspected: he has allowed us to touch it.",10,0,1,3 June 2002
Casino Royale," Bond 21: Bond reborn.
","After earning his 00 credentials (in a moody and electrifying Black and White prologue), James Bond (Daniel Craigh) follows the trail of terrorist banker Le Chiffre. When Bond thwarts his initial plan, Le Chiffre organizes a high stakes poker game in Casino Royale, Montenegro, to recuperate his money and pay back his terrorist clients before they kill him.After all the controversy about Craigh, one finally has the chance to judge the film itself. Judging by audience reception, the world is finally ready for the darker, more human Bond tentatively experimented with during the Dalton years. Craigh's Bond begins as a ruthless killer, developing class, a heart and finally the first marks of his famed style during his first mission. The first thing any honest reviewer can do is remark on the actor's prowess in giving us arguably the best - certainly the most real and touching - Bond ever to grace the screen, or at least a fair match for Connery. He is at ease with both the warmth and the ruthlessness, the charming banter and cold threats, the character scenes and violent bursts of action, and conveys that rare sense that Bond actually evolves over the course of the film. His different relationships with women and his (often vicious) sparring with M (Judie Dench on top form and hogging many of the script's best lines) also add surprising layers to his character.After introducing the new Bond, Casino Royale kicks off with the dangerously addictive title song 'You Know My Name' by Chris Cornell. It then proceeds to present Le Chiffre, daring to hint at a larger organization behind our villain. An opening African free ruining scene will leave the audience breathless, as will a demented airport confrontation. The film also has the virtue of giving us a villain fighting to save his life, for whom the stakes are just as high as they are for Bond, which brings us to section 2 of the film: the poker tournament.The second half of the film is slower, yet by no means lesser. Though the poker game has its moments and is inter-spaced with nasty assassination attempts, its chief merit is in the chemistry between Bond and Eva Green's Vesper Lyndt. Whether Green is the sexiest woman ever to play a Bond girl is a matter for the message boards (and likely not the case) but she certainly is the best actress to face 007. What's more, their relationship manages to attain depth and be touching without forsaking the usual sparks that should mark a Bond romance. Ultimately it completely convinces us in the profound effect it will leave on Bond as he will become in the future.The ending might feel abrupt to some, since it slightly pales in contrast to the unusually excellent film that precedes it. It serves as a reminder that this is merely a beginning. That it is such a stunning, moving and energetic one should delight viewers. Hopefully the level of quality attained here will be the standard for following 007 adventures and mark Craigh's era as the definitive years of the Bond saga.Rousing entertainment. A must-see.",9,1,4,1 January 2007
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," It's Our Fault, We Asked For This!
","After 10 years - or 32, depending on your regard for the legitimacy of the prequel trilogy - Star Wars is back, and, in the spirit of times, as Giuseppe DI Lampedusa would have put it, it was necessary for everything to change in order for it to remain the same: new studio, new team, new characters... new expanded universe even (more on that later). It's funny then, and sadly not at all surprising, that so many things remain the same as in 1977.The Empire has survived, in the form the The First Order, and the rebellion is now the Resistance, led by General Leia Organa. A soul-searching stormtrooper (Boyega) saves ace resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Isaac) and important info stored in a droid and stages an escape to a desolate desert planet... Well, if echoes of Episode IV are already a bit startling, it gets worse. It quickly becomes clear why so many directors turned down this dream assignment, as Episode VII isn't as much a chance to play in George Lucas' sandbox as a remake of his original opus. Blame Disney. Blame J. J. Abrahms, he's certainly done this before... the fault, it turns out, is yours.After the dismal prequels, chock-block of new ideas, some good, some bad, most of them executed horribly, we've howled for movies that resembled the originals more that Disney would have been suicidal to approve anything more original than this, and history will judge Episode VII on how much it emboldens the studio to be more daring, or whether it just confirms the need to just 'give fans what they want', more of the same. Time will tell, but, to quote our heroes, I have a bad feeling about this.What is annoying this time, after the utter cluelessness of Episodes I-III, is the very real talent on display here. The old characters could have stood silently in the background, paychecks safely cashed, but they make a mark, particularly Harrison Ford as Solo, more touching and involved here than he has been for at least a decade. The new characters are just as involving and appealing, particularly John Boyega's Finn and Adam Driver's Kylo Ren. Andy Serkis also makes an impression. Otherwise, the humor is back and it's a thrill to see J.J. Abrams work a scene after the inane telenovela-like blocking of the prequels.And still, this could have been much more, and our only consolation will have to be that it could have also been worse. The greatest question is, what comes next?Tonally, we are squarely back in original trilogy mode, the only limit will be the appeal of the characters (mostly successful here) and the caliber of the stories (not so much). It is a bit worrying that Disney has jettisoned all the expanded universe, both because it might set an ugly precedent, and because it does show a fear of risk and cynical approach to a very valuable brand. And yet... we might be wrong: what little transparency has been displayed so far might be completely honest. It was George Lucas himself who, in an interview, said Disney had rejected all his outlines saying that they wanted to make 'one for the fans'. Well, this describes Episode VII perfectly. If we could have some fresh ideas with our next helping, we'd truly be thrilled.",7,5,18,16 December 2015
Kagemusha," The Master Shifts to Color
","Kurosawa is most often - and perhaps unfairly - synonymous to many people of dynamic samurai films. People think of Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, or the different but contemporary Rashomon. They think of movement, of Toshiro Mifune bursting out of the screen. And they imagine it all in black and white.To stay focused on this is to ignore many gems in the Kurosawa crown at your peril, and it also means maintaining unreasonable expectations when exploring some of his films. Also, while previously overlooked works have been reassessed as masterpieces since (especially High and Low), Kagemusha, the master's first chambara epic in color, usually gets short-changed, viewed as best as a dress- rehearsal for Ran, his final masterpiece. It's time to rectify the situation.Kagemusha - 'The Shadow Warrior' - is the story of a lowly thief enlisted to serve as warlord Shingen Takeda's double. When Takeda is mortally wounded, his lieutenants keep it a secret and train the double to stand in his place, eventually at great emotional cost to our nameless hero.Kurosawa's career peaked with Redbeard. Not that that was his finest film, but it marked the peak of his financial and creative powers, and the height of his popularity in Japan. It was followed by a painful decade in the half in an artistic wilderness, caused by an unhappy first foray into color filmmaking, Dodeskaden, which was rejected by critics and audiences alike. After that came Russian tone- poem Dersu Uzala. Unable to get financing for his next project, Kurosawa buried himself in painted storyboards of the great film he would never make, until Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas swept in, forcing Fox to put up funds for this project sight unseen. The long prep time is keenly felt upon seeing the finished film. Where Seven Samurai and even Redbeard were kinetic and fluid, Kagemusha feels very designed, static and artificial, which perfectly complements the story it tells, and its themes of social rigidity and artifice. Toshiro Mifune is nowhere to be seen either, replaced by a very different presence: Tatsuya Nakadai. Kurosawa had first intended to use Katsu - famous for the Zatoichi series - but his controlled environment had no room for that comedian's freewheeling style, and old collaborator Nakadai swept in to carry the film on his able shoulders.The result is a beautiful film to behold, less visually alluring than Ran but more touching and human. Though it has its unforgettable images - a blinding, back-lit procession of retreating soldiers; riderless horses rolling among corpses in the battlefield; a surreal dream sequence - it is the smaller moments that stand out: the double trying to convince Shingen's concubines, his tender moments with Shingen's grandson, Daisuke Ryu's surprisingly likable antagonist Nobunaga... It is not the instantly thrilling comeback many had expected, but it is undoubtedly the work of a true master firing on all creative cylinders, and well worth watching more than once.",10,1,5,1 July 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," All Good Things come to an End!
","All the threads of Tolkien's magnum opus come together in the most elegant of fashions in the final part of Peter Jackson's adaptation. Humanity makes a last stand at Minas Tirith, the Hobbits travel through Mordor, our heroes try to by time for Frodo to complete his mission and the Evil Sauron gets tired of the whole game and lashes out with all his might and fury.'Return of the King' is 4 hours of payoff, a third act in a gigantic epic rather than a mere film of its own. As such it is intensely dramatic and dynamic and you can very much sense that though peter Jackson spared no effort on the previous episodes, this is clearly his favorite. the film floats by at a thunderous pace, taking us through unforgettable moments such as the battle of Minas Tirith itself, a marvel of seamless animation and epic film-making, it demands to be seen, as it has too many jaw-dropping moments to choose from. The quieter character moments keep gaining in potency and the full weight of the stakes and their heartbreaking consequences is never in doubt.The cast of these films have played their parts to perfection and again Jackson deserves overall credit for choosing actors that so perfectly match Tlolkien's creations: Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee are their own usually excellent selves, and the hobbits remain endearing, but of all the uniformly great cast, the true standouts are Viggo Mortensen and David Wenham as the tragic Faramir, whose relationship with his brutish father is the most traumatic of the film. Jackson pushes them even further by having them sing at a few key moments (a practice employed to powerful effect by Tolkien in the books), a daring undertaking that works wonders. And though he may offer one ending too many, he does have the decency to show off each surviving character with the appropriate screen time and respect.Now that the trilogy is complete, it can be viewed as one big film, as it should be. After 8 years, Jackson has done the impossible: he has taken Tolkien's huge legend and made films that stand on their own and have revolutionized film-making, setting the new benchmark for cinematic epics. Changes have been made to Tolkien's source novels, but they make for better, more fluid films, more faithful in spirit to Tolkien's myth than anyone had the right to hope for.A masterpiece, whether as part of a bigger whole or on its own. Well deserving of all the high praise thrown at it, and then some...",10,53,60,22 November 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Legend!
","Star Wars is the stuff of legends, mainly because it finds its inspiration in countless folk legends and archetypes, but also because it became the inspiration of an era. It was probably the first ever cinematic cult phenomenon and one can measure its power by the sway it still holds 27 years after its release.The story couldn't be simpler frankly so do dwell on this detail would be to miss the point entirely. The backdrop is the main character of the film and it is nothing short of miraculous! The alien vistas and locals while otherworldly have a worn look that makes them unbelievably real (unlike the often fake-looking CGI of the prequels). The technology looks real. This authentic look gives the action scenes a power almost transcendental. It surpasses anything we've ever seen because despite it's otherworldlyness it all works. So the world Lucas creates more than makes up for the bland characterizations (these are only archetypes after all so don't expect too much depth, that's a advantage Empire Strikes Back has over the entire saga) and acting, although veterans Alec Guiness, Peter Cushing and James Earl Jones give this more dignity and weight and there's a very welcome cynical 'this can't be real' look from Ford that means the film doesn't take itself all too seriously (something lacking in the prequels).This vision of fantasy has it's flaws but it still solidly deserves cult status for it's gargantuan strengths: a legendary score by John Williams, era-defining special effects, a mythology and fantasy that rival anything ever imagined by a film-maker, great action and a pure naive heart that makes it impossible to resist and is seriously lacking in today's blockbusters.Star Wars is more than a film: it is in itself a reason to love movies. It is a testimonial to man's imaginative powers.",10,1,1,3 May 2004
Cloud Atlas," Caught Between Two Worlds
","Characters in 6 different eras struggle and define themselves, decisions and acts of kindness (or evil) rippling through time and influencing other lives. In the 19th century, a young slaver is helped by a stow-away; in the early 20th century, a conflicted young composer works as an apprentice for a forgotten genius; in the 70s, a reporter investigates corporate wrong-doings; in the present day, a debt-ridden publisher goes through a number of absurd ordeals; in the 22nd century in Neo-Seoul, a clone waitress discovers the hidden power she possesses; in a distant, post-Apocalyptic Hawai, two survivors from different cultures try to activate a beacon that might allow them to escape a poisoned Earth.Long summary for a complex story. I will not look at this in the context of the source novel, since I never read source novel. But since against all odds this was turned into a film - and the ordeal endured to get it made is worthy of a book itself - how does this film work on its own merits?Tom Tykwer (Run, Lola Run & Perfume) co-directed this huge independent venture with the Wachowsky siblings (Matrix, Speed racer, V for Vendetta), and at first it is very encouraging to have such strong cinematic voices expressed through such a project. Directing duties were split depending on story segments in a way that meant the more contemporary ones were handled by Tykwer. A much more interesting, unusual and ultimately controversial decision was made to have actors recur across segments, playing various characters who differed in their gender and race. More about this later.Cloud Atlas has been praised as a masterpiece and derided as a massive folly. Whatever it is, and in my opinion it is torn between the two, sometimes within the space even of an individual segment, it certainly is unique. In fact, when commenting on films you can often single out things that worked throughout and others that didn't... With Cloud Atlas you have a less clean-cut job on your hands.For all the vaunted technical prowess and vision of its makers, Cloud Atlas has trouble keeping a balance, something it often just barely makes up for in pacing. For a 3-hour film containing 6 smaller stories and a framing device, it actually flies by. But then, on the flip- side, you often feel that we cut to another thread just as the one we were following was getting interesting. This ambiguity stretches to nearly all departments, even casting. What largely saves the film and will keep you in your seat is the ever-dependable emotional anchor that is Tom Hanks. Whatever the era, he is hugely watchable, and provides much of the humanity of the film. The same can be said for Jim Broadbent, alternating between heart- breaking coward, indifferent officer and evil old bastard depending on the sub-story. Elsewhere things get more complicated: Ben Whishaw and James D'Arcy have trouble shouldering the weight that the script piles up on them, Doona Bae is undermined by the film's most controversial artistic choice, and Halle Berry is simply terrible across the board.And for all its merits - Hanks, Broadbent, visions of different periods, the light interweaving of stories - there are two decisions that come very close to making the whole thing ridiculous: to a lesser extent, the silly future-speak from the post-apocalyptic story repeatedly makes you laugh when it shouldn't, and doesn't make sense in the broader sense of the film: why then do people use modern vernacular in the 18th, 19th and 22nd centuries but not here? The real disaster on hand, though, is the gender and racial-bending casting.Effects makeup have come a long way in 130 years of cinematic history, especially when it comes to portraying the otherworldly, but we still haven't nailed many more natural things: aging makeup is still hit-and-miss (think of 'J. Edgar'...), so changing genders and races without finding yourself in the darkest corners of uncanny valley should be quite a challenge. Here it fails miserably: the pasty, waxworks-looking futuristic Asians played by Caucasian actors are unsettling enough, but undermining poor Doona Bae's performance by trying to pass her off as Caucasian on two counts really hurts. The many faces of Tom Hanks are a bit more playful, but things become downright ridiculous when 60 years are piled on D'Arcy and Hugo Weaving plays an old nurse, and manages to be less convincing as a woman than he was in drag-comedy Priscilla. It's an impossible-to-overcome distraction in what could have been a great film, and keeps you at arm's length from an often compelling story.In the end, I do recommend seeing this. For all its short-comings, it is never less than interesting, and even its failed experiments deserve to be experienced once. It's unlikely you'll see its like on this kind of budget anytime soon.",5,4,7,10 November 2013
Ran," Kurosawa Twilight
","Ran is the most melancholy epic ever made. Knowing the context in which it was made only adds to that sense, but is hardly indispensable. It is the last classic Japanese samurai epic of the 20th century, and the last great film by a filmmaker who overshadowed most of his contemporaries.Adapting Shakespeare's King Lear to Medieval Japan and changing daughters to sons, Ran opens with an aging warlord (Kurosawa regular Tatsuya Nakadai) dividing his power among his sons, only to watch them sulk away. Intending to spend his twilight years visiting each in turn, he instead witnesses the slow disintegration of everything he has created and a vicious fraternal war.The 70s were a very rough time for Kurosawa, with the debacle of his first color and independent picture, attempted suicide and very slow rehabilitation. In this time he made only the Russian Dersu Ouzala, a fine film, but one that stands apart from his other work. He also devised the story of Ran, an impossible-to-finance behemoth of a picture at a time when Japanese filmmaking was evolving towards smaller, nimbler, and safer ventures. As the prospect of ever making Ran grew ever fainter, he set his sights on a smaller film to serve as a dress-rehearsal of sorts: Kagemusha. It took foreign financing, courtesy of his first generation of successful fans - George Lucas and Francis Coppola - to get that made, to great international acclaim. It also helped Kurosawa rebuild his confidence and throw himself at Ran with countless paintings and years of preparation behind him.If you've never seen anything by Kurosawa, or, worse yet, if you've only seen his earlier masterpieces Seven Samurai and Yojimbo, Ran might cause a bit of a shock at first. Those other films were the work of a master in his prime, confident, playful and extremely dynamic. Ran is a much more static, fatalistic an poised film, the product not just of a decade of storyboarding, but of a grim sense of doom born from Kurosawa's experience and the play he chose as his inspiration. That said, never has the cruel indifference of fate been so artfully depicted on a screen.The battle scenes are few, but haunting in their grim relentlessness. With his endless flows of colorful, authentically-armored soldiers, Kurosawa paints war scenes that manage to be both incredibly convincing and otherworldly at the same time. It conveys a sense of being a ghost, forced to witness the last hours of a dying world, something no other film has managed before or since. You will marvel at the mastery on display, but your enjoyment will depend on whether you can overcome the near-crushing pessimism on display. I struggled with that at the very end, and consequently cannot rate this as highly as his other films I mentioned. Nevertheless, Ran deserves deserves every bit of praise thrown at it.Watch it and decide for yourself.",8,1,4,8 January 2003
Jackie Brown," Black Sheep of the Tarantino Herd
","Small-time gangster Ordell (Jackson) runs guns. He also has the nasty habit of using a legit bail bondsman (Forster) to haul any captured associates out of prison and kill them before they can talk. When hostess Jackie Brown (Grier) is arrested for smuggling Ordell's money into the US, she persuades Ordell to let use her to con the feds and smuggle his entire fortune under their noses, while deceiving the police into thinking she is helping them nail Ordell. But whose side is Jackie Brown really on? After his crowning success Pulp Fiction, Tarantino tones down the stylistic fireworks and adapts an Elmore Leonard novel. The slick double-crossing and elegant narrative is pure Leonard, but the dialogue and humor remain vintage Tarantino, and the union works wonders. After an opening shot that bodes ill by shamelessly copying 'The Graduate', and hints that this might be a mere blaxploitation revival, Tarantino plays things more subtly with a laid-back and elegant direction, comprised mostly of long takes and a fluid camera - courtesy of longtime Del Toro collaborator Guillermo Navarro - allowing us to focus on the actors and their ace performances. Robert Forster received most of the praise at the time of release for underacting to a tee, while Samuel L. Jackson's larger than life Ordell and Robert De Niro's half-wit convict Louis steal the showier moments. In truth, this is a group effort, and everybody delivers, from Pam Grier to Michael Keaton (in a role he reprized a year later in 'Out of Sight', also adapted from a Leonard novel).Jackie Brown was not fully appreciated when it first came out, and Tarantino sadly seems to have disavowed it to some extent, following it with the indulgent and pointless Kill Bill duo, before finding himself again with the more playful Deathproof. This might be less showy and hard-hitting than Reservoir Dogs, but it remains his most sensitive and mature film to date. One can only hope he will explore such territory again soon.",9,0,1,2 July 2007
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Best of the original Trilogy...
","It is 3 years after Episode IV and the Rebels are on the run from the Empire. Luke Skywalker explores his Jedi heritage only to be confronted with disturbing truths, Darth Vader continues his quest tom punish the Rebels, and Han and Leia are on the run. The galaxy has become a much darker, more dangerous place.After a traumatizing experience directing the first Star Wars film, series creator George Lucas vowed he would stay away from the camera this time, and crank up his degree of control. Because, while production had been misery, young George had negotiated the shrewdest deal in film history: exclusive rights on all Star Wars related content and derived products. When Star Wars became not just A hit but THE hit of the century, Mr Lucas held all the cards.While the subsequent creation of a prequel trilogy might taint the whole story in retrospect, one should admire George Lucas for opting to be as faithful to his story as possible, and for deploying unprecedented independent power to back his vision. So Lucas enlisted director Irvin Kershner as well as writers Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kadan and put them to work. Lucas kept his focus on overall production and the effects work, the complexity of which far exceeded anything attempted 3 years prior.The result, any Star Wars fan will concede, is not just the finest film in the series but one of the best sequels ever made. Much like the benchmark Godfather Part II, it builds on and deepens the themes of its predecessor while exploring new, unchartered territory. It also took many brave narrative risks, most of them ruined by the unnecessary prequels. it gave the characters new depth and resonance, along with some of the most memorable dialogue in a series not often noted for its language or performances.Watching the bad guys have their day can be a thrilling experience and, as the title implies, this is the Empire's film through and through. Vader is at his most enigmatic and evil, and John Williams already legendary score achieves new heights unrivaled since. This is everything you could possibly want from a sequel to the greatest space opera in existence.",10,0,0,20 September 2002
Sin City," Wanting...
","In a city of freaks and villains, three related stories (of revenge, redemption and love) unfold. A grizzled detective (Willis) saves the angelic child he saved long ago (now stripper Jessica Alba) from a savage killer (Stahl). A monstrous hunk of a man (Rourke) searches for the psycho who killed his lover. A rogue (Owen) takes on a corrupt cop (Del Toro). Each of these stories features elements unique to Miller's world of grotesque crime.Robert Rodriguez - not a director known for artistry of the intelligence of his output - opts for total fidelity to his source, in terms of story and visuals. Using deft combinations of masks and green-screen, he transposes Miller's palette of stark black and white, with the occasional color. This, though technically admirable, proves to be the source of the film's downfall.Visually, it comes across as nifty rather than great, mostly because the potential is never fully realized: a light posterization would have rendered things less jarring and more otherworldly, whereas here we have to deal with often painful to look at impossible light games. Artistically, the film comes across as irrelevant since it neither adds to Miller's world nor does it even vaguely complete with his original panels (movement, cinema's advantage over still pictures, is only once put to effective use: during a car crash.).In terms of story, we are very much in the comic world, but while quite inventive in its own right, the story is let down by its delivery. These lines do not work in a 3D environment. And the all-too-real elements make many scenes feel odd and uncomfortable rather than part of a coherent universe. Rodriguez also unfortunately opens his film with the strongest of the three stories (Rourke's) and ends with the weakest (the Willis/Alba tale).In terms of performance, the only thing to write home about (though with honorable mention) is the charismatic and obsessive work of Mickey Rourke. The rest of Rodriguez's impressive cast fails to register.The main problem in Sin City might not even be in the concept or in the cast (as Rourke proves on his own), but in Rodriguez's complete submission to Miller's rules. The greatest proof is the film's only truly inventive and enjoyable scene, directed by Quentin Tarantino. Truth be told, it sticks out like a sore thumb, the only one that marks a slight departure from the comic, making full use of the cinematic medium. This gives one a taste of what a real director might have done with Miller's creation. In general the film is also surprisingly uninspired story-wise, mainly driven by a succession of pretty pointless violence that carries no purpose, no subtext, and no emotional impact since  with only one possible exception  we care not one iota about these characters.That 'Sin City' managed to reach such popularity (even, at present, having settled in the higher end of IMDb's top 100) is a tribute to the greatness of Miller's comic. That does not detract from the fact that this is a poor, pointless and infuriatingly stale film adaptation.",5,3,6,23 June 2006
Gangs of New York," The Hands that Built America
","1840s. Natives and Irsih Americans fight to the death in New York, resulting in the death of Irish leader Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) and Native Bill The Butcher's (Daniel Day Lewis) undisputed rule of the city's criminal underworld. Vallon's son, Amsterdam (Di Caprio) escapes. and after growing into an anonymous young man, returns to reap his revenge, yet unwittingly becomes the butcher's protégé...Scorsese was bringing a long treasured project to the screen with Gangs, creating a hype that suffered from setbacks, delayed releases and mixed reviews. In hindsight what we have is no masterpiece, but it remains an undeniably good film, with many fine qualities to make up for its flaws.Scorsese's recreation of the city is stunning: the level of detail completely immerses the viewer into an atmosphere scarcely read of in History books. Moreover, the rich criminal world depicted here maintains a delicate balance of understandability and chaos. Scorsese couples this with his flair for music to create a truly intoxicating mood. The photography reinforces the overall effect tenfold, wonderfully sustained and carrying scattered sparks of pure genius. For example: in one shot, Scorsese pans from newly arrived immigrants who are welcomed, given the nationality, provided a uniform, and enlisted into the Union army to coffins of dead soldiers being unloaded on another peer.Ultimately, a film lives or dies by its screenplay and acting, and herein lies Gangs of New York's polarizing point. Whether you focus on the slightly uneven story (oddly shortened in places by pressured editing) or the fantastic performances will determine whether Gangs makes it or breaks it, but for its sheer visual power and acting it deserves to be seen. Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz, Brendan Gleeson and John C. Reilly are all a joy to see when on top form, but the true feast here is Daniel Day Lewis's grand-standing, violent and xenophobic Bill The Butcher. A role that Robert De Niro (for whom it was originally intended over the years) near his peak might not have done justice to.See it, make up your mind. The chances of this film becoming a favorite are slim, but at the very least you'll walk away with an indelible character to remember.",7,1,2,9 January 2007
Spectre," Nostalgiasploitation
","This is not Mary Poppins' secret spell, or a rare skin condition. It's a graceless blending of words describing the dominant trend in blockbuster filmmaking these days, and its effect is either a gleeful geek-out or 360 degree eye-rolling and fatigue. In this ocean of remakes and reboots we find ourselves adrift in, it was inevitable that Ian Fleming's 007 would be reborn for the 21st century. Reforged, remade, rebooted, not just continued, even though he had never really left, his longest hiatus being before the seminal Goldeneye. Casino Royale offered a return to basics after the lapses of the late Brosnan outings and the madness of Roger Moore's heyday. Timothy Dalton bond but with slightly less dour charm than that of Timothy Dalton, and even this last proposition is one you can debate at this stage.So after rebooting Bond with Casino, Bourning him with Quantum of Solace, and throwing Oscar-pedigree crews at him for Skyfall, what can SPECTRE do to charm us but plunder the back-catalog? The clue was in the title, which speaks volumes to fans of Connery-era Bond, but like many nostalgiaspoitation flicks of late, this Bond outing fails to be the many things it wants to be to many audiences. Is it a culmination of the overall narrative that began with Casino Royale? Is it a convoluted and loose remake of the Blofeld-Bond duel films of the late 60s? Or is it an attempt to create a Bond expanded universe that would have a rigid chronology, turning these into cumbersome interlinked episodes rather than discreet treats you could enjoy on their own merits? Or are we just mining the repertoire for nostalgia value? SPECTRE wants to be all of these things, stumbling more often than not, which is unfortunate because it is at its best when charting its own path, as shown by an ingenious pre-credits sequence. From the opening song, tune included, things dip dramatically, and never quite recover. Nods to the past tend to miss the point, as does a mean but pointless train fight, and a revelation about the key villain which is about as surprising as the Khan reveal from Star Trek Into Darkness. Christoph Waltz does what he can and rises above the material, but there is only so much even he can do. Otherwise Daniel Craig is pretty charmless - veering on the wrong side of rapey at one point - and the Bond girls barely register. Director Sam Mendes managed to get a lot right on his previous outing, but this is probably not one of the Bonds you'll care to revisit anytime soon.In an age of remakes and reboots - and with the returns of Star Wars and Alien just around the corner - it will suffice to sum this up as « inoffensively » bad. There is skill on display, and the odd idea or two, but we, the audience, deserve better.",5,2,5,15 December 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Dante's Inferno, Distilled and Spiked with Cocaine
","After a few deceptively fluffy and kid-friendly outings, George Miller returns to the Mad Max universe, 30 years after Mel Gibson turned in the keys to the tune of Tina Turner's 'We Don't Need Another Hero'. The question on everyone's mind before the first trailer unleashed an internet frenzy was, in this age of needless reboots, has Miller sold out or has he used this opportunity to finally realize his full vision for the famous saga?By now you will know that the latter is true, but you might not appreciate to what extent, and how little this implies that you are guaranteed to actually like the result. Miller hasn't just provided an update of Mad Max, or even a reboot. In fact this plays like just another episode in the wild life of his antihero, relegating back- story or origins to one or two short opening lines and brief flashes of past violence. It's also much more than a modernized take: it is early 21st century filmmaking taken to its furthest possible extreme.Since most blockbusters today are at least partially bathed in Michael Bay's patented orange/teal palette, Fury Road pushes that beyond its aesthetic limits, to quasi-fluorescent territory, creating the impression of a very violent Tex Avery cartoon, or at least one viewed while doing some serious drugs. Plot-wise, it doesn't get any more streamlined than this, or economical, and what you're left with is a hellish landscape populated by astonishingly inventive grotesques, conflicted heroes (our protagonist Max is arguably not THE hero of his own film) and a sustained action sequence.If this sounds like something you wouldn't enjoy, don't waste your time. If the trailer had you hyperventilating though, what awaits is pure nirvana. The action - most of it the result of practical effects and stunts - sets an unprecedented standard, as does the level of perverse originality in the baddies' physical and moral decrepitude: even in the hallowed company of other Mad Max entries, these are some weird freaks. Finally, the lead duo is pitch-perfect. Most of the attention has fallen on Charlize Theron's fearless Furiosa, but special mention should go to a very subdued Hardy, who beautifully anchors the film and gives it an almost calm, simmering center. Whether grumbling at sights of his stolen gear or fighting for his life in one of the meanest brawls in cinematic history, he makes us believe in this twisted universe, and feel the pain.This is a journey through hell, Dante's inferno without the sanctimoniousness: distilled to its essence and spiked with cocaine. A wilder ride you will not find this year, perhaps even this decade.",10,10,20,21 May 2015
Gladiator," A Comeback For the Ages
","People love a comeback. They might just be our favorite storytelling archetypes and contain the most relatable and inspirational narrative tropes: vulnerability, failure, trial, redemption and eventual triumph. Gladiator is an epic comeback in more ways than one.First, it is the story of a comeback: unfairly disgraced Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russel Crowe) is exiled by mad Emperor Commodus. Reduced to slavery, he earns his keep in the arena, and fights his way to the Colosseum in Rome, and to revenge. It is as streamlined as storytelling comes.Then, it marks the comeback of director Ridley Scott after a series of flops and artistically underwhelming pictures. It also sees the return of a genre confined to the dustbin of cinematic history since the failure of the bloated Fall of the Roman Empire over three decades prior (which incidentally also told the story of a general fighting a redeeming battle against mad emperor Commodus). How odd that a studio might pick a director best known for science fiction to tell what is on paper essentially the same story as that famous flop?Galvanized by techniques first deployed in Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, Scott chose to stick to a straightforward, almost very by-the-numbers script and immerse us in the arena. And immerse us he did. From the first shot to the last, Gladiator is a lean, mean, single-minded brute of a film, punctuated with quiet moments of tender beauty. The bloody fights in the arena eclipsed anything seen since, and the Rome depicted was intoxicatingly real, far removed from the stagy creations of old.Serendipity was, as it so often is, essential to this film's success: original star Antonio Banderas - the main reason the screenplay alludes to our gladiator as 'the Spaniard' - jumped ship, and paved the way for revelation du jour Russel Crowe, fresh from L.A. Confidential. While Banderas is a likable, charming lead, it is impossible to imagine anyone else but Crowe as Maximus: he fits the role and the story like a glove, hard as nails but also deeply wounded and at times even gentle. It earned Crowe not just an Academy Award but super-stardom. Luckily that was not enough to completely eclipse revealing turns from Djimon Hounsou and Joaquin Phoenix as the mad emperor, or first-rate work from departed veterans Richard Harris and Oliver Reed, the later particularly haunting as gladiator-trainer Proximo.Throughout, Scott's visual mastery speaks for itself, and his seasoned collaborators all produced some of the best work in their respective careers, from set designer Arthur Max to composers Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard, whose epic score truly did echo in eternity as the ad campaign promised.Gladiator is Hollywood at its best: old-fashioned storytelling executed in a vibrant and awe-inspiring way.",10,0,0,18 September 2002
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," What is it with trilogies?
","Since the late 80s, the common perception has been that there are two ways to make a trilogy (if you absolutely must): the continuity-based, 3 act Star Wars type, or the 'keep the main character, throw out the rest' Indiana Jones approach. Why Matrix and Pirates of the Caribbean chose to follow the former, I will never know, but that proved their undoing. Now Transformers follows that same path.Transformers I was simple, light fun. It seemed perfectly comfortable with the fact that it had giant robots based on a toy-line, and Spielberg's stamp counterbalanced Michael Bay's beautifully. Transformers II tried to be 'Empire Strikes Back' when it could have gone 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'. It deliberately ignored the fact hat we came for the giant robots, and to a lesser extent, Shia LaBouf's Sam Witwicky. And it didn't want to hear how little we cared about the military team or Megan Fox's plastic girlfriend.Along comes Transformers III, a case study in Michael Bay's strengths and flaws. When it allows itself to be silly or crazy-violent (collapsing buildings, Optimus slapping the crap out of something, John Malkovitch) it works, it really does. But when it tries to be a Homeric drama, it stumbles badly. There are changes, many of them improvements on the dismal and bloated 'Revenge of the Fallen': Megan Fox is replaced by another piece of plastic, less spunky but arguably more likable. People who accused part II of racial stereotyping will find less to hiss at. And there are no giant robot balls.The flaws are the same: the messy plot and bloated running time leave more room than they should to question some gaping plot holes: the 'cunning trap' allowed many effective moments to strike out at the autobots, and none were taken. The main villain's motivations only half make sense. And the historical revisionism is mostly pathetic, as is the omnipresence of flapping flags and Optimus delivering one too many sanctimonious speeches.So see it if you want to see the series to its probable ending. But see it with low expectations, and if your idea of good 3D is stuff lurching out the screen at you, you can skip the extra expense here.",4,5,15,30 June 2011
Alien: Covenant," Ridley Through The Looking Glass
","They told me it was bad, but I went anyway. It's hard for me judge Ridley's work objectively, you see: two of his early masterpieces traumatized me as a kid and had a lasting effect on me, so I'm prepared to forgive a lot, perhaps too much. Except now, after 30+ years, I think I finally understand him.Let's zoom out a bit. Ever since the first Alien sequel came out, Scott had been musing about what a sequel involving him might be about. Rather than continue Ripley's journey, he would rather investigate the Alien's origins, especially the colossal race briefly shown in 1979's Alien - in a massive, eerie set Fox almost had canned because it was pricey and did nothing to advance the plot. Think about it: had Fox had held a slightly tighter purse, there would be no Prometheus. Hardly a heart-breaking prospect for most people, myself included.Fast-forward three decades and Scott got his chance. The answers to the questions nobody really cared about - since when does answering questions help a horror film? - were more puzzling than thrilling, and while you can commend Prometheus for trying something different, it didn't always do so successfully, chiefly in terms of design. Beyond the stupidity of the one-dimensional crew and the confusion of Damon Lindelof's rewrites, one of the greatest disappointments came from changing the engineers from Gigerian nightmares into gigantic blue Jason Stathams.So Prometheus came and went. Ridley went from saying it wasn't an Alien film, to admitting it had Alien DNA. Audiences cried foul when they realized it totally was an Alien film but didn't feature the illustrious xenomorph. When the inevitable sequel came, it looked like audience feedback weighed heavily in pretty much every respect. You can be the judge of whether or not this turned out to be a good thing.Alien Covenant reads like a wish-list of disgruntled Prometheus viewers. It fits in everything you liked last time around - Fassbender's android especially - and adds all the things you thought were missing, like the xenomorph (or is it still a prototype?), some brutal killings and echoes of the original film galore.A new crew gets diverted by a rogue signal (ring a bell?) and discovers a terraformed world with weird idiosyncrasies. Before they can investigate bad things happen and synth human David (Fassbender) comes to the rescue. He is immediately fascinated with the crew's own android Walter (also Fassbender) and we see what he's been up to for the past ten years with engineer technology. Playing God on his lonesome, only a version of God that makes the Old Testament maniac come across as a choir boy...From the get-go, Covenant goes out of its way to draw parallel's to 1979's Alien. Yes the prologue is pure Prometheus (in the best sense) but, form the way the titles pop up to plot beats, down to reuse of Jerry Goldsmith's score and the rehashed final 25 minutes, this really plays on your sense of nostalgia. It's a pity because while a lot of the newer ideas are a bit silly if you think about them for too long, they are the best things about the film. Them and Michael Fassbender. If you wonder why I haven't mentioned anyone else in the cast, it is because they are interchangeable and forgettable, but Fassbender is just so fantastic and put to such great use that he barely just about redeems the situation.Quick aside on the music: the Alien saga is unique in the variety of its aesthetics, but it's worth adding that each film had its own distinct musical identity, with no effort ever made to carry over even the slightest theme. This has led to some fantastic music: from Goldsmith's understated eerie original to Horner's martial classic, all the way to my favorite, Godenthal's apocalyptic Gothic opera for Alien 3. Prometheus had a solid, inspiring theme as well, but still made no attempt to unify the saga. While it comes at the expense of creating anything new and memorable, it is commendable of Jed Kurzel to so successfully bridge the gap for a change.Not all is perfect of course, for every awe-inspiring moment - a ravaged forest of giant trees, David's necropolis and attempt to 'pet' a new alien, or his unleashing of deadly plagues - there is another of sigh-inducing stupidity: most of the crew's early decisions, a three-stooges-style alien VS rappelling proto-Ripley duel, or a twist you can see coming a mile away... and that shower scene alluded to in trailers is what you'd expect to see in Paul W. S. Anderson's Alien, down to its surprisingly inept execution.My expectations were low going into this, mainly because of word-of-mouth, but then I saw it, and suddenly everything made sense. You have to think of it this way: before it was a phenomenon, Alien was a B-movie. Yes it was the best-looking B-movie of all time, but a B-movie nonetheless. That is also, in a way, what Ridley Scott has always been: a hack with a golden eye, who makes the most heartbreakingly gorgeous B-movies you can feast your eyes on. If you go into Alien Covenant expecting that, you just might love it. I can't say I did, but it did adjust my appreciation for it.There are moments when it's a 1. Others (scarcer) where it could well be a 9 or 10. On the whole, I'll give it a 6.",6,2,10,31 May 2017
V for Vendetta," Orwell for the new century.
","In a near-future fascist England perpetually at war, a masked terrorist nicknamed V fights the government that made him, seeking to incite an uprising.After crumbling under the weight and pretentiousness of their later Matrix episodes, graphic novel fans Larry and Andy Wachowsky hand the reins of a long considered project to their former second unit director. McTeigue surprises pleasantly, showing himself more at ease than his mentors would have been with a very talky script. V is mostly about ideas and the words spoken in it are more inspiring/terrifying than the actions.V the character remains masked throughout the film, a detail that might disturb certain viewers, but is essential. This is so he can remain, in his eyes as in those of others, an idea rather than a mortal. Mortals die, ideas do not. Natalie Portman is quite generic, she could be anyone under the right circumstances, which is the whole point, to show that the seeds of submission and of rebellion exist within each of us. What is most chilling about 'V for Vendetta', however, is its depiction of a quite probable near future. Granted John Hurt's demagogue is a bit to Hitlerian to resemble any modern western leader, but the film doesn't shy away from parallels with what Aemrica, England or most of the West might become if pushed to far. The beauty of V is that rather than play to the crowds and just condemn cartoony villains, it blames the public that allows for these monsters to be created and turns a blind eye in return for the illusion of security.In these confused times, where the public is constantly being brainwashed by single-perspectives and rallies unquestioningly to the flag, 'V for Vendetta' is a very fitting update of George Orwell's message.That is manages to also be unique and hugely entertaining as a film is just another welcome bonus. The most intelligent blockbuster since... The Matrix.",8,1,3,6 September 2006
The Island," Brains + Michael Bay = ...
","Michael Bay is the wunderkind protégé of super producer Jerry Bruckheimer. His credits include films that amount to their pitch, dressed up in bombastic scores, pretty actors, explosions, melodrama, epileptic editing and enjoyable but undeniable silliness. For him to do a 'thinking film' (on paper) begs two questions: 'why?' and 'how?'.Why? Because Mr Bay is entitled to explore other things (or at least to want to). How? By a mix of sometimes obvious, sometimes original ideas. The story focuses on Lincoln Six Echo (McGregor) and Jordan Two Delta (Johansson), clones living in a secluded environment until they discover things are seriously wrong. The escape (I doubt anyone can consider this as a spoiler) and many chases occur, with an underlying theme of ethics and what it means to be human.The subject matter of cloning is addressed with its plethora of moral dilemmas, even though the condition of clones is never as degrading as it should be (if the clones' environment is Bay's version of hell, he must live a very protected life). It is also shrugged of pretty quickly to focus on a love story between pretty people (admittedly very pretty in this case). The choice of Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson for a blockbuster is welcome as they are each thoroughly enjoyable and watchable actors (and Bay enjoys making them look even better without crushing their acting). One part of McGregor's performance (a scene with his alter-ego) even evokes subtlety (I know this is a Michael Bay film but you read correctly). The action scenes are predictably quite good if occasionally grotesque (believing in our heroes' survival from a certain building fall demands serious suspension of disbelief) and one car chase is particularly grizzly.The problem is blatantly exposed in one DVD extra where Michael Bay says that he told the screenwriters to not dwell on the action scenes. He'd fill it in. Well it often feels that the whole film received this treatment. There is a lot of glossy Michael Bay and little serious thought on what are very contemporary issues. so the film disappoints for promising more than it is. It remains entertaining nonetheless for giving us its' two leads ruining from bullets and motorcycles, and for several nice little elements, such as Djimon Hounsou, a nice main theme in the music (typical of Michael Bay, let us admit) and that car chase...This good fun, but certainly not a 'thinking' film or message film. The only message to be found is this: let Michael Bay be Michael Bay.",7,0,0,8 April 2006
The Godfather," It's The Little Things...
","The Godfather casts a long shadow over every single film represented on IMDb, to a point that creates impossible expectations, and frequent accusations of 'overrated'. Let that very subjective criteria be measured against IMDb's very transparent ranking logic: average popularity. Much like the Oscars, the IMDb top 100 might not be ruled by your number 1 film, but by the film the greatest number of people ranked very highly. If you free The Godfather from this weighty title, it still deserves a 10 by any standard.Let's rewind, and consider the insanity it took, back in 1971, to even contemplate giving a relatively novice director free reign to adapt a vast crime saga, in a costly period setting, and starring an 'ethnic' nobody and a faded has-been. The Godfather is first and foremost a triumph of screen writing, Coppola's original forte, but the fine structure, character moments and dialogue could have been tarnished by a by-the- numbers treatment, and this where the film leaps from good to great.What makes The Godfather one of the finest films ever made is how right all the individual pieces are, and how well they work in unison: the performances, all of them rich and credible, from Pacino's star-making turn to Brando's classic creation; the world of the story, rich and murky, in perfect service of the story; the look, courtesy of groundbreaking work from ace cinematographer Gordon Willis... But dig deeper and it's the small touches Coppola meticulously peppered his film with that make it unforgettable, be it a touching death in an orange grove, or hit men debating the perfect gnocchi recipe.Ultimately, its rewards are double what you'd expect, because, by most accounts (though I still prefer this one), Part II is even better.Unmissable!",10,1,4,3 June 2006
