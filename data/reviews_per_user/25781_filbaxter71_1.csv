Requiem for a Dream," How did I miss this?
","I watched 'Once upon time in America' the other night & was intrigued to see was the young actress Jennifer connelly had gone on to do.
This took me to this, a movie I had heard of but never watched & knew nothing about.
I am so glad I watched this! It is not an easy watch but it is a film made with passion...enough people are writing about the plot etc so will leave that to them.
The acting is a joy to watch I can't think of any weak performances. This is for people who enjoy film as an art rather than JUST entertainment.
