Catch Me If You Can," Our point of view...from Mona Lisa @ London
",We enjoyed so much this film but not the end too.. We would like that Frank will continue to cheat everyone and he will continue to work as a lot of other work.. We 'd like to know what's happened to Brenda because after Frank left her at the Miami Airport we didn't have any information about her..Is she alive?? We think Carl had a special feeling for Frank and he would like to catch him only for his personal aim. But anyway was a great movie about the 60's and very realistic too. We think the worst character in the film is Frank's mother.. because she wanna only 'catch' the richest men of the Rotary Club to have a lot of money to enjoy herself!! This is our comment!
