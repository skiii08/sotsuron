Ghost," Million buck movie, don't miss it.
","This. Is. The Best. Movie ever!!! I don't have a favorite movie (so many, how to choose) but this would probably be it. It has sci-fi, suspense, horror, action, drama, romance, sex, comedy, every thing. You're cringing, then crying, then laughing your butt off. Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore play two lovers torn apart by death, seriously making you cry. While Patrick and Whoopi banter and argue to make the funniest scenes. You have your bad guys, the slimy and the scary, but yauaugh, the ending is a bit gross- be warned. But still, you cannot miss this movie, it is sooo gooood. The ending is a big tear bringer, with the saddest song and the even sadder goodbye... I've watched parts of the movie so many times. It's a winner.",10,4,6,30 December 2004
The Birds," Don't bother if you value your sanity
","Alfred Hitchcock: depending on you, you will either love him or hate him with all your guts. If you like barf-causing horror and suspense to render your limbs into jelly, as well as a un-foreseeable twist, then this is your movie. It is appreciatable, no matter what. But if you are a person who appreciates movies that make you roar with laughter and recall it the next night with a smile, you will HATE this movie. It will render you to a trembling mass of nerves, and leave you fuming with outrage at the end. If you appreciate suspense, mystery, twists and a movie that will keep your eyes glued to the screen, you could not find a movie to beat The Birds. Otherwise, leave it well alone.",9,0,7,10 January 2005
