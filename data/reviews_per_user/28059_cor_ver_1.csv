First Man," Disappointing!...
","I love space movies...
I still remember after many years how much I enjoyed 'Apollo 13' and a little less 'Gravity'...
After watching 'First man' I felt disappointed...
Next time get Tom Hanks, Alfonso CuarÃ³n or Ron Howard and the 'Chivo' Luvensky when making a film like this...
Right now I'll watch 'Apollo 13' againAgustin Ros",4,3,4,17 March 2019
