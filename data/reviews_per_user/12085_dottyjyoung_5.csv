Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," What a relief! The trailers lied--it was awesome. :)
","We just got back from the earliest showing we could get a sitter for. I can say with confidence that my fears about this movie were totally unfounded, and I now hold Guy Ritchie and these writers in the highest regard. Without going into spoilers, here are the three concerns that were put entirely to rest: 1) After seeing the trailer, my biggest worry was the use of 'bullet-time' type photography during a Victorian-era movie. I thought it would be completely anachronistic and pointless. However, they'd already established in this movie and the previous one that Holmes is hyper-aware of his surroundings. The bullet-time was used to convey how traumatic a couple of scenes were to someone with that type of awareness, and it worked beautifully.2) Jared Harris looked so vanilla and soft in the promo pics and trailers that I couldn't imagine him as a fearsome adversary for Holmes. However, his Moriarty is so devious and cunning, and at one time downright sadistic, that I don't think they could have made a better choice. A couple of times I felt like he was channeling his father (the outstanding Richard Harris) without the warmth and empathy that the late actor conveyed. Can you imagine Richard Harris as a cunning, calculating perfectionist that's totally devoid of concern for human life? You won't have to after watching his son. It's freaky. And he sings.3) Holmes' relationship with Watson (and in a small way, Irene Adler) is fantastically developed. Saying any more than that would be too spoilery.So, watching this w/ my husband(who is a die-hard Sherlock fan, and used to read Sherlock Holmes aloud to me every rainy night, complete w/ voices) was a fabulous experience. We can't wait to see it again, and own it.",9,230,337,16 December 2011
Spider-Man 3," It wasn't half bad.....
","Just a little under half, actually........So everyone agrees that there were too many story lines, no adequate development for *any* of the stories, that Venom got the short end of thestick on screen time, that Peter Parker could have spent 50% less time looking like a GQ-wanna-be, and that Bryce Dallas Howard's character (what was her name again?) got no character development.Since we all agree on that, I'm going to (gasp!) point out a few of its strong points. If these points had been given time to grow, this could havebeen the most powerful of all three. Unfortunately for all of us, they were not, but my hope is to encourage people reading this to grow as writers.For starters, there IS something beyond the 'happily ever after' ending of most love stories---there's the conflict of learning how to be together! I was thrilled to see Peter Parker and MJ dealing with the age-old 'I don't want you to fix my problem, I just want you to listen and be there for me' issue. I loved the (little bit of) wisdom that aunt Mae tried to share with Peter--you have to put your wife/husband before yourself. Both MJ and Spidey were completely self-absorbed and not ready to get married. (MJ was wrapped up in her problems, Spidey in his success.) This was a beautiful gem that could have been polished more.My husband and I nearly fell out of our seats when we saw the redemption of Harry, and the forgiveness of Flint. It's wonderful to see a movie where people are not locked into an ever-deepening pit of despair. (I still want to take a shower every time I *think* about the movie The Prestige) People do have a choice---my mistakes in life are not all my parents' fault, society's fault, or even God's fault. They're MY mistakes. I can choose to wallow in my misery, or forgive and move on. It was wonderful to see both Harry and Spiderman choose to forgive. I wish for the life of me that we had seen more of the conflict with Harry. Their opening fight scene was the best in the trilogy, and James Franco proved to be an incredibly versatile and subtle actor.And who didn't cheer when Stan Lee showed up for a cameo? :) So, it's worth going to see again----at the dollar theater. :)",6,0,0,12 May 2007
The Dark Knight," An excellent movie in every way...except the one way that mattered.
","Looking over this movie piece by piece, anyone could say it was excellent.The acting was phenomenal. Heath Ledger deserves every accolade that's heaped on him by fans and reviewers alike.The dialogue was sharp, relevant, and paced well.The action was mind-boggling, but not so over-the-top that you were taken out of the story. That is an excellent, and incredibly difficult, balance to achieve.The directing and camera work was outstanding.The music was great.Even the makeup and costuming deserves a nod, especially for the fascinating re-design of the classic 'Joker' look. And I loved the new batsuit. (Nestor Carbonell was wearing eyeliner--was that a shout-out to LOST fans? :) ) All-in-all, it was a superbly *crafted* piece of art.****But I will never, ever watch it again. Why?***** Well, let's put the shoe on a different foot and see how it fits. What if the story of 'Lord of the Rings' was told this way? What if, after their long, arduous journey, Sam decides that *he* wants the ring, kills Gollum to get it, then Frodo has to throw Sam into the pit of Mount Doom to destroy the ring...but destroying the ring doesn't really rid Middle Earth of Sauron, and Frodo spends the rest of his (short) life in disgrace, and dies of a broken heart? What would we say after we left the theater? 'Why the hell did I just sit through that movie? What was the point?' Or what if Harry Potter was told this way? After 7 books and 17 years, what if it ended with Hermione being tortured to death, Ron blaming Harry and becoming a Death-Eater, Harry refusing to kill Voldemort out of respect for all living things, and the entire wizarding world blaming Harry for Hermione's death? What would we say after putting down book 7? 'Why the hell did I just read all those books? What was the point?' The Dark Knight's over-arching theme was, 'You either die the hero, or live long enough to watch yourself become the villain.' The story that this movie tells is simply this: no matter how hard you try to fight evil, evil will take everything from you, and the world will be no better off for your sacrifice. If you stand against evil, here's what you'll get. Maniacs with no motives, misguided moralists, or simply 'blind chance' will take the people you love, break your body, destroy your mind, and leave you with nothing in return. And as the Joker unflinchingly tells Batman, insanity is just a little 'push' away.Oh, great.Does it surprise anyone that Heath Ledger had anxiety attacks and insomnia after immersing himself in this script? The creators of this movie used an immense amount of story-telling talent to create a film that tears hope away from the soul. Why? What's the point? What a waste of time, creativity, and resources! What a waste of a good story! What a waste of spirit!",1,50,166,21 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!
","I've just finished watching all 5 of the HP movies back-to-back.....with my husband, who has not read the books.For the entire first 4 movies, I had to provide a running commentary for him to understand what was actually happening on the screen. 'Oh, Sirus, James (Harry's dad), Lupin and Pettigrew were all close friends. They actually wrote the marauder's map--that's how Lupin knew how to use it.' We couldn't get through 10 minutes of ANY of the movies without that! However, for 'Phoenix,' the screenwriter did something amazingly intelligent---he let the film stand on its own! He TRANSLATED the book to the screen, instead of just trying to film chunks of the book exactly as they were written. Every time I thought I would have to explain something to my husband, the brilliant screenwriter did it for me. And he did it naturally, in the proper context. Nothing seemed forced or contrived.I have to give a major 'THANK YOU' to the director as well. The previous four movies were almost exercises in special effects. In #2, for example, it was, 'Ooooh, let's see how scary we can make a Basilisk look!' But, they left out Ginny Weasley's ENTIRE STORY--- until she was brought in at the end, like a lousy Deus Ex Machina contraption. 'Phoenix' actually focused (gasp!) on the STORY, and the effects were there to enhance it. The director is a master of visual story-telling. We could feel the love Sirius had for Harry in the first glance from Gary Oldman's amazing eyes. We felt slimy every time Umbridge walked into a room. We were SHOWN what was happening, not told the plot in these stupid little summary/exposition dialogs by the characters (which dominated the previous four movies).The actors have grown by leaps and bounds. (thanks again to the director?) Everyone wants to whine about how much worse Michael Gambon was as Dumbledore, compared to Richard Harris. Well, with the crappy lines he was given (especially in #3) he didn't have much of a chance. But he shines in the hands of a competent writer and director. Daniel Radcliffe's range has expanded exponentially (he was amazing in Sirius' death scene) and Matthew Lewis took Neville Longbottom from gangly nerd to budding hero.I just read that the same screenwriter from the first four movies (Steve Kloves) is being brought back for 'The Half-Blood Prince.' Please, please, sack him and bring back Michael Goldenberg for the final installment. The man knows how to write. Steve Kloves has shown that he knows very little about adapting these books to the screen.Thank you, thank you, thank you, David Yates and Michael Goldenberg, for bringing such a fantastic story to the screen.",8,0,1,4 March 2008
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Maybe the adultery in the midst of a movie on MARRIAGE had something to do with how pitiful this movie was
","I love to read a good novelization of a movie. When the Mr. & Mrs. Smith novel came out, I thought, 'Hey, I'll read the first page to see if this could be any good!' I ended up buying the book. :) It was a GREAT picture of how honesty in marriage, throwing aside all pretenses and expectations, and accepting the other for exactly who they are, is the real path to true marital bliss.So why was the movie so awful? Angelina Jolie had to have given her worst performance ever. She was as stiff as a wax doll. Brad Pitt wasn't much better. There was no chemistry between them until GUNS came out. Whoop-de-do.Call me crazy, but could it POSSIBLY be because they were having an extra-marital affair in the midst of a movie on marriage? (Sorry folks, real life does influence your art.) I also have to lay some of the blame on the director. If their hearts are really being torn apart by this, and they're covering their emotions with trained coldness, you HAVE to show the audience that. Give us a glimpse of their soul with the camera! The novelization was very well-written. If you want to know what the story is really about, go buy the book.",1,3,6,4 April 2007
