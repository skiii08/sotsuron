Conquest 1453," quite good
","The movie is quite good when we think of action scenes, music, filming techniques. The voices of the characters are effective, the visual effects are good. People show great interest in the film, because they have been waiting to see some historical films. As this movie is the most expensive production for the Turkish movie, it drew interest. To criticize I just can say that the attitude of Sultan Mehmet the Conquerer is not like I waited. The real Faith was a modest and religious person as far as I know. Some scenes show him as an immodest Sultan. Also after the conquest Sultan Mehmet the Conquerer enters the Hagia Sophia and prays there. This scene is not filmed.",9,9,32,27 March 2012
