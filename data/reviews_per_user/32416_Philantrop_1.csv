The Blair Witch Project," This 'movie' is definitely the worst I've ever seen...
","... and I have a habit of watching bad movies when I can't sleep at night. So I consider myself an expert for the few, select worst movies ever. And BWP tops them all. (Spoiler begins here)Three idiots stumble through a wood that wouldn't hardly even qualify as one in Europe. They argue and swear (I don't feel offended by strong words but this was simply swearing for its own sake) and the only reason they kind of break down is that they obviously can't stand each other. And I can't blame them. Any sane person would hate each of them. They reach some house, one of them stands in a corner (oh horror!) and that's it.(Spoiler ends here)In short: Don't watch this. BWP is the *real* 'Ring' tape - it's just quicker, it takes only 86 minutes to kill you by boredom.If you're in need of entertainment, better read the other negative comments here. They are way more entertaining than the movie itself.",1,2,4,20 May 2005
