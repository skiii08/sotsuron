Blade Runner 2049," Boring and Self Indulgent
",On its own it's bad. Compared to the original Blade Runner it's awful.Set design and special effects are decent. Acting is fine given the script and direction.The best part of watching this boring mess was knowing i had a fast forward button. I cant imagine being in a theatre for this.,3,9,17,4 May 2019
Unknown," Great Action Thriller
","I just watched this for a second time. Great story line, good backdrop location (Berlin), and solid acting. I was particularly drawn to the relatively minor role of Ernst Jurgen played to chilling effect by Bruno Ganz. 
If you like the Action Thriller genre i can't imagine you'd be disappointed with this underrated gem.
At the time of writing this review the rating is 6.9 but i gave it a 9.",9,1,1,8 February 2018
The King," Very good movie
","Many reviewers have complained about the historical inaccuracies of this film. That's a legitimate criticism, but i am watching and judging this movie independent of the historical constraints. If you want to see a movie about the details of King Henry V's ascension to the throne of England and the battle of Agincourt, you may be better served by a documentary.The King is a well written, well directed, well produced, well acted and thoroughly engaging film that i think should be judged on its own merits.Joel Edgerton co-wrote and also starred as the superbly likable Falstaff. Quite an accomplishment.The transition of Hal from drunken lech to wise and unflappable King Henry was probably a bit fast, but it hardly detracts from the credibility of the character or the plot line. A testament probably to both the writing and to the strong performance of Timothee Chalamet.I even found myself liking Robert Pattinson who played the obnoxious Dauphin.Sean Harris is a unique character actor who rarely disappoints and his portrayal as William is riveting.The King has a high level of quality violence but not in major quantity and certainly not used in such a way to dominate the entertainment value of the film.If this ensemble of writers/director/actors/producers decide to collaborate again, i'll be lining up to experience the result.",9,2,4,29 November 2019
Spectre," Classic Bond
","At the time of writing this the film has a 6.8 rating on this site and i don't know why it's not higher.This is classic Bond - lots of action, over the top gadgets and an over the top story line.Daniel Craig plays Bond to perfection - he can be a gritty street fighter but cleans up good in a tuxedo.I'm normally not a fan of Waltz - i find his characters chronically predictable and annoying, but he does well as the villain in this film.If you like Bond films i can't see why you wouldn't like Spectre.",9,0,0,5 May 2019
