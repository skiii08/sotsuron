Child 44," This is embarrassing
","I hope that no Russians actually see this garbage because most of smart American's know that this is typical Russophobe propaganda. Stereotypes being perpetuated as if it was 1981. Do we really need to resort to the usual anti-Russian propaganda? For once can we tell a story about another country without going over the top to make them look bad in an effort to make the US look better? No one is saying Stalin was a great man, but this is over the top. It does not snow year around in Russia. And shame on the fake reviews giving this film 10 stars just because you think anyone slamming this film is some sort of troll. You are the troll. I get it, you hate Russia. Congrats on buying the propaganda our government sold you. Anyway, to the film: Feeble Script. Bland Direction, inaccurate, you get the idea.",1,110,230,17 April 2015
I'm Not There," Worst film i've seen in a very long time
","This movie was nothing short of TERRIBLE. I stopped watching around the 60 minute mark. I had high hopes for this since i'm a Dylan fan. I did enjoy the music but I'm a bit shocked at the elitist remarks made by people. Those offended that some of us think this movie is terrible, all due to their blind loyalty. I'm a huge Robert Smith fan, but i'm not so blind as to call everything he's done genius or perfect. Wow, get off your high horses Dylan fans, the movie was garbage. Some of the individual performances are very good. IE-Cate Blanchett, but this potpouri of ideas and scenes left me yawning. As it turns out, I am not alone. It takes a blind loyalist to like this movie, because I can't fathom anyone with decent taste liking this movie.",1,25,42,13 May 2008
