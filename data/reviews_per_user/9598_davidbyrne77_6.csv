Vertigo," Haunting masterpiece
","Let's get one thing straight right off the top:  This is one of the best films ever made (as if you haven't heard that enough reading these reviews). With that said, I'll say this.  I studied this film extensively in University, and I analyzed it in terms of gender/sexual power relations. There are, of course, some kinky elements to James Stewarts's obsession in this film.  What most people don't realize, is just how much that obsession is made explicit in the film, without the audience realizing. The more Scottie falls in love with (and becomes obsessed with) Madeleine, the more the real world falls away.  Literally, people start to dissapear. In the beginning, when Scottie is hired to follow her, she is seem with people (in traffic, in a flower shop).  As she becomes more and more the focus of Scottie's infatuation, the crowds of people thin out and dissapear altogether.  The museum of Art more closely resembles a tomb, as only Madeleine's and Scotties car are parked out front.  No one walks the halls of the gallery excepts Scottie, and a curator that Scottie summons for information (who only becpmes present because Scottie wants him to be there for that moment).  At San Fransisco Bay, in the shadow of the Golden Gate Bridge, it is just Scottie and Madeleine.  The colonial town up the coast where Madeleine takes her plunge is more of a ghost town, as there are no tourists, not a person in sight.  Just the two of them. In the redwood forest.  The two of them alone. It is too much of a stretch to assume that everyone in San Fransisco decided not to leave their homes that day. The brilliance of Alfred Hitchcock's directing is that he makes the camera see what Scottie sees.  He's tuning out and ignoring the other people around him, so he just sees Madeleine.  Thus, the camera only sees Madeleine, and no one else.  Thus, the city and the coast is left just to the two of them. Like Adam and Eve, only a tale of tragedy.  This 'fixation' of both the camera and the character is what gives the film its mysterious and dreamlike quality.  In a way, it's because Scottie is bewildered by Madeleine's mysterious manner, her dream-like qualities (her dream-girl qualities) that makes this film more than just a ghost story, more than a mystery or a thriller.  It's much more personal than a normal movie, and it is because the camera has become a character.  And that, my friends, is hard to pull off.  Which is why I hold Alfred Hitchcock so highly, and which is why you should give this film a second look, if you already haven't seen it once.",Null,8,13,16 January 2004
The Passion of Joan of Arc," The Last Epic Silent Film
","I was told in class that this film was to be made with synchronous sound, but the technology was slow to reach France in time, so it was released as a silent film instead.  Which doesn't matter, because it is already one of the most powerfully emotional films ever made, sound or no sound.  I was really blown away, not just with the acting (which is amazing) but with the trick camera work.  The surreal low angles that are used make the necessary characters imposing and threatening, and the scene that has the camera swinging away from the building is jaw dropping!The climax of the film is searing!(pardon the bad pun)  The trial and Joan's heartfelt testimony build suspense that will have you on the edge of your seat, and her punishment is a testament to pre-production code censorship. Very graphic, I was surprised.  This truly is one of the best silent films ever made.  By far the most powerful. Don't be scared of the age of the film - some stories stand the test of time better than others, and this one certainly is a benchmark.  Enjoy it.",Null,3,7,27 April 2004
Psycho," The best, bar none
","If you're reading this, chances are you've seen the film - so there is little point describing the plot.  Okay.  Why do I keep revisiting this film, and why do I hold it to such a high regard?  Two words - acting and directing.  If this is the first 'real' horror movie, or the first slasher film, it is the best because it doesn't fall into the traps associated with later (and cheesier) horror films.  For one, all of the characters are 'real' and intelligent.  Sure, Norman Bates is weird, and Marion Crane is scared of him, but she's also sympathetic to his plight.  It isn't like he's waving around butcher knives and she says, 'Hmm, well, I think I'll go take a shower now!'  The conversation in Norman's parlour ends on a pleasant note (after having navigated through some very dark material) and she leaves to go prepare for bed - she couldn't have suspected what was about to happen or the audience would have suspected it too - the killing wouldn't have been a shock at all. Another thing about these 'real' characters.  Arbogast starts out hard-boiled, but his conversatin with Norman in the motel office seems so real to the point where I suspect that the dialogue was ad-libbed.  But of course Hitchcock wouldn't have allowed that.  But the dialogue doesn't sound scripted at all.  It's all in the delivery - very effective, we get to see that Arbogast is very good at his job - not an amateur at all.  When Sam and Lila go to the motel to do their own investigation, there is inspired dialogue that you wouldn't hear in a conventional horror film.  For one thing, when they enter the bathroom, the scene of the earlier carnage, Sam matter-of-factly remarks 'there's no shower curtain'.  It's just a coment, and neither character dwells on this miniscule of details - how could they have guessed that it was used to wrap Marion's body with before she was dumped in her car trunk?  As well, when Sam decides to occupy Norman while Lila searches the house, he says 'If you find anything, anything at all, don't stop to tell me'.  See?  Again, this wouldn't have occurred in a regular movie. The characters are intelligent and think out their actions before they act on them.  And while Lila is put in the position of choosing to either run out the back door of Norman's house or down the flight of stairs and into the basement, she chooses the stairs (famous horror movie mistake) not because she is stupid, but because she is curious and wants nothing else but to find out what happened to her sister. It's one thing to have a main character massacred halfway through the film, but it's a much different movie that show's the intricate clean up of the crime scene - the mopping up of the blood, the wiping of the floor, walls and bathtub, the careful disposal of the body, etc, etc.  While the murder last for less than 30 seconds, the clean up goes on for 10 minutes, and makes the scene far, FAR more disturbing.  Watching dutiful Norman clean up his 'Mother's' mess, looking at the blood on his hands, smiling happily as the car sinks below the surface of his backyard swamp...well, it reaches a level of 'disturbing' that most movies hope to achieve but never reach. And the last line:  'Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly....'  Enough said.",10,1,2,17 June 2004
All Quiet on the Western Front," Haunting ending
","Easily one of the most gripping, realistic interpretations of the horror of modern combat.  Also a rarity, an American anti-war film told by German soldiers.  While some of the dialogue is bad, and mixed with early-sound film distortion, the graphic and vivid scenes really bring out the horror and make you feel sympathy for all involved.  I desperately wish to find a cleaned-up DVD copy of this film that will due it justice.  Some of the dialogue, mind you, is inspired, and stands the test of time - Soldiers mulling over just how a war starts ('One country offends another country'...'How can a mountain in Germany offend a field in England?')(Spoilers within) The scenes in this film are some of the most famous in movie history - a machine gun's view of the carnage, indescriminitely mowing down hundreds and hundreds of soldiers who drop dead six feet in front of the camera, soldiers ceasing to exist after a shell hit (all that remains, in one case, are the soldier's hands, clutching a strand of barbed wire). The battlefields are miles of muddy, shell-cratered wasteland, the soldiers too numerous to count.  The ending is definitely one of the top 3 movie endings of all time in terms of emotional power.  The main character reaches for a butterfly that lands near him, the only object of beauty he's seen in a long while.  When he leaves his cover to reach the butterfly a sniper takes careful aim and fires.  The hand goes limp.  Cut to a line of young, scared recruits marching off to war, randomly turning a fearful face to the camera, set against an endless backdrop of crosses stretching across the mud to the horizon.",Null,1,3,5 January 2004
The Truman Show," A modern-day nightmare/fable
","Director Peter Weir is no stranger to challenging subject matter (Gallipoli, Fearless), as well as the surreal (Picnic At Hanging Rock), but this film is far more daring than those earlier films.  Unfortunately marketed as a comedy, I was more intrigued with the film's dramatic elements and wish that this film was made without the general moviegoing audience in mind.   While it works as both a comedy and drama, the subject matter is so Twilight Zone-ish and totalitarian that it could easily be turned into a much darker film.  But who knows if that would be better?There are great moments in this film.  Example, Truman's 'Who the hell are you talking to?' as his wife drones on and on to an invisible audience about the wonders of a Nicaraguan coffee.  Ed Harris' final line sums up the whole TV mentality 'say something, goddam it, you're on television!'  This is one of endings that draws tears no matter how many times you've seen it, just because of Jim Carrey's brilliant portrayal of a man who realizes that his entire world has been a fabrication.  Seeing him banging his fist against his life's 'wall' rivals anything from any other fantasy films, 'Brazil' included",Null,0,0,26 April 2004
Donnie Darko," Impenetrable!
","This is one of those 'thinker' films that puzzle you for days after watching.  For the first half of the film I just assumed (like his psychiatrist) that Donnie was schitzophrenic (example - the film 'Repulsion'), but that was not the case.  All that I can figure is that the jet engine from the beginning was from his family's plane at the end - one of those wormholes he talked obsessively about - and that by going back in time (28 days) to die he saved himself from a terrible life, or possible saved the life of his family, I don't know - I'd really like to hear what the director had to say about this.  Maybe it's too impenetrable for its own good.  However, great acting from all involved - nothing over-the-top, Donnie was human, and I especially enjoyed the unflappable character of his mother.  I wonder if there is only one right way to interpret this film, or if it is supposed to mean different things for different people?",Null,0,0,8 March 2004
