The Ring," I still don't get it.
","First, I'm a big fan of Naomi Watts. So much so that I'm giving the 4 stars to her. As fas as the story's concerned I just don't get. It's convoluted. Very. Lots of stuff happens both in the present and the past but nothing that happens has anything to do with HOW something inexplicable kicks off the movie (and then occurs again). It's like saying, 'Mr. Smith can suddenly fly. He doesn't know why but ... he can.' Now we're going to tell you some stories about goblins and ghouls. They have nothing to do with Mr. Smith's surprising talent, but they're interesting on their own. And then ... it's done.Sorry. I want more out of a film. No it does not have to be tied up in a neat package but please, give me something.",4,0,1,30 September 2019
Hereditary," The critics are simply wrong
","The critics are simply wrong about Hereditary. It does not work. The audience with whom I saw the film today was laughing at what were supposed to be the most dramatic scenes. And they were correct to laugh. It is the dialogue. It is as though the screenwriters composed a 'first draft' and then inexplicably decided that it was 'good enough'. Worse still is the fact that the film is overlong by at least 30 minutes, the entire middle of the film is truly sleep inducing. The acting? It's fine. Fine for what the actors had to work with. T. Collette and Gabriel Byrne as the family's parents deserve far better. Truth is, the only reason I stayed with the film (three times I was tempted to leave) is that the professional reviewers praised it so highly I thought ... it's got to get better. It doesn't. Rent 'The Exorcist'. Rent 'Rosemary's Baby'. You'll be better off.",3,6,14,12 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Not Great. Not even good.
","Not Great. Not even good.So then, Why the 4 stars?Call me sentimental. Accuse me of liking the music, of feeling roused by the way the opening titles and storyline still disappear into the galaxy. Say that I enjoyed seeing Harrison Ford (again) and was curious about how they'd 'animate' Princess Leia. All of which is true.But more important, I liked the 'big reveal'. The 'who are Rey's parents?' And grandparents? This is and has always been a family-drama and in this final episode that string of family revelations continues. And continues with a reveal which (1) I never could have guessed and (2) raised the question, Anatomically, how did they do it?Beside that, not much. The same chases, the same bar-rooms with non-human drinkers, the same warships and fighters and upside-down fighters and more and more and more of the same. You can miss the first 90minutes or so and miss nothing.You'll likely see it, regardless of what I say.
So enjoy it.
At least, try.",4,7,14,23 December 2019
Get Out," I Wanted Stronger more Subtle Dialogue
","I wanted to love this. The earliest reviews alluded to certain subtleties of dialogue that would make me both laugh and twinge. Instead I found the film dull, lifeless. The fact that the main characters are political liberals tends to serve no real end. I was hoping that liberal values would pervade the film and slowly ever so slowly lead he main characters down a deadly path. But no. The strangeness of the characters is a dead giveaway early on and the willingness of the hero to subject himself to their whims seems altogether false. Without giving anything away there are two shocking moments in the film at which time the audience (a) gasps and (b) applauded. I must admit that I did join them.",3,11,30,3 March 2017
Schindler's List," Better with age
","There's not much to say about this film that hasn't already been said.So I'll just add that this film actually got better with age. It's some 20 years since I last saw it and I'd forgotten much of it. My memory (faulty) had 'the list' playing a more prominent role in the film (from a screen-time standpoint). And while the list is the vehicle to the film's denouement, it is the film's ability to get us into the Krakow Ghetto, to get us standing beside and inside the atrocities, that makes the film a masterpiece. TThink of a documentary, think of how moved you are by the recitation and depiction of the facts of the Holocaust. Then add to that the fictive characters' lives that underscore each of the film's scenes and well, you're beyond moved.One can quibble with the final cemetery scene.
And, in fact, I did when I first saw it.
But not this time.",10,9,18,28 November 2016
Silence," A good film, a great story
","Silence is not a film you enjoy. It is however a film that grabbed me from the outset and did not let go. For me the film was simply OK; Scorcese has done a great deal better. Missing for me was a sense of where the main characters were (yes, it was Japan) with regard to the rest of the country. The film had a look of a film with too low a budget to really project time and especially place. That said, the questions raised by the film are questions about the existence of God which I have heard raised many times before. The difference in Silence is that there are actual answers. Not necessarily answers with which I agree. But answers well-enough presented for me to understand how the characters were as enthralled in the Church, in their beliefs, as they were. In short this film gave me a lot to think over. Which is good.",8,0,1,21 February 2017
Joker," A downward spiral that grips your attention and does not let go.
","Todd Phillip's Joker does not possess the dramatic arc of most films. The arc during which things grow worse and worse until one day something happens following which the situations improve. In fact anyone who knows anything about the Batman Joker character is already aware that a happy ending here would be impossible. This is, after all, a prequel to all future Batman encounters with the villainous Joker.I liked this film a great deal. I was thoroughly absorbed. I found Jaoquin Phoenix's portrayal of Arthur Fleck to be as riveting as any I've seen on film. He evokes fear (of his character), he evokes sadness (for his character), he evokes joy (within his character). The site of him in Joker get-up, dancing down a long flight of steps, dancing lightly down a long flight of steps, just one of many examples of the actor's range, his talent, his absolute possession of the screen. It can be said that the viewer of this film might very well find himself / herself rooting for the villainous Arthur as he descends further into his villainous madness In fact there were reviewers who thought this reason enough to pan the film, to see it as 'dangerous', to see it as a political statement to be avoided. Nonsense. Absolute nonsense. There are factors which contribute to Arthur Fleck's fate. Some genetic. Others, not. Much like all of us. And I found it fascinating.On the downside we have Robert De Niro's portrayal as talk-show-host hosting the mad Arthur Fleck. A cute turn on De Niro's playing the madman to Jerry Lewis' TV host in Scorcese's King of Comedy. I imagine the casting in this film was intended as an ironic twist on that Scorcese film.Whatever the reason, it was a bad, very bad, decision. De Niro is truly horrible.",8,2,5,27 November 2019
Jojo Rabbit," To work this has to be really funny. It's not.
","The trailer for the film could not be more misleading. It represents the film as a bright, brilliant, laugh-a-minute, over-the-top, farce-like extravaganza. It's not. It drags. Oh, does it drag. It virtually stops dead in its tracks. Scenes that should be 2-3 minutes go on and on. Characters and situations that are funny are few and far between. My problem, unlike other reviewers here, is not with the subject matter. Sure it's not everyone's cup of tea. But whether or not you feel the subject is film-worthy, this is a dead film. As was the audience at my screening.",1,120,316,10 November 2019
Life," More than just Science Fiction, this is an old fashioned horror film. And that's good.
","I liked this film. Now I know there are many who did not, and many more who think it is derivative of the Aliens series, but not I. For me this film was reminiscent of the horror films of my (long ago) childhood in which we know there is a creature, and we know it is close by, and so each time a door or cabinet is opened we expect it to jump out. And sometimes ... it does. And then there was this; we know what the creature looks like. For me this is a plus. Too often Sci-Fi-Fi creatures are shown moving too quickly or are somehow portrayed from so close that it is only their teeth that we see. Not so in 'Life'. We know how large the beast is from its birth till the film's end, and we know what it looks like; head to toe (though I can't swear that it had them; toes). As for the story, it is pretty much as one would expect, not better, not worse; but with the chills and surprises, the story is enough. Great acting, this film does not have any. Jake Gyllenhall seems to be sleepwalking through his role (so if its great performances you're after, this one you can miss.) Bottom line, the film held a grip on me right up to its final seconds. And that says a lot.",8,4,11,9 April 2017
The Nice Guys," A Buddy Movie. And not the best.
","The Nice Guys is not a good movie. It's not even good as a buddy movie but as a buddy movie it's ... OK. The stuff and nonsense between Crowe and Gosling grows old after a while but for some time it'll keep you entertained. So will Angourie Rice who plays Gosling's precocious, brilliant, and brave young daughter. Until you realize that the relationship between her and her father is a bizarre one; she is the common sense mother to her immature father. That is until she places her life in danger and once she does that you start asking 'Does anyone here have a brain?' And when the answer comes back, 'Nope', you stop caring.The plot is impossible to follow. I've seen it twice and I'm convinced that a third viewing will not help. Mistaken identity, bad cops, good cops, porn stars, Hollywood stars, and - get this - a 'clean air message' just serve to propel the buddy business into the film's second hour. Finally the film seems to end three separate times, only to begin again with a new reason for being. I'm not convinced that anything but the buddy-business actually mattered.",5,0,2,10 June 2020
