Requiem for a Dream," I've seen this movie once...
","And I will never see it again. This is easily one of the best, most gut wrenching, powerful movies I have ever seen. Though I had never even thought about doing heroin in the first place, this film put me on the negative 100 side of never ever ever doing heroin. The acting is amazing and the images gruesome; the whole feel of the movie is very overwhelming as you try to deal with what is happening on screen. This movie is definitely not for the faint of heart. Every person I know who has seen it, including myself, has said essentially the same thing, 'It was a great, well done film, but I don't ever want to see it again.' I definitely give this movie a 10 out of 10, and it should be seen at least once by everyone, but if I never see it again, it'll be too soon.",Null,0,1,21 October 2004
Am√©lie," A Fabulous Film!
","I just finished watching Amelie, and I absolutely loved it!  I love this director anyways; if you haven't managed to catch 'City of Lost Children,' that is also a must see.  The only word I can use to describe the images this movie presents is sumptuous... every single frame is filled with some of the most stunning visuals I have ever seen.  At first I didn't think I was that affected by the story until the halfway point when I realized the knot in my stomach was not from my dinner.  At 1 hr. 53 min. on my DVD player came the moment that sealed the deal and stole my heart.  An excellent excellent film for those who love foreign films and those who simply love great moviemaking.",9,0,2,1 April 2003
