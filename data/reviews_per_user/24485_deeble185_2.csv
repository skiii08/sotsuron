First Man," Do not go if you suffer motion sickness!!
","I went to see this movie with my partner, her mother and a 14 year old cousin. While we all appreciated it, that was the strongest recommendation from any of us. My major problem with the film was the 'action' camera work. While I understand that hand held shots lead to a greater sense of immediacy, having the camera 10 cm away from the subject and shaking it violently did not draw me in, rather it repulsed me. I literally closed my eyes for any sequence where this effect was used, as it was hurting me to watch it. As far as the story goes, it felt incredibly slow and distanced. In the interpretation of Armstrong as a person, it seemed to drive me away from relating to him or the situation, and I had no sense of the grandeur or the excitement that should have accompanied such a story. I was tempted to see this movie by the 2013 webby award winning site, and I can still say that the actual recordings are much more engaging than this film.",3,163,291,14 October 2018
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Mitty: a re-imagining done right.
","I have long enjoyed the Danny Kaye version of this film (same title), so I was curious to see where this one would go. While wildly different movies, I feel that this Mitty is a thorough and fair re-imagining. I have recently witnessed the second Hobbit movie where many defenders are desperately trying to justify Jackson's path as a re-imagining, and I can only say - Watch these 2 Mitty movies to see how it is done. While very different in their stories, their commonalities inspire comparison. If I had to pick more thematic brethren, I would say Stranger Than Fiction is the closest that I have seen, with perhaps Turtle Diary another.I don't think that this is an awesome movie, except with cinematography, but I feel that it has been fairly placed by the voting public. Definitely well above average, and most enjoyable.",9,0,1,15 January 2014
