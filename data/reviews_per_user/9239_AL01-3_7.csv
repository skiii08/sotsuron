Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," High Expectations Almost Doom Film
","Getting people to watch this movie was not going to be a difficult task for George Lucas. He could have shown home videos of himself mowing the lawn and it still would have made millions of dollars if he had attached the Star Wars label to it. That said, he also had an almost impossible task of living up to the sky-high expectations of devoted Star Wars fans, some of whom were known to buy tickets to other movies just so they could see PREVIEWS of the upcoming Star Wars entry. In addition, Lucas also had to introduce and set up five other movies with this film. (Three of which are already made, with two more promised to come) Given that this is the first of six movies, it's not really fair to rate it by itself. It will be more appropriate to judge how it fits in with the next two movies. Since I don't have the luxury of viewing those next two films yet, I'll have to rate this picture based solely on its merits. The special effects are spectacular, (what did you expect?) but the story, dialogue and characterization leave much to be desired. When you analyze this picture, you realize that nothing really happens. The characters just move in circles, presenting information and details that the audience presumably needs for future films.Even though the special effects are a strong point in this movie, they are sometimes over-used. An example is the pod race. This sequence is at least three times too long, and extremely boring. Its only purpose seems to be to showcase Lucas' talent for visuals and does nothing to advance the plot. It could have just as easily been removed completely and it wouldn't have been missed. The same could be said for the character of Jar Jar, although a reworking of his personality would have been more appropriate.
The dialogue is clumsy and full of tired expressions that went out 6 years ago. Example: 'That has got to hurt.' (If it went out of style 6 years ago here, just think how old that expression has gotten a long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away)Part of the reason so many Star Wars fans were disappointed with this entry was Lucas' failure to understand his audience. Most of the people (this writer included) who were anxiously awaiting the release of this picture were big Star Wars fans as  children when it originally came out. However, most of those audience members have grown up and presumably have become more sophisticated in what they find humorous. This could explain why so many people strongly dislike Jar Jar's attempts at humor. Overall, this isn't a bad picture. It's not a great or even a very good one, but it doesn't belong on any worst films lists, if only for the tremendous visual appeal that it offers. This movie suffers from high expectations, but perhaps the next film in this series won't endure the same fate.",Null,0,1,11 June 2000
Citizen Kane," Simply the Best
","There are many films that could justifiably be considered the best movie of all time. Arguments could be made for Casablanca, The Godfather, It's a Wonderful Life or many others. All have their strong points, but none combine excellent detail with innovative narrative, characterization and story line quite like Citizen Kane does.  This film is a delight that has withstood the test of time. While not particularly emotionally engaging, Citizen Kane is very intellectually satisfying. The symbolism of the picture is not difficult to decipher, but the themes, ideas and content of the movie demand contemplation. It's hard to watch this picture without looking inward and asking questions like what really brings happiness? Charles Foster Kane's life starts off promisingly enough. He creates a powerful media empire, but his idealistic enthusiasm soon gives way to cynicism and loneliness. Despite his power and his abundance of possessions, contentment eludes him. He doesn't realize what he is truly searching for until it is too late to recapture what he has lost. Told in non-linear narrative, the viewer learns about Kane's life through a series of flashbacks that occur through the eyes of various characters. This is a brilliant picture that's worthy of multiple viewings.",10,2,3,11 June 2000
Annie Hall," An Excellent Comedy
","Annie Hall is a cleverly crafted film full of intelligent, subtle comedy. Woody Allen's insights on relationships in this movie are funny because they often ring true. Just about any audience member can relate to some portion of the film even if he or she doesn't get all of the references and jokes.This is a funny movie that never descends into slapstick. Not all casual viewers will be able to appreciate this picture, but most film buffs will love it.",Null,0,0,18 July 2000
The Untouchables," One of the Best Films of the 80s
","The Untouchables is a visually and emotionally compelling movie that effectively draws the viewer into the clash between Elliot Ness and Al Capone. It's unusual that this film has received so few accolades considering the number of stand-out acting performances and the numerous memorable sequences in the film.     In the movie, Elliot Ness is determined to win the battle with his nemesis Al Capone and against corruption within the law-enforcement agencies. In order to do this, he brings together a group of men who can not be bribed or in other words, are untouchable. Sean Connery is excellent in his role of a veteran cop who tries to teach Ness what it will take to defeat Capone. Robert De Niro, as Al Capone and Andy Garcia, as a talented rookie cop, give good performances, and Kevin Costner gives a subtle, underrated performance as Elliot Ness.      Brian De Palma's direction, although somewhat derivative, (Many techniques and film sequences were taken from earlier and foreign films) is very impressive.      I highly recommend this film, especially if you are a fan of the Gangster movie genre.",9,1,1,5 July 2000
Rear Window," A Great Film
","This is one of Hitchcock's best. The film is masterfully set up as the audience is drawn into L.B. Jeff's (played by Jimmy Stewart) world. Due to an injury, this adventurous photographer is confined to his apartment where he finds diversion by spying on his neighbors. A number of interesting characters keep the the film intriguing while the plot develops. During the film, Hitchcock keeps the audience guessing as to whether Stewart's character is witness to a murder, or whether he is just allowing his imagination to cloud his judgement in order to fight off boredom. This film is interesting on so many levels. Jimmy Stewart is believable and likeable as always and Grace Kelly is at her elegant best. This is a must see for any film buff.",10,0,2,31 May 2000
Back to the Future," One of my Favorite 80s Films
","This film is the first in a very tight trilogy of movies that really fit well together. It is funny, enjoyable and just plain 'awesome'.Michael J. Fox is perfect in the role of Marty McFly as he inadvertently goes back in time. The damage that he causes by his presence in the 1950s threatens his very existence. In order to avoid completely disappearing, he must reunite his mother with his nerdy father, George, during their teenage years.Mr. Strickland, Biff, Marty and George McFly are very memorable characters and this is a film that you will want to see multiple times. Each successive viewing will likely reveal some detail that was missed the previous time. This film is really well done and I would recommend it to almost any audience. I'd give this picture *** and 1/2 out of ****. This movie was best viewed in the 1980s, but watching it now adds another dimension to going back in time. Definitely make seeing this stylish, slick, funny and enjoyable film a priority.",9,0,1,23 July 2000
High Fidelity," A Good, True to Life Film
","High Fidelity is one of those rare movies that offers equal doses of humor and despair. Rob, played by John Cusack is trapped by his past rejections and failures, especially those involving the opposite sex. He explains his past by addressing the camera often which is reminiscent of Ferris Bueller's Day Off. After breaking up with his current girlfriend, the two employees at the record store that he owns are the only people that offer consistent companionship for him. These two unusual individuals are, like Rob, seemingly going nowhere in life. Although he appears to only tolerate them, these two employees are a sort of surrogate family for him.
The screen play, acting and directing are all very good in this picture. There are times when the movie is laugh-out-loud funny and there are other times when the desperation and despair of the characters is evident and felt by the audience. All of the main characters grow and advance during the course of the movie, and it has a reasonably good resolution. I would recommend this film.",Null,0,1,21 July 2000
