Captain Phillips," Bet your house on Hanks
","Like a magical movie wizard, Tom Hanks sprinkles his magical touch over yet another Hollywood blockbuster...
You can bet your house, boat, car and all your worldly possessions on anything Tom Hanks appearing in or even directing being a movie worth watching. Captain Phillips is no exception to that rule. 
Set in the pirate patrolled seas off the coast of Somalia, Hanks captains a cargo ship toward Mombasa. In a culminating battle against a band of Somalian pirates, captain Phillips and crew do their best to protect their vessel. Based on a true story, Hanks conveys well the seemingly unresolvable, life threatening plight captain Phillips individually endures. Thankfully for him the US Navy is deployed to attempt a rescue..
A great performance from the Somalian pirate cast keeps you tettering on the edge. A never knowing suspense of whether the chaos will descend into a blood bath at any moment. 
Can he be saved? You'll have to watch the film...",8,0,0,23 September 2018
