Requiem for a Dream," Great acting but weak plot
","This was truly one of the most depressing films I have ever seen. I generally dislike movies about self-destructive people because I find them tedious, but the acting and directing were so good that I would recommend it. The script left something to be desired. I found certain parts of the film unrealistic -- at least two things come to mind. I don't recall exactly when the film was supposed to have taken place, but even if it was 20 years ago, electroshock therapy would never have been given to somebody when the staff knew for a fact that the patient's problem was pill addiction and not mental illness. The patient also would not be asked to sign a consent when she clearly was not able to consent. I know things like that happened in the 1930s, but not in recent years. The arrest of two of the main characters also did not ring true. Yes, they were in the south, with the stereotypical bunch of redneck cops, but last time I checked, you can't arrest someone for being a drug addict unless you actually find drugs on their person, and if the cops did find it, that scene was left on the cutting-room floor; it appeared from the script that the doctor saw the track marks and called the cops. I don't believe that would happen. It was as if the scriptwriter decided to purposefully exaggerate what would really happen just to punish these people. It would have been better if things evolved more naturally. The film did an excellent job with the special effects, which helped the viewer see the world through the eyes of drug addicts.",7,1,2,25 February 2006
Coffee and Cigarettes," Like watching paint dry
","God, what a boring movie...I like Jim Jarmusch's work--while his films don't always succeed, at least he's original. But this movie was just so pointless. Very few of the conversations were even mildly entertaining. I was looking at my watch waiting for something to happen. If you're going to stick people on the screen and just have them talk, then the dialogue better be interesting. But that wasn't the case here. Perhaps that was because the actors improvised all their dialogue -- I don't know how much was scripted and how much was improvised. But if it was scripted, the script sucked.The pairings of the various actors/actresses were interesting, and I did like the scene with Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan, but it still wasn't enough to make the film worth seeing.",2,4,7,2 June 2006
