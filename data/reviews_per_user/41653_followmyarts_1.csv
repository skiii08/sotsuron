Black Swan," good setting shame about the movie
","I have to say it was a total let down after all the hype. 'Black Swan' has all the ingredients but the final mix was disappointing. I agree with one of the other reviewers that the audience is 'spoon-fed' the horror and everything is so obvious from the beginning. There's no real psychological challenge or thrill, it was too superficial to be a serious portrayal of someone's descent into madness. In fact it became plain silly at times and the audience in my cinema began to giggle and laugh, which I found myself doing also towards the end.Artistically it is pleasant enough and the costumes were superb.Despite reviews to the contrary, I don't agree that the actors were the best choice. I think that Natalie Portman is too one dimensional and bland for the part and Barbara Hershey - an odd choice - in a role too big for her. By far Mila Kunis as Lily was the only believable presence who gave an outstanding and authentic performance.",5,9,17,6 February 2011
