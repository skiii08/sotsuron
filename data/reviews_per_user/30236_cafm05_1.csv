Come and See," Come and See...and maybe close your eyes a little.
","'Come and See' is heavy. Okay, too heavy. Made in commemoration of the 40th anniversary of World War II, one would clearly expect a war movie to be heart wrenching, and that it is...and more. Unlike most war movies, Come and See salutes war without a victimization undertone. The incredible soundtrack is the cherry on top of a fantastically realistic piece of work, which does a great job at capturing what war really is all about...hell. The movie will leave you speechless and even breathless at times. It's almost hard to watch, and even harder to believe that some of the things that happened throughout the 2 hours actually happened in big numbers during this period, and that this was the story of only one village. It is a story about courage, a story about love, and a story about passion. The passion to defend what you believe in and stand for. The passion to remain calm and keep your cool when everything is in your way and the odds are against you.",8,1,1,4 June 2012
