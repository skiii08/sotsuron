Scarface," Iconographic
","Scarface (1983) can be viewed as the pinnacle of the crime-epic genre, as well as being the cult-favorite among hip-hop culture. This classic shows how an immigrant would like a share of the American Dream, but uses illegitimate means to ascend to the top.  Like the true stories of Al Capone, Meyer Lansky, and John Gotti, this film is just a modernization of how crime and success is related to the innovator, a typology coined by sociologist Robert Merton.  Even several lines of this classic has been sampled by DJ Ready Red of the Geto Boys.  Several of the Geto Boys, like Mr. Scarface (who took the film's name as his stage name) are fans of the movie, as well as other actors like Chris Tucker.  Even the other crime genre flicks like New Jack City, Pulp Fiction, and Jackie Brown owe a lot to this classic, since noted directors like Mario Van Peebles, Quentin Tarantino, and Robert Rodriguez are influenced by a cult favorite that has transcended.  Even violent, this classic should always be in the hip-hop collection of classic flicks, along with the blaxploitation movies of the 1970s.",Null,0,0,27 December 1999
Full Metal Jacket," How War Changes an Individual
","This might be another film about the unpopular war that Americans should never have participated in, if JFK wasn't killed in Dallas on November 22, 1963.  Watch for an early performance by Vincent D'Onofrio (of Men in Black fame) as a boot camp cadet abused by R. Lee Ermey.  The boot camp scene is just a barrage of foul language and racial slurs, and a portrayal of how young men, fresh from high school, are being stripped of their civilian lives, and becoming soldiers.  Even the scene that takes place with the Vietnamese prostitute would later surface again in 1989, when a hip-hop group (The 2 Live Crew) would sample several lines that the prostitute said (e.g. Me So H*rny), for a hit song that would be a testament of the validity of the First Amendment.  Overall, the film is just another portrayal of an unpopular war.",Null,0,0,27 December 1999
Armageddon," modern disaster flick
","Unlike the Irwin Allen disaster flicks of the 1970s, which also includes Earthquake (1974) and Meteor (1979), Armageddon seems more modern, and features the typical all-star cast like the disaster flicks of yesteryear. 
Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Billy Bob Thornton, and Liv Tyler might be heralded as an all-star cast, like the star-studded casts typical to the 1970s disaster flicks, with a few differences.  Modern CGI special effects have come a long way, since the substandard SPFX of the 1970s. 
Liv Tyler might pay homage to screen legend Ava Gardner, since she has the glamour and beauty of legendary actresses, and Bruce Willis in a role that foreshadows Charlton Heston's roles in the 1970s disaster films.  The opening narration by Heston might be homage to his other noted works, as well as his affiliation with the 1970s disaster flicks.
Michael Clarke Duncan (who would excel in The Green Mile) gives an outstanding performance that paves the way for his stardom, and watch for a scene with Canadian beauty Jessica Steen during the spacesuit orientation, since this resembles a high school classroom with a disruptive student.",Null,0,1,14 January 2000
The Hurricane," An ode to Racism and Institutional Discrimination
","The film depicts the life of Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter, a framed athlete that is serving a life sentence.  Throughout the film, racism and institutional discrimination play a key role, especially with a racist cop (Dan Hedaya), and the turbulent 60s, during the peak of the Civil Rights Movement. 
Norman Jewison might be an outstanding director, since he directed a couple of films that depicted racism, like In the Heat of the Night (1967), and A Soldier's Story (1985).  After watching this film, seeing Rubin Carter in prison might be analogous to the life of Nelson Mandela, where a miscarriage of justice still exists.  Like The Green Mile (1999), where Michael Clarke Duncan is a death row inmate, Denzel Washington is a lifer, who has nothing to lose.  Anyone who is familiar with the Alabama railroad boys case would enjoy this film.",Null,0,1,20 January 2000
The Green Mile," Racial injustice -- on death row
","Michael Clarke Duncan portrays one of his breakthrough roles as an African American man on death row for the murder of two young girls.  The setting, in the South of the 1930s, shows how racial injustice among African American males on death row, where the victim was white, have proved the point that capital punishment was arbitrary and capricious until the Furman v. Georgia decision in 1972.  The portrayal of Coffee by Michael Clarke Duncan shows that one could have the power to heal, and his portrayal of a death row inmate is similar to the character of Tom Robinson in To Kill A Mockingbird, where the similar circumstances of an African American male tried through the courts ended with a guilty verdict, and a death sentence handed down by the judge.  The death row scene was sad, since it was just another tale of how the criminal justice system singles out minorities, when their crime victims were white.",Null,0,0,10 December 1999
Jackie Brown," Excellent
","Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is a flight attendant, who is legitimately employed, and earns $16,000/yr, and works a second job by delivering money (over $10,000) to Samuel L. Jackson, who is an arms dealer, with a 'crack ho' beach bunny, portrayed by Bridget Fonda.  Jackie Brown might not be your average flight attendant; she is a convicted felon, busted for carrying drugs for her husband, and in her current profession, she smuggles and delivers money to Ordell Robbie (Jackson).  Eventually, she gets busted (for carrying $50,000 and possession of cocaine), but this is just the beginning. The portrayal of Ordell Robbie is another reference to the innovator, who engages in illegitimate sub rosa goals to achieve success, much like Al Capone and Meyer Lansky. The real-life criminals like Capone or Lansky is similar to the portrayals of the fictional characters Tony Montana (Scarface), Nino Brown (New Jack City), Dylan Malone (Catch Me If You Can), or the kid from Fresh (1994).    Jackie Brown might be the only Quentin Tarantino flick that stands alone from his other films, like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.  One thing that I noticed was that the recurring alumni (e.g. Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, and Tarantino himself) weren't casted.  Samuel L. Jackson was the only Tarantino alumni that was in the film, but he did another breakthrough by casting Hollywood has-beens (e.g. Robert Forester, Pam Grier, Sid Haig, and Michael Bowen) from 70s and 80s films and TV shows (e.g. Sharky's Machine, Across 110th Street, Detroit 9000, Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry, Mean Streets, martial arts classics, and numerous 1970's-era blaxploitation films).  Maybe it was the videos that Tarantino might have viewed while being employed as a video store clerk back in the 1980s.  She has a choice of serving time, or cooperate with the cops, to bring down Ordell Robbie.  Excellent plot twists, especially when Robbie threatens Max Cherry (Robert Forester) in his Cadillac.  Lots of cameos in this Tarantino flick, like Chris Tucker (who ends up killed in the trunk of an Oldsmobile), and Aimee Graham (Heather Graham's younger sister) as a sales lady in a department store.  She REALLY looks like a clone of her sister from Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, without the shagadelic attitude!  Another thing that I noticed was the Tarantino trademark of 70s music, especially R & B/funkadelic tunes like Across 110th Street (Bobby Womack), Didn't You Blow Your Mind This Time (The Delfonics), and Street Life (Randy Crawford).",Null,0,0,7 February 2000
True Romance," Unorthodox
","Quentin Tarantino's influences are depicted, like in his other films, but although he sold the script to finance Reservoir Dogs (1992), the storyline was close to the original adaptation, except for a few noted differences (e.g. the alternate ending and the absence of Tarantino alumni like Tim Roth et.al.).  To this day, this film has a lot of QT influences, even if he didn't had the chance to direct one, where he had to let something go to work on another masterpiece (Reservoir Dogs, 1992).",Null,0,1,3 December 2000
