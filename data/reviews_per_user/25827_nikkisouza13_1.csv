Walk the Line," Amazing.
","I've been waiting to see this movie since I first heard about it, around the summer of 2005. What originally drew me to it was the fact that one of my favorite actors, Joaquin Phoenix, was acting in it. I read numerous early on reviews, and after talking with a few of my friends, I could not WAIT for it to come out.Unfortunately, I didn't get to see it until early January due to some small difficulties. But let me say, it was well worth the wait. I was captivated by it from the moment that it started.The start of the movie came close to bringing tears to my eyes. I actually sort of predicted it. When I saw his brother near the saw, I knew that something bad was going to happen shortly. When the younger version of Johnny Cash watched his brother die, I was overwhelmed with an amazing sadness. It reminded me of how Joaquin had to watch his younger die just 12 years ago due to a drug overdose outside of the Viper Room.The entire movie moved me. I was singing along, waiting for his rise to fame, and just overall excited during the entire film.I guess that I'm just saying that I can't get enough of this movie. I loved it. I advise you to go see it. Now.",10,0,0,9 February 2006
