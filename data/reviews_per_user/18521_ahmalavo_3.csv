Ford v Ferrari," Are you serious?
","This is THE AVERANGE HOLLYWOOD FILM. The movie goes on the same old tracks of every Hollywood movies: done well, but nothing original. Oh, sure: Christian Bale and Matt Damon are twe great actors, but they are wasted in these standard roles. I shut down the TV after 60 minutes of this boring show.",6,1,4,27 February 2020
The Revenant," A movie without heart. Tom Hardy do it better then Leo Di Caprio.
","Great picture, good direction by Inarritu, and two giants in the lead roles: Leonardo Di Caprio and Tom Hardy. But behind a formerly perfection there in no heart in this movie. Beautiful nature, rocky mountain, snow like in The Big Silence, but i can't live one real emotions, neither during the famous bear scene: the bear is incredible real, but so cold, as if Inarritu is more focused in achieving a perfect fight instead of an emotional fight. For this reason i found the movie a little boring due to it's long duration - 2 hours 36 minutes. My favorite scene is the final one (but i don't reveal what happen). Now i'm curious to see 'Man in the Wilderness' (1971), the first movie about the adventure of Hugh Glass starring Richard Harris and John Huston.",6,4,7,7 February 2016
The Pursuit of Happyness," The Pursuit of Money
","Two hours following the falling of a man and his child since to become homeless. Will Smith is a great actor, but the movie is so boring! The dialogues are artificiously, full of beautiful words in the Hollywood style: shiny but unreal. The biggest problem of The Pursuit of Happyness is its own meaning: Happiness = Money. Maybe you can cry watching this movie, but you will cry for a very poor reason, and the day after you'll have completely forgot the movie.",6,4,5,19 March 2018
