Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Best of Star Wars !!!
","It's hard to understand tastes of american people, especially if you are living in Ukraine. I still can't understand the 'greatness' of episodes 4, 5 and 6. It's not even a science fiction really, it's just a comics, filled with GREAT soundtrack ! I'm quote George Lucas : ' The sound and music are 50% of the entertainment in a movie'. OK, that's right , but only in HIS movies !!! I must say that entertaining in episodes 4,5,6 are sound and music at 95% ! The Phantom Menace is the best from Star Wars - it has strong perfomances ( Liam Neeson, Jake Lloyd and Pernilla August ), beautiful cinematography, excellent special effects and GREAT music by John Williams ( as always ). It also has weak script and VERY  WEAK direction by Lucas ( as always ), but these things don't stop me from seeing this TALE again and again only to hear that genius music. Ratings : soundtrack - no words, only emotions !!! Movie - 8 out of 10.",8,0,1,16 November 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Certainly the best movie of 2000 !
","I have decided to buy this movie on vhs after seeing a beautiful cinematography shown in the trailer. Unfortunately this motion picture were not playing in our cinemas, so at the time when I see it at my home VCR it has already won 4 Oscars. As I have expected before buying, it would be an action with some dose of drama. Well, I must tell you that after seeing first 30 minutes of this movie I have been almost disappointed. Of course I admit that these fighting scenes are more than revolutionary, but there is that dramatically fullness what I have hope for? And in the end - is this movie worth that Oscars?  Thanks God, the second part of it proved that Crouching Tiger worth every Oscar of 2001's ceremony! Exception : Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun-Fat. Their weak performance is the only reason why I give it 9 out of 10. Because of them this movie has not become a masterpiece. I'm truly sorry Â… That was a negative side. Here is a positive : Zhang Ziyi and Chang Chen are one of the best screen couples in the history ! Tan Dun's music is clear magic ! Peter Pau's cinematography is like a wonderful dream ! Ang Lee's directing is excellent ! The ending sequence is really heartbreaking! All this things make me to watch this film again and again so I have see it more than 15 times. It happens with me very seldom, actually only few movies make me so exciting , so if you like Crouching Tiger I can recommend them to you . Here they are : Waterworld , Kundun , Terminator - 2 , Lolita (1997) , Dances with wolves , Braveheart  and The Last Emperor.",9,2,3,28 September 2001
