Scarface," My thoughts on the film...
","This film had been claimed as one of Al Pacino's crowning achievements, and it certainly lives up to that completely. It may not be a 'crowning achievement' for Pacino, but it's definitely a landmark in his career.Many say that this film is trash because of the drugs, 'potty-mouth', and violence. I personally believe this is beside the point of the movie. I think the point of the movie is, 'If you get involved in the drug trade, your life will be ruined.' Think about it. Tony Montana comes to America, thinking probably he'll make something out of his life. This is a guy who's had practically nothing for all of his life. So when he finds something like a drug industry, he thinks it's easy money. Little does he know the effects of the cartel.Tony gains everything: a grand mansion, smoking hot wife, friends in high places, and all the cocaine one can snort in a lifetime. However, when it's all said and done, he winds up with nothing. He kills his best friend, loses his trophy wife, loses his sister, and eventually his own life.I also love the ending of the movie. The final 'stab in the back', so to speak. All in all, I give this movie a 10.",10,0,1,11 December 2007
