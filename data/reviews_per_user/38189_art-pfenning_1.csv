The Hangover," One of worst movies ever
","This movie is just awful Unoriginal, derivative, idiotic and a semi-ripoff of Very Bad Things that was actually funny. There is not one laugh in this film. i am utterly shocked at the good reviews It stinks. The flick is a very very very boring exposition of a few guys going to Vegas and getting into trouble. (Does this sound like Very Bad Things or what? There is no laughter in this film at all I am shocked that it made any money whatsoever. RIP OFF BEWARE How on earth this movie got backing is Way beyond me. It's an odor generating mess that isn't funny Avaois at all costs. You will hate yourself for renting or buying this atrocity. Stay away.",1,10,19,21 May 2010
