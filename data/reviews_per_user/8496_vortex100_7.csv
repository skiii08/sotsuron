Miracle," I Don't Care for Hockey, I Loved This Movie!
","I live in Minnesota where hockey nuts abound, but I never got into it. I certainly never watched it on TV or went to a live game. After seeing this exciting movie I just may sometime soon.Kurt Russell does a terrific job playing the hardass hockey coach with a heart (Herb Brooks), and you can certainly tell the men playing the game on on-screen are real hockey players.  They really show off their stuff and do a pretty good acting job as well.  Even though I knew how the games ended I was still on the edge of my seat and I was tempted to yell at the screen. My wife, no big hockey fan herself, was right there with me, getting caught up in the action. The players and Herb Brooks are all legends here in Minnesota, of course. We sometimes forget that the hockey players came from Massachusetts, Michigan and elsewhere. It certainly brings back some good memories from a bad time in this nation's history.  For those of us who lived through it, we sure needed the win and this movie does a good job showing that need and the catharsis it brought to the nation.",Null,0,0,18 February 2004
Beauty and the Beast," The Greatest Animated Feature of All Time
","Disney Studios poured all their talent into this magnificent masterpiece to produce not only the finest animated feature ever, but one of the most entertaining films in cinema history.  A terrific story line and a wonderful musical score enhance some of the best animation you'll ever see.  Engaging from the very beginning, this is a simple story of a beautiful, but intelligent woman named Belle who has become bored with the provincial life of her French village.  She gets more adventure than she bargains for, however, when she searches for her father, who disappears on the way to a local fair.  In the meantime, she is romantically pursued by a handsome, but an exceptionally vain and shallow hunter named Gaston. Belle wants nothing to do with the brute, but he is determined to do anything to have her hand in marriage. Everything for Belle changes when she finds her father being held captive in a remote castle outside her village by 'the Beast'.  Highly recommended.",10,1,1,26 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Visually wonderful and riveting
","Although its ranking will certainly decline on the IMDB list as time wears on, this is undoubtedly the best fantasy movie ever filmed.  Unlike movies like 'Star Wars', which was part of a series yet self-contained with a definitive conclusion, this motion picture ends in the middle of the story and leaves viewers (especially those who have never read the books) unsatisfied.  That being said, 'The Fellowship of the Ring' contains some of the finest scenery ever put to film and great acting to boot.  After the prolouge, it begins slowly and methodically in the Shire and builds to the fantastic battle and escape from the Mines of Moria.  What is really unique for a movie of this type is the true emotions that spill from the screen. You feel the inner turmoil of the characters as they try to decide how to handle the One Ring and battle the urge to use it for their own means. You simple can't find that type of emotion or acting in any other fantasy film to date.",Null,0,0,26 December 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," An Epic Masterpiece Continues
","....and our story continues. Part two of Jackson's incredible 9 hour epic gives us more of the genius he displayed in part one. 
The most compelling member of the cast is certainly Gollum, as played by Andy Serkis and rendered into reality using amazing computer graphics. Gollum's mutiple personality disorder makes him a much more pitiful creature than he ever seemed in Tolkien's books. This is an incredible achievement on the part of both Jackson and Serkis.  I never felt sorry for the creature in the book, but everyone I talked to who saw the movie felt sorry for him. You can see how devastated he is by his evil side, but his addiction to the Ring is so difficult to fight.The terrific battle scene at Helm's Deep and the sacking of Isengard by the Ents left me in awe.  Great eye candy.  However, there was an emotional tinge to the entire ordeal, as portrayed by the women and small children huddling in fear in the Keep at Helm's Deep as the orcs battle their way into the stronghold.Overall, both thrilling and emotionally involving from beginning to end. Highly recommended.",Null,0,0,19 December 2002
Schindler's List," Magnificent and Sublime
","Not only is this masterpiece the greatest film ever made, it can be considered one of mankind's greatest artistic achievements, to be compared with the best of Mozart, Shakespeare and Michelangelo. Using the subtle but startling shadings only black and whitecinema can produce Steven Speilberg has created a protean achievement both thought-provoking and shattering in content and scope. Ralph Fiennes portrayal of the concentration camp commandant shows the horrifying side of a human both sad and twisted. Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give performances equally compelling. John Williams musical score is flawless, evoking an emotional response without overcoming this disturbing story about a German industrialist who slowly learns about the Holocaust and tries to save the few Jews he can from certain death. This miraculous piece of cinema should be required viewing for anyone interested in the human condition and the depths and heights to which we all can reach.",10,9,13,25 January 2002
Jaws," Astounding and Frightening
","A classic summer movie that kept thousands of people out of the water, even on inland lakes! A winner from the first terrifying scene to the quiet, serene ending.  Terrific acting from the entire cast, with so many memorable lines from a flawless script it would be impossible to quote them all.  The musical score deservedly won an Oscar and is legendary for building the tension and providing a perfect backdrop to this simple story about a sheriff confronting a great white shark eating tourists and locals in the waters around his island.  You'll be watching this one from the edge of your seat.",10,3,7,28 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," It's over already?
","This motion picture is a satisfying conclusion to the greatest epic in film history.One can quibble about how faithful director Peter Jackson was to the book(s), but no one can deny he has made a series of movies that carry the viewer to a new whole new world, involving them mind and soul with the characters that inhabit it. There were a few too many scenes where the men were looking a bit too soulfully into each other's eyes. If they were gay, then fine, it is expected. Here, you felt like shouting 'kiss him for heaven's sake' when the gazing became a little too intense and emotional. Deep friendship during times of upheaval and war I understand, but this seemed to be over-the-top.(Spoiler Alert!) Don't read past this line if you haven't seen the movie!I also have a problem with a section of the movie near the end where the fade to black lasts far too long and indicates the end of the film. It happens just after Frodo and Sam escape the lava after Sauron's fall and Mount Doom explodes. This confused many in the audience, who seemed ready to get up and leave. There was no reason for the fade to black, or for it too last as long as it did. The passage of time could have been easily conveyed another way. The final scenes lasted for too long and I would have been happy to see the movie end when the warriors all bowed to the hobbits.  Now THAT SCENE was truly great and showed how appreciative they were to the little people who saved their world. These were actually only minor points of contention for me.  Overall, the battle scenes were extraordinary.  I cared for all the major characters and was intensely interested in how they would defeat the army of darkness, even though I already knew how the story would end.  Some visuals were truly amazing and I came away very happy with the entire series of movies. 
I can't wait for the extended DVD edition to come out next Christmas!",Null,0,0,20 December 2003
