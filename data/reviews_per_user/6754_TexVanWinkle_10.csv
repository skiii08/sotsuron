The Blair Witch Project," UnbeWitched
","I finally decided it was time to see what all the fuss was about.  Now that I know, I'm a little boggled.  Am I missing something here?  How can I be scared at something so patently unrealistic?  If this were truly realistic, the footage would have ended about an hour into the movie, at the point where the three film makers decide their lives are more important than camera equipment, ditch the backpacks, and hike non-stop, day and night, south and/or east until they get to civilization.  They have a compass. They have legs.  Make use of them.  Don't stop every night and invite the evil right up to your doorstep.  Maryland's just not that big, and there's plenty of populous all around it.  Go towards it, all the time.  And take a cell phone while you're at it, just for emergencies.  A creative idea, to be sure (though not necessarily as original as previously thought, cf. The Last Broadcast), and the first half-hour or so is promising, but the stunning stupidity of the characters made the last hour of the movie just an irritating joke.We give a pass to most movies, especially horror movies, when they're unrealistic, because we know they're fictions trying to pass themselves off as reality.  But Blair Witch tries to pass itself off as the reality itself, as a documentary, and in so doing sets a higher standard of realism for itself.  For me, it failed miserably in meeting it.",5,0,2,30 January 2000
Fight Club," Good movie, bad philosophy
","Unfortunately, it seems many people are attracted to the philosophy the film ends up exposing as an empty fallacy.  Someone commented that 'This film is the voice of disillusionment, of realising that the world we live in places unrealistic hopes and expectations on our lives and goals.'  Excuse me, no: WE place them.  Nobody is responsible for the choices we make in our lives but us.  Norton's character--and anybody like him--is trapped only by his inability to make those necessary choices in his life.  And the answer isn't anarchy.  While the ending is somewhat disappointing and goofy, at least the film has the intelligence to recognize that fact.  Fight Club is a very well done movie, with an intoxicating visual style, compelling script, and performances that will blow your hair back.  But lest anyone miss it, what Tyler espouses *is* a bad thing, for the individual and society, and that's the real moral of the movie.  Unfortunately a lot of folks not only do seem to be missing that, but doing so enthusiastically, which is kind of pathetic, and a little unsettling.",8,0,1,22 July 2000
Monster," Wow (Very minor implied spoiler)
","As with many people, my main draw to this film was the acclaim for Charlize Theron's performance.  Well, that and the physical transformation.  Unlike some, at least, though, that transformation didn't distract me from her performance because both are just so superbly well done.  Charlize the model is so completely removed in sight and psyche that I ceased to think about it.  I simply watched an amazing and, yes, Oscar-worthy performance.  This is a tremendous acting achievement from someone who heretofore had precious little to indicate this level of potential.  As I say, wow.I can understand where some might find Theron's performance a little over the top, but personally I didn't think so.  Knowing nothing of the real Aileen Wuornos, it struck me as merely the grandiosity of someone whose self has become so stretched beyond the bounds of normal behavior.  I also understand but disagree with the opinion of some that the movie dismisses Wuornos' crimes behind so much PC victimology.  The unfortunate truth is that whereas many killers are in fact born with an evil bone (and I'll brook no arguments that they aren't), some are indeed bred to it by circumstance. This doesn't excuse their behavior, it merely explains its source, which is what I believe Monster does very well.  I think in the scenes where she does feel pity and shows mercy, the movie illustrates that Aileen does indeed know right from wrong, so that later, when she doesn't show that mercy, it's clear she's consciously chosen the wrong, and for the wrong reasons.  I just didn't get from the movie the message that she didn't deserve her punishment.The only minor negative I found in the movie was Christina Ricci's performance.  That's not to say it wasn't good, but it struck me as merely that.  In retrospect I think she could have occupied the role better. Though in all fairness to her, it may be only that Charlize is so good, Christina by comparison comes off as merely effective.This is a difficult movie to watch, no doubt about it.  It's one of those I'd usually choose to watch on video at home, due to the almost voyeuristic nature of watching something so intensely personal.  But I didn't want to wait to check out Charlize's performance.  I'd suggest others do the same. The movie is excellent--literally, directorially, musically--but Charlize Theron is outstanding.  Go check her out.  If you can find her.",8,0,0,18 January 2004
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Surprisingly good
","That's not to say it's great, but it is to say that not only is it much better than I was expecting -- a friend had to talk me into seeing it -- it's quite good.  The clich√©d parts are kept to a minimum (although their presence in an otherwise good movie makes them that much more glaring). Both leads perform the rom-com cute/serious balancing act well.  Not a classic by any means, but more entertaining than most of the others in the same class, certainly by modern standards.",7,0,0,31 January 2003
American Pie," This isn't your mother's pie
","There's Something About Mary in high school, also read as, 'More things I really don't want to see on a movie screen.'  I'll really be glad when this current crop of American film-makers grow up.  For that matter, I'll be happy when the current generations of the American public grow up. 'America: The Teenage Years.'    What, people are sexual?  Stop the presses. Get over it already.  I had no desire to see this movie when it was in theaters, but kept hearing such good things about it I decided finally to check it out.  I think I'll go watch The Philadelphia Story again to cleanse myself.",5,0,1,30 January 2000
Armageddon," I'd rather be hit by an asteroid
","I cannot believe that the likes of Robert Towne, Paul Attanasio, and Scott Rosenberg were involved in the writing process of this movie.  How the writers of Chinatown, Quiz Show, and Beautiful Girls (respectively) could in any way be connected to this glossy piece of trash is beyond belief.  I thought Deep Impact was going to be the worst movie I saw last year.  Then Armageddon came along.  It is perhaps the worst modern movie I've ever seen. Roger Ebert's right: introducing the world's first 120+ minute trailer. Good god.",2,0,1,16 October 1999
American Beauty," This Beauty is definitely skin-deep
","Thud.Thud.Thud.This is the sound of the heavy hand I heard emanating from the screen as I watched American Beauty.  The characterizations are so broad and cliched as to be almost cartoonish.  These characters are -- the whole movie is -- about as deep as the paint on my walls.  (Less so, in fact: I used two coats.)  Like the city of its origin, it's a gaudy board covering a deep hole, platitude ornately expressed.  It's bumper-sticker philosophy.Is it fun and sometimes very funny to watch Kevin Spacey make war with (the filmmakers' idea of) convention?  Sure.  It's also painfully adolescent.  It gives an out to pent-up angst.  But Lester Burnham's carpe-diem catharsis is the worst kind; it's not bravery to act the way he does in his release, it's bravado.How much of a epiphany can it be when it's not enough to spur him to regret and apologize for his shameful behavior?  He's been just as guilty as any of the other guilty parties in the film of being blind to the implications of mortality, yet when his eyes are opened, he doesn't seek to expand on that understanding.  He doesn't use it for anything other than an excuse to become self-indulgent.  That's not courageous, that's selfish.  I'm supposed to admire him for this?  I'm supposed to admire a guy for not having sex with a minor?  This is how low our standards have dropped?  Frightening. Good for Lester for seeing the light, but shame on him for not learning anything truly worthwhile from it.  The same admonition applies to the filmmakers.Basically this is yet another movie that espouses the idea that personal happiness is more important than moral behavior, which is why American Beauty is so popular.  People are more concerned with how they feel than how they act.  They'd rather be happy than moral.  It's easier.  Definitely American, but it ain't beautiful.",6,0,0,15 March 2000
District 9," Action movie, video game, yes. Social commentary, not really.
","This movie is technically impressive. It has some solid performances. It is not subtle, and it is wildly implausible. I assumed I wasn't getting the whole story from the trailers on how an advanced race capable of intergalactic travel could become refugee camp squatters to a less advanced race. Nope. That's pretty much it. I had a number of 'Why?'s floating in my brain afterward, but they were beaten down by the sheer brutality of the film. This is basically a buddy cop film, with as thin a veneer of plot as most of them have. What sets it apart, again, is the technical execution. It looks amazingly real. If only the story and script lived up to it.",6,2,2,5 September 2009
Mission: Impossible II," Robert Towne wanted credit for this?
","Towne's downward arc from Chinatown continues.  At least Days of Thunder generated some interesting characters and realistic conflict.The conventional wisdom is that people don't go to action movies to have to think.  The people that believe that will be more than happy with M:I-2. Nothing challenging about it, except for caring one whit about the characters.  Batman cartoons have deeper characters--and plots, for that matter--than this.  Was it fun?  Oh...yeah.  It's flashy, and got some cool stunts and whatnot.  It's decent matinee entertainment.But that's not what I expect from this kind of talent.  I expect sharp dialogue, layers of story, depth of character, texture.  It is possible for an action movie; anyone recall a movie called Raiders of the Lost Ark?  It's extra disappointing for something like this to be what it is.  I shouldn't have to consider whether it was fun or not with talents the likes of Cruise and Towne attached.  This could have been--*should* have been--so much better.  I'd like to be able to put all the blame on John Woo, since all his movies suffer from the same malady to varying degrees, but Cruise, nice as he is, deserves a hardy head-smack as co-producer.  In the end he had to sign off on it. Tom, Tom, Tom.  You coulda been a contendah.",5,0,0,24 May 2000
All Quiet on the Western Front," Fine film, better book
","Read the book.  Excerpts are adapted into dialogue for the film with somewhat stunted results; people just don't talk that way.  Nonetheless, an extremely advanced film for its time, superior to most war films of any time.  The battle sequences are vivid and realistic.  (And, I might add, considering practical film effects of the time, probably much more like actual live fire exercises than most of the actors would have liked.) People are being a little lazy in their political commentary on the film, though, extrapolating from a legitimate expose of the grim reality of war and its effect on men and societies to a naive questioning of the occasional necessity of war itself.  War is hell, Sherman said, but on to Atlanta he drove anyway.  Surely no one thankful for their freedoms and privileges in the U.S. alone can unhypocritically indict war as a last resort for the liberation and preservation of liberty and men's souls.  Peace and unity at the expense of human dignity are worthless.  Let's not forget that in avoiding the calamity of war, which All Quiet is so effective in portraying, as much as we can.",7,1,6,30 November 2002
