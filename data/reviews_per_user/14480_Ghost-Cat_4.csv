Kill Bill: Vol. 2," At first I was disappointed by sex but then I grew to like it.
","When I first saw Kill Bill vol.2 I felt disappointed in my expectations but then I grew to like it and eventually gave it 10 out of 10. Because it is a great movie and because it surprized me and I enjoy being surprized. Life is boring when it is predictable. Not mentioning the movies. Anyway, throw away your expectations when going to see this movie. It is still Kill Bill but the whole different one.If the first one was 80% action and 20% drama the second one is 80% drama and 20% action. It is not a usual sequel, exploiting the success of the first movie, but a true continuation. The story will get deeper, the characters become more developed. The ending will be what you expect but not the way you were led to believe.",10,1,3,20 April 2004
The Matrix Revolutions," Great, Good & Ugly
","Matrix was a great movie, Matrix 2 was good if not very good, Matrix 3 is plain ugly. It is shallow, sloppy and lame. They reused every special effect, every line of the script and did not even bother to add anything new.I am pretty sure that everyone who watched the first two movies will watch the third one to find out how it will all ends. Well, it does not really end. It looses its breath before the finish line and nothing really gets resolved. No questions will be answered. You'll leave the theater with mixed feeling, on one hand you kind of wish for the fourth installment to resolve the unresolved, on the other hand you will feel no desire to see Matrix 4 or any other movie made by the brothers for a long time.",1,0,0,5 November 2003
Collateral," When the trees are cut down the chips are flying

Of, relating to, or guaranteed by a security pledged against the performance of an obligation. 6. Having an ancestor in common but descended from a different line.This movie is much deeper than it seems. It's about the ordinary man who lives ordinary life doing the best he can, as he thinks. He does not expect much from live, just trying to take pride in an ordinary job, driving a cab, filling the missing part with a pathetic dream of his own limo service. The best in town, of course.And one day the lighting strikes. The love comes but with it a deadly challenge. Suddenly, to call her next day or not is no longer the question. The question is how to survive this night. Too see what helped him to survive. watch very carefully, especially after shootout in a disco. It's easy to miss what caused the switch from the hope to survive to the passion to win.Mark my words, you'll have a good ride.",10,0,1,14 December 2004
