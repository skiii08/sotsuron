Moneyball," Like good science (non)fiction to me
","My family is somewhat agnostic about sports, meaning that we believe they exist but are not certain of the where or why of them. That being stated, this movie (and the book that I read before seeing it) were not unlike very good science fiction of life on another planet/world complete with the good guys and bad guys and the weird and alien politics and social structure.I guess this should be very good science non-fiction.Another serious plus for this movie is how closely it followed the book. Most movies from books -- at least the ones I have seen -- diverge a lot from the written tale. Not so for Moneyball. They left some of the good parts out but for what are probably several very good reasons, did not change the tale from the book at all.Someone should be thanked for this.",10,1,2,9 October 2014
Ender's Game," True to the book
","I saw this movie as part of my local libraries 'Movie and a Book' program and I enjoyed this more than most of the pairings. This movie follows the book very closely and never does something that wasn't in the book.Having been written in 1977, I found the story to be surprisingly fresh and on the mark for many things that just did not exist in the late '70s.One thing that I found disturbing while reading the book which was not so disturbing in the movie was the opposite of what the story is about. Where the youngsters think that the game is not a game -- the blur between reality and the game.",8,2,5,23 December 2014
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," I watched it for about 20 minutes in the middle
","The bits I saw meant a lot or nothing to me. I watched it on a TV inside a drum with the volume very loud.When I sat down to see it, the regularly dressed vampires were allowing the overly dressed vampires to see a young girl.I asked the girls who had selected the movie and were watching it instead of playing cards, 'Why does Marching Band wants to meet the girl?' One of them answered 'Because she is half immortal.' I kept it to myself that by as many definitions of all of those words that I can come up with, 'half immortal' is impossible.At some point, I was bored and wanted to leave so I jumped up and said 'And that's why you keep the f-ing band in the orchestra pit!' And then I left. I laid in my bed and missed that Suzanne Sommers Thigh Master, something awful....",7,0,1,15 February 2017
