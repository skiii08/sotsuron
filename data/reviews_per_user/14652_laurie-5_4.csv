Antz," You'll never looks at ants the same way again...
","I was really hesitant to see it at first but it was worth my money. 'Antz' is the first of yet another pair of movies on the same theme to be released within weeks, the other being Disney's 'A bug's life' (ironically a trailer for that movie was shown). It wasn't just another kiddie-flick, the humour was surprisingly sophisticated. Woody Allen did what he does best: playing the neurotic ant, alongside Sylvester Stallone as a Rambo-esque ant, Sharon Stone as the princess of the colony and Christopher Walken as (duh!) the evil ant. The animations were superb and very realistic. With humour, action and romance you have a great cocktail of family entertainment!",9,0,0,9 October 1998
Independence Day," It's the end of the world as we know it...
","It was two hours of great entertainment! Unlike 'Contact', this is not a movie that is suppose to make you think, but it was a good old fashioned popcorn flick. Will Smith is very funny (as usual) and the special effects were amazing. The only thing that is annoying is the patriotism, but what can you do, it's made in America.",9,1,2,4 October 1998
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Do us a favor, leave the franchise alone!
","As most sequels are, this one is inferior to the original. I was really looking forward to see this movie since the first 'Jurassic' is my favorite movie ever ! (don't tell me, I know it's no Citizen Kane). If you can't come up with a story or new ideas, don't waste your money in doing unnecessary sequels. I really don't expect anything from a third one. Just leave it that way! As the Jeff Goldblum character would say, doing another sequel is 'the worse idea in the history of bad ideas'.",6,0,2,28 September 1998
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The movie that changed the face of sci-fi...
","I first saw 'Star Wars' when it was re-released last year mostly because I wanted to see what the fuss was all about. It was better than I expected. George Lucas really has a lot of imagination to come up with all this. It was a fun cinematic experience. Everybody in the theater was cheering. The effects were also amazing (thinking that they did it for only 10M$, which by the way is today's half of Harrison Ford is getting per film). I can't wait to see the first chapter of the prequels, 'Phantom Menace', due out next year.",Null,0,0,4 October 1998
