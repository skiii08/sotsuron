Ali," very moving and believable
","I love a good biography film and Ali is at times masterful in many ways and portrays all the parts of Muhammed Ali, not just the dazzling boxing life he led which is often used above his deep inner anguish at the prejudice in America.Will Smith is the only person in my opinion who could've played Muhammed, you can tell that he really wanted to play the part just by looking at his actions throughout the movie; it's deeply obvious that he's studied Muhammed in depth and this worked wonders on screen.  While the fight scenes are not on the same level as perhaps the Rocky films this should not be downplayed as they're excellently executed with a beautiful blend of action, excellent music and banter between Ali and also between Ali and his own mind.Overall i'm glad that this movie didn't focus on Ali's boxing career, moreover i'm glad that it highlighted his personal life, it's trials and tribulations and it's anguish at the events going on around him.  Certain scenes like Ali running through the shanty towns of Kinshasa really evoke Ali's feelings for the oppression around him and how he's become a hero of freedom and independence to them.  It truly is remarkable.  My only quaam with the film is that it is in certain places slightly vague in it's descriptions of characters.  For example, if a person (how this could happen, i do not know) had never heard of Ali or his story then they would be mystified at some of the characters because little is explained or highlighted about some characters throughout the film.  This is as expected however, because the makers clearly had the idea that everyone watching would have a vague idea of who each person is, i mean, how could you not in a sense?But other than that, a great film and an accurate biography.  Well done, I recommend it!",7,0,0,11 August 2002
The Big Lebowski," Put simply, a marvellous film and a must see
","To say this film is a masterpiece is perhaps a little generous, however, it is not far off.  The Big Lebowski is a tribute to the real people out there; people trying to get through life exerting the shortest amount of effort necessary whilst drifting in and out of trouble.  I think this sums up the film perfectly.  I've watched this film so many times and I still can't find anything wrong with it.The acting is sublime, Jeff Bridges is at his comic best and with John Goodman and Steve Buscemi as support there's always going to be laughter and suspense.  The script is faultless; each person blends into the script with effortless precision resulting in a feeling that the actors really ARE the people they're playing which makes it all the more better because you feel their joy, their anguish and their feelings of the often baffling but wonderfully written events happening around them.Not only is the acting sublime, aswell as the script and directing, but the musical score is so good you think that the songs were written especially for the film with them evoking a feeling of lazyness, a feeling of laid back carefree attitudes which in a way is what the film is all about.  In essence, as a whole; acting, script, directing and music, this is the ultimate feel good buddy film and is an absolute must, a real modern classic work of film-making and shouldn't be missed.  I feel it must be watched from start to finish though, without any breaks, to fully grasp the magnitude of this film.10/10. - splendid, one for the collection.",10,0,0,28 June 2002
Event Horizon," poor, very poor despite some pretty sweet SFX
","I'm a big fan of the sci-fi genre but this film is just woefully poor.  To give it credit, it started out positively but apart from some sweet special effects it just diminished into so much half chewed fish.  It was a movie that was made for a 'B-Rate' actor not the likes of Lawrence Fishburne. Even Morpheous himself looked un-at-ease with his corageous captain role. To be honest, the gore was just tooooooo graphic.  I can tolerate gore in fits and spurts so to speak but it was just too graphic.  For me, hanging someone horizontally on meat hooks and then slicing their inerds out while they're still alive is just too much.  And to think.....the great Michael Kamen of Metallica did the music to it!",5,0,1,7 July 2002
Goodfellas," Among Scorsese's best and a true classic
","Goodfellas is without a doubt one of the best gangster films of all time, if not THE best.  I find it hard to watch a gangster movie without likening and comparing it to Goodfellas in more than one fashion; ranging from script, musical score, acting and screenplay - and most of the time I have to admit, none of them come near to Goodfellas.You couldn't have picked a better director than Scorsese to do this film and his exquisite and rightly respected directing skills are on full show as he transforms this age-old clichÃ© genre into a real classic film where the audience is captivated from start to finish.  The acting is superb and Liotta as Henry Hill puts in possibly his lifetime best performance and with Joe Pesci as his side-kick you've got an extremely talented actor who never fails to either make you laugh (whut, am I a clown?) or make you despise him (the first scene) at the click of a finger; magic - in a word.  To be honest, there are talented actors left, right and center in Goodfellas.The script itself is masterful in picking up the story halfway through the movie before jetting back to the 'proper' starting point of a film to show you what's happened up to the point where the film picks up.  It's sort of hard to follow and pleasantly surprising when you see it first time but becomes crystal clear towards the end and when you watch it again it all makes full and complete sense.My only quam with Goodfellas is that in places it is often drawn out and the film itself is very long, however, don't let this deduct from the film's brilliance as is seen from The Godfather movies.  Goodfellas is a beautifully directed and acted masterpiece and as with all gangster movies, the language and extremely explicit and gory violence comes at a thick and fast pace.  However, the fact that Goodfellas is high up in the top 250 movies is testament to this film's true brilliance.Certainly one for the collection and certainly one worth respect. 10/10",10,0,1,30 June 2002
