Requiem for a Dream," Forget DARE... Wow.. just.. wow..
","I have seen this movie more times than I could count, and every time I do, it has an impact on me as though it were the first time. Every time I see it, I cry.. every time I see it, by the end, my heart is pounding and I feel ill.. Err, I suppose that's a bit.. sappy of me. This film is.. real. It shows the reality of the downfall of drug users.. It shows an in-depth and artistic view of the pain and struggles that so many people face, even those who don't intend to. If you are at all related to the topic of drugs or not, this is a movie that everyone should see at least once. Powerful, dark, and with a long-lasting impact, not to mention backed by an amazing soundtrack by the Kronos Quartet, I would recommend this film to anyone who is ready to step away from the airy sex-themed comedies all over the shelves and take a look at real life.",10,1,2,24 April 2006
