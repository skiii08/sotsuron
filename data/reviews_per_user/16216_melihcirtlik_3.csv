The Avengers," You must watch this film
","I can say you must absolutely watch this movie. Visual effects are fantastic and this best movie I've ever seen so my vote is 10 of 10. While I was watching movie,I excited every minutes. From the start to the end the movie was really good.That's why you must watch the movie. If you carry heroes of Marvel comic,you will watch this movie. At the end of movie you mustn't go anywhere you must wait some minutes and a scene will come it is about other movie will come.In the scene you will see bad character of the other movie.First you can't understand. I guess you think 'who is he' , I am here for answer the question :D. He is Thanos. I say again watch this movie,watch this movie,watch this movie.",Null,3,8,8 May 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," We have a movie for the first avenger
",This movie isn't great but not bad. If you like movie of heroes you will watch this film. This movie for The Avengers because The Avengers need some heroes (like Thor) so Marvel Studios cine-recorded this movie for The Avengers. But I don't say 'You mustn't watch this movie' in fact 'You must watch this movie'. In the start of movie you will get bore but from the mid to the end you will excited. You can't understand first scenes because its explain in the end. After end of the movie(like 10 minutes) you must wait. A scene come and it's from The Avengers you have to watch it. After that you will see trailer of The Avengers.Good time,Null,0,0,9 May 2012
Cloud Atlas," Cloud day
","I have never seen like this movie. First of all, you can't understand in the beginning of the movie. It's about our past and future, actually reincarnation entered my head but it's about how the past affect the future. All of actors are good playing their role. Visual effects are fantastic with actors' acting it will be amazing movie.The movie is 3 hours but you don't understand how past the time. While you were watching the movie you should not miss any scene. If you watch with subtitle you won't miss any subtitle.When the credits came you must wait for a while.When the cast came,you will see which actor playing which character.",Null,1,5,11 November 2012
