Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Don't Believe The Critics
","The new Star Wars is better than what the critics have been saying - The movie doesn't quite match the hype, but could any movie? And no, it's not the best Star Wars, but it's the best movie I've seen for ages.None of the actors have any serious problems, and the special fx are incredible. It also has the coolest sword fights in any movie ever, although Darth Maul doesn't say much, he's still a villian to rival Darth Vader.If you're a Star Wars fan, be there, if you're not, be there you will be surprised, it's not done in the same style as the others, but is still worthy of being a part of the Star Wars universe.Cheers!",9,0,0,13 June 1999
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Excellent
","This movie does have its weird moments, but is damn funny. It just takes a little time to get used to the characters and what's going on. The story sort of reminded me of Pulp Fiction, but British. One of the top movies of the year, I enjoyed it more than Private Ryan, or any other Oscar nominated movies. If you like a good and time, and don't have any qualms about violence or drug use, this movie is more than worth seeing. A modern classic.",10,0,0,13 March 1999
