Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Story poor, effects exaggerated, Darth Maul ridiculous.
","What's wrong with good old George-Boy? Why did he do THIS(!) - this crapmovie?The colours in the Film - THESE MARSHMALLOW-COLOURS!!!Then this absolutely ridiculous DARTH MAUL - shining eyes, red skin and horns - ooohhh, how scary! (An adaption of the devil? - Oh my god...)Darth Vader looks like having been a Gay-Teen-Anakin!The fighting-scenes (double-lightsword!) are overdone and pure showmanship.The whole story is poor and there is a love-story no one really needs.All in all CRAP!",3,0,1,17 November 2004
