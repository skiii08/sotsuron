Miracle," If you like USA and hockey, you will like this. If not, this is not a movie for you!
","Hi there!This is a patriotic hockey film. So if you like USA and hockey, there is a big chance, that you will like this movie.If not, then this is not a movie for you. The acting and the story is OK i guess, but if you don't like people shouting USA the whole time, a angry hockey trainer thats shouting and hockey players simply playing hockey and train, there is no way, you will like this movie.Im not such a huge fan of hockey or the USA. I just like good films, with good actors, good stories, good music and so on.Therefore i will give this movie a 5/10!Over and out!",5,1,5,8 October 2016
The Maze Runner," Hungergames + lost = Terrible movie
","This Movie was a complete waste of time. The story is really terrible. I don't wanna give away the whole story, so I'm just gonna say that the reason they are stuck in the maze makes no sense at all. They could have just been trapped in some lab, in their one rooms but hey, lets make a giant maze with half robots, half monsters who wanna kill Everything.Makes no sense at all! Forget this Movie, its just a waste of time! I will not Watch this Movie again thats for sure. The actors are OK i guess. But i for one, wonder why they did not just make some ladders, they have been in the maze for 3 years and still not found the end of it. Just make some ladders and then they would see the whole maze and don't have to fight monsters to learn more. Simple and easy. But no, nobody there is smart enough to Think of that idea. Jesus Christ. Well i give the Movie 3 Points and hope somebody out there will enjoy it. But if you have a brain, there is a good chance you will find the story terrible like me and my friends did.
