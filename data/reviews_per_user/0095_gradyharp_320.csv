The Rock," 'Uh, yeah, okay, that's about the most awful thing I've ever seen.'
","That headliner line is not about the film - it is one of the funnier lines spoken by Nicholas Cage in this knockout movie. Almost twenty year old, this film - THE ROCK - remains one of the most entertaining and powerfully performed and produced action films in cinema history. Re-examining It today finds it still as fresh as ever - a film that keeps you on the edge of your seat with a solid story (David Weisberg, Douglas Cook, and Mark Rosner) and pitch perfect direction from Michael Bay. Yes, there are many special effects (pyrotechnics, underwater fighting, the recreation of the bowels of Alcatraz, etc), a dialogue that allows the intervention of comic relief in a situation that seems impossible to find humor, and some very fine performances by a huge cast of actors. It is an 'escape movie', both for the audience and for the story.Dr. Stanley Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage, in one of his better roles), who lives in Washington D.C., is a biochemist who works for the FBI. Soon after his fiancée Carla Pestalozzi (Vanessa Marcil) announces that she is pregnant, Stanley gets a call from FBI director James Womack (John Spencer). Womack tells Goodspeed that San Francisco's Alcatraz Island has been taken hostage, along with 81 tourists, by marine General Francis Xavier Hummel (Ed Harris) who, for years, has been protesting the government's refusal to pay benefits to families of war veterans who died during covert military operations. The death of his wife Barbara Hummel on March 9, 1995 drove General Hummel over the edge, and now he's holding hostages in order to get his point across. Goodspeed is needed because General Hummel has stolen some VX gas warheads and has announced that he will launch them onto San Francisco unless his demands are met. Goodspeed knows how to disarm the bombs, but he needs someone who knows Alcatraz well enough to get him inside and that someone is a former Alcatraz escapee James Patrick Mason (Sean Connery). The wise and experienced Mason and the nerdy brainy but intimidated Goodspeed make an odd couple but head to Alcatraz in an attempt to foil Hummel's terrorist scheme.The large supportive cast is populated with such actors as David Morse, William Forsythe, Bokeem Woodbine, Danny Nucci, Claire Forlani, Jim Caviezel, John Enos III, Richard Conti, Raymond Cruz and Philip Baker Hall. It is a bit long but never fails to keep your interest. A good old-fashioned Hollywood blockbuster action flick! Grady Harp",8,2,3,3 September 2012
Ford v Ferrari," 'We're lighter, we're faster, and if that don't work, we're nastier'
","James Mangold directs this historic visit to the 1960s, using the script written by Jez and John-Henry Butterworth and Jason Keller, and the result is a heart-pounding series of fast car racing events that surface as an entertaining film due to the presence of some very fine actors. Not only is it a recreation of the 1966 Le Mans event: it is also a penetrating statement about corporate behavior attempting to drown individual personal achievement!Briefly, American car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) battle corporate interference and the laws of physics to build a revolutionary race car for Ford in order to defeat Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966. The 'Ford' tent includes Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts), Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal), and Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas), and the Ferrari group is lead by Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone). Significant roles include Ken's wife Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) and their son Peter Miles (Noah Jupe), as well as Shelby's right hand man Phil Remington (Ray McKinnon).But towering over the entire epic are the acting chops of Mat Damon and Christian Bale, both of whom create fully three-dimensional roles that make the story come vividly to life. The film is overly long and at times self indulgent, but for fans of fast cars - and racing history - this film will more than satisfy.",8,2,3,23 February 2020
The King's Speech," Brilliant on Every Level!
","THE KING'S SPEECH is one of those rare films that rely on the brilliance of the actors to bring a story/screenplay alive. But the success of this extraordinary film does not stop there. This re-telling of history as written by David Seidler and as directed with enormous sensitivity by Tom Hooper, as captured on film by cinematographer Danny Cohen glows as a background for some of the finest acting before the public today. The film opens in 1925 as King George V (Michael Gambon) is beginning to fail, leaving the heir apparent to the throne at the time of his death to be Edward VIII (Guy Pearce), a man more concerned with love with the twice divorced Wallis Simpson (Eve Best) than he is with the Royal Lineage. Once the now senile George V dies, Edward VIII takes the throne but soon abdicates to marry Wallis. This passes the throne to the tender but severely stammering Prince Albert (Colin Firth), a man terrified of facing his beloved countrymen because of his speech defect - a defect that his wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) has encouraged him to correct through a series of speech doctors. Elizabeth hears of Australian émigré Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), a poor wannabe actor who gained his knowledge for correcting speech defects teaching returning WW I victims in Australia. Prince Albert (Bertie) and Logue meet and begin therapy by Logue's tough rules before Albert takes the throne. Through a series of rigorous exercises and lessons Logue helps the Prince learn to speak, finally accompanying him to the throne as a speech therapist and giving Bertie (now known as King George VI) the courage and strength to rise to the occasion of leading England through WW II. Though the above is a brief synopsis of the story, the real message of the film deals with the gradual building of a close friendship between Bertie and Logue - or between royalty and commoner. The manner in which Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush create this memorable relationship represents some of the finest acting in cinema history. The very large cast includes such luminaries as Claire Bloom as Queen Mary, Derek Jacobi as Archbishop Cosmo Lang, Jennifer Ehle as Logue's wife, Timothy Spall in a brilliant turn as Winston Churchill, Anthony Andrews as Stanley Baldwin, and Roger Parrott as Neville Chamberlain. Alexandre Desplat provides the original music allow heavy portions of Beethoven's 7th Symphony and Emperor Concerto (with Steven Osborne as piano soloist). This is a perfect film, well deserving to win the Oscars for every category for which it is nominated. Grady Harp",10,1,4,30 January 2011
Moneyball," Overrated
","MONEYBALL is gathering a lot of acclaim as an Oscar potential contender on several levels, so much so that for those who have little interest in baseball in general have overcome that inertia and have watched this film primarily out of devotion to the work of Brad Pitt. For this viewer the film is long on tedium, lacking in excitement and character involvement and focusing on the financial background of a sport that is supposed to be for the pleasure of the public. Yes, there are moments of interest in the concept of building a team based on saving money by hiring players who by statistics realized on a computer program show potential for building a solid team (as opposed to scouting for popular 'names' with the public and the media). These moments are underlined by the strong performance of Jonah Hill as Peter Brand, the Yale Economics graduate who comes up with 'the concept'.The story is based on Michal Lewis' book 'Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game' and adapted for the screen by Stan Chervin, Aaron Sorkin and Steven Zaillian. Bennett Miller directs. The story is basically a docudrama about the Oakland Athletic's General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) who is faced with the loss of the best payers of his team to scouts from other clubs with bigger dollars. If he ever wants to win the World Series, Billy must find a competitive advantage. Billy is about to turn baseball on its ear when he uses statistical data to analyze and place value on the players he picks for the team.Oakland A's GM Billy Beane is handicapped with the lowest salary constraint in baseball. If he ever wants to win the World Series, Billy must find a competitive advantage. Billy is about to turn baseball on its ear when he uses statistical data to analyze and place value on the players he picks for the team. The rest of the film is a push pull game played in the boardroom, with the manager (Philip Seymour Hoffman), and with certain players (Chris Pratt, Stephen Bishop et al). Tossed in for some reality testing is Billy's daughter Casey (Kerris Dorsey), ex-wife (Robin Wright), and a few encounters with reappearing people.The idea for the film is solid but it wears thin because it is so insular to Oakland. The fact that it is a true story (with a less than satisfying ending) probably will attract some viewers. It certainly is not Brad Pitt's best role to date, not does the film seem that it will have much holding power. But, if you are a fan of baseball it just may ring your chimes.

The Avengers," Loud, Long, 110% Special Effects
","Has the global situation grown so bleak that the populace has regressed to comic books for escapism entertainment? Judging by the enormous popularity of everything cinematic based on superheroes and sci-fi extravaganzas I suppose the answer is 'Yes!' To sit in one place for an excess of 2 ½ hours and witness the destruction derby that is the apocalyptic bad guys (in the form of a light spear carrying Loki (Tom Hiddleston) against Samuel L. Jackson's SHIELD cast of make-believe folks - Robert Downey, Jr in armor, Chris Evans in his Captain America Halloween costume, Mark Ruffalo unconvincingly transforming into the Hulk, Chris Hemsworth as hammer wielding Thor, Scarlett Johansson as a pretty Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye all out to make life sustainable for the leasers like Stellan Skarsgård, Clark Gregg, and Colbie Smulders - is a feat in itself.For movies of this type this one has more color and imaginative loco devices that most and therefore I suppose it remains at the top of the heap. When will these characters run out of tales? The answer likely is 'When the movie public stops ling up for these epics.' Grady Harp",4,13,25,30 September 2012
Angels & Demons," A Visually Spectacular Thriller - with not a lo of respect for the audience
","ANGELS & DEMONS would work well as a silent movie - well, a silent movie with the musical score of Hans Zimmer in the background. Cinematographer Salvatore Totino offers us views of Rome and Vatican City, both from the exterior and from the historically significant interiors, that are as stunning as any on film. The actors look well and seem as involved as the creaky script by David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman have pasted together from Dan Brown's first (in a probably endless line) novel allows about the derring-do of symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks reprising his role from The Da Vinci Code). But while the story is interesting - illuminating the Illuminati's centuries old plight to force the Catholic church to accept scientific reasoning instead of condemning it - and while Ron Howard as director does his best to give us a fast-paced thriller, the dialogue dumbs down the audience by the simplistic, hurriedly discovered answers to the meaning of symbols that drive this story. Dan Brown's novel gave the reader some breathing time to digest the ancient codes and incorporate them into the action: Ron Howard's film condenses the important findings in favor of emphasizing special effects and splendid footage of the inner chambers of St Peter's and the various churches that become destination points for the murders of the 'preferiti' cardinals gathered to elect a new pope after the surprise demise of the current pope. The cast includes some fine, interesting faces and actors - Ewan McGregor as the recently dead Pope's camerlengo, Stellan Skarsgård as the suspicious Commander Richter, a very beautiful but bland Ayelet Zurer as the sole female scientist Vittoria Vetra who understands the importance of rescuing the 'antimatter' that threatens the end of the church and a good part of the territory around Rome, Armin Mueller- Stahl as the crusty old Cardinal Strauss, Pierfrancesco Favino as the Inspector Olivetti, and the always fascinating character actor Nikolaj Lie Kaas as the assassin - but Tom Hanks' Robert Langdon rattles off his obsession with ecclesiastic symbology with such speed and nonchalance that the mysteries become almost insignificant to the audience who simply go along with the patter. It is a mad chase of a film, fortunately treating the audience to some wondrous scenery and lighting effects. As a film it is entertaining, but then that was the purpose of the book, too. It just feels like it not as fully realized a mystery as would be possible in different hands. Grady Harp",7,0,0,29 November 2009
First Man," 'It'll be an adventure'
","One of the most memorable quotes in the past hundred years is the familiar 'That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind' - the words we all heard when Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon on July 20, 1969. James' R. Hansen's book has been adapted for the screen by Josh Singer and the film is directed by Damien Chazelle (La La Land, Whiplash).The film covers the years 1961 - 1969 in the life of Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling), beginning with Armstrong's trials as a pilot and proceeds through his training for the Gemini mission and the famous moon landing. Along the way the psyche of the astronaut is explored by revealing his interactions with his wife Janet (Claire Foy) and terminally ill daughter Karen (Lucy Stafford), his friend and fellow astronaut Ed White (Jason Clarke) and his wife Pat (Olivia Hamilton) whose lives alter Neil's perception of his mission. Nods are given to Buzz Aldrin (Corey Stoll), Elliot See (Patrick Fugit) and other very small cameos.Much of the film is very loud, with all the harrowing tension that accompanies the launching and flight of spacecraft extended to near the breaking point. The facts are there but what is missing is a storyline that allows the audience to accompany Armstrong's historic mission. It is a noisy adventure with rather flat performances by the main characters, but it does encourage recall of that momentous day in 1969 with reality.",7,1,3,17 March 2019
Black Swan," White Jekyll to Black Hyde
","BLACK SWAN is a clinical examination of psychosis vs borderline personality dichotomy and as such it succeeds well. It is not unusual for director Darren Aronofsky to plunge into controversial subject matter ('Requiem for a Dream', 'The Wrestler', 'Pi', 'The Fountain') but his mastery of a new zone of cinematic investigation of mental illness based on a story by Andrés Heinz who also wrote the screenplay with Mark Heyman and John McLaughlin is his most daring work yet. BLACK SWAN is as disturbing a film to watch as it is a richly rewarding testament to storytelling based on age-old themes. The setting is a ballet company preparing a new version of the familiar Petipa and Ivanov choreography of the ballet Swan Lake, a story based on Russian folktales about a young girl transformed into a white swan ('Odette') and the darker malevolent black swan ('Odile') who under spells from the evil Rothbart vie for the love of Prince Siegfried. The choreographer Thomas (Vincent Cassel) must retire the reigning white swan queen (Winona Ryder) because of her age and has tryouts for a new swan queen. The shy, introverted, frightened but excellent dancer Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) seems perfect for Thomas' new concept of the white swan, but she lacks the visceral and sensual passion for the extension of the role as the black swan. Nina is the daughter of a frustrated ex-ballerina Erica Sayers (Barbara Hershey) who gave birth to Nina and missed out on becoming a prima ballerina. Erica is controlling and forces Nina into rigorous training and discipline so that Nina will become the star Erica failed to realize. Nina devotes her life to ballet, participates in behaviors such as self mutilation that suggest she is an unstable personality. Thomas continues to attempt to bring out Nina's passionate personality but the attempts become Nina's obsessive delusions regarding her fear of being unable to be perfect: she imagines all manner of events and body changes, finding that her only friend Lily (Mila Kunis) leads her into an even more distorted lifestyle - or does she... The manner in which Nina transforms herself into the black swan is breathtaking and the climax of the film leaves the audience wondering about the real ending versus another version of Nina's broken mind. The cast is excellent, with Natalie Portman (who trained into her own balletic role so that she could perform Odette/Odile credibly) delivering a brilliant performance as the fragile, vulnerable, mentally disturbed Nina. Her partner in the ballet, David, dancing the role of the Prince, is Benjamin Millepied - a remarkably magnetic actor/dancer with whom Portman is now engaged and pregnant. Vincent Cassel and Barbara Hershey raise their characters to an even higher level than the script - wholly and terrifyingly credible. At times Aronofsky could have used some restraint in showing the repeated delusions of Nina's broken mind and the impact would have been a bit more subtle. Mathew Libatique provides elegant cinematography and Clint Mansell reinterprets the Tchaikovsky score - sometimes it works, other times it is maddenly warped: the most successful plagiarism is in the piano-only reduction during the credits. But the overall impact at film's end is a stunning work and a tribute to the talent of Natalie Portman. Grady Harp",10,5,11,14 February 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Some New Twists, but it is all about Johnny Depp as it should be!
","Part Four of the Disney money soup and the concept keeps riding high. Not a whole lot of story here, this version is more just allowing a group of terrific actors to strut their stuff in hilarious semi-drag and play it for what it was meant to be - Disney entertainment. Johnny Depp continues to be the raison d'etre for the project and he is in fine form with antics that include a lot of sword play and harrowing escapes, and yet all the while maintaining that inimitable twinkle of the eye that makes these films fly.Some new folk are around - Penélope Cruz is lovely and lush but without a whole lot to do in this search for Ponce de Leon's site of the Fountain of Youth. Ian McShane is the peg-legged Blackbeard, Geofffrey Rush hams it up as Barbossa, and Richard Griffiths has a terrific time as the blubbery old fop King George - a role that deserves some awards for best supporting actor. The show is mighty and loud - Hans Zimmer's musical score drowns out most of the dialogue, but then that is no great problem as the dialogue is secondary to the action. In all this is a rather long in the tooth production, but with the likes of Johnny Depp having the obvious raging good time it is entertaining. Keep lots of popcorn handy....Grady Harp",Null,0,2,22 October 2011
The New World," Awe: The Quiet Curiosity and Fear When Worlds First Meet
","Terrence Malick is a master of understatement and it is that quality of his writing and directing that makes THE NEW WORLD so luminous an experience for the viewer. Though the historical material in this film has been told and written and filmed to exhaustion, Malick finds that awe and wonder as the Old World of the King James' England puts ashore on the pure and unsoiled land of Virginia of 1607 to an audience of naively innocent 'naturals' who are as fascinated with the arrivals of the visitors as the English are curious yet fearful of the 'savages' they may face in this new place. This is an interior film that just happens to be filmed in the wonders of the meadows and rivers and seaside of nature resplendent.Malick has wisely elected to have the meeting between the naturals and the English remain in their own languages: the Indians speak a beautiful language that is not translated for the audience, a fact that adds to the feeling of 'the other' on both sides. And it is this separateness that makes the story credible. Upon landing Captain Newport (Christopher Plummer) cancels the scheduled hanging of Captain John Smith (Colin Farrell) and sets rules for the newly formed Jamestown, which he soon leaves to return to England, leaving Captain Smith in charge. It is Smith's duty to meet with the naturals in an attempt to gain needed food supplies. The magic that occurs with this meeting of 'the stranger' with the naturals is the epitome of discovery. Smith is saved from execution by the Chief Powhatan's (August Schellenberg) favored daughter Pocahontas (Q'Orianka Kilcher) and lives with the naturals, learning their innocence of spirit and falling in love with Pocahontas.But Smith is returned to his fort, suffers misadventures among his own men, sustains attacks by the disenchanted naturals, and eventually returns to England, telling his friend to inform Pocahontas that he has drowned. Pocahontas is outcast from her community because of her kindness to the English and is placed in Jamestown where she is 'assimilated' by the new arrival of English. Among the new arrivals is John Rolfe (Christian Bale) who falls in love with Pocahontas and though she does not love Rolfe she consents to the arranged marriage because Rolfe is kind and because she believes her beloved Smith to be dead. The two have a child and Rolfe takes his little family to England where Pocahontas is presented at court for her invaluable aid to the English. She discovers Smith is still alive, dies, and Rolfe and son return to Jamestown. No spoilers, these: this is historically accurate reporting of stories we have all known from grade school.All of this majestic story is told primarily in silence with the stream of conscious dialogue from each character spoken in voice over. The sounds of nature accompany the action in an eerily perfect manner. Many have praised James Horner's musical score for this film and it is a score that contributes to the beauty of the film: the fact is there is little original music here, the use of Wagner's 'Das Rheingold' accompanies the extended opening and recurs for the big moments while Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 23 is used extensively for the quiet moments. Yes, it works, but there is not much other original music to praise.But that is the only quibble with those who have raved about this film. It does weave its spell under Malick's understanding eye and is beautifully cast with first-rate actors who are asked to render their characters physically and with their eyes rather than words. Farrell, Kilcher, Bale, Thewlis, Plummer and the large supporting cast are exemplary. What, then, Malick has given us in this majestic film is that sense of wonder of the unknown, the thin thread between curiosity and threat that spins the coming together of cultures. And that sense of awe is still propelling the forces of the world today. If only all such interactions would hold the respect of this initial encounter. Highly recommended.

Frost_Nixon," The Rise and Fall of Showmen
","FROST/NIXON is one of the most successful screen adaptations of a play yet made. Perhaps that is due in part to the fact that the popular stage play by Peter Morgan was revised for the screen by the playwright, but it is also to the credit of director Ron Howard who managed to suffuse the 'play as movie' with such atmosphere and feeling of spontaneity that the rather long movie seems to whisk by more rapidly than history! Everyone knows of the infamous David Frost interview with Richard Nixon after Nixon had resigned office and was living in semi-seclusion in San Clemente, California, a bitter man struggling with the demons not only form the recent past but also form his childhood. Frost took on the challenge to bring the perpetrator of the Watergate scandal to his knees to satisfy the American public's need for retribution, and in conducting these interviews he did indeed achieve that. The story is as much a character study of Frost as it is of Nixon and the parallels writer Morgan uncovers makes the film far more than a quasi-documentary. This is real drama played for all it's worth. Frank Langella is unforgettable in his portrayal of Nixon as is Michael Sheen as Frost, each actor having played the roles on Broadway and transferring that depth of understanding to the screen. The surprise in this film is the use of the peripheral cast of characters - Kevin Bacon, Oliver Platt, Sam Rockwell, Matthew Macfadyen, and Toby Jones - a group of actors who light the darker corners of the story with aplomb. FROST/NIXON should be required viewing for every Political Science major in our schools - and hopefully will urge the nation to find a similar manner to bring closure to the strangely coincidental machinations of the recent Bush administration crimes.

Walk the Line," Much Ado Over Not Very Much
","Rarely has a biopic film made such a racket at the box office. After viewing the DVD version of WALK THE LINE the reasons for that success must be attached to some sort of homage to Johnny Cash, an American icon of sorts. Yes, his life and career are notable - the emergence of a legendary Country Western singer out of the elements of a warped childhood peaked by the accidental death of his older brother whom the father clearly preferred, and the torture of self doubt that haunted a man through an unsuccessful marriage and a thwarted love for fellow Country Western singer June Carter, his descent into alcohol and drugs, and his final victory over his demons - but isn't this the same story we see almost annually about famous stars whose backgrounds seem templates from this same mold? Joaquin Phoenix is a fine actor and has the courage to take on a variety of roles, succeeding in them all. And yes, he was able to sound like Johnny Cash (given the fact that even Cash's fans will admit it was not a voice of quality but of message). Much the same could be said for Reese Witherspoon's tackling successfully the equally mediocre quality voice of June Carter - again it was her sassy style that made her a star, not her voice. And perhaps that is the reason the writers and director elected to spend most of the screen time on the singing and concerts of Cash and Carter - leaving very little of the story of Cash's life except to outline form between songs.But if you condensed the actual acting time on the screen it falls into the overly familiar family clashes, drunken bouts, weaning off drugs, spats and eventual public displays of feelings that seem to be the formula for this genre of biopic. Though Phoenix and to an extent Witherspoon do well with the material they are given, does the result merit Oscar attention? That is up to the voters. It seems to this viewer that there have been many finer performances by less publicized actors in the smaller films more worthy. But then what are the Oscars for if not for PR for the movies. Just not that impressed. Grady Harp",5,24,41,2 March 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," 'Comedy ceases to be funny when it is demeaning'
","Curiosity drove this viewer to see BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF America FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN. Especially when the Golden Globe nominations pegged both the film and the star as candidates for potential honors!!!! And though many very fine reviewers find this film worthy of praise, the response after viewing the piece in a theater packed with people howling with laughter - again, for this viewer - was one of being appalled.Comedy is an art, an art that magnifies human foibles and allows a different viewpoint to make even sad aspects of life appear humorous. Dark comedy can be cruel when the writing is acerbically witty and smart. What BORAT seems to have done is costume and scene change a standup comedy routine bent on grossing out its audience and choosing a demeaning manner instead of a parody to lash out at the multiple groups it attacks, be those the people of Kazakhstan, Pentacostal Holiness churches, drunk sexist/racist teenagers, feminists, businessmen, actors, Jews, homosexuals, rodeo folks, genteel Southerners, TV talk show hosts/weathermen, etc.Production wise the filming is crude, the storyline is plotted to look as though it were spontaneous candid camera takes (yet credits a long list of writers including Cohen), and the flatline character of Borat is as predictable as the potty mouth humor it accompanies. But apparently the public wants this type of entertainment on the screens: the film is raking in millions for the effrontery of Sacha Baron Cohen. Have we really arrived at a state where our choices range from comic book hero flicks to gory slasher flicks to the base, crude, and thoughtless antics of extended comedy hour routines? Food for thought, but this viewer is obviously in the tiny minority. Grady Harp",2,18,35,18 December 2006
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," 'A wandering minstrel I --A thing of shreds and patches..'
","That quote form a Gilbert and Sullivan lyric defines this movie's appearance. Remember that particular pleasure of reading Arthur Conan Doyle's intelligent and vastly entertaining stories about a man and his sidekick whose braininess unraveled impossible mysteries that no one else could solve? That man was Sherlock Holmes and his sidekick was Dr. Watson, and neither of the ghosts of those two fascinating and intelligent gentlemen can be found in this lengthy, boring mess of a film that seems to be concerned only with action movie clones so popular today and setting in a period that allows beautiful costumes to hide the lack of story. Michele Mulroney and Kieran Mulroney are responsible for hiding behind famous literary characters to create a script that is likely less than 5 pages long. Guy Ritchie is the star of this noisy piece.Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey, Jr.) and his longtime trusted associate, Doctor Watson (Jude Law), take on their arch-nemesis, Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris), with the help of Holmes's older brother Mycroft Holmes (Stephen Fry) and a gypsy named Simza (Noomi Rapace). Now make a movie-long story out of that and you have the second installment (and hopefully the last) of Sherlock Holmes a la Guy Ritchie. The endless fighting on the screen is also populated by some fine actors such as Rachel McAdams, Eddie Marsan, and Kelly Reilly. If the viewer is entertained by the countless costume changes by Robert Downey, Jr. and by some fairly silly swashbuckling by all concerned then perhaps the two hours will pass quickly. But in the end there is simply no story or resemblance to the creations of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to warrant plagiarism of his books. Pass. Grady Harp",3,1,2,16 June 2012
The Monuments Men," 'It was the greatest art heist in history'
","Something went wrong in transforming history onto the big screen. Based on a book by Robert M. Edsel and Bret Witter and adapted for the screen by director George Clooney and Grant Heslov, this true story gets all Hallmarky despite the theme and a fine cast. The problem is that the mystery has been removed and in its place are series of actor shots paying homage to the real monuments men of history. As a result we really don't get to know about any of them and the mission becomes a game, a dangerous and courageous at times game, but a game nevertheless.Based on the premise of Clooney's character Frank Stokes, 'You can wipe out an entire generation, you can burn their homes to the ground and somehow they'll still find their way back. But if you destroy their history, you destroy their achievements and it's as if they never existed. That's what Hitler wants and that's exactly what we are fighting for' the film concerns the gathering of a groups of arts oriented men to rescue art masterpieces from Nazi thieves following WW II and return them to their owners. It is based a true story The Monuments Men is 'an action drama focusing on an unlikely World War II platoon, tasked by FDR with going into Germany to rescue artistic masterpieces from Nazi thieves and returning them to their rightful owners. It would be an impossible mission: with the art trapped behind enemy lines, and with the German army under orders to destroy everything as the Reich fell, how could these guys - seven museum directors, curators, and art historians, all more familiar with Michelangelo than the M-1 - possibly hope to succeed? But as the Monuments Men, as they were called, found themselves in a race against time to avoid the destruction of 1000 years of culture, they would risk their lives to protect and defend mankind's greatest achievements.' The hoopla from Sony so states. The cast includes George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Bob Balaban and Hugh Bonneville as the disparate rescue squad. The best performance in the film is Cate Blanchett's well considered role as Clara Simone, the only one who seems to have an original idea in her mind. Dimitri Leonidas impresses in a small but significant role of a Jew who stays in company with the Monuments Men. It could have been written better and acted with more commitment, but as a movie it is good entertainment.",5,0,1,23 May 2014
Mission: Impossible III," Mission Impossible III goes more for Noise and Effects than Cunning Intelligence
","The reason for the success of MI I and MI II, for this viewer, was the sophisticated, scientific devices and plans used to manipulate evil by good. It was always a pleasure to watch the superior minds win. But somehow MI III seems far more interested in pyrotechniques and mass explosions and derring-do than for smart ideas and for that reason it seems less successful - but then that may be the result of watching it on the home television instead of the vast spaces of a theatrical screen.The story is negligibly the same as usual: impossible villain is superseded finally by Ethan Hunt. The role still fits Tom Cruise well, if a bit repetitious, but the strong point of this third installment is the supporting cast. We have the pleasure of Philip Seymour Hoffman's acting gifts as the arch villain, and the added pleasure of fine actors like Billy Crudup, Ving Rhames, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Laurence Fishburne and the beauty of Michelle Monaghan, Keri Russell, and Maggie Q. And when they are not all covered by fire and broken glass and whirling helicopters and collapsing bridges etc they do make us notice them.Not a movie for those who prefer intelligent scripts, but for an evening's diversion it is entertaining, Grady Harp",7,0,0,30 October 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," A Surprise...of the Good Kind!
","Reviewing films encourages following the opinions of fellow reviewers whose thoughts nail movies dead center: often reading reviews by certain reviewers encourages or discourages this reviewer regarding a controversial film. Reading some thoughts about how particularly disappointing this film almost precludes watching it: happily a coincidence encouraged viewing such a film that for this viewer was fascinating and satisfying.The production crew of this thriller worked overtime to make a style: the film is filled with metaphorical circles in the wallpaper, the decor, the steps, the room designs - each pointing a sturdy finger to the story's meaning from the very beginning. But along the way the writing and pacing of this high-octane film zoom past the eye with twists, turns, interlocked relationships, and character development that waits for the end for the payoff. To say more would probably alter the good chase fun the movie provides in its ending.The film is one of the bloodiest and goriest of the season, but it all serves the purpose of exposing crime at its pinnacle. The good guys are difficult to separate from the bad guys in this case of mistaken identity that spurs mayhem. But the cast is at all times stylishly active: Josh Harnett, Lucy Liu, Danny Aiello, Morgan Freeman, Sir Ben Kingsley, Stanley Tucci, Kevin Chamberlin, Dorian Missick, Mykelti Williamson, and of course Bruce Willis.

Captain Phillips," 'It was supposed to be easy. I take ship...ransom...nobody get hurt.'
","Though based on Richard Phillips' book 'A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALS, and Dangerous Days at Sea' which is the true story of Captain Richard Phillips and the 2009 hijacking by Somali pirates of the US-flagged MV Maersk Alabama, the first American cargo ship to be hijacked in two hundred years, the screenplay by Billy Ray (The Hunger Games, State of Play, Color of Night) is so brilliantly written that the 134 minutes of this 'docu- drama' tear through the mind at terrifying speed and there is not a moment when the audience can breathe without fear of missing the action. Of course, much of that is due to the impeccable direction by Paul Greengrass (The Bourne series, United 93, Green Zone, etc), but the kudos land directly for the extraordinary performance by Tom Hanks, in what many of us believe is his finest performance on film, along with 'Philadelphia'.Because it is history, everyone knows the story: a multi-layered examination of the 2009 hijacking of the U.S. container ship Maersk Alabama by a crew of Somali pirates. The film focuses on the relationship between the Alabama's commanding officer, Captain Richard Phillips (Hanks), and the Somali pirate captain, Muse (Barkhad Abdi), who takes him hostage. Phillips and Muse are set on a predestined collision course when Muse and his crew target Phillips' unarmed ship. In the breathtaking standoff, 145 miles off the Somali coast, both men find themselves at the mercy of forces beyond their control.Greengrass had the right idea in casting completely unknown non-actors as the Somali pirate crew: Barkhad Abdi (born in Somalia but living in the US and serving as a chauffeur when he was cast with no acting experience at all), Barkhad Abdirahman, Faysal Ahmed, and Mahat M. Ali – each is wholly credible in the tense drama both on the big ship and in the claustrophobic life boat where they hold Captain Phillips hostage. The entire cast is very well enacted, keeping the tension and the sense of terror at facing a battle for which they have never been trained.This is a superb piece of filmmaking and why it was snubbed by the Oscar nominations is a conundrum.

The Perks of Being a Wallflower," 'We accept the love we think we deserve.'
","Major question: why did this perfectly crafted, intelligently written and acted, touching little film not get nominated for an Oscar? It has all the ingredients of one of the finest films of the year - script based on the writer's own novel by the same name and directed by him, too - Stephen Chbosky - and a superb cast of young actors (and some excellent veteran actors such as Joan Cusack and Dylan McDermot and Paul Rudd, all playing against the slot roles into which others have stuck them), and makes many points about teenage angst and how the schism between teenagers and adults has become a chasm rarely navigable. But, as in current terminology, 'go figure!'Very briefly, the story set in the early 1990s in Pittsburgh is about 15-year-old Charlie (20 year old Logan Lerman), an endearing and naïve outsider, coping with first love, the suicide of his best friend, and his own mental illness while struggling to find a group of people with whom he belongs. The introvert freshman is taken under the wings of two seniors, Sam (22 year old Emma Watson) and Patrick (19 year old Ezra Miller), who are step-siblings and welcome him to the real world. Into this ménage enter Brad (Johnny Simmons), the football hero who happens to be a deeply closeted gay boy in an affair with the openly gay Patrick, Charlie's sister Candace (Nina Dobrey) and her abusive boyfriend Ponytale Derek (Nicholas Braun), Charlie's parents (Dylan McDermott and Kate Walsh), the influential English teach Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd) and the psychiatrist Dr. Burton (Joan Cusack).The story is complex as Charlie writes to his 'friend' and slowly reveals the secrets of his background that make him a loner 'who finds loneliness unbearable, a friend who feels his friends deserve better than they get but cannot bring himself to feel that he does too. He can rise fiercely to the occasion when his friends are threatened but is as fragile as glass when the secrets he carries buried deep inside threaten to overwhelm him.' The manner in which each of the characters change in the course of this story manages to be at once credible as well as entertaining. This is a deeply touching film that deserves a very wide audience. One of the finest films of 2012. Grady Harp",10,5,12,26 February 2013
3:10 to Yuma," Understanding why Westerns are a National Treasure
","If there is a truly unique American contribution to film making then that contribution has to be the Western. Though not as popular a theme these days as it was in past decades, it only takes a powerhouse film such as 3:10 TO YUMA to remind us just how pungent storytelling of this type can be. Yes, the story itself (based on a short story by Elmore Leonard) is rather simple: desperate farmer needs money to save his failing farm and family and signs on to escort a powerful outlaw to the train that will take him to prison. But in this screen adaptation by Halsted Welles, Michael Brandt, and Derek Haas the story is fleshed out by sharing with the audience the essence of the pioneer spirit and the sequelae of the Civil War on the minds of the dispossessed who turned to crime against the ruling order - the railroads and the banks represented the conquering North - and the film becomes one of profound understanding about man's plight in the pioneer West.The landscape and atmosphere of Arizona is captured with dusty accuracy by cinematographer Phedon Papamichael and sets the stage for director James Mangold ('Girl, Interrupted', 'Walk the Line', 'Identity', 'Kate and Leopold', 'Cop Land') to work with his talented cast to give a realistic view of life in the hard times of the old West. Russell Crowe is the notorious outlaw Ben Wade whose gang includes such actors as Ben Foster and Rio Alexander and once he is captured during a robbery, the local sheriff promises to pay $200. to destitute, crippled farmer Dan Evans to escort the prisoner to Contention, AZ for catching a ride to the 3:10 to Yuma and prison. The connection between the two disparate men - Wade and Evans - is the message of the story and is beautifully enhanced by allowing the audience to understand both sides of 'the law'. The co-stars of the film include Gretchen Mol as Evans' wife and young Logan Lerman as Evans' impressionable son William, Dallas Roberts as the head of the bank investment at risk, Peter Fonda, Alan Tudyk, Vinessa Shaw and a large cast of the people who interplay in the drama.Both Crowe and Bale give superlative performances, acting so cohesively that it would be difficult to single out either for the Oscar: this is ensemble acting at its finest. For once the added features enhance our appreciation of the tales from the Old West and how they became legends and the comments by the director, producers and cast actually make sense! The film will doubtless become a classic: it deserves the honor. Grady Harp",10,4,8,9 January 2008
The Equalizer," 'When you pray for rain, you gotta deal with the mud too.'
","Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, Shooter, Olympus has Fallen, etc) has rethought and adopted the television series by the same name (Michael Sloan and Richard Lindheim) with a script by Richard Wenk into a movie that is so well made that it shows every actor in the film at his/her best. Yes, it is violent, but the violence is directed at those evil men who benefit from the misery of others, never being arrested and never submitting to punishment.Robert McCall (Denzel Washington in one of his finest roles) believes he has put his mysterious past behind him and has dedicated himself to beginning a new, quiet life in Boston, Massachusetts. He is methodical and supportive and works at the Home Mart store, frequently helping his co-workers. Every night, McCall goes to a diner to read a book and drink tea, and he befriends the teenager Russian prostitute Teri (Chloë Grace Moretz), the alias of Alina. One night, Alina's pimp Slavi (David Meunier) brutally beats her and she goes to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the local hospital. McCall goes to the Russian restaurant where Slavi is and offers US$ 9,800.00 for the freedom of Alina. However Slavi does not accept the offer and McCall kills him and his four bodyguards. The Russian mafia kingpin Vladimir Pushkin sends the cruel enforcer Teddy (Marton Csokas – in an exceptionally fine performance) to find who killed his men. Soon he finds that McCall is the one who killed the mobster and Teddy begins a war against him. McCall may have a mysterious past but he has become a 'Robin Hood' hit man who destroys those people who prey on others and in doing so he changes the lives of those for whom he is the benefactor. The plot is appropriately complex, involving bad cops, the FBI, the Russian gangs and their multiple crime influences of human and drug and oil trafficking. The excellent cast includes Johnny Skourtis as Ralphie – the obese lad Robert McCall guides to a better life, Melissa Leo in a very brief but poignant role, Bill Pullman, David Harbour, Haley Bennett, etc. After a fine and tense drama the film is all but ruined by the wholly unnecessary noisy Rap music that destroys the mood during the credits. Despite this, this is a very fine film, overlooked for some reason.",Null,0,0,2 January 2015
Source Code," Well Crafted Thriller
","SOURCE CODE has an element that is lacking in too many of the Hollywood CGI sci-fi experimental movies that are so very cloned these day - humanity. Much of the credit for this quality comes from the intelligent and imaginative writing of Ben Ripley and the tight direction by Duncan Jones, but the main reason this film works so well is the presence of charismatic and fine acting by Jake Gyllenhaal. The story borders on the obtuse: a device has been invented by Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) that can maintain a person in a state of recall much the way a light bulb has a glow after it has been extinguished. Rutledge has placed helicopter pilot Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal), who is missing in action in Afghanistan, in a capsule that is capable, under the direction of military officer Goodwin (Vera Farmiga), of projecting Stevens onto a train entering Chicago that has been planted with a bomb in order to discover the perpetrator who is apparently planning another bomb that will decimate the city of Chicago. It is a back and forth series of 8 minute exercises, each time Stevens relives the moments before a bomb detonation and gradually learns the the device and its owner. On board the train he meets Christina (Michelle Monaghan) who 'sees' Stevens as her boyfriend Sean and during these repeat flashbacks Stevens and Christina form a bond that makes Stevens re-think his 'purpose' in this military gimmicky. *In the hands of the wrong people this little venture would seem trite and silly, but with this crew of creators it becomes a puzzle that touches on tension, fear, humor, and warmth. That is what a superb cast can do with any material, but with this particular strange tale it works perfectly. Grady Harp",9,0,1,9 July 2011
Skyfall," 'Some men are coming to kill us. We're going to kill them first.'
","James Bond devotees will get their fix in this excitingly sculpted story that takes 007 to a new level. Following the shenanigans of James Bond movies has as part of its reward the opportunity to see some of Britain's finest actors with a smattering of other countries polished veterans as well. The usual Bond formula - absurdly impossible chases and fights, scenic splendor form around the globe, beautiful women in daring roles, and the blur between justice and revenge - are all present.When James Bond (Daniel Craig, buff and strong as usual) mismanages his latest assignment in Turkey etc - the unsuccessful chase of Patrice (Ola Rapace) despite the very fine support of agent Eve (Naomie Harris) and the sidetrack of Sévérine (Bérénice Marlohe), Britain's agents around the world are exposed and MI6 is attacked forcing M (Judi Dench) to relocate the agency. These events cause her authority and position to be challenged by Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), the new Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee. With MI6 now compromised from both inside and out, M is left with one ally she can trust: Bond. With the aid of MI6 computer geek Q (Ben Wishaw) 007 takes to the shadows aided only by Eve and follows a bizarre set of clues to the secret island where the slimy Silva (a blond wigged Javier Bardem) is plotting his lethal and hidden motives that have yet to reveal themselves in the very place where Bond began - Skyfall, his Scottish home still managed by his old friend Kincade (Albert Finney). In perhaps the most spectacular (and loud) pyrotechnical exhibition of the Bond 23 films to date (more to come, we discover), the film simmers to an end.Sam Mendes directs this very long but tensely exciting global travelogue of violence and Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and John Logan pepper the script with enough humor and clever lines to keep the audience entertained on a more cerebral level. The cast is uniform strong, with Daniel Craig, Javier Bardem, and Judi Dench in full control of their lead responsibilities and supported by the fine acting of Naomie Harris, Ralph Fiennes, Albert Finney and Ben Wishaw in the smaller roles. If you love James Bond You'll love this. Most critics are saying it is the finest of the Bond series...so where does it go from here? Grady Harp, January 13",8,1,4,22 January 2013
The Young Victoria," This Year's Costume Period Piece
","THE YOUNG VICTORIA is a elegantly costumed and reproduced bit of history that benefits from some fine settings, solid direction by Jean-Marc Vallée of stalwart Julian Fellowes' version of the youthful lass who was to become England's longest reigning monarch - Victoria. Much of the early portion of the film, that part when Victoria is a child whose ascent to the throne is contested by her mother (Miranda Richardson) and Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong) seems to drag and get lost in the multiple costumes and scenery variations. But once Victoria (Emily Blunt) comes of age and is courted by Prince Albert (Rupert Friend) the film blooms. Blunt is a strong actress and finds that delicate line between girlish infatuation and royal dignity that makes her a fine foil for those at court who would seek to control the 'child queen' - including her secretary Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). But as she matures into her role as queen her eye dwells on the dashing German Prince Albert, and a love affair that has lasted in the memories of everyone is matched by the concept of joining Royalty with concern for the care of her subjects - much due to the sensitivity of Albert. The film takes us to the birth of their first of nine children and then ends with some statements about the influence of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert's effect on the various Royalties throughout Europe! It makes for an evening of beautiful costume drama and allows us to appreciate the growth of two young stars in Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend. A solid if not transporting epic.

The Hangover," 'Where have all the good films gone - long time passing'
","THE HANGOVER apparently swept the country, touted as the funniest film ever made. And indeed the proof of its success lies in the fact that THE HANGOVER 2 is in post-production. So there is more on the way. The question arises, 'more what?' Apparently resting on the information gathered from television sitcoms and other raunchy potty mouth movies like 'Borat' etc., there is an audience for films that pose middle aged men as men in their 20s performing acts that are more like boys in their misbegotten teens. It is amazing that these films that put down African Americans (like the manipulation of Mike Tyson and the dumb drug dealer character 'Black Doug' portrayed by Mike Epps) and Asian Americans (like the foolish over-the-top fop of 'Mr Chow' by Jen Keong, etc etc etc are not confronted. But then it may appear that all is fair in cinema 'comedy'. The premise is that four friends go to Las Vegas for a bachelor party before the wedding of the most mild of them all. Bradley Cooper (a teacher), Ed Helms (a dentist), Zach Galifianakis (the obese mentally disturbed brother of the bride) and Justin Bartha (the groom to be) spend one lost night of doped drunken misadventures and wake up in an hotel suite with a chicken, a tiger, a mess, hangovers and amnesia, and a missing groom. The remainder of the film is simple the antics of these broken down individuals attempting to find the groom and to right some infractions of behavior. Is that funny? Well, apparently to the vast number of people who see this film it is. So here comes the next installment in what will likely be a long line of gross-out sequels. Meanwhile the beautiful adult movies languish in oblivion. To this we've come? Grady Harp",2,10,20,29 May 2010
Iron Man 3," 'I'm Tony Stark. I build neat stuff, got a great girl, occasionally save the world. So why can't I sleep?'
","And they just keep coming down the pikeWhen will the obsession with Marvel Comic Book heroes/heroines fizzle? Obviously not in the near future as this comic book recreation IRON MAN 3 has made almost as much money as HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE - $1,215,439,994 and counting. Money talks and in this case it shouts, so we are likely in for more Iron Man episodes. 'A bomb is not a bomb when it's a misfire.' This quote form the film is cogent in that it nods to the feeling of some viewers. The plot is more about 'things' than story but in case a story line is needed then the following help decipher the reason this movie takes over 2 hours to tell: 'IRON MAN 3 pits brash-but-brilliant industrialist Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) against an enemy Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) and his 'front' 'Mandarin' (Ben Kingsley) whose reach knows no bounds. When Stark finds his personal world destroyed at his enemy's hands, he embarks on a harrowing quest to find those responsible. This journey, at every turn, will test his mettle. With his back against the wall, Stark is left to survive by his own devices, relying on his ingenuity and instincts to protect those closest to him. As he fights his way back, Stark discovers the answer to the question that has secretly haunted him: does the man make the suit or does the suit make the man?' That makes the film sound like it has a tale to tell.Actually the writing (Drew Pearce, Shane Black, Stan Lee, Don Heck, Larry Lieber, Jack Kirby, Warren Ellis, Adi Granov – whew!) tosses some terrific one-liners that do entertain, but the main character is the special effects crew. Actors Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Rebecca Hall, Jon Favreau, Ty Simpkins, Paul Bettany's voice and a host of real TV personalities help the derring-do do, and likely in 3D this is quick a show. But these escapism films are wearing thin – except in the pocket books of the producers. Grady Harp, January 14",5,1,3,12 January 2014
Marie Antoinette," As Beautiful as a Fabrege Egg and as Empty
","Sofia Coppola offers another look at history's infamous Marie Antoinette, the premise being that she was in life just a simple young Austrian girl delivered to France as a political queen candidate, who liked pretty things, loved children, flowers, clothes, shopping, and sweets, and lived a life oblivious to the political turmoil outside the confines of Versailles until it was too late. Coppola delivers her side of history with a maximum budget, endless sumptuous costumes, shoes, wigs, oft-changed costumed huge cast, top of the line creative cuisine and pastries, a nice little performance by Kirsten Dunst, an extended tour inside Versailles and two hours of minimal dialogue about rather inconsequential matters.Coppola does mix contemporary music with period music, an anachronism that is not additive but does allow us to see snippets of Rameau's 'Platee' (and a cut version of Susan Graham as Gluck's 'Orfeo' singing 'Che faro Euridice' in French translation on a beautiful stage with a sensuous nude model lying at her feet). And if Coppola's purpose is to demonstrate how the 'media', whether that be printed or verbal history, has painted an incorrect picture of a charming young child/lady who happened to be blissfully unaware of the changes of the day, she has succeeded. It just doesn't seem to be enough story for a two hour slick magazine spread on indulgences in France of the late 18th century.The cast is well chosen: Judy Davis exudes court etiquette as Comtesse de Noailles, Rip Torn is a fine Louis XV more interested in his consort du Barry as well imitated by Asia Argento, Steve Coogan is Steve Coogan as Ambassador Mercy, Rose Byrne keeps the story afloat as Duchesse de Polignac, and Jason Schwartzman makes us understand why the distracted Louis XVI capitalized the troubles of a clueless court during the time of Revolution.The endless costume changes are entertaining to the eye but about as repetitive as the too frequent boudoir lack of activity between Marie and Louis. This is one of those films where the Featurette on the DVD makes the evening worth tolerating; it is fresh, funny, informative, allows bonuses, and ultimately explains why the movie was made in the first place. As for the film itself, it is a long static song. Grady Harp",5,0,0,16 February 2007
Stop-Loss," Afterburn
","The title of this film STOP-LOSS may puzzle many. According to Wikipedia, 'Stop-loss, in the United States military, is the involuntary extension of a service member's active duty service under the enlistment contract in order to retain them beyond their initial end of term of service (ETS) date. It also applies to the cessation of a permanent change of station (PCS) move for a member still in military service'. According to writer (with Mark Richard)/director Kimberly Pierce (whose previous 'Boy's Don't Cry' tackled similarly volatile issues), the impetus for making this film about the effects of war on veterans returning home was her viewing of videos taken by soldiers while actively engaged in battle in Iraq: this is the first war where the soldiers have actually photographed their own experiences, documenting the realities/horrors of war on the now popular video equipment at their disposal. It is a solid idea for a film, but somehow the idea gets diluted in the script. Texas homeboys who have just returned from the Iraq war are greeted with a parade and medals and empty rhetoric, but find adapting to reentry into their native land is fraught with the deeply embedded mental wounds of their experience: interpersonal relationships fall apart, families face altered personalities in their sons, Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome reigns. Brandon (Ryan Phillippe) blames himself for the deaths of his men, Tommy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) drinks himself toward suicide, Rico (Victor Rasuk) attempts to see past his traumatically missing limbs, Isaac (Rob Brown) finds his entire world out of focus, and Steve (Channing Tatum) sees the military as his only point of reality to a life of success. When Brandon receives his Stop-Loss instead of his discharge papers his world turns upside down and he flounders in his nightmares and his need for escape to Canada or Mexico with his friend Michelle (Abbie Cornish). The horror of events that follow the homecoming of these damaged soldiers culminates in a tragedy that somehow results in the soldiers following the orders of the governmental Stop-Loss orders. And that is the worst tragedy. Though the message is important, the delivery of it gets hazy: the motivations of the characters are too loosely defined to convince us of their terrible plights. But the impact on the public should be a wake-up call on the extended damage of war - any war- on the men and women who experience it first hand and carry the mental scars for life. For that reason, if for no other, this is a film that should be seen. Grady Harp",8,1,2,9 July 2008
United 93," Paul Greengrass Creates the Impossible: Capturing the Horror of 9/11
","Though it has been over five years since the devastation of 9/11 the memory lives on, a day no one will ever forget - nor should we. This viewer waited until UNITED 93 was released on DVD to view it, thinking that watching the film in the security of the home might make it less threatening. But what Paul Greengrass has created in reconstructing those few hours in 2001 that changed the psyche of the world forever is an achievement in courage, in understatement, and in respect - as fine a memorial as any that has been planned.In using not easily recognizable but very fine actors in all of the roles, Greengrass allows his script to unfold gradually in the relaxed atmosphere of the usual air flight plans and minor delays, conversations heard by all of us as we await a take off of a plane. Concurrently he shows the four men, whose mission is to destroy 'the oppressors', prepare, pray, dress, and board. Then he moves into the planning rooms of air control, lets us feel the insidious progression of the hijacked planes, shows us the military response and paralysis, places us back in United 93, and unfolds the recognition by the crew and passengers of the danger in which they have been placed. The acts of heroism seem like natural permutations of human response all the way to the final abrupt dark screen when the plane goes down.The degree of tension Greengrass and his superlative cast and crew convey is almost intolerable: magnify that times infinity power and we have a glimpse of what it was like to be in United Flight 93 on September 11, 2001. The film is a remarkable achievement and is destined to become a hallmark for artistic representation of historic events. Highly Recommended on every level. Grady Harp",10,2,4,30 January 2007
Deja Vu," Going Back to Look Forward
","DÉJÀ VU is a riveting film about time travel in tandem with crime investigation that works on every level. Tony Scott is back in his element as the top director of intrigue/thrillers. Working with a challenging script by Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio that asks the viewer to accept the possibility of time travel, Scott is able to make the story work clearly despite the interplay of mixing the viewing of the past form the vantage of the present with placing a character into that past to alter it.The setting is New Orleans, still suffering from the devastation of Katrina, where a ferryboat explodes killing hundreds of people. ATF (Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms) agent Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington) is brought into the investigation of the 'accident' when he discovers elements that suggest the explosion was the act of a terrorist. Agent Pryzwarra (a very fat Val Kilmer) and his team of secretive experts (Adam Goldberg, Elden Henson, Erika Alexander and Bruce Greenwood) introduce Doug to a highly sophisticated machine that coordinates cameras and heat detectors from satellites and security cameras that is able to mix images and reveal the past - a tricky means of examining a crime scene ex post facto to capture the perpetrators. Spurred on with Doug's discovery of a beautiful female body (Paula Patton) washed up from the water before the explosion, Doug examines all the evidence, observing the replay of the days leading up to the explosion, and finally asks to be placed in a time machine to return to the scene in hopes of altering the inevitable and unmasking the terrorist (Jim Caviezel). How this occurs forms the climax of the film, and while many viewers may have trouble swallowing the time travel aspect, the action is so tight and the technique of creating the incident so convincing that few viewers will fail to be wholly involved.The cast is excellent, beginning with Denzel Washington as a terrific lead to the work of Jim Caviezel and all the more minor roles in between. The musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams and the cinematography by DP Paul Cameron heighten the tension of this exciting suspense movie. Grady Harp",8,4,7,27 April 2007
Finding Neverland," 10 Stars! If you see no other movie this year, see this one!,
","FINDING NEVERLAND is that rare work of art that transcends the medium of film and becomes a spirit-altering experience. Strong accolades? Gush? Perhaps so, but squeeze time out of the clutter of life and the holidays to see this movie and be transported to a place that nurturingly reassures us that the cycle of life is indeed good. Find Neverland!Marc Forster ('Monster Ball') has created a lovingly tender look at the playwright JM Barrie (Johnny Depp) in 1903 when, down on his luck with theater flops, unfulfilled by a marriage of Victorian standards to a beautiful but aloof and social climbing wife Mary (Radha Mitchell), and with writer's block, he encounters the Llewellyn Davies family - a widow Sylvia (Kate Winslet) and her four boys, George (Nick Roud), Jack (Joe Prospero), Michael (Luke Spill) and Peter (Freddie Highmore) - playing blissfully in Kensington Gardens. Barrie is captivated, draws the boys to him with his patient and infectious enthusiasm for play, and bonds with this family, gaining the obvious seeds for his highest achievement or creation, PETER PAN.How these seeds grow, despite the soft, yet supportive, growling of his producer Charles Frohman (Dustin Hoffman) and the not so soft interference of Sylvia's wealthy haughty mother Madame du Maurier (Julie Christie), form the storyline of this film. The magic comes from the skill of the writers (Alan Knee and David Magee) and director, the cinematographer (never has Victorian London glowed with such elegant gaslight presence), and the musical score by Jan Kaczmarek. Cameo roles are treated with tremendous respect: Eileen Essel as Mrs. Snow, Ian Hart as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Kelly MacDonald as the first Peter Pan, etc all are brief but fully realized and poignant. Given this support it is obvious that the talents of the lead performers will shine, and they glow they do with such understated performances that make the simple story of the sanctity of the inner child so cogent that there is not a dry eye in the house during the thankfully long credits. Johnny Depp continues to prove that he is one of the finest actors on the screen today: his Barrie has a flawless Scottish accent and a manner of movement and facial expressions that make him a gentle hero. Kate Winslet, never more beautiful, likewise embodies Sylvia with exactly the right amount of perk and pathos, and as her mother, Julie Christie is strikingly beautiful and unfailingly solid in a role less than loving. The boys are artfully recreated, never absurdly over the top, always very close to the bridge that crosses the craggy canyon between childhood and adulthood. Growing up has never been better portrayed - by all of the characters!In a time when too often films that address magic and imagination rely on computer effects to create creatures that are comic book absurd, FINDING NEVERLAND relies on simply showing the stage mechanics of the play, suspending wires and all, even in the climax of the story when Barrie brings his successful play to the living room of the ill Sylvia in order to keep his promise to her to take her to Neverland. No gimmicks here, just solid stagecraft very much in keeping with the inherent magic of Barrie's enduring play. This is a brilliant cinematic accomplishment - a feast for the eyes, the ears, the brain, and the soul. Please don't miss it! Grady Harp, November 2004",Null,232,305,23 November 2004
In Bruges," The Psychic Isolation of Two Hit Men in Bruges
","Martin McDonagh makes an impressive writing and directing debut with the very fresh and entertaining and surprisingly well rounded film IN BRUGES. Though the basic storyline is rather simple, McDonagh knows how to keep it turning and twisting with generous amounts of humor as well as probing character development. He has assembled a cast of very fine actors, turned the cinematography of the gorgeous Belgian city of Bruges over to the capable creative hands of Eigil Bryld, and finished his project off with a fine musical score by the gifted Carter Burwell (with a nod to Schubert and others): the result is a beautiful little film with messages galore and always a visual treat to see repeatedly. Two hit men - Ken (Brendan Gleeson), a chubby, optimistic bloke who loves spending time with the sights of Bruges, and Ray (Colin Farrell), an emotionally distraught young man in the throes of guilt from a botched 'hit' that accidentally killed a young boy - have been sent by their 'boss' Harry (Ralph Fiennes) to 'lay low' after the botched murder of a priest (Ciarán Hinds). It is Christmas season and there are too few rooms available so Ken and Ray reluctantly share a tiny hotel room to await further orders from Harry. Ken falls in love with the beauty of the city of Bruges while Ray, ever anxious and distrustful, finds some solace in a film being shot about 'midgets' (Jérémie Renie) with behind the scenes girl Chloë (Clémence Poésy). How these two Irish guys make the most of their enforced isolation ultimately leads to the real reason for their assignment, a reason that includes a last 'hit' that sweeps the audience to a surprising ending. McDonagh writes very well, giving some of the best comedic lines to Farrell who proves himself a fine fit for this difficult role. Yes, it is another 'hit man film', but this one has the good fortune to deal with very real people, conflicted with their choice of 'occupation' and who are hungry to share their tenuous lives with good friends. Though there is considerable bloody derring-do, the film uses the chase and kill scenes to good advantage, allowing the audience to feel the human side of those whose job it is to 'off' others. Both Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson are superb and their roles are enhanced by a choice selection of character actors who speed the plot along nicely. This is a very entertaining movie, one that can be appreciated on many levels, and one that suggests that Martin McDonagh has a solid future in cinema. Grady Harp",9,3,7,26 June 2008
Chinatown," A Hollywood Masterpiece
","Experiencing older Hollywood films, films made in the era when script, direction, cinematography, lighting, musical scoring and acting became melded together in an intricate but cohesive escapist adventure, is like visiting a fine art museum - masters at work creating a living work of art that time only enhances in respect.Such is the case for Roman Polanski's 1974 film noir CHINATOWN. Robert Towne's brilliant script is the baseline for this fascinating story of the Los Angeles and environs of the 1930s, a time when power was wedded to corruption, greed, family secrets of aberrant stature, and manipulation of resources (here the Department of Water and Power, the police, and entrepreneurs). Using the inimitable Jack Nicholson as the smart and daring private detective who pries open a conspiracy in the family of John Huston and his daughter Faye Dunaway whose private life secret is as huge as the water stealing crimes that are at the basis of the story was a stroke of genius that has rarely been matched since. And tying all of this together with one of Jerry Goldsmith's finest musical scores and cinematography that is liquid and redolent of the wastes that were the at the core of Los Angeles' prostitution of sunlight and shadow - the desert by the sea - was part of Polanski's genius for direction.For viewing an example of the finest in film-making, CHINATOWN remains at the top of the list.

","Bradley Cooper makes a bow as writer/actor/director for this re-visit to the perennial favorite story A STAR IS BORN. Whether or not the viewer likes the music as performed by both stars - Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga - is probably secondary to the visual spectacle and the intensity of the performances.A quick overview of the well-known plot is supplied by Warner Bros: Seasoned musician Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) discovers-and falls in love with-struggling artist Ally (Lady Gaga). She has just about given up on her dream to make it big as a singer - until Jack coaxes her into the spotlight. But even as Ally's career takes off, the personal side of their relationship is breaking down, as Jack fights an ongoing battle with his own internal demons.'Lady Gaga shines in both acting and singing - a sensitive and multifaceted screen performance. Bradley Cooper has early moments of credibility but the constant in-your- face dreary alcoholic behavior grows old quickly. The big Grammy Awards scene when he practically destroys Ally's fresh career is most disturbing to watch - as it should be.The supporting cast is exceptional - Sam Elliott, Anthony Ramos, Dave Chappelle, Rafi Gavron, Barry Shabaka Henley, and Michael D. Roberts are especially fine. The cinematography by Matthew Libatique is exceptionally fine - both in the spectacle of the performances of the songs and in the intimate moments.The plot drops out of focus too often for the length of this film, but A STAR IS BORN once again proves that the tale of rising from nothing to stardom merits retelling.

Gravity," 'I hate space.'
","Father and son team Alfonso Cuarón and Jonás Cuarón wrote the screenplay (with assistance from George Clooney) and Alfonso Cuarón directed (with capable assistance from director of photography Emmanuel Lubezki) what is likely to go down in cinematic history as a shining moment of the art of the craft. It manages to tell an impossibly simple story about surviving and not surviving astronauts out in space and makes the emotions so complex that the audience is left speechless. It is a staggering achievement.Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a brilliant medical engineer on her first shuttle mission, with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) in command of his last flight before retiring. But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone - tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness. How eventually Stone manipulates the fragments of international spacecraft in her attempt to live is profoundly touching and extraordinarily touching.Both Bullock and Clooney offer portraits not only of the characters they portray but also the hopes and fears of us all if ever faced with surviving the impossible. This is a film that must be seen to understand and appreciate the little miracle Alfonso Cuarón has created.",10,8,12,27 February 2014
Lone Survivor," 'You are never out of the fight'
","Director/writer Peter Berg has translated Marcus Luttrell's and Patrick Robinson's fact based book into a film that is as spot on accurate as far as the training and extraordinary skills of the Navy Seals. The casting is excellent, the degree of uncomfortable banter is balanced well with the sheer terror of a covert op in a way that few directors and actors have been able to accomplish. This is a bloody, crude, harsh film to watch but the audience must be ready to accept that this is the way things were and remain in the multiple wars in the Middle East. And for what? The film begs the question. It is a story of survival and profound comradeship and it jolts us in just the right way.The film opens with a training camp for Navy SEALS, a fine way to set the tone for the story. The time is 2005, the place Afghanistan. Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg and his team – Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) and Matt 'Axe' Axelson (Ben Foster) set out on a mission to capture or kill notorious Taliban leader Ahmad Shah (Yousuf Azami After running into mountain herders and capturing them, they were left with no choice but to follow their rules of engagement or be imprisoned. Now Marcus and his team are left to fight for their lives in one of the most valiant efforts of modern warfare. Cut off from back support team (Eric Bana, Alexander Ludwig, Rich Ting, Jerry Ferrara, Scott Elrod, etc) the four struggle to survive against insurmountable odds. But is many ways the acidic cruelty of war is somewhat offset by the compassionate benevolence (Pashtunwali) by a group of Afghans who offer the lone survivor Luttrell succor and safety. Food for thought after the battle of the film is over.",8,0,1,22 June 2014
I'm Not There," A Successful Exploration and Cinematic Investigation of an Artist
","I'M NOT THERE is clearly not a movie for everyone. The concept of the film is experimental, the execution of the 'documentary' is actually an amalgam of the aura and influence of one man in the music world instead of a linear history of a famous singer/poet, and the goal seems more to find the effect of Bob Dylan's chameleon persona on those people with whom he came into contact than it is to relate the story of a fascinating and important American artist. Writer (with Oren Moverman) and Director Todd Haynes ('Far from Heaven', 'Velvet Goldmine') has gathered images, memorabilia, fragments of interviews, and responses from acquaintances and from these he has pieced together a quilt-like panorama of the enigmatic, elusive, ever-changing Bob Dylan. The result is not meant to be a precise history, but instead a 'feeling' for the man who so profoundly influenced American music in the 1960s. Haynes selected several top actors to inhabit various aspects of Dylan's life and times. The Narrator for this both black and white and color film is symbolist poet Arthur Rimbaud (Ben Winshaw) who through a series of comments opens the vignettes that reflect Dylan. Eleven- year-old Marcus Carl Franklin radiates the energy of Woody Guthrie when he is suggesting the early formative influences of Dylan. Christian Bale becomes 'Jack Rollins', among the closest of the actors to impersonate the performing Dylan. Heath Ledger embodies the love- life side of Dylan's character with the Claire of Charlotte Gainsbourg while Cate Blanchett comes closest to showing us the inverted personality as Jude Quinn - the name assigned to the character who most resemble Dylan's appearance and talk and physical reactions to the public, the press, and the audience. And as an homage to Dylan's preoccupation with history, the final version of Dylan becomes Billy the Kid (Richard Gere) in the surreal town of Riddle. Other important characters pass through this musical mélange - Julianne Moore comments as Alice Fabian, a Joan Baez-type figure, Michelle Williams becomes Coco for a moment, and Bruce Greenwood has double roles suggesting influences from the height of Dylan's career to his old age. Throughout the film the music of Bob Dylan pervades the soundtrack, the tunes as important as the timely poetry of his lyrical output. The film is as strange as the man who inspired it, and Todd Haynes and his amazing cast of actors give us an impressive slice of our history as well as an appreciation of the aura of the strangely haunting Bob Dylan. In extended featurettes on the CD the director and cast give wonderful insights both into the character of Dylan as well as the concept of creating this amazing film. For some, watching these introductions BEFORE watching the actual movie may enhance appreciation of this art piece. Highly recommended - but the audience must understand this is not a routine movie!

Fury," 'Ideals are peaceful. History is violent.'
","'Ideals are peaceful. History is violent.' David Ayer (Training Day, The Fast and the Furious, End of Watch, Harsh Times, S.W.A.T, Sabotage etc) wrote and directed this film that explores aspects of WW II – and all war, in fact. It is intensely brutal, unforgivingly bitter, and graphically assaulting – just like war. It is one of the better film s to capture the way war alters soldiers and the citizens of the country who are not involved. It is painful to watch: it is important to note.April, 1945. As the Allies make their final push in the European Theatre, a battle-hardened Army sergeant named Wardaddy Brad Pitt) commands a Sherman tank and his five-man crew – Bible Swan (Shia LaBeouf), Gordo Garcia (Michael Peña), Grady Travis (Jon Bernthal) and the very young 8 week in the Army typist Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) on a deadly mission behind enemy lines. Outnumbered, out-gunned, and with a rookie soldier thrust into their platoon, Wardaddy and his men face overwhelming odds in their heroic attempts to strike at the heart of Nazi Germany. There are a few moments when battle is not active that are memorable – the episode where Wardaddy and Norman have lunch and more in the home of two frightened German women, the confrontation of Wardaddy with Norman bringing him into the realm of being a killing soldier, etc – but for the most part the film is constant fighting, grizzly unspeakably horrid, insane, sociopathic but true to war mentality fighting.The cast is excellent – if only the adopted varying accents would allow us to understand all the lines – and kudos to Brad Pitt, Logan Lerman, Michael Peña, Shia LaBeouf, Jon Bernthal, Jason Isaacs, Alicia von Rittberg, Anamaria Marina. The musical score by Steven Price is superb and the cinematography by Roman Vasyanov is incredibly realistic. The film is very long – just like prolonged battles in war – and the end result is a crushing question of why do we continue to participate in such wastes of lives.",9,3,7,31 January 2015
Darkest Hour," 'You can not reason with a Tiger when your head is in its mouth.'
","History wrote this story but Anthony McCarten translated it into a screenplay for Joe Wright to direct one of the truly great films of the year. The film is about the month of May in 1940, the odd rise to power of Winston Churchill, and the near miraculous survival of the island of England because of the rascal/devil obstinacy of Churchill's commitment not to give in to Hitler's sweep of the world into a globe of fascism. And crowning the importance of this film is the impeccable performance of Gary Oldman in the role of Churchill. 'Hitler has invaded Czechoslovakia, Poland, Denmark, and Norway. 3 million German troops are now poised on the Belgian border, ready to conquer the rest of Europe. In Britain, Parliament has lost faith in its leader Neville Chamberlain. The search for a replacement has already begun...' So opens the film. With Europe on the threshold of World War II as Hitler's armies rampage across the continent's once proud nations, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup), is forced to resign, appointing Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) as his replacement. But even in his early days as the country's leader, Churchill is under pressure to commence peace negotiations with the German dictator or to fight head-on the seemingly invincible Nazi regime, whatever the cost. However difficult and dangerous his decision may be, Winston Churchill has no choice, but to shine in his darkest hour. He gains the favor of King George VI (Ben Mendelsohn), the assistance from his secretary (Lily James) and wife (Kirsten Scott Thomas), and the tolerance of peacenik Viscount Halifax (Stephen Dillane). Of course the ending is known: Churchill overcame the darkest hour and saved England by refusing to stand down.This is one of the most successful historical films to date and it is so very appropriate that it was released in the same year as DUNKIRK - the battle that involved the people and polished the British tenacity.

Inglourious Basterds," Vengeance, Tarantino Style
","INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS is a romp that takes a bit of horrendous history and makes an entertaining film about it. For those who admire the strangely off kilter Quentin Tarantino's films, this may just appeal as his best and fanciest production yet. It is a way over the top story about revenge as carefully served out by Jewish American soldiers known as Inglourious Basterds on the Nazis who during the occupation of France sought out and murdered thousands of Jews. This may sound like a grim topic for an entertaining film, but in Tarantino's hands it becomes not only a grisly look at reality but also an at times hilarious parody. The cast is almost secondary to the story: Brad Pitt as the leader Lt Aldo Raine sports a scarred throat and a somewhat tiresome Tennessee accent but seems to enjoy every grisly moment of his command to have all members of his division gather 100 scalps from the Nazi killers; Denis Menochet provides a sensitive opening as the French father who is hiding Jews (namely one Shosanna Dreyfus- MÃ©lanie Laurent - whose escape from her family's slaughter begins the lead seed for the story ahead), Mike Myers portraying a German parody as only he can, Daniel BrÃ¼hl, Marin Wuttke as a pitch perfect Hitler, B.J. Novak as Pitt's sidekick, Sylvester Groth as Goebbels, etc. But the crowning actor in this film is the amazingly gifted Christoph Waltz as the multilingual, sinister, smarmy, yet elegant Col. Hans Landa who drives this wild tale to its grisly conclusion. As with all Tarantino films this is not a film for the faint of heart, but it is surprising how entertaining this sprawling story is in his hands. It goes on a bit long and is chocked full of grisly incidents, but it is fine film making. Grady Harp",8,2,6,19 December 2009
Iron Man 2," How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a etc....
","IRON MAN II. May he rest in peace. As with so many of these Marvel Comics scripts there are so many add-on characters to disrupt the meager storyline that it seems like the studio tapped everyone who walked by the filming, gave them a few lines and a wow costume and said 'come one in.' Rating an obvious millions of dollars production such as this is duplicitous: CGI 5, acting 3, story 1. But if noise, mayhem, and electrical fires are pleasing to you, then by all means jump aboard this colorful film. Robert Downey, Jr. is a fine actor so he puts as much as he can into the lines allotted him to read. Mickey Rourke is the bad guy with even more tattoos and longer hair than the Wrestler, and with a Russian accent to boot. Don Cheadle plays Don Cheadle, and Sam Rockwell needs a shave as a supposed wily bad guy executive. Samuel L. Jackson attempts to lend some dignity. Gwyneth Paltrow seems to be asking why she bothered until Scarlett Johansson jumps on board to give the film some much need punch. It's good guy versus bad guy - with drones create by Rourke's disenchanted character that attempt unsuccessfully to turn the tide. What's missing is some of Robert Downey, Jr.'s comedic banter and the brakes put on the destruction of the Stark Expo concept. Definitely a film for those who like this sort of high volume comic book outing.Grady Harp",4,2,5,9 October 2010
Two for the Money," For the Actors
","TWO FOR THE MONEY takes on the topic of Sports Gambling and makes a serious attempt to turn it into a movie. The story is apparently based on a true one (as per the opening screen statement) but it is from the pen of Dan Gilroy that the well-drawn characters are realized. DJ Caruso (Smallville, The Salton Sea, The Shield) knows his way around matters such as these and his pacing is fine, allowing for the isolated 'arias' in the film to work well. The problem, for this viewer, is the topic: how interesting can bilking chronic gamblers over football game wagers possibly be? The story is related by Brandon Long (Matthew McConaughey) who begins life as a sports hero and just at the moment when he is ready to break in to the Pro Football domain, he fractures his leg in a winning touchdown. Six years later, and still dreaming of making it as a player of football, finds him in the numbers game with a talent for picking winning teams and calling 900 numbers to urge gullible people t place bets according to his predictions. Enter Alter Abrams (Al Pacino), a recovering Gambler who is making it big in the sports gambling arena. He coerces Brandon to join him in New York, wines him, dines him with the aid of his smart and beautiful wife Toni (Rene Russo), and in no time Brandon Long takes on the persona of John Anthony and makes it big as a TV personality who successfully bilks willing gambling people out of their money. Long as Anthony takes on a life of his own and it is the conflagration between the creator Abrams and the protégé Anthony that fleshes out the film.Interesting to a point, the story loses steam in the last half and we soon lose interest in the outcome or the characters. And not that that is the fault of the actors! Al Pacino is very effective as the reformed gambler still fighting demons and Rene Russo is as beautiful as ever, acting her role with complete conviction and holding what is left of the story, once started, together. Matthew McConaughey spends much of the movie without his shirt on which is a major contribution to the visuals of the film! Buff and beautiful he manages to keep the heart of Brandon Long beating inside the persona of John Anthony.Not a great movie by any means, but some truly fine acting from the trio of stars. The supporting cast also gives solid roles despite the skimpy script. If gambling of any sort, and sports gambling in particular, is of interest to you, then this is a movie to recommend. Otherwise see it for the actors, not the story. Grady Harp",8,44,64,18 January 2006
Lords of Dogtown," History as a Mood Piece
","There is not a whole lot of story to the cinematic adaptation of Stacy Peralta's memoir of his experience in the mid 1970s with the popularization of skateboarding. Nor is there a whole lot of character development in these teenagers addicted to skateboarding among other things. But what LORDS OF DOGTOWN is, is a spectacular cinematic excursion into the risks and exaltations of the sport of championship skateboarding: watching the thrills of these kids doing dangerous leaps, twists, airborne stunts in empty swimming pools is truly entertaining.The film is set in 1975 when surfing was all the rage, especially in Venice, CA where one Skip (Heath Ledger) owns a surfboard shop. He befriends a scrappy bunch of teenagers who live their lives for skateboarding along Venice Beach and in private homes where empty swimming pools (this was the era of water conservation!) provide provocative arenas for their skills. The lead among them is Jay (Emile Hirsch) who is out to explore new challenges and when he and his confrères Stacy (John Robinson), Tony (Victor Rusak), and Sid (Michael Angarano) demonstrate the way skateboarding pleases crowds and girls, Skip cashes in on the enterprise by forming Zephyr, a club for championship skateboarding and enters his groupie into the competition circuit. As the boys gain fame they are tempted away from Skip into higher profile gigs and the group disintegrates only to reform after a tragedy befalls one of them.The screenplay was written by Stacy Peralta (and that may explain why his role is a bit too goodie-two-shoes when compared to the antics of the other boys) and while there isn't a lot of dialogue of significance, there is a lot of communication very much in tune with the historic time of the action. Catherine Hardwicke has an amazing sense of the teenage attitude and vulnerability and keeps the story 'skating' with staggering momentum. The cast is uniformly fine: Heath Ledger shows he can be something other than the Hollywood leading man type and Emile Hirsch, Victor Rusak, and John Robinson are all on target with their roles. Newcomer Michael Angarano shows the promise in this film that resulted in his superb role in the current 'One Last Thing' - his screen presence is magnetic.In all this is a recreation of a wild period of life in a bizarre era staged in a rickety old version of Venice, CA and it gives the viewer a slice of atmosphere that will likely not be re-created as well.

Passengers," 'You can't get so hung up on where you'd rather be, that you forget to make the most of where you are.'
","Writer Jon Spaihts (Prometheus, Doctor Strange, The Darkest Hour) wrote the story and script for this work to be directed by Morten Tyldum (The Imitation Game, Headhunters, Fallen Angels) and with the talent of Guy Hendrix Dyas as production designer and a massive crew in art direction PASSENGERS is a feast for the eyes – and a rather humanistic sci-fi love story.A mammoth company offers people the opportunity to leave the Earth and live on a new colony called Homestead Colony. They are being transported on a space vessel called the Starship Avalon. The journey takes 120 years so the travelers and crew are kept in hibernation chambers while the ship flies on its own and are to be awakened just before they arrive. And when one passenger Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) awakens, he quizzically explores the ship and sees he's the only one awake, he discovers he woke up 90 years early. The only talking being is Arthur (Martin Sheen) the robot bartender. He tries unsuccessfully to reenter his hibernation pod and spends the next year alone, wandering the ship. He looks at the videos of the other passengers and is impressed with Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence). He has to decide if he should wake her up. Eventually he does and the two court and try to make the best of their time together. But then it dawns on them that something happened to the ship that made it wake Jim up. And they try to find out what it is. Further troubling is the awakening of one of the crew – Gus Mancuso (Lawrence Fishburne) who aids the in their trials. To say more would be a spoilerThe CGI effects are terrific, the story is more an honest love story than a sci-fi futuristic space adventure, but the film feels very long and soon the gorgeous visual effects become tiresome. Good performances from beautiful actors save the film.",8,2,3,30 April 2017
The Hunger Games," 'They just want a good show, that's all they want.'
","Maybe if you read the books, or maybe if you love watching young people kill each other, or maybe if you like juxtaposing Alice in Wonderland with apocalyptic visions, or, as in this viewer's case, maybe you just want to see what all the commotion was about when this HUNGER GAMES hit the theaters and sold out for weeks...but seeing that there are at least four more sequels scheduled into production through 2015 means we all should know what young people are idolizing. This series is to killing fellow youngsters as the Twilight series is to vampires and werewolves - and we still have another episode in that blood bath to go.Suzanne Collins wrote the book and contributed to the screenplay along with Billy Ray and director Gary Ross so the result must be satisfactory to those addicted to the concept of THE HUNGER GAMES. According to the brief synopsis (for those who have yet to submit to this 2 Â½ hours of mayhem, the story goes something like this: In a dystopian future, the totalitarian nation of Panem is divided between 12 districts and the Capitol. Each year two young representatives from each district are selected by lottery to participate in The Hunger Games. Part entertainment, part brutal retribution for a past rebellion, the televised games are broadcast throughout Panem. The 24 participants are forced to eliminate their competitors while the citizens of Panem are required to watch. When 16-year-old Katniss' young sister, Prim, is selected as District 12's female representative, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She and her male counterpart Peeta, are pitted against bigger, stronger representatives.'The story inserts phrases like 'Hope, it is the only thing stronger than fear. A little hope is effective, a lot of hope is dangerous. A spark is fine, as long as it's contained' and 'They just want a good show' in order to make excuses for the wild concept of the movie. The cast includes Jennifer Lawrence, Stanley Tucci, Toby Jones, Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson (probably the best performance in the film, sleazy though his character is), Elizabeth Banks (her makeup and costumes are more ridiculous than any of her confrÃ¨res), Lenny Kravitz (the most sensitive of the crew), and hunks Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson in addition to a cast of thousands. They do with the script what they can.Perhaps it Is the popularity of the mayhem of the current video games or perhaps it is facing the mess we adults have created of this globe, but it is worrisome that themes of films such as this (and the sequels to come) attract such a positive response form the young adults for whom the book was written and the movie was made. It is almost like we have sunk to the level of the gladiator games of ancient Rome or the cockfights still popular in the little towns of the Americas. Knowing that those who follow reviews of this film will shred it, this viewer has to rely on the oft-repeated phrase form the film, 'May the odds be ever in your favor.'

The Impossible," 'Nothing is more powerful than the human spirit.'
","There are times when it takes the making visual of the devastation that occurs in nature to drive home the need for our being more aware of the suffering of our fellowmen at the hands of natural disasters around the world. Certainly THE IMPOSSIBLE achieves that. On December 26, 2004 one of the most disastrous tsunamis in history devastated portions of Thailand, killing thousands of people and destroying the landscape and lives of many more. This is the story of a Spanish family living in Japan but vacationing in Thailand and how they coped and survived this impossible natural act. Of note the entire crew that made this film is from Spain, the original title of the film is LO Impossible: María Belón shared her story which was transformed into a screenplay by Sergio G. Sánchez and the direction is by Juan Antonio Bayona. The cinematography is by Óscar Faura and the deeply moving musical score was written by Fernando Velázquez. For the film the family of note is British in origin but even their British background is secondary to the omni-national impact of the story.A regular family - Maria (Naomi Watts), Henry (Ewan McGregor) and their three children Lucas (a brilliant performance by Tom Holland), Simon (Oaklee Pendergast) and Thomas (Samuel Joslin) - travel to Thailand to spend Christmas in a villa on the coastline. After settling in and exchanging gifts, they go to the pool, like so many other tourists. A perfect paradise vacation until a distant noise becomes a roar. There is no time to escape from the tsunami; Maria and Lucas are swept in one direction, Henry, Thomas and Simon in another. Once the storm settles the story is the strength of character and of family and of love that is able to overcome the impossible odds that they will ever be united.The cast of the family is excellent but there are also very fine cameo roles by Sönke Möhring who plays another father desperately seeking his lost family, Geraldine Chaplin as an old woman who comforts the boys, and many others who move in and out of the story quickly. The film approaches two hours in length and in the mid portion it becomes repetitive and in need of some editing. But in ways this adds to the incredible sense of tolerance and survival of the characters. The surprise of the film, once the emotional impact begins to subside, is the brilliance of the acting of Tom Holland as Lucas, the oldest son who has inherited his mother's medical acumen and is able to help everyone around him. Watch for his career to ascend. Grady Harp",8,2,5,24 April 2013
42," 'Maybe tomorrow, we'll all wear 42, so nobody could tell us apart.'
","This was a strange week to watch '42' for the first time - the week of the demonstrations and riots after the Zimmerman/Martin verdict. Just when we think we have a handle on racism, complete with a Black President etc, the ghosts of the past deny being forgotten. This film hopefully, now on television, will put things back into perspective if just enough people watch. Brian Helgeland wrote and directed a solid hit with a fine cast, but this is a painful film to watch on the one hand, and a celebration of one of the first cracks in the racism veneer of this country.Briefly the story can be summarized as follows: 'In 1946, Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) is a Negro League baseball player who never takes racism lying down. Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) is a Major League team executive with a bold idea. To that end, Rickey recruits Robinson to break the unspoken color line as the first modern African American Major League player. As both anticipate, this proves a major challenge for Robinson and his family as they endure unrelenting racist hostility on and off the field, from player and fan alike. As Jackie struggles against his nature to endure such abuse without complaint, he finds allies and hope where he least expects it.'The supporting cast is strong: the beautiful Nicole Beharie as Rachel Robinson, Christopher Meloni as Leo Durocher, Andre Holland as Wendall Smith, and Ryan Merriman, Lucas Black , Alan Tudyk, Hamish Linklater, Brad Beyer, James Pickens Jr. and on and on. At times the direction is lax and the story seems to be sidetracked, but it is the powerful performance of Chadwick Boseman that keeps the spirit of the story vital. Grady Harp",8,2,2,18 July 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," A Cute Little Disney Film but Not for Children
","'Pirates Of The Caribbean - Dead Man's Chest' is but the second installment (the third has already been shot) in the series of movies based on a Disneyland ride: strange nidus for a story idea and one that takes a bit of patience to sit through, but a fun evening nevertheless. Though the first installment took the audience by surprise with the character of Jack Sparrow so inimitably portrayed by the gifted Johnny Depp and therefore served as a tastier treat, this second installment substitutes sea-dead cum barnacles for the dancing skeletons of the first and is a bit more grisly...and a lot less fun.But Gore Verbinski knows how to choreograph these outings and he is able to marry some very fine special effects to the genuinely good cast of characters and the result is a fantasy that is a visual delight. The cast includes Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Jack Davenport, Bill Nighy who is completely covered in tentacles as Davy Jones, Jonathan Pryce, Tom Hollander, Stellan Skarsgård,and Naomie Harris and they all seem to be having a glorious time. It is a bit long for a slight story (well in excess of two hours) and the special effects of the kraken (octopus like tentacles) overwhelming boats becomes tedious, but it is a fun outing and it all too blatantly sets us up for part three due our next spring.

Argo," 'We did suicide missions in the army that had better odds than this.'
","There is so much hype regarding the Oscars now that viewing any of the contenders is met with confusion. That is unfair to each of the films because it automatically places each in a police lineup for who is going to win. ARGO is a solid film based on a true incident and the significance of that very important mission to free hostages is one equally share with our good friends the Canadians. That is what makes this film important - the courage and fortitude shared in freeing 6 American citizens form a near hopeless situation. But on to the film itself.In 1979, the American embassy in Iran was invaded by Iranian revolutionaries and several Americans were taken hostage. However, six managed to escape to the official residence of the Canadian Ambassador and the CIA was eventually ordered to get them out of the country. With few options, exfiltration expert Tony Mendez (played by Ben Affleck) devised a daring plan: to create a phony Canadian film project looking to shoot in Iran and smuggle the Americans out as its production crew. With the help of some trusted Hollywood contacts (John Goodman and Alan Arkin, both brilliant in their comedic roles), Mendez created the ruse and proceed to Iran as its associate producer. However, time was running out with the Iranian security forces closing in on the truth while both his charges and the White House had grave doubts about the operation themselves.The film opens with a brief but well edited history of the fall of the Shah of Iran and the rise of the Khomeini, actual footage that lends a sense of credibility form the start. For the first hour of the film the plans are set into motion - plans that seem absurdly Hollywood but the options are non-existent. Once the actual exfil mission is begun the film become tense and suspenseful and the cast of characters selected to show both the resistance of the home front and the terrifying situation happening to the hostages in the shelter of the home of the Canadian ambassador makes this a finely tuned thriller.The cast of actors includes, in addition to Affleck, Arkin and Goodman, strong work from Victor Garber who plays the Canadian ambassador, and Bryan Cranston, Tate Donovan, Clea DuVall, Scoot McNairy, Rory Cochrane, Christopher Denham, Kerry Bishé, Kyle Chandler, and Chris Messina. Though the film was basically shot here in the US (with a bit of footage in Istanbul, Turkey) the action appears authentic. The film was written by Chris Terrio but based on the book 'The Master of Disguise by Antonio J. Mendez and Escape for Tehran by Joshuah Bearman. Affleck directs, produces and stars. ARGO is an important film to see, a slid movie on its own rights, but is it the best film of the year? Check the competition. Grady Harp",8,1,2,20 February 2013
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," A Fantasy Well Grounded in Reality
","CS Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia may very well have been a book intended for children but it was also the result of a life through the Great Wars and the effects those wars had one the individual. Gratefully in Andrew Adamson's directorial hands that part of the story that lends the need for the fantasy is preserved.The concept of separating children from their parents during the Blitz in London in WW II is now showing up in many novels. Lewis was one of the first to address the trauma these separations had on children. Adamson opens his film with some fine footage of the aerial German blitz and the terror of the Londoners running for bomb shelters. The family in focus is the Pevensie family - Lucy (Georgie Henley), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), Peter (William Moseley), and Susan (Anna Popplewell) - and these four children are sent off to a safe mansion owned by the Professor (Jim Broadbent). The mansion has a wardrobe that begins the fantasy, Lucy being the first to enter the kingdom of Narnia through the back of the wardrobe. Soon the four children are all together in the snowy place and encounter first a faun, then the Queen of Narnia/White Witch (Tilda Swinton) and there begins the struggle for domination and secrets that gradually resolve the mystery of Narnia, that mystery carefully paralleling Christianity through the forces of the kind Lion Aslan (Liam Neeson).The children are wonderful, especially Georgie Henley, and while the story deals with human creatures it is strong. As the various CGI animals enter (fine though they may be as creations) the tale for this viewer weakens a bit, but that is a personal response. In general with work like that from Tilda Swinton and Jim Broadbent along with the children, the movie form of Narnia is convincing and enchanting. Quibbles aside, it is a charming film.

","The title for this film is a solid choice: CRAZY, STUPID LOVE is. Thought he reviewers and the general public alike seem to rank this as one of the greatest films of the decade, for some other viewers this seems tired and trite and a faux showcase for some excellent actors to overcome a tawdry story. Writer Dan Fogelman (Cars, Cars 2, Tangled, Bolt, Fred Claus, etc) may be taking a step up form his previous work and that is a good sign, but when directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa have shown their sensitivity in the much maligned if not sadly ignored treasure 'I Love You, Philip Morris' it feels odd they should go for this script.Difficult to classify as a Romance or Comedy or Drama the film falls into the familiar category of a RomCom. Opening a film with an embarrassingly public announcement of a marriage dissolution over a wife's infidelity and dissatisfaction with her nerdy but good father/provider husband this story embraces about every situation about falling in and out of 'love' imaginable. The idea of a monogamous clueless husband being 'changed' by a smooth talking, much bedded lothario isn't new nor is the 'finally met his match' idea fresh. The manner in which the children of the couple respond with their own needs and damaged outlooks on relationships works OK, but the manner in which the in the process of divorcing couple work through their problems holds a mirror up to today's marriages. The stories surround us in everyday life: the film merely magnifies them.It is always amazing when the marquee boasts the names of some of our more interesting actors as being involved: Julianne Moore, Ryan Gosling, Marisa Tomei, Kevin Bacon, et al deliver what they can. The 'star' is Steve Carell according to the script, and you have to like the caricatures he creates to relate to him here. There are some fine turns in cameos by Emma Stone, young Jonah Bobo, and Liz Lapira; when they are on screen the film lightens up. But in the end it is a two hour formulaic condensed television series type story. And yet the Bravos form the audience must mean there is a craving for this type movie.

The Other Boleyn Girl," But it is very pretty to watch...
","THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL suffers from overexposure to the passion for all things Tudor that has produced multiple novels, television series, and films that range from great to mediocre. Having not read Philippa Gregory's best selling novel, this viewer entered the theater without preconceived notions of the path the story would take/stray in the wake of heightened interest in historical data. From the opening scenes to the end the impression is one of having viewed some very beautiful scenery, sumptuous costumes, grand lighting - and very little involvement in caring for the plight of the characters. The soggy music score underlines the unrelenting dark atmosphere of the story and the production, and despite a cast of actors known for credibility in historic roles, there is little compassion stirred.King Henry VIII (Eric Bana, in relatively little screen time) tires of Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torent) and her inability to bear a male heir. The Boleyn clan (Mark Rylance and Kristin Scott Thomas in collusion with the Duke of Norfolk David Morrissey) seize on Henry's frustration and serve up their daughters Anne (Natalie Portman) and Mary (Scarlett Johansson) to satisfy his dalliances. The younger Mary beds him first, produces a daughter (Elizabeth), then falls our of favor leaving Anne to works her newly honed skills of feminism learned in her exile to France on the easily seduced King. The results are tension in the castle, in the Boleyn family, and between the sisters Anne and Mary. History is molded by the writer to maintain more of a Hollywood soap opera that a recreation of fact and it all ends with beheadings and the child Elizabeth running gaily through sunny old meadows of England.The actors all try to make us buy into this version of betrayal and lust and loathing, but the dialog (written by Peter Morgan) is tired and used and anything but in keeping with the period. But then, the movie is a collection of scenes that are very pretty to watch... Justin Chadwick directs. Grady Harp",5,1,5,2 March 2008
The Danish Girl," 'I think Lily's thoughts, I dream her dreams. She was always there.'
","Transgender issues are finally being discussed and studied at length, and while we have no idea how widespread the numbers of people born in the wrong sexual receptacles is, it really makes no difference. This film is about the first trans gender reassignment surgery and that aspect works very well as a treatise on etiology and progress of the initial surgical candidate, but the film is more than that; this is a very powerful love story and therein lies its significance. It demonstrates the power and need for finding true, unconditional love. Based on a true story as written by David Ebershoff and adapted for the screen by Lucinda Coxon and direct with tremendous sensitivity by Tom Hooper, the true reason the film works so well is the quality of acting by the two lead characters and their supporting cast.The setting is Copenhagen in 1926 (introduced by stunningly beautiful landscape photography which will be reflected in the main characters paintings). Danish artist, Gerda Wegener (Alicia Vikander), painted her own artist husband, Einar Wegener (Eddie Redmayne), as a lady in her painting. When the painting gained popularity, Einar started to change his appearance into a female appearance and named himself Lili Elbe. With his feminism passion and Gerda's support, Einar - or Elbe - attempted one of the first male-to-female sex reassignment surgery, a decision that turned into a massive change for their marriage, that Gerda realized her own husband is no longer a man or the person she married before. After a brief romantic dalliance with the handsome Henrik (Ben Whishaw), a childhood friend of Einar, art-dealer Hans Axgil (Matthias Schoenaerts), shows up and starts a complex love triangle with the couple. We are privy to the medical workup both by the dubious Dr. Hexler (Pip Torrens) and the genteel surgeon Dr Warenekros (Sebastian Koch) and the manner in which the surgeries proceed. But the most important sense we gain from this long movie is the strength of character of both Gerda and Einear/Lili as played with consummate skill By Alicia Vikander and Eddie Redmayne. The always-reliable Alexandre Desplat supplies the musical score and Danny Cohen the cinematography. Eloquent and memorable.",10,1,2,4 March 2016
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Video Games as Films? The concept sets a low standard
","Video games. Since when did the art of film neglect fine screenplays, theatrical works, novels, and short stories as resources for cinema and settle for making kids' games movie material? It makes a statement about priorities, right? But given the fact that pure video game entertainment is that important (having never played, this viewer is at a disadvantage), PRINCE OF PERSIA is a surprisingly sound film produced with extravagance and vigor and a wealth of CGI effects, and whatever happens with the little machine held gismo for the video game manipulation to make the experience exciting, that experience has been very well transformed by writers Boaz Yakin, Doug Miro, Carlo Bernard, and game inventor/screen story creator Jordan Mechner. Disney joins Jerry Bruckheimer (with the fine help of director Mike Newell) in creating what should have been a resounding success at the box office extravaganza. But alas, this one fizzled. Why that happened is not apparent from the DVD. Jake Gyllenhaal hits that happy medium as a daredevil Prince Dastan with just the right dose of derring-do stunts, charisma, and finely tuned comedy timing: he makes a great hero on screen, but the costumers should have allowed him to feature his well-developed physique he worked on for this role. But he makes the little orphan boy turned royal family believable and lovable. His adopted father, the king of Persia (Ronald Pickup), his 'brothers' (Toby Kebbell and Richard Coyle), his sidekick Bis (Reece Ritchie - keep an eye on this actor), and his evil uncle (Ben Kingsley) all contribute solid roles with quite a bit of philosophy about family ties and loyalty. The key to the story is the siege of a borderline rival kingdom ruled by the smart and sassy Rachel Weisz-type Tamina (Gemma Arterton) who guards the dagger that has the ability to manipulate time. Throw in a group of evil Hassasins (like that play on terms?) lead by Gísli Örn Garðarsson, some nearly unconquerable situations such as the world becoming a quicksand disaster, some wildly hilarious comedy (on the dark side) by tax evader Sheik Amar (Alfred Molina), and some changes that the time manipulating dagger can effect and the story spins to a conclusion. This viewer would be ready for a sequel, so entertaining is this diversion of a film, but the apparent box office failure of expectations make that an outside possibility. Though it is always difficult to tell where a Director of Photography and the CGI engineers meet, John Seale does provide some gorgeous desert effects. The music by Henry Gregson- Williams is appropriate if forgettable. Coming away from the DVD experience leaves this viewer even more impressed with the spectrum of acting skills of Jake Gyllenhaal. And that is really enough. The script makes some strange errors - beginning the film with statements as to how Persia was a vast country that covered the entire Middle East, and then throwing in references in the dialogue to Iraq, Turkey and other countries that makes the research sound shaky at best. It is a great popcorn movie - if popcorn at home weren't such a dietary no-no. Grady Harp",8,0,1,16 September 2010
The Secret in Their Eyes," Brilliant, Simply Brilliant: A Gold Standard for Filmmaking
","EL SECRETO DE SUS OJOS, based on the novel 'LA PREGUNTA DE SUS OJOS' by Eduardo Sacheri who with director Juan José Campanella adapted it for the screen, is a work of great subtlety and artistic taste. It is also a fine love story, detective story, and moral tale that makes every aspect of the total experience of watching the film unfold as a kaleidoscope of just how fine the art of cinema can be. 25 years ago in Argentina the murder of Liliana Coloto (Carla Quevedo) drew the focus of detective Benjamín Espósito (Ricardo Darin), his feisty assistant Pablo Sandoval (Guillermo Francella) and the department chief Irene Menéndez-Hastings (Soledad Villamil). The murderer, Isidoro Gómez (Javier Godino) is captured, but because of the corrupt government, he is not kept in prison: the disgusting governmental police release him to work as an undercover agent for the government as part of the desaperacidos situation in the 1970s. The case is closed, leaving behind Ben, Irene, and Pablo completely disenchanted by the legal system, and the grieving husband of the victim Ricardo Morales (Pablo Rago) to sit at the train station watching for answers. Now, in the present, Ben returns and is convinced he wants to write a novel about the murder he still finds suspicious. Together with Irene (who remains a love interest for the shy Ben) and Pablo, the three research every aspect of the case. In attempting to discover the truth of the murder each of their lives is changed: the communication on the part of every character is through the looks in their eyes until the story ends in a very surprising manner. Justice is served, love prevails, and the novel is written. This may seem too fragile an outline of a plot about a film as important as this, but the true beauty of the film is the unraveling of events and the development of the characters: sharing too much information would destroy the complete pleasure the film provides. Every member of the cast is brilliant, the chemistry between Darin and Villamil is so subtle and credible, and the acts of violence we are asked to witness are delivered in a way that make the story line progress to a breathtaking end. Campanella's direction (and editing) is of the finest cinematic achievement and the cinematography by Félix Mont and the haunting musical score by Federico Jusid and Emilio Kauderer heighten all facets of the action - love, terror, violence, and character of each of the actors. This is a film to own, as repeated viewings of it will be like repeated visits to an art museum. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp",10,3,5,22 September 2010
Black Book," A Stunning, Compelling Film on Every Level
","Just when we think we have read about or seen all of the stories there are to tell about courageous heroes/heroines who sacrificed much for the sake of many during World War II, along comes BLACK BOOK (ZWARTBOEK) with another dramatic 'biography' of a significant figure. Director Paul Verhoeven (Basic Instinct, Spetters, Total Recall) is a much admired Dutch artist who is able to draw his audience into another world so real that it literally feels as though we are part of the process. And that is precisely why this film works so well: the audience as a participant drives home the film's message that war changes people, that from one day to the next it is impossible to distinguish the 'bad' from the 'good', the 'enemy' from the 'friend'.Rachel Stein (the enormously gifted Carice van Houten) was a Jewish Dutch born cabaret singer in Berlin until the war broke out, at which time she returned to Holland to hide during the Jewish Solution. A series of incidents in 1944 destroy her hiding place and thwart her attempts to join her family to escape the Nazis. She is left to fend by herself until she bonds with a group from the Dutch Resistance. Gaining their confidence she is asked to masquerade as a German singer, dye all of her body hair blond, enter Germany as the consort of a doctor Hans Akkerman (Thom Hoffman) and infiltrate the highest elements of the Nazi regime, namely to become the mistress of Gestapo head Ludwig Müntze (Sebastian Koch) changing her name to Ellis de Vries. She stays in contact with the Resistance, places microphones in strategic positions, and with her friend Ronnie (Halina Reijn) becomes a Nazi party girl, singing at events while assisting her colleagues underground. The story is complex with many surprises as to who is with the Nazis and who is with the Resistance, and the story is so well told that we the audience are left guessing identities much the same as the characters.Paul Verhoeven wrote the screenplay with Gerard Soeteman and Verhoeven's dedication to his story is always present. There is a considerable violence and some sections that may offend viewers, but try to tell a true war story without including such aspects! The cast is brilliant, especially the multi-talented Carice van Houten, easily one of the finest actresses on the screen today. The entire cast is includes such gifted actors as Waldemar Kobus, Derek de Lint, Christian Berkel, Dolf de Vries, Michiel Huisman and Ronald Armbrust. The cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub recreates not only The Hague, Holland, and Germany but also a kibbutz in Israel with solid veracity. Anne Dudley has created a musical score that includes songs from the period (sung beautifully by Carice van Houten), and atmospheric scoring for the tender scenes as well as the many tense scenes.Released in Europe in 2006, it is not clear as to whether this film will be eligible for the Oscars this year. If it is it should win. It is one of the finest films this reviewer has seen in a long time. In Dutch, German, Hebrew, and English with subtitles. Highly Recommended!

127 Hours," Concerto for Left Hand
","Films such as 127 HOURS come along all too rarely. Based on a true story, the memoir by Aron Ralston 'Between a Rock and a Hard Place', and prepared for the screen by Simon Beaufoy and writer/director Danny Boyle, this film is a paean to the indomitable spirit of man. Basically a one man drama - Aron Ralston (James Franco) - the writers and director have managed to transfer enough outside of the story energy to keep the film in motion at all times. The story is well-known: Aron Ralston (Franco) set out for one of his freewheeling adventures in April 2003 in the canyons of Utah, befriends two girls (Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn) in hiking distress, and proceeds on his hike only to fall into a crevice with a heavy rock crushing his right hand. The story is about the 127 hours Ralston endures and ultimately survives by excising his own partial right extremity, thus limiting all his efforts to the use of his left hand, freeing himself until he can return home to his parents (Kate Burton and Treat Williams) and his girlfriend (Clémence Poésy). The magic in the film is how immersed Franco is in this role, keeping our attention and compassion through his on-videocamera jokes and pathos. How he survives is a wonder of nature, of ingenuity, and faith, and that is what sets the film apart as being so special. Grady Harp",10,0,3,5 March 2011
Creed," 'Time takes everybody out; time's undefeated.'
","For a film about boxing CREED manages to stay toward the top of the list. The story seems simple at first - The former World Heavyweight Champion Rocky Balboa serves as a trainer and mentor to Adonis Johnson, the son of his late friend and former rival Apollo Creed – but in addition to playing on the old Stallone ROCKY movies it introduces some solid ideas about genetic inheritance, goals, family, and fulfillment. Directed and written (with Aaron Covington and Sylvester Stallone) by Ryan Coogler, the film manages to capture the language and atmosphere of the boxing set and while keeping the film grounded in reality and honest emotions.Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Johnson) lost his mother when he was young and would get into constant trouble and end up in foster care or juvenile detention. One day a woman (Phylicia Rashad) goes to see him and tells him that her late husband is his father - boxing great, Apollo Creed. She would take him in and educate him but he feels the need to be a boxer like his father. So he moves to Philadelphia and approaches Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) and asks Rocky to train him. Rocky tries to talk him out of it but it's something he needs to do. Eventually Rocky offers to train him and when he beats a great boxer and his connection to Apollo is revealed, he is offered a chance to fight a world champion and all he needs to do is take the name Creed. The resolution of the film is very tender and to share those facts would be spoilers.The cast is uniformly fine – both Johnson and Stallone offer first-rate performances, as do Tessa Thompson, Phylicia Rashad, Ritchie Coaster, among others. This is a film that is more than just about boxing and that is what makes is worth seeing.",8,1,2,24 August 2016
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," 'We're going to make you indestructible - but first, we're gonna have to destroy you.'
","'We're going to make you indestructible - but first, we're gonna have to destroy you.' Gavin Hood directs this 2009 cinematic version of the origins (read 'explanation') or the X-Men series of comic book heroes based on a screenplay by David Benioff ('Game of Thrones' etc) and Skip Woods ('Hitman', 'Swordfish', 'The A Team' etc). The team manages to pull of the credibility-testing feat with aplomb – just the right amount of humanistic emphasis on the early ears of Wolverine and a flair for the impossible feats and countless deaths of the latter half of this film. It is a look at Wolverine's early life, in particular his time with the government squad Team X and the impact it will have on his later years.Leading up to the events of X-Men, X-Men Origins: Wolverine tells the story of Wolverine's epically violent and romantic past, his complex relationship with Victor Creed, and the ominous Weapon X program. Two mutant brothers, Logan (Hugh Jackman) who will become Wolverine of the retractable claws and Victor (Liev Schreiber), born 200 years ago, suffer childhood trauma and have only each other to depend on. Basically, they're fighters and killers, living from war to war through U.S. history. In modern times, a U.S. colonel, Stryker (Danny Huston), recruits them and other mutants as commandos. Logan quits and becomes a logger, falling in love with a local teacher (Lynn Collins). When Logan refuses to rejoin Stryker's crew, the colonel sends the murderous Victor. Logan now wants revenge. Along the way, Wolverine encounters many mutants, both familiar and new, including surprise appearances by several legends of the X-Men universe (Ryan Reynolds, Taylor Kitsch, Dominic Monaghan, Daniel Henney, et al) whose appearances in the film series have long been anticipated.The first half of the film is sensitive and humanistic (Ryan Reynolds manages to insert his expected spot-on one liners to keep the story light) – the second half is pure CGI tricks (though according to the featurettes Hugh Jackman performed all his own choreographic fights). Better than expected and a really fascinating cast!",8,4,6,2 July 2017
Alexander," A Director's Cut Reformation of Alexander
","Few films have garnered the criticism as the theatrical release of the much maligned Alexander and that fact always stirs the curiosity cauldron - in this case, so much so that Oliver Stone decided to re-edit and re-compose the original version into this Director's Cut DVD. Now the film can be viewed in the relatively inexpensive milieu of the home and perhaps more folks will give another (or, as in my case, a first) look at what the grumbling is all about.Alexander is a big film about a big person who did big things. How a story so altered by time, history, myth, and folklore could be translated to the screen strains the imagination - but not Oliver Stone's - a man who loves big events and big issues. And I think he succeeds in drawing us into the atmosphere of the 'civilized world' of Alexander's time. Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) relates the history of a man who wished to tie the known world together into one empire and would have us believe that dream was altruistic as well as destined. Through a series of flash forwards and flashbacks the birth to death of Alexander is pieced together: each time a great moment or crisis occurs in Alexander's life, the story backtracks to explain the etiological influences of that particular step in Alexander's march around the globe.The settings of Alexander's youth in Macedonia are breathtakingly beautiful in the cave painting details of the various gods and heroes and heroines that so deeply influenced the life of Alexander - Medea, Oedipus, Herakles, Zeus, etc. If the entire film had been able to maintain this mystic quality of ambiance, this would have been a powerful work. But once the scenes begin to disperse to Persia, India, Greece, etc the film becomes Hollywoodized and hearkens back to the Cecil B. DeMille view of ancient history, garnished with expensive sets and costumes and endless dancing maidens and overwrought battle sequences.Where this film (at least this version) is best is when it approaches the passion of Alexander for Hephaistion. Few writers or film makers have dared to enter the arena of homosexual love of heroes of history and this is where Stone takes the chance - and then unfortunately heavily edits the romance from this 'director's cut'. A missed opportunity to examine an important aspect of neglected history is sad.As for the cast, Colin Farrell does his best with the script he has in making us believe in Alexander, and he is able to connect the chemistry with Jared Leto's Hephaistion well. Angelina Jolie is aptly smarmy as the snake-loving Olympias, Val Kilmer's Philip, grotesquely hidden behind scars of makeup, is suitably evil, but given the tritely written roles of Aristotle (Christopher Plummer) and Roxane (Rosario Dawson) the rest of the cast is forgettable.But now that the film is available in two forms for less money than a pair of theater tickets perhaps more people will watch, plug in to Oliver Stone's concept, and the air will clear. I, for one, think it is a film worth watching! Grady Harp",8,1,8,3 August 2005
Hot Fuzz," A British Bellyful of Laughs
","British comedies remain an ilk of their own - smart, sassy, full of quips rendered so quickly that many are lost in the ether that propels the plot, and characters who often are such finely-honed parodies that they make us laugh at ourselves. HOT FUZZ is a fine example and it is a film brimming with a cast of some of England's finest talent who seem to be having as much fun as the viewing audience.Sgt. Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is one of London's finest new policemen, expecting a smart career in the big city, but instead is transferred by jealous superiors (including Bill Nighy) to a little village where his rigorous training seems wasted on the sleepy town. After a first night's arrest of youthful pubsters and an inebriate driver, he reports to duty to discover the that his first 'arrest' is to be his partner PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) who just happens to be the slow son of the chief, Inspector Butterman (Jim Broadbent). The staff at the police station resembles a vaudeville team played by such fine actors as Paddy Considine, Rafe Spall, Timothy Dalton etc, not exactly what Angel had in mind as a career advancing opportunity. But soon enough the threads of evil that are beneath the silly facade of the village begin to unravel and what follows is a hilarious, almost Keystone Cop attack on the loonies in this take off of an Agatha Christie plot that curdled.And that only touches the surface of this witty little farce: the innuendoes pop up out of every situation, giving the astute viewer quiet chuckles throughout the film. Hidden from obvious view are little vignettes by such luminaries as Cate Blanchett, Steve Coogan, and Peter Jackson! Director Edgar Wright, who wrote the script with Simon Pegg, knows his way around the genre and the result is an hysterically funny evening's entertainment. Grady Harp",8,2,3,8 March 2008
Constantine," Yet Another Animated Comic Book Creature
","The trailer for CONSTANTINE made it looking vaguely intriguing: majestic wingspan lifting above Gabriel's head, murky derring-do in the streets of Los Angeles, the presence of Tilda Swinton (always involved - until now - in interesting dramatic films), Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou, and yes, Keanu Reeves. So what happened? Director Francis Lawrence should stick to his prior experience with making music videos. After the first few minutes of this tired and monotonous script (deliver in tired monotonous bland monotone by Reeves) you know you should just switch it off. But then come monsters emerging from the neck of a young girl undergoing exorcism, silly discovery of a lost spear by a border-crossing Mexican peasant in front of whom all animal life dies, suicides, 'up pops a new monster' episodes etc etc. The apparent struggle between good and evil forces seems it may have been the impetus for this overblown mess, but others have done it better - many, many, many times ad infinitum. When will the public's tolerance (? demand) for this genre be exhausted? Grady Harp",1,0,5,23 July 2005
Brokeback Mountain," Discovering Love: The Longing to Make It Fit
","E. Annie Proulx visited a cowboy bar in Wyoming and felt an underlying eroticism seething in that most macho of possible places. That observation translated into a courageous short story in 1997, a study of love between two cowboys whose world would never condone such feelings (remember Laramie?), and so 'Brokeback Mountain' was born in New Yorker Magazine. Now that tender and heartbreaking tale of hidden, durable, passionate love between two young men trapped in a society that will not allow such feelings has been luminously transformed in to a film: it is rewarding to see how successful that long journey became.The story is so well known that it need not be summarized beyond the brief statement that two nineteen year old young men, both with histories of abandonment, need, and pain, find physical attraction in the cold nights on Brokeback Mountain while guarding sheep, and though both assure each other that neither is gay, the love creeps out of the night physicality into the daytime sunny thrills of feeling alive and cared for. After only a couple of months, their job completed, they part ways, each marrying, having children, but over almost twenty years they periodically reconnect, understanding the depth of their forbidden love, and cope the best they can. Divorces ensue, promises of being together permanently are thwarted by a number of reasons, and the while the story evaporates into the lonely landscape of Wyoming, the love that bonded them, a love they could never 'own', ends.Ang Lee molds this magnificently poignant love story with grace, style, realism, and bravery. Proulx's story is made visual by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana's screenplay and while the script is true to the story on the whole, there is much added business about the wives and children and parents that perhaps is necessary for moviegoers to 'get it', but in this viewer's mind is less sensitive than the extended silences within the vast spaces of Wyoming that made Proulx' story so quietly and powerfully understated. Heath Ledger is superb as Ennis Del Mar but Jake Gyllenhaal is equally as strong as Jack Twist: together they create a chemistry racked with pain as well as bliss and make their characters totally believable. Michelle Williams does well as Ennis' long suffering wife Alma, while Anne Hathaway remains Anne Hathaway, a lady far too elegant to be convincing as the cowgirl Lurene the Jack marries in the vacuum without Ennis.But criticisms are few (the only major one is that Gyllenhaal has not been sufficiently recognized for his brilliant portrayal in Heath Ledger's shadow). This is a beautiful film that addresses love and all its permutations and it is so refreshing to see a story of this depth and significance so quietly and tenderly placed before the theater audience. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, December 05",10,48,63,17 December 2005
About Time," Lesson #1: All the time traveling in the world can't make someone love you.'
","Expect to be in for a jolly good ride if a film is both written and directed by Richard Curtis (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, Love Actually). Add a fine cast of actors, a bit of a kink with time travel (of sorts) and out comes this little British confection perfect for Valentine's Day – or any day when an uplifting bit of romantic fluff is needed.The setting for the most part is Cornwall and the film is narrated by 21year old Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) who is awkward with finding a girlfriend and in general unlucky in love, as played out in a rather disastrous New Year's Eve party. But things change when Tim's father (Bill Nighy) tells his son that the men in his family have always had the ability to travel through time. Tim can't change history, but he can change what happens and has happened in his own life-so he decides to make his world a better place...by getting a girlfriend. Sadly, that turns out not to be as easy as you might think. Moving to London to train as a lawyer, Tim finally meets the beautiful but insecure Mary (Rachel McAdams). They fall in love, and then an unfortunate time-travel incident means he's never met her at all. So they meet for the first time again-and again-but finally, after a lot of cunning time traveling, he wins her heart. Tim then uses his power to create the perfect romantic proposal, to save his wedding from the worst best-man speeches, to save his best friend, playwright Harry (Tom Hollander) from professional disaster, and to get his pregnant wife to the hospital in time for the birth of their daughter, despite a nasty traffic jam outside Abbey Road. During his life, Tim uses his gift to fix not only his errors, but also in the lives of his relatives and friends.Tim's family is a bit on the loony side and in addition to Bill Nighy as his wondrously gifted father, there is Lindsay Duncan is his mum, Richard Cordery is his space cadet Uncle D and Lydia Wilson is his sister nutty but sweet sister Kit Kat. Margot Robbie, Vanessa Kirby, Will Merrick and Tom Hughes offer excellent cameos. The time travel idea peters out once the film has started but the idea has been planted and helps make this frothy film float. 'We're all traveling through time together, every day of our lives. All we can do is do our best to relish this remarkable ride.'",9,3,4,13 February 2014
Spotlight," 'a story about degenerate clergy, and a story about a bunch of lawyers turning child abuse into a cottage industry.'
","This city, these people... making the rest of us feel like we don't belong. But they're no better than us. Look at how they treat their children. Mark my words, Mr. Rezendes. If it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a village to abuse one.' In what is likely the finest ensemble film of the year – writers Josh Singer and Tom McCarthy, director Tom McCarthy, a cast of our finest actors – will hopefully gain rewards at the Oscars. But whether the film 'wins' in the badly bruised Oscar category or not, this film will remain a focal point of cinematic achievement for many years.The plot is well known: The true story of how the Boston Globe uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, shaking the entire Catholic Church to its core. When the Boston Globe's tenacious 'Spotlight' team of reporters delves into allegations of abuse in the Catholic Church, their year-long investigation uncovers a decades-long cover-up at the highest levels of Boston's religious, legal, and government establishment, touching off a wave of revelations around the world.Everyone in the cast is superlative (including Brian d'Arcy James who is oddly missing form mention of the cast members) – Michael Keaton (whose character Robby provides the surprise ending), Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Live Schreiber, Stanley Tucci, John Slattery, Billy Crudup et al. The dialogue is crisp and very intelligent, and the pacing is breathtaking. Superb film worth of everyone's attention.",10,1,3,25 February 2016
500 Days of Summer," Coincidences, Opportunities, Consequences
","(500) DAYS OF SUMMER is a refreshing bit of fluff about the dance of contemporary courting - with a twist. Writers Scott Neustader and Michael H. Weber demonstrate a keen understanding of the bumpy road of romance and have been able to make a film that balances humor and tenderness very well. Director Marc Webb encourages his two fine lead actors to give performances that could just be career boosts for both. Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a completely different role than his usual stereotype) is an architect whose line in the job seeking market landed him in the greeting card business, writing inane messages for silly cards. Feeling as though he will never meet the girls of his dreams, he encounters Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel), a pretty if somewhat evasive and odd girl with her own concept of 'relationships'. Egged on by his friends McKenzie (Geoffrey Arend) and Paul (Matthew Gray Gubler) as well as his very bright 'therapist' little sister Rachel (Chloe Moretz), Tom approaches Summer in a courtship that lasts for 500 days - only some of which are rewarding. It is a back and forth game of ping pong, with Tom the obsessed pursuer and Summer the feather in the wind. There really is no particular linear story here, but instead a series of wonderful vignettes that allow Gordon- Levitt and Deschanel to shine as actors. Webb interweaves drawings with photography in an especially winning way and allows the ping pong ball to bounce to and fro between periods of time in this thwarted courtship. This is not a deep movie, but it is a well designed and acted look at love among the young today. The performances by the lead actors justify visiting this little treasure.

","Teenage pregnancy is frequently a starting point for myriad philosophical arguments: some see it as a major problem, some see it as an argument for the need of early teaching of contraceptive technique and sex education, some see it as a reason for championing abortion, and some see it as a piece of life that confronts families in both positive and negative ways. JUNO is a beautifully written (Diablo Cody) and directed (Jason Reitman) version of unplanned pregnancy offered by a splendid ensemble cast: it is a movie that could modify the sociologic outlook of many people in a very strong fashion. Juno (Ellen Page) is sixteen and talks her best friend Bleek (Michael Cera) into having sex: the result is a surprise pregnancy that Juno shares with her girlfriend Leah (Olivia Thirley) and the store clerk Rollo (Rainn Wilson) even before informing Bleek, a likable kid who seems fairly flat about the situation. After discarding abortion as a viable solution, Juno informs her father (JK Simmons) and stepmother (Allison Janney) of her status, and tells them she is going to complete the pregnancy and give the baby to some loving and needy barren couple. Her parents are at first flustered by the news, but quickly become supportive in a way that tells us many things about the durability of successful families. With Leah's help, Juno answers an ad for 'wanted: baby' in PennySaver and visits the Lorings (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) who desperately want a child and embrace Juno's gesture of adoption with eager excitement. The remainder of the film follows Juno as her abdomen increases in girth, finding new respect for her parents and for Bleek, and inadvertently walking in the troubled waters of the Loring's marital discord. Without giving the story away, the ending is so tender and free of cliché that it allows us, the audience, to appreciate all the vigor and sensitivity and humor and warmth of Juno - an example of developing maturity that is a fresh breeze compared to the usual teenage movies. Ellen Page does indeed deliver a pitch perfect performance, but her co-stars are equally fine: Simmons and Janney break away from their usual type cast roles brilliantly, and the other members of the cast (the entire cast) flesh out this well written story with great skill. The mixture of animated graphics and the imaginative musical score enhance the flavor of the tale. JUNO offers an unbiased look at the topic of teenage pregnancy and wins on every level.

Concussion," 'Repetitive head trauma chokes the brain! And turns man into something else.'
","Peter Landesman wrote (with Jeanne Marie Laskas) and directed this very important film about withholding public awareness of a devastating associated after effect of the game of football. It is surprising that it did not earn academy awards – especially for star Will Smith. But that fact may be tied to the desire to remain uninformed about adverse effects of the country's national sport – and all the money and crowds and media coverage that accompany the sport.CONCUSSION is a dramatic near documentary based on the incredible true David vs. Goliath story of American immigrant Dr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith), the brilliant forensic neuropathologist who made the first discovery of CTE, a football-related brain trauma, in a pro player and fought for the truth to be known. Omalu's emotional quest puts him at dangerous odds with one of the most powerful institutions in the world – America's form of Roman gladiators, Football. The supporting cast is excellent - Alec Baldwin as the ex- Pittsburg Steelers' team physician turned compatriot Dr. Julian Bailes, Albert Brooks as Dr Cyril Wecht who supports Dr Omalu's research, Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Dr Omalu's devoted wife, David Morse as Mike Webster whose autopsy at his death provides the initial brain material for Dr Omalu's discovery of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, in addition to major players Eddie Marsan, Adewale Akinnouye-Agbaje, Paul Reiser and Luke Wilson.The film is extraordinarily well done, factual without being sensational, and places before the public a very serious problem intimately connected to the country's national sport. The NFL will not be happy but the audience will.",10,2,4,17 July 2016
The Day After Tomorrow," 'I think we are on the verge of a major climate shift!'
","Though this film was made in 2004 and too few people realized the implications of Writer/Director Roland Emmerich's sci-fi fantasy as being in many ways a call to attention of the ignoring of the global climate due to our interference with the natural aspects of this planet, watching it again in 2013, with the backlashes of the hideous hurricanes and ice storms and the tsunamis and the drought and the hottest year on record being 2012, hopefully will provide a bit more serious look at the concept THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW offers. Yes, it is exaggerated for impact and the visual effects tend to take over the personal stories that lie so closely under the surface, but watch it and think. This is where we likely are headed - or something very like it.Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) is a Paleoclimatologist stationed in the Antarctica where he finds that a sheet of ice the size of Rhode Island has sheared off. 'Our climate is fragile. At the rate we're polluting the environment and burning fossil fuels, the ice caps will soon disappear.' Concurrently the planet is witnessing severe weather changes - and Jack's son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) is in New York with friend Laura (Emmy Rossum) and others when enduring an endless rainstorm they witness a massive tidal wave in addition to freezing cold temperatures that could possibly kill them. In the background is Sam's physician mother (Sela Ward) who brings a sense of personal agony to the realization that the world is heading for a next Ice Age. From there the story is a matter of Jack's swearing to save his son trapped in the Library in New York and warning the President (Perry Blake) to take his head out of the sand and realize that the extermination of the human race is possible if evacuations South are not begun. How it ends is predictable and makes the film too shallow, but the message is strong and one we must all heed.The special effects are extraordinarily fine and the cast delivers the sub-stories with skill. Yes, it can be viewed as corny and overblown and a bit on the sanguine side, but the point of the film is well worth our serious attention. Just reflect on the events of the past year and the few years before that and try to deny that we are indeed harming our environment and future. Grady Harp",7,3,6,8 January 2013
Don Jon," 'There's only a few things I really care about in life. My body. My pad. My family. My church. My boys. My girls. My porn.'
","Joseph Gordon-Levitt keeps testing his boundaries as an artist and that is to be applauded. The strength of his performances in the past few films grows steadily and now he branches out in to writing, directing, and starring in a film that is truly his own. Is it a great film? No, but it is an inventive one - and that is a breath of fresh air in the current Marvel Comics shoot-'em-bang-bang-explode obsession. The fact that it deals with the current focus on sex-rated themes may be off putting to many, but that the theme is solely that speaks loudly for a young writer/director to register a parody of our current shaky quasi-relationship fad.There is not a lot of story so the more brief the synopsis the better: A New Jersey guy, Jon Martello (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) dedicated to his family, friends, and church, develops unrealistic expectations from watching porn and works to find happiness and intimacy with his potential true love. Though he has many sexual liaisons those episodes do not fully satisfy him the way onanism in front of a porn video does. He hits on a tacky, gum-chewing, perfect 10 Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett Johansson) but that continued dance has its problems. Finally he meets a very strange older woman Esther (Julianne Moore) who puts a bit of meaning into sexual expression and Jon's life changes - maybe.Gordon-Levitt manages to pull together a fine cast (Tony Danza and Glenne Headly as his parents, Rob Brown and Jeremy Luke as his buddies, et al) and keeps the flavor of the accents and the characters very New Jersey. His writing for Jon's weekly confessions in church is hilarious and in general the dialogue is snappy. Gordon-Levitt spent as much time at the gym as he did creating this film and his very buff body is a showpiece! Everyone who sees this film should realize it deserves an R leaning toward X rating, but then most programs on television do these days, so everyone is used to the porn glut. Nice to see an actor take risks like this.Grady Harp",7,3,6,18 December 2013
Deadpool 2," 'Put your hands behind your knees and get down on your head now!'
","DEADPOOL 2 is a spoof of MARVEL comic book characters, directed with panache by David Leitch, rich in one-liners written by Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick and surpirise! Ryan Reynolds! It is apparently based on the Marvel Comics character by the same name (Deadpool is a fictional antihero Initially Deadpool was depicted as a supervillain but later evolved into his more recognizable antiheroic persona. Deadpool is a disfigured and mentally unstable mercenary with the superhuman ability of an accelerated healing factor and physical prowess. He is known as the 'Merc with a Mouth' because of his talkative nature and tendency to break the fourth wall, which is used by writers for humorous effect and running gags). Even for those saturated with the endless expensive overblown repetitious Marvel Comic films that flood the market (making billions of dollars), This film is funny, not only due to the comedic writing of Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, and Ryan Reynolds, but also due to star Ryan Reynolds inimitable talent for admixing silly banter with heroic handsome good looks and fancy footwork. Very briefly (because there isn't much story), After losing the love of his life, 4th wall-breaking mercenary Wade Wilson aka Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) must protect Russel (Julian Dennison) must assemble a team of mutants and protect Russel from Cable (Josh Brolin), a no-nonsense, dangerous cyborg from the future and Deadpool must learn the most important lesson of all, to be part of a family again.Much of the success of this film is due to the cast - Ryan Reynolds of course, but also a fine role for Josh Brolin as Cable, T.J. Miller, the every glamorous Morena Baccarin (of Homeland fame), as Vanessa, Julian Dennison, Zazie Beetz, Karan Soni, Leslie Uggams as Blind Al, etc.The film does go overboard in noisy destruction and massive killings and foul language, but hey, this is a Marvel Comics outing - so you expect something different? Entertaining if quite a bit too long. Grady Harp, August 18",6,0,2,24 August 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," 'A creepy old man cut my hair off!'
","Another THOR movie, this one written by a cadre of 6 and directed by Taika Waititi and a few added movie stars, this time some humor, and a lot of CGI and the taste is about the same.Story (what there is of it) - Thor (Chris Hemsworth), held captive on the planet Sakaar without his hammer, must win a gladiatorial duel against the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and assemble a team (made up of Hulk (Ruffalo), Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), Thor (Hemsworth), and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to stop the villainous Hela (Cate Blanchett) and the impending Ragnarök, the doom of the Asgardian civilization. New characters pop in and out - Skurge (Karl Urban), Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum), Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), Surtur (Clancy Brown), and of course Heimdall (Idris Elba), and Odin (Anthony Hopkins). BTW, Ragnarök is not a character, just the doom of the Asgardian civilization - in case you're wondering.Does it make sense? Of course not, but then this is a comic book.... If THOR is your thing you'll have a grand time - if you can see through all the aether and other CGI clutter.",5,0,3,3 April 2018
Match Point," An Engrossing, Brilliantly Played Work of Chamber Music
","Woody Allen is always at his finest when he stays away from self-parody: the man can write and direct brilliantly and create solid gems of cultural/society examinations with the best of them! MATCH POINT is a case in point. From the opening credits, to the keenly meaningful voice-over about the significance of luck in molding the course of our lives, to the arresting pause of a tennis ball frozen in its rise from a struck net before falling to either side, to the use of scratchy Enrico Caruso recordings - all of these are indications that Allen is about to lead us into a world defined by walking on razor blade edges. Match Point is an intelligent, burnished, glowing little masterpiece of movie making, a thriller that keeps the viewer bound until the surprise ending.Chris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers, groomed and handsome and magnetic in his first role as a non-quirky oddball) is a lower middle class ex tennis pro who begins his new life as a tennis teacher in a wealthy club where he encounters the Hewett family, a family of immense wealth lead by a benevolent father (Brian Cox), a class conscious mother (Penelope Wilton), a handsome son Tom (Matthew Goode) who is dating a middle class American wannabe actress Nola (Scarlett Johansson), and daughter Chloe (Emily Mortimer). Chris' good looks and manners win the family's affection and he is melded into the fabric of wealth through his attention to Chloe and his movement into the father's business. Sadly for all Chris is attracted to the sensuous Nola who, despite her physical attraction for Chris, knows the steps to climb up the ladder to wealth by being engaged to Tom.Chris falls in love with his new life of luxury, marries Chloe who wants to have children immediately, and yet he lusts for Nola. In time Nola and Tom part (the reason to be outlined later in the film) and though hesitant to shake Chris' marriage to Chloe, Nola becomes physically involved with Chris. The inherent dangers of Chris' infidelity grow to tragic proportions and his knotty dilemma of choosing his new life of comfort versus his lust for Nola result in bits and pieces of luck that determine the outcome of the film.For this viewer it is difficult to fault any aspect of this film: the cinematography by Remi Adefarasin is not only stunning visually - it also captures the tension of the film in mixing tight shots with panoramas isolating the characters in motion of betrayal; the film's music score is almost entirely opera excerpts from old Caruso recordings (know the opera excerpts and the story is enhanced!) and from 'live' stage performances at Covent Garden (superb singing and staging oddly accompanied by only a piano!). But the brilliance of this ensemble is Allen's keenly sensitive eye and timing and pacing of a suspense thriller that always has as its base a fine dollop of social comment and lusty romance. The cast is impeccable, from the consistently superb smaller roles to the tour de force acting of Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Scarlett Johansson, and Emily Mortimer. This is clearly one of the finest works of Woody Allen's long career and hopefully he will continue along this vein. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp",10,0,3,26 April 2006
Midnight in Paris," The Obvious Star is Paris!
","MIDNIGHT IN Paris sounds good on paper and looks in ads. The film opens with a long sequence of views of the sights in Paris - no actors, no story, just the breathtaking magnificence of the City of Light. For this viewer that section i the most rewarding of the entire film. Once the film starts Woody Allen imposes an improbable story with stereotype characters and with a few notable exceptions, it gets stuck in its own cuteness.VERY briefly screenwriter wannabe novelist Gil (Owen Wilson playing Owen Wilson) and his bride to be Inez (Rachel McAdams) are in Paris with Inez' parents (Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy) who in turn are on a business trip. Inez is a bore: Gil wants adventure. As Inez sees the touristy places with her friends, the hideously boring pedantic Paul (Michael Sheen) and his flaky partner Carol (Nina Arianda), Gil escapes to walk the streets of Paris and fall in love with the history and the magic of the city. At the stoke of midnight he is picked up by an elegant car and is taken to the 1920s where he encounters Cole Porter (Yves Heck), Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll), F Scott Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston) and his Zelda (Allison Pill), Josephine Baker (Sonia Rolland), Alice B. Toklas (Thérèse Bourou-Rubinsztein) and Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates), Picasso (Marcial Di Fonzo Bo) and his current flame Adriana (Marion Cotillard who seems to have phoned in her performance), Djuna Barnes (Emmanelle Uzan), Salvador Dalí (Adrien Brody - in probably the only convincing performance in the film), Man Ray (Tom Cordier), Luis Buñuel (Adrien de Van), TS Eliot (David Lowe) - in other words all the famous artists of the 1920s. Gil is captivated by the opportunity to share his work with these greats, though he finds it difficult to understand time travel. He falls for Adriana who in turn wishes she could live in the time of Le Belle Epoque so of course Gil and Adriana time travel again meeting Henri Matisse (Yves-Antoine Spoto), Toulesse-Lautrec (Vincent Menjou Cortes), Paul Gauguin (Olivier Rabourdin), and Edgar Degas (François Rostain) at Maxim's. Gil by day grows less enamored with Inez and by night more infatuated by Adriana and in the end there is a permanent schism between Gil and Inez and we are left with the moral 'Don't wish to live in another time than your own.'Sounds like a run through of famous names? It is. Wilson is inept at romantic comedy, and Woody Allen's script is fairly boring for Allen's works. BUT Paris is Gorgeous - and that is enough! Grady Harp",6,4,5,23 December 2011
The Last Song," For Nicholas Sparks Fans
","Nicholas Sparks has found a formula about teenage angst an finding love despite non- supportive parents: from the number of books and films that use his formula it would seem he has hit pay dirt. THE LAST SONG is Sparks' 14th published novel on the same theme as the preceding 13 and was published in 2009. One year later he transformed that sudsy story (with some help from Jeff Van Wie) into another of his formula films and turned it over to TV director Julie Anne Robinson to map out the predictable story.For a brief outline of the scant story: begin with a divorced family - Ronnie (Miley Cyrus) and her younger brother Jonah (Bobby Coleman) are sent to spend the summer with their father Steve (Greg Kinnear) in an indescribably beautiful waterfront town in Georgia. Ronnie resents her father and has no intention of being friendly or even talking to him for the summer. But after meeting a handsome guy Will Blakelee (Liam Hemsworth) and beginning to fall in love, Ronnie starts rediscovering her love for music, something she shares with her father. Reconnecting with music revives a kinship with her father which proves to be the most important relationship she may ever experience. And there it is. Mix the story with the usual acidic girls in the town who claim Will is a Lothario, overcome that rumor with some all night watches for raccoons who may steal some sea turtle eggs, pop in some father/son meaningful contact, and there you have a Nicholas Sparks formula.Miley Cyrus is Miley Cyrus - and for fans of Hannah Montana that works well. The light of the film is the screen presence of Liam Hemsworth who looks and acts like someone who will succeed in movies. Otherwise, just be advised that this is another setting for a Nicholas parks familiar story; if that is to your liking you will like this. If not, then pass. Grady Harp",Null,8,10,6 November 2011
Youth," 'I have to believe in everything in order to make things up.'
","Italian writer/director Paolo Sorrentino (Il Divo, The Great Beauty, This Must Be the Place, etc) is known for his wispy, experimental films in which he dissects the concepts of love, beauty, meaning, significance, art and the manner in which they interact and influence each other. One line (of many great lines) from the movie sums up the message of YOUTH: 'I want to tell about your desire, my desire. So pure, so impossible, so immoral. But it doesn't matter because that's what makes us alive.' Filmed in the grandeur of the Swiss Alps, the cinematography by Luca Bigazzi and especially the musical score by David Lang add to the mesmerizing theme of age – youth being attainable only to the dreamers and the young of heart. A retired orchestra conductor/composer Fred Ballinger (Michael Caine) is on holiday with his daughter Lena (Rachael Weisz) and his film director best friend Mick Boyle (Harvey Keitel) in the Alps when he receives a visit from an Emissary (Alex Macqueen) from Queen Elizabeth II who invites him to perform his 'Simple Songs' at the request of Queen Elizabeth II to perform for Prince Philip's birthday. Fred refuses – he is retired and there are personal reasons for not wanting the 'Simple Songs' performed (one of the many threads that weave the mystery of aging and memory). Mick, on the other hand, is busy writing his testament – his magnum opus of a film, aided by a strange claque of young writers: the film's production depends on Mick's old friend Brenda Morel (Jane Fonda) starring in the major role. It is the interaction of these two aging artists, observed closely by an actor Jimmy Tree (Paul Dano), and their dissolving into the beauty of the alps scenery that brings surprises an a satisfying conclusion to this daydream of a filmThe acting is excellent, the pacing is slow (like aging) and the musical score is stunning. This is a film that appeals to the intellect as well as the eye and is such a refreshing respite from the clangor of the current films before us today. Relax into this dream state and feel refreshed.",10,0,2,29 May 2016
Zodiac," Obsession
","David Fincher knows how to go straight to the bone, whether that be by grisly effects or wearing down the psyches of his audience. In ZODIAC he traces the very long investigation of the serial killer in the 1960s and 1970s in the San Francisco area who was never found and has managed to mimic that interminably long yet fascinating exploration by taking close to 3 hours to unravel the bits and pieces of evidence that were to confound the police and the press alike. Based on the book by Robert Graysmith (the SF Chronicle cartoonist who became obsessed with the conundrum of the murders) and adapted for the screen by James Vanderbilt, ZODIAC holds the viewers' attention by its smart, edge of the seat development of what could easily been a too-long-song of a docudrama.Much of the success of the film is due to Fincher's pacing and yet a great deal of the credibility of the story falls in the capable hands of a very fine cast. Jake Gyllenhaal portrays the obsessed Graysmith, a man whose life as a cartoonist for the newspaper and as a husband to Melanie (Chloë Sevigny) and father to three children is gradually broken by his preoccupation with finding the serial killer named Zodiac. He is well supported by Mark Ruffalo as Inspector David Toschi and Anthony Edwards as Inspector William Armstrong, Robert Downey as the alcoholic reporter James Avery, Brian Cox as Melvin Belli, and Elias Koteas, John Carroll Lynch and others in brief but very important cameo roles.For some the film may feel like a long frustrating bore, but magnify that by the real life situation the Zodiac killer created over extended years and the frustration of the forces who wouldn't let the case die will be realized. Obsession such as this takes patience. The payoff is well worth it. Grady Harp",8,0,0,26 July 2007
Milk," A Splendid and Important Film
","MILK is one of the more powerful bio-epics produced by Hollywood. Harvey Milk, the man honored by this superbly crafted film by writer Dustin Lance Black and directed by Gus Van Sant, is brought to life by Sean Penn in his most skilled performance of his fine career. Not only is this movie an homage to Harvey Milk, but it is also a shaking reminder of the ferocious ongoing battle for Civil Rights. Few viewers will come away from this film untouched. The life of gay activist Harvey Milk is well known, as is his assassination as he finally reached a platform where his voice could be heard. Black and Van Zant have wisely started the story with some black and white footage of the abuse of the gay population across the country and then ease into the biography by showing us Milk in New York, approaching his 40th birthday and discovering Scott Smith (James Franco) as the beginning of not only a tender partnership but also a change in Milk's drive to make a difference. The climb to importance from his migration to Castro Street in San Francisco and the 'recruiting' of his clan (Emile Hirsch as Cleve Jones et al) and the struggles he faced in gaining acceptance of a minority group is the stuff of legends. Penn is extraordinary, but Franco, Hirsch, Josh Brolin as Milk's assassin, and Diego Luna as the kinky Jack Lira turn in excellent performances. Van Zant is unafraid to show the tenderness among his characters: it is satisfying to see prominent male actors take on roles that include same sex intimacy. This is a film that deserves to enter the archives as one of the 'greats.' Highly recommended. Grady Harp",10,2,5,12 March 2009
The Prestige," The Pledge, The Turn, The Prestige: We see what we want to see
","Jonathan and Christopher Nolan have collaborated on previous projects (namely the brilliant MEMENTO) and here take on Christopher Priest's dazzling novel THE PRESTIGE. Where MEMENTO kept the audience tense and on the edge of the seat and of quizzical mind, THE PRESTIGE attempts to use the same techniques but ends up being an overly long, at times ponderous, and ultimately rather bland examination of illusion and magic and the need audiences have to believe in what they see as an exit route from the mundane lives they lead.The time is turn of the century England (with a foray into the United States) when Magic Shows were a popular form of entertainment (as they still are in Las Vegas). Two friends - Borden (Christian Bale) and Angier (Hugh Jackman) - are both fascinated with illusion and are frequent audience volunteers for magician tricks. The boys become magicians themselves with Borden becoming the superior illusionist and Angier the superior showman. Their rivalry is healthy until an unfortunate illusion/trick fails at the hands of Borden and the loss of the beloved assistant of Angier. From this point the two friends become archenemies, each sworn to discover the secrets of the other, a journey which eventually leads to murder and the ultimate illusion of life over death.There are so many subplots that they defy summation. Suffice it to say that inventors (electricity scientist Nikola Telsa - David Bowie), magic machine creators (Cutter - Michael Caine), wives (Julia Angier - Piper Perabo and Sarah Borden - Rebecca Hall), lovers (Olivia - Scarlett Johansson) all weave in and out of the plot, at times illuminating the ideas and at times confusing them. The ending is predictable: it is the only way to explain the Transported Man secret trick. Still, in all, THE PRESTIGE is an entertaining if uninvolving film and while the characters may not make us care very much for them, they are well executed by a strong and literate cast. The production values are what really make the film work. Worth an evening's viewing - a long evening... Grady Harp",8,0,2,21 February 2007
Sleepy Hollow," Tim Burton's Visually Stunning Masterpiece
","As far as adaptations of old American novels go, Tim Burton's visually rich, tightly composed, resplendent version of Washington Irving's 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow' ranks in the top echelon. The script for the screen is the work of Kevin Yagher and Andrew Kevin Walker and while it takes some liberties from Irving's story, the resulting dialogue and action pacing are so wholly in keeping with Burton's vision that it feels like an original story.Much of the magnificence of this film is due to the atmospheric set design by Rick Heinrichs (with art direction by Ken Court, John Dexter, and Andy Nicholson with set decoration by Peter Young) and Colleen Atwood's extraordinary costumes. It is not usual to credit these artists when reviewing a film, but their contributions are an integral part of the success of the movie.As far as acting, Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane shines in a fully nuanced character portrayal complete with paraphernalia and ticks and mild madness. He is ably supported by Christina Ricci (in one of her finest moments), and a troupe of brilliant actors that includes Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson, Casper Van Dien, Jeffrey Jones, Richard Griffiths, Christopher Lee, and Ian McDiarmid. They appear as though they are daguerreotypes, so perfectly in keeping with the time and period and mannerisms of Irving's novel. The musical score by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki are synchronous with Tim Burton's brilliant direction. This is a treasure of a film. Highly recommended.

Hotel Rwanda," 'I promise to tell your story'
","With these words written on a visitors' log in a memorial site in Rwanda, the reason for making this stunning film is posed. HOTEL RWANDA is not only a well written (Keir Pearson), well directed (Terry George), well acted (entire cast) work of cinematic history, it serves as a thunderingly loud announcement of how the world ignored the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, Africa - a country whose only exports are tea and coffee and therefore not high on the agendas of importance of the other nations of the world. HOTEL RWANDA brings us the realization that there are many unreported acts of inhumanity that never reach our television or radio or newspapers. How many of us knew about this incident before now? But this well-crafted film is all the more poignant because it focuses on the quiet heroism of one elegant, enlightened hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) and his response to the Tutsi rebel uprising that resulted in the slaughter of over a million people, and for what reason? Going back to the time when Belgium 'owned' the country they divided the people into the Tutsi and Hutu categories based on skin color, nasal width and other absurd parameters. With Belgium's exit the two parties were placed in delicate balance and long years of struggle for control resulted in the 1994 disaster.The senselessness of the genocide is shown by the selection of victims for which the Tutsi rebels depended on registration cards to identify Tutsis from Hutus: in reality the people had intermarried - even Hutu Paul was married to Tutsi Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo) - so that the killings were wholly irrational. Given this madness, Paul struggles with the insurgency and gives shelter to as many people as he can squeeze into his hotel, refugees including orphan Tutsis, hotel staff, and friends and fellow countrymen in need of a Gilead. All of this is happening while the United Nations contingency led by Col. Oliver (Nick Nolte) is impotent and the outside reporters such as Jack Daglich (Joaquin Phoenix) grab footage of the slaughter and flee to safety. Only a Red Cross nurse Pat Archer (Cara Seymour) remains to assist in any way she can. Paul attempts to contact the outside world through his employer Mr. Tillens (Jean Reno) of the Belgian Sabena Airlines, but the world refuses to recognize the reality of Paul's plight in saving his countrymen.The cast is exceptional: Don Cheadle and Sophie Okoneda are brilliant in their roles and the supporting cast is superb. The DVD opens with a statement from Don Cheadle the actor, the movie unfolds, and the remainder of the CD includes 'the making of' sequences and historical segments that for once are not self-serving aggrandizement, but sensitively informing pleas for understanding and digestion of a genocide that was ignored. This is a powerful film that deals with an atrocity without electing to lambaste the viewer with gore: the message is more powerful for its understatement.",10,1,1,17 April 2005
Once," Ad lib
","There is much to love about the quirky little film ONCE: it is honest, simple, transparent, and made with a low budget and lots of love. The leading characters are gentle people who happen to sing as well as act and the love story they create is a fragile little tale that remains in the air as a nice memory after the credits are past.A Dublin busker (Glen Hansard) is a songwriter and singer who plies his music on the streets when his is not helping his warmly generous father (Bill Hodnett) in his vacuum repair shop: his songs reflect a ruptured love affair and are sensitively poignant. Along comes a Czech girl (Markéta Irglová) who sells flowers on the streets but is impressed enough with the lad's music to stop, listen, and even put ten cents in his case. The two strike up a friendship (the girl plays the piano in a music shop during lunch hour) and in time these two bruised people interact in the wavelength of their love of music. The lad meets the girl's daughter and mother (Danuse Ktrestova) - the father of the child is still in the Czech Republic -, they all become friends, and with the help of a few fellow musicians they cut a recording that hopefully will launch the lad's career in a trip to London. The mood of the extemporaneous feeling piece is one of developing love that can only happen once, especially given the histories of each of the two musicians.Writer/director John Carney demonstrates how a simple story can be made into a touching film for under $150,000. and on a shooting schedule of 17 days. The featurettes have just as much tenderness in outlining the production of the film as the film itself. The only problem with the film for this viewer is the music, which seems redundant and repetitive: for those who favor this type of music this will not be a 'flaw'. It is admirable that films like this are being made, restoring our faith in honest craftsmanship backed by warmth of intent. Grady Harp",7,8,9,20 December 2007
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Intense, Relentless Intrigue
","TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY is a challenging cinematic interpretation of John le Carré's novel of the same name, This is not an action movie: this is a quiet study of how the intelligence operations of several countries function - slowly, quietly, secretly, mesmerizingly, and occultly. To fully comprehend the complex story it would be best to read the novel first: the film condenses a long tale into just over 2 hours and for the uninitiated this can result in a conundrum of semi-fleshed out events. But if you are in for an intense psychological drama that requires 100% of your attention then this is a movie to savor.One aspect of the confusion that accompanies this film's story is the random uses of time changes - some things are shown in various stages of their development as they affect the story and some remain in the present, giving a time travel feel to the film. Odd little bits of action clarify this for the viewer: in the opening of the film George Smiley (Gary Oldman) is fitted for new glasses (a very fine bit of photography form cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema) and that is the clue that when he is wearing his new glasses we are in the present and not in a flashback.As for story it is fairly well known: we are in the Cold War in the 1970s and Control (John Hurt), the irascible Head of the British Intelligence resigns after a botched attempt to ferret out a mole in Hungary by sending Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) on a mission. Prideaux is killed. Convinced there is a Russian agent serving as a mole Control brings on George Smiley (Gary Oldman) to investigate a story agent Ricky Tarr (Tom Hardy) feels compelled to share. Smiley considers that the failure of the Hungary operation and the continuing success of Operation Witchcraft (an apparent source of significant Soviet intelligence) confirms this, and takes up the task of finding the mole. Through the efforts of Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberbatch), Smiley obtains information that eventually leads him to Jim Prideaux, the agent at the heart of the Hungary fiasco. And on it goes with the resolution of events offered to the viewer behind the same sort of shady gauze that hides much of the work of Intelligence.The strong cast includes key roles by Toby Jones, David Dencik, Ciarán Hinds, Colin Firth and Simon McBurney. Though Gary Oldman's performance is definitely worthy of the praise he has received, it is the performance by Tom Hardy that sets a level of excellence to which all the other actors must strive to achieve. Have a good night's sleep that night before viewing, a couple of strong cups of coffee, and stay hyper alert: the film is well worth exploring and digesting. Grady Harp",8,1,2,21 March 2012
Molly's Game," 'You know what makes you feel okay about losing? Winning.'
","Aaron Sorkin is one of the finest writers for the screen today - Charlie Wilson's War, The Social Network, Moneyball, Steve Jobs, The American President, A Few Good Men, The West Wing for television - and while the topics he elects to write are controversial, he always comes through with brilliant dialogue and dizzying pacing to that actors who are given the opportunity to bring his work to our eyes and minds are challenged to create their best work. To add to the success of MOLLY'S GAME Sorkin also directs and the result is a film that dazzles.Molly's Game is based on the true story of Molly Bloom Jessica Chastain), an Olympic-class skier, driven by her father (Kevin Costner) to succeed, who ran the world's most exclusive high-stakes poker game for a decade before being arrested in the middle of the night by 17 FBI agents wielding automatic weapons. Her players included Hollywood royalty, sports stars, business titans and finally, unbeknownst to her, the Russian mob. Her only ally was her criminal defense lawyer Charlie Jaffey (Idris Elba) I, who learned that there was much more to Molly than the tabloids led us to believe. The final scene between Molly and her father is one of the most gripping on film.In addition to the bravura performances by Chastain and Elba and Costner, there are many superb cameos by such actors as Michael Cera, Jeremy Strong, Chris O'Dowd, Brian d'Arcy James, Bill Camp, Graham Greene, Justin Kirk, Samantha Isler (as the young Molly), et al. Truly one of the most powerful and disturbing films of the year.",10,0,3,15 April 2018
Crash," 'In LA, people don't touch. They're separated by glass and steel..'
","and the only time they come into contact is by crash'. And with these words Paul Haggis tears open the box of CRASH, one of the most searingly vital and important films of the year. This is a film that explores prejudice, racism, fear, hate, bigotry, random violence and all of those barriers we people of the cities have erected to isolate ourselves from the miscegenated world in which we live. In Haggis' hands every possible form of miscommunication based on ignorance and transference of self-loathing is woven together in a story that mixes Caucasian, African American, Asia, Persian, Hispanic conflicts and lifestyles and the concurrent disruption of world views gone wrong into a pungent story of tragedy and collision.Every character in this well-crafted script eventually confronts every other character in ways that are at times coincidental, at times, tangential, and at other times the direct result of prior confrontations. African Americans bully each other over their own prejudices, Caucasians belittle their Hispanic workers and are the first to point the finger at the 'tattooed gangsters' who in reality are innocent tradesmen, Persians terrorized on their property immediately aim their hate at other minority suspects, redneck racist policemen thrash out at African Americans in response to their own personal family demons that have eroded their outlook and extend that venom to the most innocent of the rookie cops who metamorphose into like habits. Every form of prejudice and hate is encountered and none of the characters is free from being both the perpetrator and the victim. It is as though the Golden Rule of 'Do unto others as you would have others do unto you' has been hideously transformed into a reason for violence.Each member of this extraordinary ensemble acting team is outstanding form those with the largest parts to those whose presence is fleetingly meaningful. And some of the actors heretofore know as B actors rise to the level of brilliance under Haggis' knowing direction. Matt Dillon, Ryan Phillippe, Don Cheadle, Terrence Howard (here is a star!), Thandie Newton, Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Larenz Tate, Loretta Devine (extraordinary!), Beverly Todd, Jennifer Esposito, Michael Pena (who delivers the most affecting scene in the film), Shaun Toub, Yomi Perry, Brendan Frasier, Sandra Bullock, Tony Danza, William Fichtner - indeed, the list of the entire cast should be included in the kudos.People leave the theater stunned, tearful, informed, and incredulous, so great is the impact of this film. Much or that impact is aided by the brilliantly creative cinematography of James Muro and Dana Gonzales and by the powerful musical score by Mark Isham. This is quite simply one of the finest films of the year by anyone's standards. For those critics who descry Haggis' lack of providing 'Redemption' for the characters, this viewer would take offense: every character is altered either tangentially, directly, or referentially by the tightly woven tapestry that is CRASH. Recommended for everyone to see, internalize, and begin to make changes on our planet. Grady Harp",10,0,5,24 July 2005
BlacKkKlansman," If I am not for myself, who will be? If I am for myself alone, who am I? If not now, when?
","Finally director Spike Lee is being nominated for an Oscar for this troubling film based on a true story. The film is based on Ron Stallworth's book about his experience with the Colorado Ku Klux Klan and the reenactment of the story is very well presented, despite the gut-wrenching events it relates.In the early 1970s, Ron Stallworth (John David Washington, son of Denzel Washington) is hired as the first black officer in the Colorado Springs, Colorado police department. Stallworth is initially assigned to work in the records room, where he faces racial slurs from his coworker Andy Landers (Frederick Welller). Stallworth requests a transfer to go undercover, convinces his Jewish colleague (Adam Driver) to go undercover as a surrogate white supremacist, and is assigned to infiltrate a local rally at which national civil rights leader Kwame Ture (birth name Stokely Carmichael - portrayed by Corey Hawkins) is to give a speech. At the rally, Stallworth meets Patrice Dumas (Laura Harrier), the president of the black student union at Colorado College. While taking Ture to his hotel, Patrice is stopped by patrolman Andy Landers, a corrupt, racist officer in Stallworth's precinct, who threatens Ture and sexually assaults Patrice.The plot rambles a bit to include a terrifying overture of Dr. Kennebrew Beauregard (Alec Baldwin) offering history and a racist tirade, the influence of David Duke (Topher Grace), and Klansmen Walter Breachway (Ryan Eggold), Felix Kendrickson (Jasper Pääkkönen) and his wife Connie (Ashlie Atkinson) and Ivanhoe (Paul Walter Hauser), and ends with the 2017 Charlottesville riots (actual footage) with neo-Nazis and white supremacists marching the streets, and some disturbing moments from Donald Trump and the real David Duke.Tough to watch but important to see.",8,4,8,27 January 2019
Fast & Furious 6," Hail, hail the gang's all here - but now minus one
","Mixed emotions his the viewer seeing FAST AND FURIOUS 6 for the first time knowing that Paul Walker is gone and wondering what will happen with the in process Fast and Furious 7. But in ways that fact makes this movie more treasured. It is a whoop-'em up fast action packed film that takes your breath away with the wild car chases and one the ground derring- do. Writer Chris Morgan and director Justin Lin have this medium down to a predictable but fine science.The plot is fairly simple (as usual) allowing the telling of the story to be more important than any big philosophical notions. Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson, with even larger biceps varices!) has Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) reassemble their crew (Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Sung Kang) in order to take down mastermind Shaw (Luke Evans) who commands an organization of mercenary drivers across 12 countries. Payment? Full pardons for them all. The big driver is to 'rescue' Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who seems to be with Shaw's group after suffering amnesia, back into their fold. Wild situations abound and they are as exciting as ever – if not more so!Definitely worth watching even for those who are not long term F & F fans. It is a terrific action film with sparkling actors having a great time. Grady Harp December 13",9,5,8,12 December 2013
The Expendables," A Hoot and A Holler!
","Even for those who are fatigued by the loud, bloody, pyrotechnical messes, and absurd cloned plots of the past few years' thriller movies, THE EXPENDABLES is bound to please. Why? Simply because it is a parody of this genre, with a hilarious script of puns written by director and star Sylvester Stallone (with David Callaham, probably the one responsible fro sticking the story line together). No one really takes this action flick seriously because of the fun the actors are having. It is reunion time for the likes of Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone), knife pro Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), martial arts pro Ying Yang (Jet Li), rasty renegade Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren), Toll Road (Randy Couture), and Tool (Mickey Rourke) - collectively called The Expendables, biking through another impossible adventure. The 'other side' (villains who are destroying a Gulf island include Eric Roberts, Paine (the impossibly huge Steve Austin), the good/bad puppet General Garza (David Zayas form 'Dexter'), and the general's rebel daughter Sandra (Giselle Itié). There is a lot of body destruction, firebombing, and breathless chases, and for an action drama it is very well paced. But the pleasure of the film comes form seeing all the famous guys of yesteryear having such a great camaraderie. There are even small cameos for Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger! It is a fun ride with a lot of unexpected laughs as these men make fun of their past films and stereotypes! Grady Harp",8,4,7,28 November 2010
Pan's Labyrinth," The Blurring Line Between Reality and Fantasy
","PAN'S LABYRINTH is a mystery cloaked in the garb of a fairy tale for adults. It is an examination of the cruelty of the Civil War in Spain as Franco assumed prominence and the extent to which some people would resist or escape: one of those means of escape just happens to be fantasy. Writer/Director Guillermo del Toro proves his potential as one of the more important experimental filmmakers with this haunting, mesmerizing tale of a young girl's ability to cope with the world into which she is plunged.Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is the eleven year old daughter of Carmen (Adriana Gil) whom we first meet as the mother and daughter move to the deserted mill to live with Carmen's sadistic and brutal new husband, Falangist Capitán Vidal (Sergi López). Carmen is pregnant with Vidal's child and upon her arrival she is ordered to bed attended by the housekeeper Mercedes (Maribel Verdú). Ofelia is frightened by Vidal and his cruel world and by the deteriorating condition of her very pregnant mother and follows a strange insect that leads her to a secret opening into a labyrinth. Her curiosity and desperation to find a better place leads to her discovery of an entirely different world beneath the ground, a world run by the Faun (Doug Jones) who gives Ofelia three tasks that will assist her in making her world above ground a better place. Ofelia must choose between the ever increasing terror surrounding her new home with Vidal and his heinous behavior and overcome the fear of the grotesque but fascinating world of Pan's Labyrinth: the story ends with the manner in which a child must face the realities of the failure of the adult world and find successful solutions - whether those solutions be reality or fantasy.Guillermo del Toro has chosen a superb cast of actors, extraordinary visual effects technicians, cinematographer Guillermo Navarro and music composer Javier Navarrete to create this magical tale. The film becomes one of the finest examples of the use of fantasy in an historical setting. It is bound to become a classic. Grady Harp",10,3,6,21 May 2007
The Flowers of War," Maintaining Humanity in Time of War
","The gruesome realities of the Japanese invasion and conquering of the city of Nanking, China in 1937 have been brought to the screen on a regular basis: In The Name of the Emperor form Christine Choi and Nancy Tang in 1998, Nanking form Bill Gutentag and Dan Sturman in 2007, City of Life and Death form Chuan Lee in 2009 and John Rabe from Florian Gallenburger in 2009, and now come THE FLOWERS OF WAR from Yimou Zhang in 2011. Though the story is based on facts, the various movie versions vary considerably on what really happened. THE FLOWERS OF WAR is based on Geling Yan's novel '13 Flowers of Nanjing,' the story gathers an improbable collection of people -- Bale's freelance American mortician, a group of convent schoolgirls and the women from a local brothel -- in the nominal refuge of a Catholic cathedral as the capital falls to Japan's Imperial Army. There are so many sidebar stories and characters introduced that the enormous impact the other films created is somewhat diluted here despite some quality direction from Yimou Zhang. As the LA Times critic stated, 'The Flowers of War has broken new ground for China's movie industry: It's among the first domestically financed films to star a high-profile Hollywood actor (Christian Bale), and its reported budget of close to $100 million makes it the country's priciest production to date. But when it comes to storytelling, Zhang Yimou's 19th feature is decidedly backward-looking: A lavish period weepie set against the atrocities of the Nanking Massacre, 'Flowers' abounds with well-worn movie archetypes and slathers on schmaltz.'Briefly stated, in 1937 China, during the second Sino-Japanese war, a mortician, John (Christian Bale) arrives at a Catholic church in Nanjing to prepare a priest for burial. Upon arrival he finds himself the lone adult among a group of convent girl students and prostitutes from a nearby brothel. When he finds himself in the unwanted position of protector of both groups from the horrors of the invading Japanese army, he discovers the meaning of sacrifice and honor. Innocence-vs. -experience is an undeniably strong theme. The girls' tender adolescence heightens its impact, especially given the historical facts. The Nanking Massacre is also known as the Rape of Nanking, and it's more than a figurative description: The Japanese invaders committed horrendous sexual assaults against the female population. In 'Flowers,' the girls' safety becomes the paramount concern of the survivors holed up in the cathedral.Christian Bale seems to struggle with this character and his performance is not particularly convincing or moving. The aspect of this film that overcomes the over-production qualities (hiring Joshua Bell to provide a violin solo seems a bit much, etc) is the story itself, a bit of history that cannot be replayed often enough to again remind us how war alters man - and that survival, no matter the method, is the laudatory aspect of human caring.

The Way Back," Die Free or Live as a Prisoner
","THE WAY BACK is a discovery: there are some themes of films such as the bleak one this title suggests that we too often avoid, think that there is only so much that can be expressed or processed in a long stretch of a prolonged escape. Nothing could be further from the truth in the case of this film. It begins in 1940 'when seven prisoners attempt the impossible: escape from a brutal Siberian gulag. Thus begins a treacherous 4,500-mile trek to freedom across the world's most merciless landscapes. They have little food and few supplies. They don't know or trust each other. But together, they must withstand nature at its most extreme. Their humanity is further tested when they meet a teenage runaway who begs to join them on their quest. A compelling testament to the human spirit, this gripping wilderness adventure is Peter Weir at his hypnotic best', as one critic from the Telluride Festival phrased it. The screenplay by Peter Weir and Keith R. Clarke is based on the Slavomir Rawicz novel 'The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom' and despite the controversy about the facts as portrayed in this film, this is a human versus nature drama that quietly explodes with an intensity that is at times nearly unbearable, while at other times extraordinary in the manner it shows how men survive the most impossible obstacles. From the beginning of the film in a Soviet Gulag the escapees include a Polish political prisoner Janusz (Jim Sturgess), a Russian criminal Valka (Colin Farrell), and American Mr. Smith (Ed Harris) who was caught working in Moscow when war broke out, and Zoran (Dragos Bucur), Tomasz (Alexandru Potocean), Kasik (Sebastian Urzendowsky) and Voss (Gustaf Skarsgård). During their 4500 mile across the Gulag, Siberia, the deserts of Mongolia, the Himalayas in China and into India they encounter a young girl Irena (Saorise Ronan, in an incredibly sophisticated performance), also escaping the Soviet Union, and she becomes part of the survival team. The well-written script allows the human element in all its forms to rise out of the struggle with Nature and thanks to Peter Weir's astute direction and the incredible cinematography of Russell Boyd the epic is a deeply moving tale.

The Book Thief," 'The only truth that I truly know is that I am haunted by humans.'
","That a film that is so meticulously made and directed by Brian Percival with a cast of brilliant actors in excellent performances and concentrating on a different view of WW II Germany should have attracted well in the box office. It failed. But here it is now in DVD format and in many ways this may be the best way to absorb this compelling story.THE BOOK THIEF, based on the beloved bestselling World War II-era novel by Markus Zusak and adapted for the screen by Michael Petroni, tells the story of Liesel Meminger (Sophie Nélisse),a spirited and courageous young girl who transforms the lives of everyone around her when she is sent to live with a foster family, Hans Hubermann (Geoffrey Rush) and his caustic wife Rosa (Emily Watson) in World War II Germany. Her brother has died and her mother is selling Liesel for cash. She arrives having just stolen her first book, 'The Gravediggers Handbook' - it will be the beginning of a love affair with books. Her new Papa teaches her to read and bestows love and affection while Mama remains businesslike and cold. Liesel's only friend is Rudy (Nico Liersch), a spicy little neighbor boy with whom she becomes close. The Hubermann's agree to hide a young Jewish lad Max Vandenburg (Ben Schnetzer), the son of a close family friend, who is ill. The Hubermanns and Liesel nurse him back to health but as the war progresses Max must leave to prevent the Hubermanns from being discovered as harboring a Jew. Papa is conscripted but returns and eventually the village is bombed at the peak of the war. How Liesel deals with all of these changes makes for a fascinating, emotionally gripping story.The aspects of the film are so beautifully wrought – acting, cinematography (Florian Ballhaus), musical score (John Williams), screenplay, story – that this is a film that likely will become part of movie lovers' libraries. The fact that it is narrated by Death (Roger Allam) may have put off many people in the theater. At home, it is simply another haunting element Highly Recommended.",10,2,5,14 March 2014
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," The Many Facets of Stephen Sondheim's SWEENEY TODD
","When it comes to a work of the musical stage it is difficult to imagine a finer one than Stephen Sondheim's SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET. For those who saw the original 1979 Hal Prince extravagant production starring Angela Lansbury and Len Cariou/George Hearn, and then the 2005 revival as condensed so creatively by John Doyle and re-orchestrated by Sarah Travis who placed the orchestral instruments in the hands of the 10 actors who tell the story of the strange Todd, the Tim Burton (screenplay reduction by Josh Logan) film will only enhance the pleasures of seeing SWEENEY TODD resurrected in yet another form. Each of these incarnations has its riches and together they establish Sondheim's work as a masterpiece.Johnny Depp makes a convincing Sweeney Todd, in looks and demeanor as well as in singing voice, and Helena Bonham Carter's Mrs. Lovett fits right into Tim Burton's vision of the dark, squalid and seedy London. Timothy Spall is perfect as the oily Beadle, Alan Rickman makes Judge Turpin an understandable villain, Jamie Campbell Bower and Jayne Wisener are suitably infatuated young lovers, and Sacha Baron Cohen and Ed Sanders give top flight cameos as Signor Pirelli and Toby. The one advantage of seeing this fine film on DVD is the option of turning on the subtitles so as not to miss a word of Sondheim's superb lyrics.For this viewer, however, the most successful version of this 'opera' is the John Doyle production currently on the boards in Los Angeles with Judy Kaye as the most satisfying Mrs. Lovett on record. This uniquely economical and endlessly creative production goes to the core of the work better than any other version, and if this traveling company comes anywhere near your home, go see it! It is the essential SWEENEY TODD and a fine adjunct to seeing the film version again and again. Grady Harp",10,0,2,3 April 2008
Horrible Bosses," Another must miss....
","HORRIBLE BOSSES is. Why there is a continuing need to put films of this sort before the market is cause for concern. The story is ludicrous - maybe playing out the fantasies most people control about disliking their 'bosses' is OK but actually showing it is another item altogether. Potty mouth dialogue, sociopathic behavior supposedly masked by three guys who 'really aren't all that bad', and placing the roles of Bosses who are over the top obnoxious and maladaptive in the hands of actors of the caliber of Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Anniston, and Colin Farrell is a gross waste of talent. Then padding the 'story' with appearances (albeit brief) by Donald Sutherland, Bob Newhart, Jamie Foxx and especially Ioan Gruffudd - there must be some favors owed somewhere.It is a committee written script (Michael Markowitz, John Francis Daley, Jonathan Goldstein) and it shows: this is more a disconnected series of standup comedian jokes than a story. Seth Gordon directs with a heavy hand on exasperatingly gross language and sexual innuendoes, insulting just about everybody possible. The only saving grace about this 'film' is the comedic timing by Jason Bateman and his cohorts in crime - Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis. There are some funny lines but the sorry mess you have to wade through to get to them is hardly worth the effort. It is an embarrassingly poor film, but as with the popularity of The Hangover et al it sells tickets. Sad. Grady Harp",Null,4,9,15 October 2011
The Polar Express," Too Much, yet not Enough, of a Good Thing
","In 1985 sculptor Chris Van Allsburg published his first children's book, THE POLAR EXPRESS, which became an instant classic, especially appropriate for family reading during the holidays. The beauty of the book was not only a simple story about a lad's discovery of the real meaning of Christmas, but also the power of Allburg's glorious art - which was awarded with the Caldecott Medal in 1986.Some of that book is retained and some of that is lost in this grossly overproduced, extravagantly expensive, film transition of the book. For reasons only known to director Robert Zemeckis, who also adapted the story for his film, and to his long time friend Tom Hanks, the decision was made to make not just an animated feature and not a computer enhanced film using actors, but a strange amalgamation of the two. We are seeing puppet-like characters morphed to resemble real people - and that must have caused the animators headaches but earned big money! But despite the bigger than life extravaganza version of basically an intimate story, the theme comes through and the message is sweet. Whether the 'fillers' heavily frosted on this version are additive is up to the taste of the viewer. But it is a tour de force for Hanks who plays almost everyone in the film, and it is evident that the film's heart is in the right place. Grady Harp",5,1,4,24 November 2005
Black Mass," 'Bulger's playing us, making a fool of the Bureau. We're in too deep, and he knows it! God help us all.'
","'Bulger's playing us, making a fool of the Bureau. We're in too deep, and he knows it! God help us all.'Director Scott Cooper brings us via screenwriters Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth the true story of Whitey Bulger, the brother of a state senator and the most infamous violent criminal in the history of South Boston, who became an FBI informant to take down a Mafia family invading his turf. It sounds impossible but the tale is true and the director makes sure every detail of every person involved is summarized at film's end. If Mafia type crime films are your cup of tea BLACK MASS will certainly satisfy. For most, despite a huge case of outstanding actors, the story is so fragmented that it seems an ongoing bloodbath and once again we are privy to the corruption within the law enforcement system – especially in Boston. The synopsis pulls it together rather well: 'Based on a true story of James 'Whitey' Bulger (Johnny Depp), an Irish Mob godfather and FBI informant who had a 'secret trading' deal with his brother, William 'Billy' Bulger (Benedict Cumberland), a state senator and a Boston public figure, and John Connolly (Joel Edgerton), an FBI agent. They planned to take down the Italian mob and mafia in Boston, which went awry and things turned massively violent. When the credence for each other began fading out, drug dealing, murders, and extortion started to rise, and forced the FBI's Boston office to confirm that Whitey Bulger was one of the most notorious criminals in US history and also one of the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List criminals.'Take a look at the cast – Peter Sarsgaard, Kevin Bacon, Dakota Johnson, Juno Temple, and an array of bit part players each with viable varying accents of Boston areas – and you can see how this violent evening would work. History here – and it still is going on.",8,0,1,28 February 2016
The Ottoman Lieutenant," 'The most dangerous place to be during war is in love.'
","Jeff Stockwell provided the screenplay and Joseph Ruben directed this slice of history from the early stages of WW I as it encroached on the Ottoman Empire, driving a split between the Christian Armenians and Muslim Turks as exacerbated by the inclusion of the Russian forces. It is a well-considered examination of the brutality of war, the collapse of both the Ottoman Empire and the decimation/genocide of the Armenians, and the role America played in the drama in providing a safe haven hospital in the midst of the battles. It is also a love story that deals with the same conflicts – religious differences, ancient customs, the then 'secondary role' of women, and the survival of contested love.After her brother's death from tuberculosis, young nurse Lillie Rowe, a beautiful, strong- willed woman (Hera Hilmar), who, frustrated by ongoing injustice at home and her Philadelphia parents' prejudices (Paul Barrett, Jessica Turner), leaves the United States after meeting Jude Josh Hartnett), an American doctor who runs a remote medical mission within the Ottoman Empire - a world both exotic and dangerous, and on the brink of what is about to become the first World War. There, she works as a nurse, and finds her loyalty to Jude and the mission's founder Dr Woodruff (Ben Kingsley) tested when she falls in love with their perceived enemy, Ismail (Michiel Huisman), a lieutenant in the Ottoman Imperial Army. Now, with invading army forces at their doorstep, and the world about to plunge into all-out war, she must make a decision if she wants to be what other people want her to be, or to be herself. The development of the story is well balanced as we see the brutality of the Turks slaughtering Armenians, the prejudices of Americans who fail to respect the value and stature of women endangering their lives to save wounded patients, the artificial barrier between Christians and Muslims in time of war and in the concept of love, and one of the reasons the story plays well is that instead of stereotypes portraying these misconceptions, the writer and director have instead placed those challenging differences in the characters of their story. In many ways this is a love story that addresses all the issues so rampant during WW I. For this viewer it works. Add the extraordinary photography by Daniel Aranyó and the musical score by Geoff Zanelli and the result is a memorable reenactment of a moment in history whose impact remains.",8,4,13,25 August 2017
The Town," A Fine, Smart, Well Made Drama
","THE TOWN, the title refers to Charlestown, a section of Boston infamous for the crime and criminals who hail from that area, and Director, Actor, and Co-Writer (with Peter Craig and Aaron Stockard) Ben Affleck knows this area well as is evident in not only the accents of all of his characters but also in the choices of locations for this fast moving bank heist drama. Affleck knows how to bring out the best in his cast of superb actors - never forgetting that despite the crusty surfaces of his people their lies beneath a bruised psyche. Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) leads a gang of bank robbers - James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Gloansy Magloan (Slaine), Desmond Elden (Owen Burke) - carrying off a series of successful heists dressed in costumes to conceal their identity, laundering their stolen money at the guidance of florist Fergie (Pete Postlethwaite) in a manner that eludes the police. During one of their heists they take a hostage, the bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) whom they release after the heist. Knowing that she may inform the FBI Doug decides to makes friends with her but instead of assuring his fellow gang that she will not be a problem Doug instead falls for her. The FBI - Frawley (Jon Hamm) and Dino (Titus Welliver) - remain hot on the gang's trail, attempting to get information from Doug's old girlfriend Krista (Blake Lively, in a breakout performance!). Doug is conflicted and thinks of leaving the gang so that he won't end up like his father (Chris Cooper) who is in jail, but James is the baddie here and demands the gang stay together for at least one last major heist. A schism arises between Doug and Claire and uncovers a deep scar from Doug's past. From that point on through the end of the film the story is filled with conflicts, chases, the gang's outwitting the FBI and Boston police, all with the gang's penchant for changing disguises frequently. The ending is full of surprises. Though not a great movie, THE TOWN is far better a film than many that are gaining award nominations. One of the reasons is the tight ensemble work by this surprisingly fine cast who together give us a slice of Boston we'll not forget. Well worth watching. Grady Harp",8,1,2,18 December 2010
Shutter Island," The Mind as Prison
","Too rarely are we offered films that are so well written (Laeta Kalogidis does a marvelous adaptation of Dennis Lahane's mesmerizing novel) that after viewing the audience is almost afraid to leave the theater or home screen for fear they may have missed some important information that will help them figure out why the story is so successfully enigmatic. Such is the case for Martin Scorsese's brilliant film, SHUTTER ISLAND. It is only in retrospect, after the shock of the film is over, that the magic of quality cinematic achievement can be appreciated. Then in rethinking the events the film portrays so well the story is as straightforward as Scorsese's vision. The film opens in 1954 nothingness - from out of the fog slowly appears a ship headed toward Shutter Island, a terrifying prison for the criminally insane, and almost incidentally we meet US Federal Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) emetically cloistered in a ship's lavatory while his newly assigned partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) awkwardly waits for him on deck. The two are on a mission to investigate the escape of a female prisoner. They are greeted by curious wardens who escort them onto the terrifyingly ugly and ominous island to meet with the famous psychiatrist Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow). Curious restrictions are placed on the Marshals who decide to return to Boston because of lack of cooperation from the psychiatrists. A hurricane prevents their exit and slowly the story unwinds: Daniels is haunted by memories of his war experience in viewing the concentration camps in Dachau and delusion of his wife Dolores (Michelle Williams) in nightmares he cannot explain. The various aspects of the Marshals' investigation lead them to all of the compounds where prisoners are kept and treated and surgically altered and the terror mounts. To tell more of the story of one man's descent in to madness would distract from the viewer's own grappling with the conundrum of this tale. It must be seen to appreciate the brilliance of the story. In addition to superb performances by DiCaprio, Ruffalo, Kingsley, von Sydow, and Williams there are astonishing well crafted cameos by Patricia Clarkson, Elias Koteas, Emily Mortimer, John Carroll Lynch and a very large cast of bit players. The cinematography is superbly crafted by Robert Richardson. The music score for this moody piece is a montage of works by such brilliant composers as György Ligeti, Krzystof Penderecki, John Cage, Morton Feldman, Schnittke, Lou Harrison, John Adams and even Gustav Mahler whose rarely heard 'Quartet for Piano and Strings in A minor' plays a significant role in the film. On all accounts this is a superb film. Why it did not do well in the theatrical run is puzzling: perhaps it is a long film that is way ahead of its time. Watch it on DVD and become absorbed by all the bizarre mysteries it captures. Grady Harp",10,3,6,10 June 2010
Capote," The DVD Package Makes CAPOTE Even More Gripping
","CAPOTE is a great movie. Let that be said at the beginning of this review. The superb screenplay by Dan Futterman based on the book by Gerald Clarke in turn based on that part of the life of Truman Capote when he was obsessed with writing his final and finest novel 'In Cold Blood', and the extraordinary directing by Bennett Miller who influenced a fine production crew and coaxed brilliant performances from his cast is all a well established fact. That all of this could be brought together in the featurettes that accompany the film on the DVD release is an example of just how fine additive commentaries can be. This is not only a superb film; it is also an equally superb DVD package.Philip Seymour Hoffman as the idiosyncratic author Truman Capote probes the psyche of this strange but gifted writer from his first newspaper clipping of the November 15, 1959 brutal murders of the Clutter family in Holbrook through his immersion in the tiny Kansas town accompanied by his friend and fellow writer Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) absorbing the atmosphere where such a deed could happen, ingratiating himself with investigator Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper) and his wife Marie (Amy Ryan) to gain access to information that will eventually result in material for his projected book. He becomes obsessed with the murderers Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.) and Richard Hickock (Mark Pellegrino), connecting with Smith in particular on a very basic level and providing the men with lawyers to appeal their conviction for a long enough time to eventually hear the truth of the night of grisly mayhem that fascinates Capote so. The story ends with the execution of Smith and Hickock in 1965, an occasion that further bewilders the now fragile mind of Capote as he gains the end to his story while simultaneously watching the loved Smith dangle from the scaffold in death. Each actor is exceptional here: Hoffman does indeed deserve his Oscar for a brilliant portrayal.But it is the aftermath that brings even more poignancy to the film. Hearing Bennett, Clarke, and Futterman discuss the origin of the cinematic idea blends naturally with the production crews' commentary about the choice of Winnipeg, Canada as the location to depict Kansas, the thorough preparation of the design and costuming and color palette and camera techniques, and then the comments by four of the main actors (Hoffman, Keener, Cooper, and Collins) illuminate not only the characters they depicted in the film but also the dynamics of entering into this strange world of bleak winter murder. The effect of the featurettes is staggering and makes the viewer want to immediately replay the entire movie.This DVD package should serve as the template for future releases: the disc in its entirety is an art form that has few peers. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp",10,3,4,22 March 2006
Life of Pi," 'I suppose in the end, the whole of life becomes an act of letting go, but what always hurts the most is not taking a moment to say goodbye.'
","As is obvious from the number of rave reviews this film LIFE OF PI was are sounding success in the theaters when it was shown in 3D. There is no question but that the story, so well known over the past decades since the publication of the book of the same name by Yann Martel, draws everybody in, whether because of the indomitable spirit of our surviving hero or the religious aspects of the story. Perhaps because of all the hoopla about director Ang Lee's manipulation of CGI effects and the endless interviews about the making of the film that make the final product (on DVD at least) seem so contrived and unreal that some viewers will find the end product less than satisfying a version of the novel. David Magee sculpted the screenplay from the novel and while that provides a lot of background about the character of Pi before the main event of the lost at see episode, it does seem disruptive at times and in this viewer's response robs the story form some of the poetry.The story has been summarized elsewhere as follows: 'In Canada, a writer visits the Indian storyteller Pi Patel and asks him to tell a story. Pi tells the story of his life since he was a kid in Pondicherry, India and the origin of his nickname. One day, his father who owns a zoo tells his family that his business is not good and he had decided to move to Canada and sell part of the animals in the United States. They travel in a Japanese cargo ship with the animals and out of the blue, there is a storm followed by a shipwrecking. Pi survives in a lifeboat with a zebra, a orangutan, a hyena and a male Bengal tiger called Richard Parker. They are adrift in the Pacific Ocean and when the tiger is hungry, he eats the other animals. Soon Pi learns that he might find a way to feed and domesticate the tiger to survive.The character of Pi Patel is played for the most part by Suraj Sharma while his earlier years embodiments are shared by Ayush Tandon and Gautam Belur and the adult storyteller by Irrfan Khan. Pi's parents are played by Adil Hussain and Gita Patel and his brother Ravi by, depending on age, Ayan Khan, Mohd Abbas Khaleeli, and Vibish Sivakumar, Rafe Spall is the writer who will create the book from Pi's story, and for a few brief moments Gérard Depardieu plays a Cook on the ship.There are some very beautiful scenes of skies and waterscapes, but we are left wondering how much of this is carton created in the large studio tank that serves as the ocean. Some of Martell's original explanation of the various religions Pi adheres to are retained: they were the best part of the novel. Perhaps in 3D this film would have worked better.

Doctor Strange," 'Death is what gives life meaning. To know your days are numbered. Your time is short.'
","Death is what gives life meaning. To know your days are numbered. Your time is short. Another MARVEL comic book has entered the very crowded space for superheroes and CGI dominance - this time it is DOCTOR STRANGE and the combination of fantasy and special effects and very fine script writing and a superb cast (directed by co-author Scott Derrickson) is a winner. Or as the PR states, Marvel's 'Doctor Strange' follows the story of the talented neurosurgeon Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) who, after a tragic car accident leaving his talented hands useless, must put ego aside and learn the secrets of a hidden world of mysticism and alternate dimensions in a lace in Katmandu called Kamar-Taj in search of a cure, but instead discovers the mystical arts and becomes a powerful sorcerer battling dark forces bent on destroying our reality. Based in New York City's Greenwich Village, Doctor Strange must act as an intermediary between the real world and what lies beyond, utilizing a vast array of metaphysical abilities and artifacts to protect the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Leaving his female interest (Rachel McAdams) he encounters a fellow traveler Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor), Wong (Benedict Wong), the evil Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelson), and the true star of the film The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton). The special effects enhance the story as well as any fantasy movie around, but it is the wry sense of humor as well as the intelligence of Benedict Cumberbatch that makes the film a welcome addition to the Marvel Comics spectrum. The Ending with a brief conversation between Doctor Strange and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) assures us this is a 'to be continued' series.Even for those fatigued by the overkill of Marvel Comics films, this one is an infusion of fresh air.

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," 'All this anger, man, it just begets greater anger.'
","Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, Seven Psychopaths) wrote and directed this very tough but brilliant story about anger, revenge, agony, prejudice - and redemption. Every character in this dramatic tour de force is drawn with equal parts hate and anger - with a dollop of hope and forgiveness and reconciliation in the end. It is a phenomenal achievement. The language is saturated with foul/vulgar/trash type language but it fits the area and the particular character in this darkly comic drama. After months have passed without a culprit in her daughter's murder case, Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) makes a bold move, painting three signs leading into her town with a controversial message directed at William Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), the town's revered chief of police. When his second-in-command Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell), an immature mother's boy with a penchant for violence, gets involved, the battle between Mildred and Ebbing's law enforcement is only exacerbated. Mildred's son (Lucas Hedges) is seemingly the only stable character despite his absentee father (John Hawkes) and 19-year-old girlfriend (Samara Weaving) antics and his mother's foul pained mood. The pinnacle of angry young men is policeman Dixon (Sam Rockwell in a brilliant performance) whose movements include severely harming the sign maker (Caleb Landry Jones) as well as violating all manner of laws. Peter Dinklage portrays James, the 'town midget' whose role is also key to the denouement of the action.Rape, murder, arson and many other forms of violence fill the screen but McDonagh makes it all make sense. McDormand, Rockwell, and Harelson are astonishingly but then there isn't a weak member in this extraordinary cast. This is one of the best films of the year, despite the subject matter at the core of it.",10,18,30,2 March 2018
Empire of the Sun," 'Learned a new word today. Atom bomb. It was like the God taking a photograph.'
","Some films never age, they just become more important with repeated viewings. This is the time to add this DVD to your library at the extraordinarily inexpensive price. It is a treasure and seeing 26 years after its initial release only enhances the impact this film made on the world not yet ready for such an epic.Tom Stoppard wrote the screenplay based on J. G. Ballard's autobiographical novel 'The Empire of the Sun' which tells the story of a boy, James Graham (Christian Bale, very young and very talented), whose privileged life is upturned by the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, December 8, 1941. Separated from his parents, he is eventually captured, and taken to Soo Chow confinement camp, next to a captured Chinese airfield. Amidst the sickness and food shortages in the camp, Jim attempts to reconstruct his former life, all the while bringing spirit and dignity to those around him. Somehow Bale manages to transform from the pampered British aristocracy in Shanghai through the changes brought about by the Japanese invasion of China and becomes a survivor and a little hero role model to many.Steven Spielberg directs this epic with a cast that includes John Malkovich, Miranda Richardson , Nigel Havers, Joe Pantoliano, Leslie Phillips, Masatô Ibu, Ben Stiller among others. It is a deeply moving film, beautifully captured in cinematography and musical scoring - a film that belongs in the library of all film buffs. Grady Harp",10,3,8,5 August 2013
American Sniper," 'If you think that this war isn't changing you you're wrong.'
","Why do we as a species just keep killing, making war, destroying countries, making surviving soldiers' minds scared and dysfunctional? For those of us who have been through extended combat in wars throughout the last century and into the present answers to those questions escape us. But despite the lurid subject matter of watching men kill men under the umbrella of 'war', films such as this keep our eyes focused on the pity of war. Jason Hall adapted the book of the true events as recorded in their book by Chris Kyle, Scott McEwen and James DeFelice and form all the facts molded a story that gives us a distilled version of the four tours of duty in Iraq as a navy Seal Sniper that 'won' Chris Kyle 160 kills and in doing so allowed us to witness the moral and mental deterioration of a man's soul. This film SHOULD be seen.Chris Kyle was a Texan who wanted to become a rodeo cowboy, but in his thirties he found out that maybe his life needed something different, something where he could express his real talent, something that could help America in its fight against terrorism. Post 9/11 happened, so he joined the SEALs in order to become a sniper. After marrying Taya, Kyle and the other members of the team are called for their first tour of Iraq. Kyle's struggle isn't with his missions, but about his relationship with the reality of the war and, once returned at home, how he manages to handle it with his urban life, his wife and kids. It does not end well for anyone.Clint Eastwood's direction is razor sharp and he doesn't miss a step. Bradley Cooper brings an astonishingly fine performance in allowing us to see all aspects of this driven man. Sienna Miller is excellent as his sensitive wife, and there are poignant little character vignettes by Jake McDorman as Biggles, Luke Grimes, Sammy Sheik as the Iraqi counterpart to Chris, Navid Negahan, Jonathan Groff, Cory Hardrict, Keir O'Donnell and many other in this huge cast. The cinematography is so realistic it is difficult to watch and the locations in Morocco are disturbing real. The film will keep you awake after seeing it, and it should.",10,69,129,19 April 2015
The Devil Wears Prada," Meryl Streep Once Again Proves She Act Any Role!
","THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA may put off many moviegoers because it sounds like a silly bit of fluff best seen when released on DVD. But this is a fine little movie that, despite its rather predictable and silly storyline, gives a number of fine actors the opportunity to sharpen their skills in playing roles not usually associated with their repertoire. Especially in the case of the brilliant Meryl Streep, who here proves she can be a convincing evil witch and yet hold our attention for her rare vulnerable moments. This is a piece of powerful characterization.The story is both well known because of Lauren Weisberger's Top 10 on the charts novel and because the story of a plain Jane making it big in the corporate world at the risk of jeopardizing her ideals and private life. But the story works again, this time draped in the fashion magazine industry.Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) is a reporter without a job, a girl simple and physically unsophisticated with a chef boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier) and extended family, who is placed for interview with Runway Magazine as the personal assistant to the editor Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep). And is dowdy but smart, and Miranda decides to take her one despite her other assistant Emily (Emily Blunt) and jeering crowd's amazement. Miranda is a Diva who is a control freak, spits out demands as she tosses her wrap and purse on the assistant's desk, communicates only is stingingly acidic one liners, and is in general a fearsome Titanic of a woman. The story revolves around Andy's transformation by magazine worker Nigel (Stanley Tucci) et al and within weeks Andy is Miranda's right hand person, responsible to her whims 24/7. This obligation and change wrecks havoc with Andy's personal life, leads to a Paris fashion trip, an encounter with Christian Thompson (Simon Baker),a hunky writer with high credentials when sets out to woo Andy, and eventually Andy must make some choices about the speedy treadmill on which she finds herself.Yes, it is a bit of Working Girl, Cinderella, etc but it works on screen due largely to the fine performances by the entire cast - but especially for the stunning tour de force by Streep. Clothed in an endless array of fashionable outfits, Streep is the epitome of the fashion guru: she hasn't looked this beautiful in a long time and this film reminds us that she is a very attractive as well as inordinately gifted actress. This role is so well played that it may even be listed in the Oscar category. Now who would have ever expected that from the rather silly idea of The Devil Wears Prada? Strong work!

Lion," 'We wanted the two of you in our lives. That's what we chose.'
","In a time where immigration is a raw debate along comes a true story that is not only touching on the level of the main character but also speaks clearly about the adoption agencies around the world placing lost or unwanted children in other countries where parents can afford them. This is a multifaceted story and one that gleams from each of the facets.The setting is 1986 India in the Hindu region. Saroo (a sensationally fine Sunny Pawar) was a five-year-old child in India of a poor but happy rural family. On a trip with his brother Guddu (Abhishek Bharate), Saroo soon finds himself alone and trapped in a moving decommissioned passenger train that takes him to Calcutta, 1500 miles away from home. Totally lost in a strange urban environment and too young to identify either himself or his home to the authorities, Saroo struggles to survive as a street child until he is sent to an orphanage. Soon, Saroo is selected to be adopted by the Brierley family (Nicole Kidman and David Wenham) in Tasmania, where he grows up in a loving, prosperous home. Yet for all his comfort and good fortune, Saroo finds himself plagued by his memories of his lost family in his adulthood (as played by Dev Patel) and tries to search for them even as his guilt drives him to hide this quest from his adoptive parents and his girlfriend Lucy (Rooney Mara). Only when he has an epiphany and his use of IT revolutionary technology known as Google Earth does he realize not only the answers he needs, but also the steadfast love that he has always had with all his loved ones in both worlds.The novel 'A Long Way Home' by Saroo Brierley was adapted for the screen by Luke Davies and directed with great sensitivity by Garth Davis.

Gone Baby Gone," One of the Year's Best Fims: Oscar Ignored!
","Ben Affleck has written (with Aaron Stockard) a superb screenplay adaptation of Dennis Lahane's novel GONE BABY GONE and has proceeded to direct this tough tale with an ensemble cast of both well-known actors and unknown actors and walk-ons from the streets of the Boston area where they grisly story takes place. The result is a film so well tuned and realistic with a perfect sense of pacing and character development that it becomes a remarkable calling card for Ben Affleck's career as a director. That it is going unnoticed (with the exception of Amy Ryan's nomination for Best Supporting Actress) by the Oscars is a grave oversight ! The time is contemporary Dorchester, Massachusetts and Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and his girlfriend/partner Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan), become aware of a missing child Amanda (Madeline O'Brien) in their own neighborhood. The child's aunt Bea (Amy Madigan) and uncle Lionel (Titus Welliver), unable to cope with Amanda's drugged out mother Helene (Amy Ryan), knock on Patrick and Angie's door, pleading with them to help find Amanda: Patrick and Angie are private detectives who just happen to be an integral part of the neighborhood. Reluctant at first to become involved in the now 3-day police hunt for the child, a hunt headed by the respected Captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) who his lost his own daughter in similar circumstances and detectives Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Poole (John Ashton) and who as a triad feel they are competent to handle the case without the 'immature experience' of the young couple. But Patrick and Angie do become involved, uncover leads within the neighborhood that lead to the clues behind the missing child incident and in doing so, unravel a lot of corruption within the police force, and also discover differences between themselves that threaten their otherwise close relationship. To say more would remove the incredible tension this story maintains all the way to the fadeout credits.The cast is uniformly excellent, from the smallest roles to the most major ones. It is difficult to single out any performer for praise as this is truly an ensemble piece. The flavor of the film is honest, unflinching, and refuses to ignore the grotesque incidents that must be shown for the movie to maintain its impact. Writer Dennis Lahane ('Mystic River', 'Shutter Island') is a master of detailing the spectrum of responses that ugly matters induce: even the most noble of intentions have their shadowy side. Affleck finds all of this in this excellent film, a film so strong that it easily bears repeated viewings. Highly recommended...but not for the squeamish. Grady Harp",10,1,2,13 February 2008
Southpaw," 'I can't lose my daughter. I'll give you my everything.'
","How many times can this story be told? The answer is like 'infinite' because we see the same sad boxer film with different twists and casts almost every year. SOUTHPAW was written by television series writer Kurt Sutter and directed by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, Shooter, Equalizer, Olympus Has Fallen, etc). The reason the tired story and slow movie holds together is due to the splendid acting of Jake Gyllenhaal, Rachel McAdams, Forest Whitaker, Oona Laurence and Naomie Harris. Otherwise it is a predictable, slow moving, same old story rehashed.The story? – 'As tragedy strikes him in his prime (his beloved wife Maureen – Rachel McAdams – is killed after he has won the title of boxing champion at Madison Square Garden), famed boxer, Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal) begins to fall into a great depression. Once the decision regarding the custody of his daughter Leila (Oona Laurence) is under question, Billy decides to get his life back on track by getting back into the ring. He turns to trainer Tick Wills (Forest Whitaker) to help him get his life back on track after losing his wife in a tragic accident and his daughter to child protection services.'The musical score is James Horner's last and it is sad that it is so weak. There is some fine cinematography by Mauro Fiore – lots of closes ups of boxers beating each other bloody – and some moody lighting. But in the end - no surprises, completely predictable, and very slow. The reason for enduing it is the extraordinarily fine acting by Gyllenhaal et al. Grady Harp, November 15",7,1,2,1 November 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," One of the Best Comic Book Hero Film Adaptations
","CAPTAIN America succeeds on so many levels that it is difficult to list them all. But perhaps one of the most refreshing aspects of this film is that it treats the story in a time frame (WW II) that makes the 'supernatural heroes and villains' seem like operatically overstated normal people. Opening the film with the superhero as a skinny nerdy but ethical and committed to do good kid and then see him transform into the hero of heroes who for once is doing good things because he cares about his fellowmen and his country makes for a feel good experience. Dapple that with some old-fashioned 1940s Rockettes type dance sequences and keep the 'impossible gimmicks' down to a level of near credibility and you have a winner.Quick, borrowed plot outline: 'It is 1942, America has entered World War II, and sickly but determined Steve Rogers is frustrated at being rejected yet again for military service. Everything changes when Dr. Erksine recruits him for the secret Project Rebirth. Proving his extraordinary courage, wits and conscience, Rogers undergoes the experiment and his weak body is suddenly enhanced into the maximum human potential. When Dr. Erksine is then immediately assassinated by an agent of Nazi Germany's head of its secret HYDRA research department, Johann Schmidt aka the Red Skull, Rogers is left as a unique man who is initially misused as a propaganda mascot. However, when his comrades need him, Rogers goes on a successful adventure that truly makes him Captain America and his war against Schmidt begins.' And that about says it all.Now, populate this story with a cast of first rate actors - Chris Evans as the magnificent Adonis built Steve Rogers/Captain America, Stanley Tucci as Dr Erskine, Hayley Atwell as the sole 'love interest' Peggy Carter (Natalie Dormer does have a few seconds of screen time, too), Tommy Lee Jones as the military guy in charge, Sebastian Stan as Steve's best buddy, Dominic Cooper (a good guy), and a set of villains starting with Hugo Weaving as Red Skull, Toby Jones as Dr.Zola, Richard Armitage as Heinz Kruger and then fill in the spare parts with the likes of Samuel L. Jackson, Neal McDonough, Derek Luke, Kenneth Choi, JJ Feild, Bruno Ricci, Michael Brandon, Martin Sherman etc and the results are almost guaranteed to be good. Joe Johnston directs the film in a propulsive fashion that takes time out for some humanity amid all the military derring-do and allows just the right amount of sarcasm and humor (courtesy the screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) and it all comes out 'just swell'. A terrific night's entertainment! Grady Harp",Null,8,15,26 October 2011
American Hustle," 'The art of survival is a story that never ends'
","David O. Russell and his entire crew created one of the most impressive films of last year. Strange it was so highly honored by everybody but the Oscars. If ever there were a candidate for Best Ensemble Cast American HUSTLE wins hands down. Loosely based on the Abscam, which for those who have forgotten, 'Abscam—sometimes written ABSCAM—was a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) sting operation run from the Bureau's Hauppauge, Long Island, office in the late 1970s and early '80s. The operation initially targeted trafficking in stolen property but was converted to a public corruption investigation. The FBI, aided by a convicted con-man, videotaped politicians as they were offered bribes by a fictional Middle Eastern sheik in return for various political favors. The investigation ultimately led to the conviction of a United States Senator, six members of the United States House of Representatives, one member of the New Jersey State Senate, members of the Philadelphia City Council, the Mayor of Camden, New Jersey, and an inspector for the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service.' Given that bit of reality, Russell and cast and crew created a stingingly brittle yet funny movie.American HUSTLE is set in the alluring world of one of the most stunning scandals to rock our nation. It tells the story of brilliant con man Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale), who along with his equally cunning and seductive British partner Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) is forced to work for a wild FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper). DiMaso pushes them into a world of Jersey powerbrokers and mafia that's as dangerous as it is enchanting. Jeremy Renner is Carmine Polito, the passionate, volatile, New Jersey political operator caught between the con-artists and Feds. Irving's unpredictable wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) could be the one to pull the thread that brings the entire world crashing down. Elisabeth Röhm is Carmine tacky wife, Louis C. K. plays Stoddard Thorsen, Michael Peña is the Mexican man pulled in to impersonate Sheik Abduklah, Alessandro Nivola is the smarmy Anthony Amado, and Jack Huston is the guy Rosalyn goes after – Pete Musane. The costumes, hair, clothes, and sets mirror the tacky 70s and make us all remember how over the top we were. But setting the core of reality for this fictional movie aside, here are some of the finest acting performances on film to savour.",10,0,2,19 March 2014
Incendies," Not simply 'scorching' but 'blistering'
","INCENDIES began as a play of the same name by Wajdi Mouawad and was opened up as only cinema can do by the author with the assistance of Canadian director Denis Villeneuve and consultant Valérie Beaugrand-Champagne. The result is a staggeringly powerful film whose story is so well revealed by a cast of sterling actors that telling too much of the plot would be a disservice to those who come to this experience for the first time. In this viewer's opinion it is simply one of the finest films of the decade and it bound to become a permanent part of the cinematic library.The opening of the film reveals many clues as to the direction the story will take. In a stark room young boys are having their hair shorn: one of the boys as a tattoo on his heal - three aligned dots on the Achilles tendon. After this unsettling beginning the camera moves to Canada in the office of notary Jean Lebel (Rémy Girard) who has the responsibility of executing the will of his secretary Nawal Marwan (Lubna Azabal in an illuminating performance that plays through the entire film) and presenting the will to Nawal's Lebanese- Canadian twin children Jeanne (Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin) and Simon (Maxim Gaudette) Marwan. The will divides Nawal's worldly goods equally between the children, but describes in detail how the deceased mother is to be buried (naked, face down, with no coffin in an unmarked grave) and provides two letters charging Jeanne and Simon to find the father and brother they did not even know existed. The remainder of the film moves back and forth between the past and the present as the twins attempt to find their living relatives and the story of how Nawal's life was an unbelievable nightmare. Nawal was a Christian Lebanese, had a lover who was a Palestinian, and when her lover is killed she realizes she is pregnant, shaming her family and thus forced to give up her boy child to an orphanage - but not before her grandmother sensitively tattooed the three dots on his heel for future recognition. From that point Nawal becomes a mathematician, a hired killer, is imprisoned and tortured and once again becomes a mother. The twins trace clues as detectives to follow the rocky road of Nawal's life and make discoveries that are astonishing.Though Lubna Azabal is clearly the central star of this film, the entire cast particularly Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin and Maxim Gaudette as the twins is exemplary. Very little of the tragedy of Nawal's life is spared but the power that comes from the moments of discovery of the truths of that life lies in the quiet shock in the eyes of the twins. This is an amazingly powerful film that keeps the audience tension level high making the surprising ending just that much more powerful. The cinematography by André Turpin manages to capture both the vast power of the Middle Eastern desert and villages as well as the moments of intimacy. The musical score by Grégoire Hetzel enhances the atmosphere and the story line very subtly. But in the end it is the sensitive direction of Denis Villeneuve that brings with human tragedy of a story alive. Highly recommended. Grady Harp",Null,0,4,27 September 2011
The Bourne Ultimatum," A Breathless, Intelligent, Finely Honed Part 3 of the Bourne Series
","Paul Greengrass has stepped into the director's shoes for this third installment of the Jason Bourne identity crisis and in doing so has created nearly two hours of tension that would make Robert Ludlum proud! This is an example of how Hollywood can shine when it integrates all of the components of an 'action suspense thriller' by capitalizing on finding the best contributors available - actors, producers, cameramen, stunt men, script (Tony Gilroy, George Nolfi and Scott Z. Burns), composer of music (John Powell), editors - everyone of the hundreds required to pull off this superlative film. It is as fine as any thriller can be and reflects the intensity of concentration and understatement and respect for the viewers' intellect that crowned his excellent UNITED 93 and THE BOURNE SUPREMACY. The result is a polished movie that remains compelling form the opening frame to the final credits.For those who have read or watched Ludlum's Bourne trilogy the story line is at core very simple: Jason Bourne has lost his memory and struggles through terrifying confrontations with all governments and potential assassins, endures relentless chases, and defies the machinations of the world's intelligence sources to discover his true identity. The rest of the novels and films are the how.Matt Damon has come into his own as an electrifying screen presence as Jason Bourne: his acting is keen and his ability to hold our concern through impossible situations would be difficult to duplicate by other actors of this genre. The supporting cast includes such superb actors as Joan Allen, David Strathairn, Scott Glenn, Albert Finney, Paddy Considine, Daniel Brühl, Joey Ansah and a very large cast of others. The pacing and use of Intelligence techniques is extraordinary and is beautifully captured by the cinematography of DP Oliver Wood and finessed by the editing of Christopher Rouse.One aspect of this film that is the most frightening is to observe just how invasive the Intelligence portions of our government can be: there seemingly are no secrets about even the most personal aspects of our lives that cannot be flashed on multiscreens in the war room of the CIA and associated organizations. Perhaps this film will be a red flag to alert public attention as to how our right to privacy has been so visibly raped by the government in the name of security - a factor that makes watching this excellent movie even more terrifying!

Rush," 'A wise man can learn more from his enemies than a fool from his friends'
","'Everyone's driven by something' is the perfect tag line for this intense film by director Ron Howard and writer Peter Morgan that successfully revisits the sexy, glamorous golden age of Formula 1 racing in the 1970s. The film is based on the true story of a great sporting rivalry between handsome English playboy James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth), and his methodical, brilliant opponent, Austrian driver Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl). The story follows their distinctly different personal styles on and off the track, their loves and the astonishing 1976 season in which both drivers were willing to risk everything to become world champion in a sport with no margin for error: if you make a mistake, you die. The love interest are provided by actresses Natalie Dormer, Olivia Wilde, Alexandra Maria Lara and the supporting cast is full of fine actors, Pierfrancesco Favino as Clay Ragazzoni among them.The film focuses as much on the internal struggles these opposite drivers had as much as it does on the racing tracks. Philosophical questions are raised that pertain to any sport and Ron Howard knows ho to bring that into focus. Both lead actors are exceptional, with Daniel Brühl - false teeth and all - turning in a fully realized performance as the severely burned but not battered Niki Lauda. This is an action film with doubt, but it is also a psychological dramatization of a true story that for once works very well on film.",8,3,4,9 February 2014
Notting Hill," A Wry British Comedy with Staying Power
","NOTTING HILL was a breath of fresh air when it entered the theaters in 1999. Written by Richard Curtis (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Love Actually, The Girl in the Cafe - as well as the Bridget Jones scripts) and directed by Roger Michell (Persuasion, Changing Lanes, Enduring Love) the story is a bit cockamamie but blossoms in the hands of the fine cast. Now with this Collector's Edition release it is available for us all to appreciate again.William (Hugh Grant) is an ordinary bloke who runs a Travel Book Store in Notting Hill, a man whose life is abruptly changed when an American actress Anna (Julia Roberts) enters his shop and his life. Bumbling William spills orange juice on celebrity-shy Anna and the two cross the street to William's flat, shared with the wildly mad but lovable Spike (Rhys Ifans), and despite poor starts there begins a romance to test all romances. The manner in which William and Anna gradually find each other's vulnerabilities, including exposure to each other's lives - Anna with her celebrity entourage, William with his loony but oh so tender extended family (Tim McInnerny, Gina McKee, Emma Chambers, and Hugh Bonneville) - is the story of love overcoming hurdles. The secondary themes are lovely and beautifully played by this committed cast.For a springy, funny, tender, sweet British humor story, this one is hard to beat. Recommended.

Nightcrawler," 'Do you know what fear stands for? False Evidence Appearing Real'
","Dan Gilroy both write and directed this very disturbing yet very successful film. The story is so close to reality (paparazzi, manufactured crime stories that blast out on the 11 PM news to give us nightmares, shady reportage, the extents to which some people will go for money and fame, etc) that at first the story is painful to watch unfold, but the performances by every actor in the film are so credible and exact and memorable that the film deserves to be high on the list of awards.When Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal in a brilliant performance), a driven man desperate for work, muscles into the world of L.A. crime journalism, he blurs the line between observer and participant to become the star of his own story. Aiding him in his effort is Nina (Rene Russo), a TV-news veteran and his 'hired intern' Rick (Riz Ahmed, in a career making performance). Lou is a guy who's a thief and hustler. He wants to do something else only thing no one wants to give him a chance. One day he witnesses an accident and while the CHP helps the driver, some men (Bill Paxton) show up and record the whole thing. He learns that they intend to sell the footage to a TV news program. So Bloom decides to get into it. He starts small. Eventually the station where he sells his footage to, is impressed with him. Later he comes across a murder and gets there before the police do and records the dead bodies. But he also manages to get the killers on tape but doesn't give it. Instead he intends to wait till he can call the police and record them being arrested. But it doesn't exactly work out that way.The cinematography by Robert Elswit, the musical score by James Newton Howard, and the brilliant direction by Gilroy coupled with the tremendous cast make this hard to swallow film a winner on every level.

Bohemian Rhapsody," 'The human condition requires a bit of anesthesia.'
","This lavishly creative cinematic jewel honors the legend of Freddie Mercury and so much more. The story was written by Peter Morgan and Anthony McCarten (who also wrote the screenplay) and Bryan Singer directed the film with finesse.The title of the film is perhaps the most famous song that Queen created - the members of Queen being Freddie Mercury (Rami Malek)- lead vocalist, Brian May (Gwilym) - guitar, Roger Taylor (Ben Hardy) - drums/percussion, and John Deacon (Joe Mazzello) - guitar. The essence of the film is well described by 20th Century Fox: 'Bohemian Rhapsody is a foot-stomping celebration of Queen, their music and their extraordinary lead singer Freddie Mercury. Freddie defied stereotypes and shattered convention to become one of the most beloved entertainers on the planet. The film traces the meteoric rise of the band through their iconic songs and revolutionary sound. They reach unparalleled success, but in an unexpected turn Freddie, surrounded by darker influences, shuns Queen in pursuit of his solo career. Having suffered greatly without the collaboration of Queen, Freddie manages to reunite with his bandmates just in time for Live Aid. While bravely facing a recent AIDS diagnosis, Freddie leads the band in one of the greatest performances in the history of rock music. Queen cements a legacy that continues to inspire outsiders, dreamers and music lovers to this day.'Yet even that description barely hints at the grandeur and sensitivity of this spectacle. The early Freddie is shared with his family, the Bulsaras (Meneka Das, Ace Bhatti and Priya Blackburn) - a fine bow to his Pakistani heritage, and his early love affair with Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton). Then the rise to stardom begins and Rami Malek soars as Freddie Mercury. The music is lip-synched to the original with great skill and the performances by Malek and his Queen family are outstanding.Supporting roles by Allen Leech, Aidan Gillen, Tom Hollander, Mike Myers and Aaron McCusker are strong as is the cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel. But the crowning element of film is the extraordinarily fine performance by Rami Malek. He MUST get the Oscar!",10,3,4,14 February 2019
Burn After Reading," Silly, But That Seems To Be The Point!
","Joel and Ethan Coen won the market on strange, off-centered movies that toss out bits and pieces of nonsense and lets the audience - and the obviously wildly entertained group of actors involved - put it together as best they can. The Coen brothers have made some very fine films: this just isn't one of them. What little plot there is pops along something like this: Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich), an expert on Balkan affairs, is fired at the CIA: he begins writing a memoir of his past and his responses. His wife Katie (Tilda Swinton) wants a divorce and expects her lover, Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney) - a philandering State Department marshal - to leave his wife Sandy (Elizabeth Marvel). Bouncing along to the next episode, a CD drops out of a gym bag at a Georgetown gym and employees Linda (Frances McDormand), an Internet obsessed date seeker, and Chad (Brad Pitt) attempt to make it big by turning it into cash (Linda wants money for elective surgery, and Chad, a fluffhead goes along). Information on the CD leads them to Osbourne who declines to pay them for the CD so they visit the Russian Embassy as an option. Linda and Chad decide they need more of Osbourne's secrets to enhance their 'valuable CD'. Bounce to another sidebar: Linda's boss Ted (Richard Jenkins) likes her, and Harry's wife leaves for a book tour. The CIA (JK Simmons) is involved and the 'conspiracy' continues to blossom - all so that Linda can have plastic surgery to enhance her status on the Internet dating sites while her partner Chad just plods along in his own oblivious style for the ride. Looking for a meaningful interconnected plot? Good luck! The film lacks sensitive editing that would make it easier to follow the myriad subplots but then that is part of the Coen style. The dialogue is full of puns - embarrassingly so - and instead of trying to make the film make sense it is better to just sit back and let the silliness of human foibles entertain. That is probably why so many of our top film actors sign on for Coen brothers film - to have fun and poke fun at not only the world we live in but also at us. Grady Harp",Null,0,1,5 August 2011
The Last Legion," Toga Epic, Short on Story, Long on Sincerity
","THE LAST LEGION, apparently based on the novel of the same name by Valerio Manfredi and cut and pasted together as a screenplay by Jez Butterworth, Tom Butterworth, Carlo Carlei and Peter Rader, may come across as a rather under-budgeted film as directed by an earnest Doug Lefler, but it does seem to have heart. The scenery is terrific and the cast consists of some of the better actors on screen who seem to have taken on this project out of respect for Lefler. It is entertaining but hardly deep.Based partly on history, the story begins with the short reign of 12-year-old Caesar Romulus Augustus (Thomas Sangster) just days before the Goths overthrown the city of Rome. Under the protection of Aurelius (Colin Firth) and Demetrius (a buffed up and solid Rupert Friend!) and after the death of his parents, the young Caesar takes to the hills only to be captured and sentenced to isolation on Capri with his trusted teacher and adviser Ambrosinus (Ben Kingsley of course). So far so true. From here however we begin the struggle for finding troops to re-take Rome and end up in Britannia, the home of the last legion of Roman soldiers. Along the way the escaping group is joined by a Mira (Aishwarya Rai), a beautiful 'soldier' from Constantinople and all manner of Goths and turncoat Romans (John Hannah, Iain Glen, Peter Mullan, Owen Teale, Harry Van Gorkum, James Cosmo, et al), but once in Britannia their struggles are rewarded by finding the sword of Caesar that saves the day and becomes embedded in a stone and renamed Ex Caliber. And oh yes, Ambrosinus stays alive through the years to become Merlin, the one who now advises King Arthur as a child who will successfully pull the sword from the stone! There is a sincerity of style here and a group of fine actors who seem like they are enjoying their holiday and that feeling extends to the audience. Keep expectations low and the film will provide a satisfying evening's entertainment. Grady Harp",7,0,3,21 December 2007
The Italian Job," The Snap and Polish of a fie Topkapi-type Caper
","THE Italian JOB has style and a grand sense of speed and action in one of the better caper films of recent years. Where other heist-based films push the button for unremitting tension, THE Italian JOB combines sleekly written dialogue and character interaction which makes all of the tension scenes (and there are plenty) all the more credible. The photography of the inevitable car chases and 'inside shots' of the capers is terrific, with the scenes set in Venice, Italy among the best. The cast is electrically charged without that all too familiar over-the-top push. Donald Sutherland and Charlize Theron (father/daughter team) are superb, and Mark Wahlberg, Jason Statham, Seth Green, Mos Def, and Franky G establish a camaraderie that is destined to overcome their betraying partner Edward Norton. With a cast like this you almost don't need a script, but the writing has a fine balance of bite and wit. For sheer explosive entertainment by a crew of winners this movie is among the best in this genre. Grady Harp, January 12",9,1,1,1 January 2012
Justice League," 'There are heroes among us. Not to make us feel smaller, but to remind us of what makes us great.'
","Thought Superman was dead? Well, this film brings him back to life by a company of dazzlingly brilliantly costumed actors - a fine cast who seem to take the whole adventure too seriously - and a director (Zach Snyder) that prefers CGI wowzers to storytelling, perhaps because of the screenplay pasted together by a cast of eleven (count 'em, 11!) writers. But comic book heroes continue to sell well and keep the theaters full - very possibly because these noisy action packed movies are a way to escape the realities of the world in which we live. The 'plot' is well summarized - Fueled by his restored faith in humanity and inspired by Superman's selfless act, Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) enlists the help of his newfound ally, Diana Prince (Gal Gadot), to face an even greater enemy. Together, Batman and Wonder Woman work quickly to find and recruit a team of metahumans to stand against this newly awakened threat. But despite the formation of this unprecedented league of heroes-Batman (Affleck), Wonder Woman (Gadot), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Cyborg (Ray Fisher) and The Flash (Ezra Miller) -it may already be too late to save the planet from an assault of catastrophic proportions. Amidst all the explosions, flying beasties, Amazons, and the evil Steppenwolf (voiced by Ciarán Hinds) up rises Superman (a very buff bare-chested Henry Cavill) and his usual entourage (Diane Lane, Amy Adams) and with the help of J.K. Simmons, Jeremy Irons et al, everything is simply OK again ....maybe.... there will never be an end (or need) for superheroes.For lovers of the comic book realm this one will please. Big on CGI (excellent) and not so much on story.",6,0,0,17 March 2018
Man of Steel," 'What do you think of him?' 'I think he's hot.'
","There are two camps in regard to this yet another exhumation of a comic book hero – those who worship at its altar (and allow it to achieve a box office intake of $291,021,565 in the USA alone, with nearly equal international numbers), and those who see the entertainment value of the film that is in dire need of editing at least 45 minutes of extraneous repetitive CGI effects to make it tolerable. The cast is very fine – hunky Henry Cavill is a rather demure Superman and that is in his favor, Amy Adams makes Lois Lane credible, Michael Shannon is ominous as the evil General Zod, and then there are the home-baked goodness of Diane Lane and Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe and Amtje Traue as the variable parents (Krypton genes, Kansas adoption). Nods also go to Christopher Meloni, Ayelet Zurer, Harry Lennix, Richard Schiff, and Laurence Fishburne for trying to take all this seriously.Plot (not really adapted from the original comic books): A child, sent to Earth from a dying planet, is adopted by a couple in rural Kansas. As a young boy he learns that he has extraordinary powers and is not of this Earth. As a young man, he journeys to discover where he came from and what he was sent here to do. But the hero in him must emerge if he is to save the world from annihilation and become the symbol of hope for all mankind. Sounds like a good story through the sci-fi telescope. The problem is the heavy handed emphasis on the monsters and space ships and tunnels and gore of Krypton and the mess made not only in Smallville, Kansas but in the major cities by the invading Krypton dudes. Makes you wonder when all the CGI minds behind it will tire of the noise and fire and space sailing of Superman. Enough already. Grady Harp",5,0,3,14 November 2013
The Revenant," 'On est tous des sauvages' ('We are all savages')
","Oscar winner for best actor (Leonardo DiCaprio), best director (Alejandro G. Iñárritu, and best cinematography (Emmanual Lubezki), THE REVENANT is an epic production and in truth Nature is the leading character. The film is a visual spectacle, the themes of survival and for love between a father and son are moving, but this is a long song and requires endurance on the part of the viewer for sitting through 156 minutes of repetitious gore and raw natural elements. The film is based in part on a novel by Michael Punke, and the screenplay is by Mark L Smith and Alejandro G. Iñárritu.The film may be excessively long but the story can be quickly summarized: While exploring the uncharted wilderness in 1823, legendary frontiersman Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) sustains injuries from a brutal bear attack. When his hunting team leaves him for dead, Glass must utilize his survival skills to find a way back home to his beloved family (his son Hawk - Forrest Goodluck – dies on the same trip). Grief-stricken and fueled by vengeance, Glass treks through the wintry terrain to track down John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), the former confidant who betrayed and abandoned him.The hunting troops are well portrayed by Tom Hardy (very difficult to understand his mumbling accent), Domhnall Gleeson. Will Pouster (a very talented young actor), Forrest Goodluck et al. But the overwhelming power of the film is the depiction of man in Nature and the concept of survival against all odds. For that aspect alone the film is well worth seeing.",9,1,2,6 March 2016
Bridge of Spies," 'It doesn't matter what others think. You know what you did.'
","The setting for this based on a true story film is the 10950s – that tense period when in America children were put through classroom drills in case of an expected (or rather, feared) nuclear attack form Russia. Most people had bomb shelters stocked with supplies for the propaganda response that the Cold War ruled everyone's thinking. Remember those days? If not then this film will most assuredly force you to stare at the anxiety that ruled the politics and the military and the populace during that awful time.Steven Spielberg directs a script created by the Coen Brothers and Matt Charman and has engaged a splendid cast that offers many insights into the thinking of that period. The story (for those who are shaky on facts and dates) is as follows: 'In the cold war, an insurance lawyer, James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), who hasn't practiced criminal law since he was a prosecutor at the Nuremburg trials after World War II, is recruited by the CIA and involved in an intense negotiation mission to release and exchange a CIA U-2 spy-plane pilot, Francis G. Powers (Austin Stowell) who was arrested alive after his plane was shot down by the Soviet Union during a mission- with a KGB intelligence officer, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) who was arrested for espionage in the US. The strong anti- Communist mood at the time makes him a target from those (the general populace) who think Abel should just be executed. Abel is convicted but Donovan convinces the judge to sentence him to prison, rather than execute him, as they may at some point in the future want to swap him for an American spy the Soviets might have in custody. And of course Donovan's theory works, emphasizing the humanity that can resist fear of the unknown in the time of Cold War. The cast is uniformly excellent with special kudos to Alan Alda, Sebastian Koch, Amy Ryan and of course Hanks and Rylance. Superb script, well re-enactment of an ugly part of our history, and some fine nuances about faith in the democratic system make this one of the finest films of the year.",10,1,3,14 February 2016
American Psycho," 'Darkness very darkness is sectional' - Gertrude Stein
","American PSYCHO, 12 years after its release as a film, retains its power as a very dark human comedy. Based on the popular Bret Easton Ellis novel and adapted for the screen by Guinevere Turner and director Mary Harron it has the effect on the surface of being a brutally disgusting horror story but if the viewer stops there the point of the tale is missed. This is a parody on human behavior pushed to extremes and one of the main reason if works so immensely well is the fine performance by Christian Bale as the title character.Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is an obsessive compulsive, style driven, ego maniacal successful wealthy Wall Street figure, working for this father's company. The film wisely dwells on the manner in which Patrick starts every day - doing abdominal crunches and weight lifting (the resulting boy Bale built is stunning eye candy!), every lotion and potion he puts on his face to keep his youthful appearance, dressing in the most expensive clothes and concentrating on reservations in the most expensive and exclusive restaurants for lunches and dinners with his associates (Justin Theroux, Josh Lucas, Bill Sage). Critical of even the appearance of the outfits and shoes of his secretary (Chloë Sevigny) and polished like a gleaming Tiffany diamond, he is as shallow as those around him in the 'look at me' 1980s. He is dating a would-be fiancée (Reese Witherspoon) but pays little attention to her. Instead, at night Patrick murders people: he picks up hookers, kills them and mutilates them, hiding them in plastic bags like so much discarded clothing. He also murders street people for no reason and then begins a killing spree that reveals how completely psychotic he is, pretending to be a person he has already killed (Josh Lucas). The only law enforcement person on the scene (Willem Dafoe) but so little that he can be overlooked.American PSYCHO is a film that packs a wallop and Christian Bale gives a bravura performance. It is becoming a cult classic and that designator is well deserved. Grady Harp",10,2,3,19 May 2012
Little Miss Sunshine," 'Being a Winner is only a state of mind'
","and being a winner of a film based on so many potentially disastrous bits of black comedy works exceedingly well! As opposed to some of the movies of the recent past (Borat, American Pie, Waiting, the National Lampoon endless series, etc) LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE starts with a smart script by Michael Arndt that addresses many of the highly dysfunctional family elements present in today's society and allows us to hold a few mirrors up to our own vaguely warped view of good and bad, right and wrong, ambition and self destructive delusion and makes us laugh - at times embarrassed, at times just having fun! Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris direct this odd little story of a family in Albuquerque, NM, a family comprised of a grandfather (Alan Arkin) whose 'elderly status' allows him to speak inappropriately grossly and frankly to his grandchildren while snorting coke in the bathroom; a father (Greg Kinnear, who just gets better and better) with a motivational program scheme that is melting toward failure; a mother (the extraordinary Toni Collette) who attempts to cope with her role as the matriarch of this weird group; the mother's brother (Steve Carell), a gay Proustian scholar who has just lost his job over an affair with a grad student and has survived an unsuccessful suicide attempt; a space-cadet teenage son (Paul Dano) who is in a vow of silence as he pursues Nietzsche and extracting promises for his future from his intimidated parents; and last, but most important, a chubby little sister Olive (Abigail Breslin) who dotes on Miss America pageant reruns on TV and longs to tryout for the Little Miss Sunshine beauty/talent show for little girls in Southern California.The bulk of the film is a road trip which confines this very strange family in an RUV headed for the only bit of positive hope for change in Olive's ploy to become Little Miss Sunshine. Along the trip we get to know these oddballs personally and in the end the results of the family effort competition seem almost secondary to the fun of getting there. Each of the performers is at peak form in acting and the direction and pacing would be difficult to improve. The film accomplishes what comedy sets as a goal: it entertains us while allowing us to take a second look at our own foibles, and that makes for a fun and healthy outing. Highly recommended.

Knowing," 'Ezekiel saw the wheel - way up in the middle of the air.'
","KNOWING will find an audience, whether that audience is the science fiction aficionados, the spiritualists, those waiting for 2012 ideas, or those who enjoy thrillers. It is a mixed bag - based on a story by Ryne Douglas Pearson who adapted it for the screen with Juliet Snowden and Stiles White - that depends heavily on the audience's perception of Nicholas Cage: after a string of films that cast him as a mad man it is nice to see him in a humanistic role. Alex Proyas directs. 50 years ago a school closed and the new school that opened to replace it called for a ceremony that included the burying of a time capsule full of children's drawings about what they felt the future would hold in 50 years. At the ceremony the enveloped drawings are dispersed among the class and Caleb Koestler (Chandler Canterbury) opens an envelope that is simply a page of numbers: Caleb begins to hear voices, but is reassured by his widowed astrophysicist father John Koestler (Nicholas Cage) that it is probably due to Caleb's hearing aide. But as John examines the list of numbers with his fellow associate Ben (Phil Mendelsohn) he begins to discover that the numbers are not random but are instead dates of horrible accidents or events followed by the number of lives lost in that event: the obvious number sequence is 9/11. John follows events that are predicted and finally discovers that an event listed as the last number set is predicting the end of the world. The little girl who made the original list lived a strange life and in her lineage is an adult (Rose Byrne) who has a daughter Abby (Laura Robinson) who is Caleb's best friend and also hears the voices Caleb hears. Together the two families explore the ramifications of the numbers and the film speedily progresses to a fantasy ending. The story itself is interesting and the acting is fine - up to the point that the inevitable CGI effects take over. Then it becomes a matter of taste as to whether the viewer needs to have details splashed all over the screen or merely keep the story in the imagination of the viewers' minds. As Hollywood so often forgets, sometimes less is more, and in this case what could have been a rather tender film becomes another loud apocalyptic disaster sequence.

Hugo," 'Come away and dream with me'
","HUGO is a strange film. It purports to be for children despite the fact that the screenplay written by Josh Logan based of the book 'The Invention of Hugo Cabret' by Brian Selznick has more references to words and people and events that children would not relate to on the same level as adults. It is a spectacle in the order of director Martin Scorsese with some of the most beautiful contraptions and mechanical wonders ever filmed. It seems in many ways to be an homage to the history of filmmaking in the manner in which the rather disjointed story is presented. Likely it comes across better in 3D than on the small flat screen. Not that the film is without special merits: there are many moments of impressive philosophical values, child/parent relationships, and a few comedic turns. The cast is solid if somewhat underused in this visual mechanical Parisian extravaganza spectacle, but it well worth watching as pure entertainment - and that is really OK!The story is well known: Hugo (Asa Butterflied) is a lad whose inventor father (Jude Law) salvaged a broken automaton from a museum to fix it but dies before accomplishing that: his Uncle Claude (Ray Winstone), a drunk, is let in charge of the lad. Hugo is soon left alone in the bizarre train station in Paris where he tends to the multiple clocks, misses his beloved father, and fends for himself by shoplifting food and a few 'parts'. He is caught by a rather glum Georges Méliès (Ben Kingsley) who runs a toy store while bemoaning his current lack of the thrill of living, despite the nurturing he receives from his wife (Helen McCrory) and his adopted daughter Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz) who longs for adventures. In time Hugo and Isabelle become fast friends and discover the secrets held by Georges and it is through their efforts that joy and the dreams of the aged filmmaker are resurrected.There are some sidebars - an injured WW I veteran who serves as Station Inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) who dreams of the attention of the flower lady Lisette (Emily Mortimer), Madame Emile (Frances de la Tour) who sips coffee while tending her dog and attracting the attention of the hefty Monsieur Frick (Richard Griffiths), cinema devotee and historian Rene Tabard (Michael Stuhlbarg) who opens the doors to the mysteries that have collected during the story), and the odd Rene Tabard (Christopher Lee) who part is questionable.The cast is strong - especially the children - and the special effects are very lovely to watch. The film takes us to the land of fantasy and it is worthwhile trip. Though the film seems to be impressed with itself and the revelation of the history of cinema, it offers many pleasures. Not sure it is a DVD to buy, though. Grady Harp",7,3,5,29 February 2012
Warrior," Warrior: A Powerful Film About Family
","WARRIOR is one of the finest films of the year - and that is a statement coming from one who does not like violent films. The film does deal with UFC fighting, a mania incomprehensible to most), but it is more an extraordinary story about the magnetism of family. Writer Gavin O'Connor (with Anthony Tambakis and Cliff Dorfman) also directs this intense film and his sensitivity in bringing out brilliant performances from everyone in his cast is simply amazing. This is a monumental achievement worthy of Academy Award consideration.Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) has returned from a tour with the USMC in Iraq where he ran away after saving his fellow marines in a near fatal situation, witnessed the death of his closest buddy Manny, and went AWOL from the stress: he returned to the US to make sure Manny's family was cared for. An ex fighter, Tommy drinks and does drugs and finally returns to his father Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte) to gain new training as a fighter. The Conlon family history is tragic - the mother took Tommy away from Pittsburgh hoping her older son Brendan (Joel Edgerton) would follow - escaping the spiraling alcoholism of the father. Tommy moved with his mother who subsequently dies: Brendon stayed with his father and the family ties seem to have been forever broken. When Tommy returns Paddy is 1000 days sober, but instead of love for this father Tommy loathes him and only wants his expertise as a trainer. Paddy consents and the two begin training at Paddy's old friend Colt Boyd's (Maximiliano Hernández) Gym. In Philadelphia Brendan is a high school Physics teacher and has married Tess (Jennifer Morrison) and they have two little girls, one of whom has renal damage that has been so costly that both parents must each hold down two jobs to survive. Brendan happens upon a Mixed Martial Arts fight (he spends his nights as a bouncer in a club making very little money) and decides that the money he can gain through fighting may save his home from going into foreclosure): he fights, and wins $200. When he shows up at school to teach he is bruised and cut and is suspended without pay for disgracing the school (the principal - Kevin Dunn - hates to lose his finest teacher). With a dim financial outlook Tess hesitantly agrees for Brendan to re-enter fighting for money and Brendan hires his old friend Frank Campagna (Frank Grillo) to train him.There is a much publicized tournament for the championship in Mixed Martial Arts in Atlantic city and through many strange coincidences the two brothers end up in the final fight - fighting each other. The end is brilliant in its understatement, not stooping to resolve all family problems, but at the same time having the courage to show how powerful is the love of two brothers no matter how different their lives. Both Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton are brilliant as the brothers and Nick Nolte gives the performance of his career. Every character created by this extraordinary cast is pitch perfect. For this viewer this is one of the most moving films that has been released in a very long time. Grady Harp",10,2,5,24 December 2011
Disturbia," High Tech Voyeurism Enhances a Good Thriller
","DISTURBIA is a fine little thriller of a movie. Though some viewers are commenting that it is merely a takeoff on REAR WINDOW and finding it not up to that caliber - and if that bothers potential viewers then be advised, for this viewer it is more a film that addresses our progressive invasion of privacy by high tech instruments, and as such the film makes an important statement. Writers Christopher Landon and Carl Ellsworth have produced a solid script that manages to capture teenage angst and view of the world and with director D.J. Caruso the story is propelled along with a hold-your-breath pace that makes for a very entertaining and scary movie! Kale (a very fine Shia LaBeouf) had a great relationship with his father (Matt Craven), but in a hideous auto accident Kale witnesses the death of his father, an event that disturbs him so greatly even a year later that he misbehaves in school and eventually is put under house arrest wearing an alarm bracelet on his ankle. Kale's mother (Carrie-Anne Moss) tries to cope with the 'incarcerated' Kale, but tires of his aimless wasting of time and energy. Out of boredom Kale stares out his windows with binoculars, observing the neighbors, not the least of which is an attractive young Ashley (Sarah Roemer). Kale's best friend Ronnie (a very promising Aaron Yoo) is Kale's only contact with the outside world and when the two boys spy on Ashley in her swimming pool, they together find more sophisticated means of voyeurism. And, once Ashley visits Kale the three join in spying on a strange neighbor Mr. Turner (David Morse), finding him similar to a media-described serial killer. From there the plot thickens and quickens as the threesome made dangerous discoveries and end up in an investigation of scary proportions.The final fifteen minutes of the film are a bit over-the-top, but the rest of the movie is so well done that the ending can be forgiven. There are some fine cameo roles by Viola Davis as the detective in charge of Kale's house arrest, Jose Pablo Cantillo as officer who is stuck with responding to Kale's multiple infringements of his house arrest, among others. Shia LaBeouf is young in his craft but demonstrates a fine screen presence and a lot of polish: he carries the movie well. This is not a major film (though it did very well at the box office!), but is a surefire entertainment! Grady Harp",8,2,4,9 August 2007
Silver Linings Playbook," 'The world will break your heart ten ways to Sunday. That's guaranteed.'
","Something there is about a movie that while in the theaters everybody loves and then the Oscars come 'round and awards pour in, you you're left with the thought 'how can two actors known for such films as potty mouth Hangover I – III and credibility challenging violence such as Hunger Games make a film worth all the hullabaloo?' Well, SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is the enormously successful answer. Based on the novel by the same name by Matthew Quick and freely adapted for the screen by writer/director David O. Russell, this stage brings an unusually fine opportunity to reveal the rather phenomenal talents of Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence while also demonstrating the brilliance of ensemble productions.The story briefly outlined is as follows: Against medical advice and without the knowledge of her husband Pat Solatano Sr. (Robert DeNIro), caring Dolores Solatano (Jacki Weaver) discharges her adult son, Pat Solatano Jr. (Bradley Cooper), from a Maryland mental hospital after his minimum eight month court ordered stint. The condition of the release includes Pat Jr. moving back in with his parents in their Philadelphia home. Although Pat Jr.'s institutionalization was due to his beating up the lover of his wife Nikki, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Nikki has since left him and has received a restraining order against him. Although he is on medication (which he doesn't take because of the way it makes him feel) and has mandatory therapy sessions with Dr. Patel (Anupam Kher), Pat Jr. feels like he can manage on the outside solely by healthy living and looking for the 'silver linings' in his life. His goals are to get his old job back as a substitute teacher, but more importantly reunite with Nikki. He finds there are certain instances where he doesn't cope well, however no less so than some others who have never been institutionalized, such as his Philadelphia Eagles obsessed OCD father who has resorted to being a bookie to earn a living, his best friend Ronnie (John Ortiz) who quietly seethes over the control wielded by his wife Veronica (Julia Stiles), and Veronica's widowed sister, Tiffany Maxwell 9Jennifer Lawrence), a recovering sex addict. In their fragile mental states, Pat Jr. and Tiffany embark on a love/hate friendship based primarily on what help the other can provide in achieving their individual goals. But they may reevaluate their goals as their relationship progresses.The entire cast is superb – including Chris Tucker as a mentally challenged friend Jake – and the joy of the film is that even while dealing with the controversial subject of bipolar disorder, the story and the actors portraying the characters (each bruised in a particular way) always seems real and gains our empathy. But it is the glow of Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence walking the very thin line of social adjustment with the grace of the finest of actors that makes this film so special. Highly Recommended.

The White Ribbon," Ignorance poses as Innocence: The White Ribbon
","In a small village in Northern Germany in 1916 a series of bizarre and horrid things happen. There is no explanation for these events, only mute rumors and musings in a town confined by strict Protestant rules of judgment and behavior. The town Doctor on horseback is tripped by a trap wire hidden on a path, is injured, and must leave town for a hospital treatment for a while: upon return we learn that the town doctor is anything but kind in his verbal and physical abuse of his office manager/mistress who may be the mother of 'his child' - a mentally challenged boy cared for the mother/mistress who also cares for his naive other children by his deceased wife. A young boy, the son of the town Baron, is found in the woods, bound and beaten, and the town fails to produce information as to the brutality. A woman falls through a dangerous flooring and dies, her husband commits suicide, the mentally challenged boy is severely tortured, the Baron's cabbage farm is destroyed, the children of the large family of the town pastor are punished for varying reasons (each offending child must wear a 'white ribbon of innocence' to remind themselves to sin no more - the young boy's sin is physical self satisfaction), a building on the Baron's estate is burned, etc. Oddly since there are no identified culprits, the town focuses on the children as the possible perpetrators of the violence - since they are ignorant until they receive Confirmation in the church - a ritual supposed to bring the enlightenment of adulthood to those confirmed! There are many stories in this magnificent film by the gifted Michael Haneke and none of them is fully resolved by the end of the film. It is the tenor of the city that seems to breed ill winds that in turn suggests that the town's inhabitants - curious and possibly dangerous children and adults with both overt and subliminal evil in their characters - are setting the scene for a country that could produce the evil demonstrated by the events of July 1917 which opened World War II. Haneke captures all of this terror and submerged hate and fear and abuse and character dysfunction in startling black and white photography. The townspeople are all fairly similar in appearance, made more so by the black and white imagery, and the only person in the town that has some semblance of humanity is the young schoolteacher (even in his discovery of courtship) that seems to make the statement that it is only through education that change can occur. Haneke has the courage and sensitivity to leave the audience guessing about the etiologies of all the evils we have witnessed and simply ends his film in slow fadeout as WW I ensues. It is a heart-stopping film, brilliantly directed and acted and photographed and accompanied by a musical score that emphasizes choral hymns sung by children. This is magnificent film-making!

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Brilliant Cinema From All Concerned
","Despite any reservations a viewer might have about a prompt English version re-make of a very successful Swedish film still popular in this country - the first novel in author Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy, namely GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO - this version of Larsson's story is immensely successful. Much of that is due to the tightly woven screenplay by Steven Zaillian and the extraordinary direction by one of our most gifted directors, David Fincher (Fight Club, The Social Network, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Seven, etc). But also the gifts of the musical composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (with a bit of help from a very well placed Morten Lauridson's 'Lux Aeterna') and the bitingly vivid cinematography of Jeff Cronenweth. Add to that one of the finest collection of actors ever to collaborate on a project and the result is a film that is so engrossing that its very long length doesn't seem long enough!Everyone knows the story by now: disgraced journalist, Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), escapes to an island in Sweden at the request of Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) to investigate the 40 year absence of his niece Harriet. The Vanger family is as dysfunctional and bitterly cruel an ensemble as could be imagined and everyone on the island wants Mikael to leave. The case fascinates Mikael and he gains access to the services of an associate, the very bizarre and brilliant pierced, tattooed, punk computer hacker named Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara). As they work together in the investigation, Blomkvist and Salander uncover immense corruption beyond anything they have ever imagined. There are indelible characters along the way: the disgustingly sadistic Nils Bjurman (a brilliant role for Yorick van Wageningen) who mistakenly sexually abuses Lisbeth who in turn has her own manner of revenge), the wily Martin Vanger (Stellan Skarsgård), a brief but impressive Dragan Armansky (Goran Visnjic), Anita Vanger (Joely Richardson), Inspector Morelli (Donald Sumpter) etc etc etc. Every role is cast so carefully that there is never a missed beat in this huge ensemble.For those who love the Swedish version of GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO this English version will surely satisfy. They are different but for this viewer the English version is far more memorable. There is considerable frank sexual activity, torture, animal abuse, and there are some gruesome scenes: they add and must be there. Kudos to all concerned. And yes, Rooney Mara really is that fine!

The 40-Year-Old Virgin," An Adult Version of the Teeny Flicks
","Raucous humor, outrageous interpersonal situations, potty mouth, and over the top jokes have long been the successful turf of countless summer movies aimed at the teen crowd, films such as the endless American Pie series, Dumb and Dumberer, There's Something About Mary, etc. Now there is a new trend aimed at the thirty to forty something audiences that mimics the earlier teen subjects. THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN falls into this category along with WEDDING CRASHERS et al, but there is a difference with this one: empathy.The story is slight: an uptight, loner, action heroes collecting, non-driving bicycle-riding punctual worker in a boring firm is now forty years old and is still a virgin - a fact that bothers him deeply but his virginity has developed into a phobia for close encounters of the female kind. His work partners discover his secret over poker and pledge to resolve the problem by getting him laid, in some of the most negative possible of suggestions. After endless trials to resolve his sexual vacuum he meets a forty something grandmother and in a mutually agreed pact they decide to date without sex for 20 dates before they allow physical activity to occur. In the process the friends at work (including the seductive female manager) learn a thing or two about their own life styles and the film ends in a bizarre musical number that pushes it over the top while tapping at the heart.Steve Carell co-wrote the script (with Director Judd Apatow) and it shows. His 'Andy' may be a nerd but his adaptation to his problematic existence is sweet and charismatic. Likewise, his office entourage (Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen, Romany Jay, Jane Lynch) gives us three-dimensional characters each of which shows some personal growth of their own during their experiments for Andy. The real glow of the film is due to the presence of Catherine Keener as the 'grandmother' for whom Andy falls. Whenever she is on the screen lights flash and reality sets in. The real problem for this viewer is that the slapstick portion of the film simply goes on too long. Apatow needs to rethink comedy in a way that reminds him that brevity is better: two hours is way too long for this very short story. Though it has redeeming graces, this is a film for a audience tolerant of the silly and the gross who is willing to wade through the first three-fourths of the film to catch the quietly tender social comment the film contains.

The Men Who Stare at Goats," Wildly Funny Movie - with a dollop of philosophy
","THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS probably will always maintain a rather small audience. The film is strange on every level, is filled with some fairly outrageous ideas, has more punch lines than a standup comedian, and is populated by a strong cast of characters who seem to be thoroughly enjoying the madness of the story. It is a shifting tale started by a lovesick reporter (Ewan McGregor) who discovers a military secret concerning the Jedi Warriors - a post Vietnam group developed by on Bill Django (Jeff Bridges), a left over hippie who developed a line of psychic spies who could read minds and control events just by thinking. Two major members of the Jed Warriors were Lyn Cassady (George Clooney) and Larry Hooper (Kevin Spacey) - the Yin and Yang/dark and light sides of the movement. Spill all of this into Iraq and a series of events that shows how absurd humans behave in war time and the fun never stops. It is nutty, at times confusing in the manner in which the story is laid out, but it is always entertaining - if you like a touch of the bizarre superimposed on what was apparently a real story!

Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Making the Impossible Possible
","Director/story/ screenplay writer Christopher McQuarrie keeps the fast action, droll humor, and level of excitement in this new version of Mission Impossible and to this viewer's experience it works very well indeed.CIA chief Hunley (Alec Baldwin) convinces a Senate committee to disband the IMF (Impossible Mission Force), of which Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is a key member. Hunley argues that the IMF is too reckless. Now on his own, Hunt goes after a shadowy and deadly rogue organization called the Syndicate. Ethan and team (Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, and Ving Rhames) take on their most impossible mission yet, eradicating the Syndicate - an International rogue organization as highly skilled as they are, committed to destroying the IMF. Key figures are Ilsa Faust (a dazzling Rebecca Ferguson), Lane (Sean Harris), and Atlee (Simon McBurney) – with a brief but well offered appearance as Prime Minister of England Tom Hollander.Strong cast (Cruise still has what the role takes), excellent special effects, smart script, lush color photography and even some time allowed to listen to a performance of Turandot at the Vienna Stadtsoper – all add up to an enjoyable escape outing.",9,0,1,28 December 2015
Jarhead," Significance? JARHEAD depicts the Bizarre DESERT STORM War
","Were intentions graded instead of product, then JARHEAD would be given 4 stars rather than 3, merely because it is one of the few films (so far) that shows the particular idiosyncrasies of that first Bush war, the DESERT SHIELD transforming into DESERT STORM. We have many films that document the mindset of the soldiers from the Civil War through the two World Wars, to Korean War to Vietnam War and each is different. JARHEAD is as much about the changes that have occurred in the American military with the advent of computerized warfare and sophisticated war machines and weapons as it is about the Greed for Oil Dominance that prompted the US Kuwaiti involvement. And for that this film is important and will remain so until something better comes along.The story is rather minimal and as narrated by the author of the novel on which it is based, Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal), it takes a while to become airborne. Swoff is a disillusioned kid who can't figure out how to make life meaningful so he opts for the USMC as a staging zone in his growth. What he discovers is the usual boot camp mentality and training, encountering other men who have both similar and different reasons for joining the Corps: Troy (Peter Saarsgard) has dark issues that remain with him throughout the story; Kruger (Lucas Black) opted for the Corps instead of prison; Cortez (Jacob Vargas) needed money to support his pregnant wife; Cuban immigrant Escobar (Laz Alonso) sincerely is a grateful patriot, etc. Along the way the boys encounter the stereotype DI (Scott MacDonald), the Staff Sergeant (Jamie Fox) and the company commander Lt Col Kazinski (Chris Cooper) as well as the usual variety of testosterone provoked young kids successfully brainwashed to be 'fighting men'.The bulk of the story after boot camp is the boredom of going to war in the Kuwaiti desert, having nothing at all to do except play dumb games and wait and hydrate, until at last the Staff Sergeant gleefully announces Saddam Hussein is shooting and they are off to actually do what they were trained to do - Fight! But even that is thwarted as they wade through a miserable existence of seeing sky-darkened oil well fires, constant oil raining from the burning oil money holes, losing buddies to friendly fire and mistaken attacks by their own air support. And just at the point when this company of trained snipers (especially Swoff and Troy) gets the chance to kill, the 'war' is over and they go home. And in Swofford's narrative comments he notes how those men will never be allowed to leave the desert experience behind. 'Wars are different, yet wars are the same'.Jake Gyllenhaal, buffed and shaved headed, gives us everything Swoff represents - as far as the meager script and misguided direction by Sam Mendes allow. He is a fine actor and his range of emotions is what holds the film together. The remainder of the cast likewise does their best to make their shadowy character outlines from the screenplay by William Broyles Jr. as close to three-dimensional as the lines allow. Yes, the film is about a new kind of soldier, one less driven by patriotism and more informed about the commercial greed that drives these fiascoes, and Mendes does allow us to see that. But deeper character development and motivation could have made this a more powerful antiwar statement than a visual excursion of life under the sun of the foreign desert skies.

The Machinist," A Dark and Somber Maze of Altered Reality
","THE MACHINIST is a mesmerizing film, a journey through the interstices of a mind deprived of sleep, of nourishment, and a mind that struggles to untangle the chaos of a past of guilt and terror. And the journey is terrifying.When the film opens we meet Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale) or at least the emaciated, tortured remains of a man who hasn't slept for a year. We don't know why this worker in a machine factory is in such condition: the story unwinds slowly so that by the end we accompany Reznik in his shock to his moment of discovery. It is the getting there that is the tough beauty of this amazingly rich film as written by Scott Kosar and directed by Brad Anderson.The setting is always dark as though the state of mind is a nightmare. Reznik's meager existence is challenged when he is involved in an industrial accident in which a fellow worker Miller (Michael Ironside) loses an arm. Shocked by the accident (for which Reznik feels responsible) the various few people in his life seem supportive: a hooker named Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a waitress in an airport all night diner Marie (Aitana Sánchez-Gijón), and an ambiguous bald man Ivan (John Sharian) who appears to Reznik in strange ways.Reznik's mind slowly disintegrates into paranoid delusions, the only way he can hold his life together is by post-its reminding him first of his documented progressive weight loss, then of his needs, then of his secret mystery. To say more would be a great disservice to the extraordinary plot.Christian Bale delivers one of the most committed performances on film. He not only physically inhabits Reznik with his skeletal appearance, he also mentally nurtures all the nuances of fear, pain, pleasure and madness that build as his character's reason for a year of insomnia is revealed at the very end. We stand in suspense with him and his fall is as powerful as any Dante ever devised. The entire cast is superb but special kudos go to Jennifer Jason Leigh who finally has a role that allows her to demonstrate the spectrum of skill she possesses as an actress. Not an easy film, this, but a very important one. Highly recommended - but not to see alone! Grady Harp",10,74,94,8 June 2005
The Intouchables," 'Art is the only trace we leave behind.'
","Films such as THE INTOUCHABLES come around far too seldom and when they do the public should somehow be advised that here is a cup of magic that could alter the manner in which we relate to each other and to the world tainted by schisms of societal errors. Written and directed by Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano the film was inspired by the true story of Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and his caregiver Abdel Sellou, discovered by the directors in 'A la vie, à la mort', a documentary film. Of note, the book version of the film's story was written and released after the film enjoyed great success. Written by Abdel Sellou the book 'You Saved My Life' tells the extraordinary true story of the charming Algerian con-man' friendship with a disabled French aristocrat. Sellou's book shows the real man behind Sellou/Driss's smiling face. The book takes us from his childhood spent stealing candy from the local grocery store, to his career as a pickpocket and scam artist, to his unexpected employment as a companion for a quadriplegic. Sellou has never before divulged the details of his past. In many interviews and documentaries, he has evaded or shrugged off the question of his childhood and his stay in prison, until now. He tells his story with a stunning amount of talent, with humor, style, and--though he denies that he has any--humility. Abdel Sellou now lives in Algeria with his wife and three children, where he runs a chicken farm. He remains close to Philippe Pozzo di Borgo, who lives in Morocco with his second wife and two children.The cinematic version of this relationship is an irreverent, uplifting comedy about friendship, trust and human possibility. After he becomes a quadriplegic from a paragliding accident the aristocratic intellectual Parisian millionaire Philippe (François Cluzet) is interviewing candidates for the position of his caretaker with his secretary Magalie (Audrey Fleurot). Out of the blue, the rude ex-con African Driss (Omar Sy) cuts the line of candidates and brings a document from the Social Security and asks to Philippe to sign it to prove that he is seeking a job position to receive his unemployment insurance. Philippe, impressed that Driss is the only candidate who does not look at him with pity, challenges Driss and offers a period of adaptation of one week to him to gain experience helping him. Then Driss would decide whether he would like to stay with him or not. Driss accepts the bet and moves to the mansion, changing the boring life of Philippe and his employees, especially under the watchful and compassionate eye of the head of the house staff Yvonne (Anne Le Ny). As Driss reluctantly learns to move, feed, and clean Philippe, the two men discover a blunt but vital humor that not only bridges the cultural and class divide between them, but gives Philippe a renewed joy in life - and a chance to turn his passionate epistolary relationship with one Eleanore whom he has never seen into a chance at a second go at life.The only aspect of this film that is somewhat distracting is that the film opens with a car adventure involving both Philippe and Dris which is terrific film making and very funny but does make the film's beginning (after the credits) seem less surprising. A very minor point, especially when the film ends with the same activity but this time drives it to an incredibly touching completion. Highly recommended on every level: both François Cluzet and Omar Sy are brilliant! Grady Harp",10,2,3,7 March 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," 'Secrets have a cost. They're not free. Not now, not ever.'
","Why we needed another Spiderman series after the recent (2002/2007) Tobey McGuire run is probably the same reason we keep getting remakes of foreign films (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, etc): they make money. And it looks like the public will never tire of Marvel Comic Book stories, so might as well settle in and give them a try. It is an evening's entertainment approaching 3 hours of visual shenanigans that are pretty entertaining.There are some differences between this Spiderman and the last - aside from cast: the stories are different although they both claim to show the origin of this magic transformation of a lonely confused young man trying to figure out who he is until he discovers some super secrets and the power to change into a humanoid spider-gifted hero. It all starts out well enough - Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is shy and unable to relate to about everyone except his aunt and uncle (Sally Field and Martin Sheen do a fine job here). He fails at a run-in with the high school bully Flash (a hunky and promising Chris Zylka), is noticed by the perky Gwen (Emma Stone) who is involved in Peter's introduction to scientist Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) who is an old friend of Peter's strangely disappeared father (Campbell Scott) and mother (Embeth Davidtz). Peter is smart, discovers a formula in his father's briefcase, and ultimately is able to transform himself into Spiderman - his nemesis being The Lizard who is actually Dr. Connors taking a potent experimental solution. After a lot of flying around on buildings and throwing spider web tendrils at everything including The Lizard, Peter is hunted as a threat until Gwen's policeman father (Denis Leary) eventually bonds with the insecure Peter in a life saving situation. Then we are given footage of what is up for the sequel...The human (read 'credible') parts work the best - Garfield and Stone make a fine pair and Sheen and Field give fine cameos. Once the transformation takes place the film becomes a lesson in special effects and that is fun enough to watch. It just goes on far too long...and there is more to come. Makes you wonder when the next cycle of Spiderman will come along. Grady Harp",6,3,6,27 November 2012
Dallas Buyers Club," 'I've been looking for you, lone star.'
","In perhaps one of the most emotionally charged, brave, brilliantly acted films of the year DALLAS BUYERS CLUB opens door to emotions and facts and history that to this day remain tightly closed - a film about the AIDS plague. Based on a true story and written with sensitivity by Craig Borden and Melisa Wallack and directed with equal verve and insight by Jean-Marc Vallée (The Young Victoria, C.R.A.Z.Y.), this is a film that lingers in the mind long after the closing credits. It deserves to be seen by everyone, not only for the incredibly fine performances by Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto, but because of the questions it raises about the interplay of disease, drug companies and current governmentally controlled medical practice guidelines.Texan Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) is an electrician, a rodeo cowboy, a heavy drinker and cocaine abuser, and a woman chaser for casual sex. In 1985, Ron is blindsided by being diagnosed as H.I.V. -positive and given 30 days to live. Yet he will not, and does not, accept a death sentence. His crash course of research reveals a lack of approved treatments and medications in the U.S. (especially the prolonged investigation of AZT), so Ron crosses the border into Mexico where he discovers Dr. Vass (Griffin Dunne), a discredited American physician with his own battery of drugs to fight AIDS. Woodroof learns about alternative treatments and begins smuggling them into the U.S., challenging the medical and scientific community including his concerned physician, Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner). A true homophobe, Ron finds an unlikely ally in fellow AIDS patient Rayon (Jared Leto), a transsexual who shares Ron's lust for life. Rayon also shares Ron's entrepreneurial spirit: seeking to avoid government sanctions against selling non-approved medicines and supplements, they establish a buyers club, where H.I.V.-positive people pay monthly dues for access to the newly acquired supplies. Ron's pioneering underground collective beats loud and strong. With a growing community of friends and clients, Ron fights for dignity, education, and acceptance. In the years following his diagnosis, the embattled Lone Star loner lives life to the fullest like never before.In addition to the brilliant performances by McConaughey and Leto, there far fine cameos by Jennifer Garner, Denis O'Hare, Steve Zahn, Dallas Roberts, Donna Duplantier and Griffin Dunne. This is a stunning cinematic achievement.",10,2,3,5 February 2014
Now You See Me," 'What is magic? Focused deception. But deception meant to entertain.'
","This movie is magic. It is simply fantastic entertainment that keeps the viewer glue to the screen trying to figure out the impossible things that are happening to a superlative groups of actors playing well written roles (written by Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin and Edward Ricourt) and directed with aplomb by Louis Leterrier (Clash of the Titans, The Incredible Hulk, Transporter 2, Unleashed, and the soon to be made Now You See Me 2!) whose imagery and imagination is endless.The story is simple but inordinately complex in the way it is shared. Four magicians each answer a mysterious summons to an obscure address with secrets inside. A year later, they are the Four Horseman (Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, and Dave Franco), big time stage illusionists who climax their sold out Las Vegas show with a bank apparently robbed for real. This puts agents Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) of the FBI and Alma Vargas (Mélanie Laurent) of Interpol on the case to find out how they did it. However, this mystery proves difficult to solve even with the insights of the professional illusion exposer, Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman). What follows is a bizarre investigation where nothing is what it seems with illusions, dark secrets and hidden agendas galore as all involved are reminded of a great truth in this puzzle: the closer you look, the less you see. Add to this rather amazing cast the talents of Michael Caine, Michael Kelly, Common, David Warshofsky, José Garcia, and Elias Koteas and the talents of Brian Tyler, musical score and the cinematography by Mitchell Amundsen and Larry Fong and this film becomes addictive.

Captain America: Civil War," 'Our very strength incites challenge. Challenge incites conflict. And conflict... breeds catastrophe.'
","Yes, the Avengers are back and this super long film is populated with one of the most impressive list of actors in the business. Writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have transformed the Marvel comics writers' Joe Simon and Jack Kirby ideas and concepts and Mark Millar's comic book 'Civil War' into one explosive and at times very funny adventure. Anthony and Joe Russo hold it all together as directors.Whether you are a Marvel comics devotee or just a person who likes to see a group of good and good-looking actors/actresses do a lot of impossibly ridiculous feats, this film is entertainment. No profound messages (except the goal of the Avengers is to make the world safe and right wrongs that threaten life on this planet) but the endless CGI tricks and costumes and jabbing dialogue are enough to make you stick around for the 2 ½ hours of off the wall antics.A synopsis is hardly feasible with so much action: With many people fearing the actions of super heroes, the government decides to push for the Hero Registration Act, a law that limits a hero's actions. This results in a division in The Avengers. Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) stands with this Act, claiming that their actions must be kept in check otherwise cities will continue to be destroyed, but Captain America (Chris Evans) feels that saving the world is daring enough and that they cannot rely on the government to protect the world. This escalates into an all-out war between Team Iron Man - Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Vision (Paul Bettany), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), War Machine (Don Cheadle), and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and Team Captain America - Captain America (Chris Evans), Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Ant Man (Paul Rudd)) while a new villain Zemo (Daniel Brühl) emerges.Add to this a dazzling cast actors with bit parts – Frank Grillo, William Hurt, Martin Freeman, Marisa Tomei, John Kani, Hope Davis, Howard Stark, and Alfre Woodward – and it is easy to see why actors as well as audiences have fun with the Avengers characters. Take it for what it is – CGI wizardry embellished with some terrific puns and patter. It IS a comic book, afterall! Grady Harp, December 16",8,1,3,20 December 2016
Jackie," 'There comes a time in man's search for meaning when he realizes that there are no answers.'
","November 22, 1963 is a day everyone remembers as one of the more devastating moments in our history. That day that JFK was murdered was a hole in time and it is not likely anyone will ever be able to recreate that national and global sensitive loss, Writer Noah Oppenheim and Chilean director Pablo Larraín have tried and have shifted the national grief to a micro study of how that incident affected Jacqueline Kennedy. It works to a degree and to a degree it flounders in superfluous details – minor distractions such as Jackie's excessive smoking and the often-whiny timing that replaces her grief.Opening the film with a journalist (Billy Crudup) interviewing Jackie (Natalie Portman) sets the pace for a re-run of the brief Kennedy time in the Whitehouse and Jackie's important role in restoring the history of the living space of many Presidents before JFK. Footage (re-enacted in black and white with Portman) reminds us of the extent of that renovation and pride in our history. The close relationship with her 'secretary' Nancy (Greta Gerwig), and her protection by Bobby Kennedy (Peter Sarsgaard) play a key role, but the impressive decision for Jackie to walk with the funeral cortege is matched only by her prolonged, sensitive discussion with her priest (John Hurt). Much of the rest of the overly long film is tedious and burdened with one of the weakest and most intrusive musical soundtracks ever written.Natalie Portman's performance is fine – whether the viewer can accept her interpretation of this difficult role is a personal decision. Despite the over-stressed Camelot plagiarism the film does take us back to that fateful day and how we all deal with that is again a personal matter.",5,0,0,19 March 2017
The Duchess," Similar Sagas
","THE DUCHESS (based on Amanda Foreman's book 'Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire' which in turn was based on historical fact) has been well adapted for the screen by Jeffrey Hatcher, Anders Thomas Jensen and writer/director Saul Dibb. What was basically snubbed by the critics of the theatrical release as a 'fashion show with little else going for it' turns out to be a quite beautiful period drama. The fact that the story is based on the life of the outspoken feminist and political thinker in the late 1700s - Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire - who happens to be an ancestor of Princess Di whose life in many ways paralleled the Duchess, makes it more interesting than most costume dramas. And yet, even without the obvious parallel in stories, this film stands well on its own, due to a smart script and a fine cast. Lady Spencer (Charlotte Rampling) coaxes the marriage of her beautiful daughter Georgiana (Keira Knightley) to marry the very wealthy Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes), a rather boring dog lover whose only interest in 'purchasing' a wife is to gain a male heir. Caught up in the dignity and lush homes and gardens of the Duke, the new Duchess charms all who see her - and the manner in which Keira Knightley wears the vast number of gorgeous sculpted costumes gives credence to her appearance popularity and enhances her personal popularity as she looks beyond the surface to the hearts of the people around her. When the Duchess is unable to produce live boy children (two stillborns don't count, nor do the two daughters she births), The Duke turns to dalliances both with the household maids and to the Duchess' newest friend Lady Bess (Hayley Atwell): the Duchess seeks solace with her childhood love Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper) and the tension in the household comes to a breaking point. British etiquette rules, and the 'wife' must bear up under the pressure of society, a position the Duchess obeys but continues her popularity with the politics and social comments of the times - quite a daring feat for those revolutionary years in England, America, and France and the world in general. How this singularly intelligent woman copes provides the resolution of the story. Keira Knightley is ravishingly beautiful and continues to impress with her sensitive acting skills. The contributions by Ralph Fiennes, Charlotte Rampling, Dominic Cooper and Hayley Atwell bring finely honed characterizations to life. Rachel Portman is responsible for the musical score that fits the production like a glove. There is, then, far more to this film than a panorama of elegant costumes. It is deserving of a larger audience. Grady Harp",8,4,6,31 December 2008
No Country for Old Men," 'To this we've come'
","Cormac McCarthy's novel NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN has been successfully transformed into a film in the skilled hands of Ethan and Joel Coen. The story is intact, the characters are given the dialog so uniquely McCarthy's invention, and the horror of the message of the book - that we have come to a point in time when crime, especially random murder, surrounds our lives - is, if anything, even more pungent than on the pages of the book. It is an amazing, and a highly disturbing movie, and while this viewer is one of the few who does not believe it deserved the Oscar for Best Picture, there is little doubt that it is a brilliant piece of cinema.The story is fairly simple: on the raw plains of Texas a slaughter of men and dogs engaged in a drug deal is discovered by a simple guy Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin). Moss observes the mayhem, sees the drugs, finds the 2 million dollar payoff money, takes the money, and embarks on an escape, leaving his wife Carla (Kelly Macdonald) to escape the pursuit of a mad killer Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who in turn is being pursued by the local sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) and a hired hit-man (Woody Harrelson). The satchel of money contains a tracking device and Chigurh has the instrument necessary to follow the trail the device leads. The remainder of the film is the pursuit both in Texas and in Mexico, accompanied by countless brutal murders of all sorts by the crazed Chigurh, until a surprise ending.But the toughest part of this violent film is more in the discussion of shared philosophies between the sheriff and his old cronies: they reflect on the sad state of universal crime that is so different and more malevolent than in the 'old days'. The conversations, in the superb dialog of these old men, bring our attention to some realities we would rather not confront, and those realities are even more disturbing than the repeated images of bloated bodies and senseless murders that fill the screen. Jones, Brolin, and Bardem are indeed superb in their roles, but the small cameos of the townsfolk of Texas are little gems of acting and direction.

The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," An Homage to Western History in a Moody Daguerreotype Style
","THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD is one of the finer films about the history of the Old West 'heroes' such as Jesse James. It is difficult to describe the degree of high quality of the way in which this film has been created: the script (adapted by Andrew Dominick from Ron Hansen's novel) is as poetic as it is gritty and flows like a Shakespearean tragedy both in narration and in dialog; the exceptionally fine cinematography by Roger Deakins captures the flavor of the times, shot in subtle lighting whether in darkly intimate interiors or on the vast plains at times heightened by snowlight, but always in the feeling of the quality of daguerreotypes; the musical score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis is strangely apropos without seeming to borrow from any previous source; and the cast of fine actors play the film as a true ensemble work. Director Andrew Dominik has accomplished a masterpiece.The story begins subtly in the last year of the James gang at the final train robbery in 1881. Jesse James (Brad Pitt) and his brother Frank (Sam Shepard) have gathered remnant criminals to bolster their decimated gang - Dick Liddel (Paul Schneider), Ed Miller (Garret Dillahunt), and Wood Hite (Jeremy Renner) among them. The Ford brothers want to ride with Jesse: 19-year old Robert (Casey Affleck) idolizes Jesse and his older brother Charley (Sam Rockwell) enjoys the attention of the gang's fame. Jesse James, at only age 34, is at the end of his career, content to be at home with his wife Zee (Mary Louise Parker) and children. But Robert's adoration results in a chain of events that slowly dissembles the gang and results in Robert's obsessive revenge for Jesse's murder of one of the members fired by the promise of reward for the capture of Jesse James, dead or alive. History and the title of the film tell the plot so there are no surprises here. It is the inevitable unfolding of the drama and the tension of the interplay of the actors that drives the mood of the story. The film does not stop with the killing of Jesse James but instead follows the descent of the lives of Robert (now wealthy and in love a stripper - Zooey Deschanel) and the progressing insanity of Charley to an end that fades like the proverbial sunset on a time in our history we will never forget.Each of the actors is exceptional, and despite the glory of having big name stars associated with the cast, the effect is one of pure ensemble work. The 160 minute running time of the film never seems too long, so well timed is the pacing of the story and the pauses for understanding the interior aspects of each character's mind. This is a haunting film, unusually fine in every detail. It deserves, and demands, attention. Grady Harp",10,0,1,7 February 2008
Batman Begins," A Comic Book Hero Transformed into a Credible Hero
","Not at all being one for the comic book fantasies that continue to flood the screens and gobble the dollars, camouflage weak scripts with tacky overblown computer graphics, introduce bizarre meanies and barely clothed wonder women, etc, I approached this BATMAN BEGINS with a big bag of prejudices. And in no time at all that bag of unjustified prejudices began to fill with applause for a truly fine film that carries style, wit, character, and enough dazzle to please everyone. This is a surprising good movie! It takes courage to move a larger than life fantasy hero into the realm of humans who through reasons of their own feel the need to become superheroes to the down and outers of the world. Watching the early life of Batman as produced and trained and stimulated by believable characters makes the non-believer want to return to the earlier forays into the genre. So very much of the success of this film lies in the hands of a brilliant cast: Christian Bale (once again a hunk after his pathetically shriveled body in 'The Machinist'), Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, Linus Roache, Morgan Freeman, Tom Wilkinson, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy and yes, even Katie Holmes (!) all master the tightrope of parody, serious drama, and comedy. The costumes and cinematography are exciting and the direction by Christopher Nolan is pitch perfect.It is good to have a dusty old bag of prejudices fall apart. Maybe there will be more action hero movies that take themselves seriously as an art form! Grady Harp",8,1,2,22 October 2005
The Fault in Our Stars," 'Okay?' 'Okay.' Perhaps, 'okay' will be our 'always.'
","Based on John Green's immensely popular novel by the same name, adapted for the screen with extreme skill by Scott Neustader and Michael H. Weber, and directed with sensitivity and taste by Josh Boone THE FAULT IN OUR STARS steps so far beyond expectations that it may just be another Nicholas Sparks young adults tearjerkers and actually becomes one of the more impressive dialogues about death and dying and the meaning and importance of love. Add to that a cast of young actors (an experienced actors) who 'live' their roles and the result is a film that should be experienced by everyone.Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley) and Augustus (Ansel Elgort) are two teenagers who share an acerbic wit, a disdain for the conventional, and a love that sweeps them on a journey. Their relationship is all the more miraculous, given that Hazel's other constant companion is an oxygen tank, Gus jokes about his prosthetic leg, and they meet and fall in love at a cancer support group. Add to that the presence of Gus' best friend Isaac (Nat Wolff) who also has cancer which makes him lose his eyes (and his mental stability at times) and we have a trio of youth facing enormous odds who end up discovering the real meaning of being alive in the world and the importance of love. Hazel's parents are (for once in film) sincerely supportive in the face of a dying child and realistically portrayed by the brilliant Laura Dern and Sam Trammel. Hazel and Gus travel to Amsterdam to visit Hazel's favorite novelist Van Houten (Willem Dafoe) and discover he is a smarmy drunk who lives with the compassionate Lidewij (Lotte Verbeek). Sharing how the story plays out would involve spoilers for those who have not read the book.The on screen chemistry between Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgot sends this film into that rarefied realm of becoming a classic. But for this viewer, even more important is the lesson it offers about the process and concept and meaning and insignificance of death as an ending: it is a continuation.",10,2,4,25 July 2015
Twilight," Bland
","TWILIGHT is an audience-directed film: the popularity of the ongoing teenager vampire/werewolf series of novels by Stephanie Meyer will most assuredly pull in all the readers to see what these characters look like. And that is what we get with TWILIGHT - a movie created by screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg from Meyer's novel and directed by Catherine Hardwick that stays pretty much in the 'twilight' tones of the Washington state overcast atmosphere. The actors are for the most part young newcomers (with the exception of some like Billy Burke as the father of the teenage star) and since they are given little to say or do other than wander around the school or blend into the shadows of the woods it is difficult to ascertain the quality of acting. Kristen Stewart is the monotoned Bella, confused yet lusting after the 'don't come out in the daylight' vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) who is equally attracted to but fearful of revealing his true identity to Bella. There are of course, in addition to the usual fellow students concentrating on the Prom, two vampire groups (one eats animal flesh, the other the more traditional human blood) and then there are the 'native American Indians who have secrets of ancestry of their own. We do get to meet the very young lead for the next episode - Taylor Lautner as an interesting variation on the werewolf type, and there are some interesting minor roles for Peter Facinelli and Elizabeth Reaser of TV fame. This is not a bad film at all and for those who are avoiding it because of all the money spent on PR hoopla, it is an entertaining diversion. Keep expectations low and you'll probably be surprised.

To Rome With Love," Why Woody Allen should not star in his own movies
","Woody Allen has made some very important and poignant films and he does have quite a following. When Allen casts himself in movies that he writes and directs they become ego trips and almost unbearably dull as Allen's character is always Woody Allen, despite the costume he is supposed to be wearing to alter his character.TO ROME WITH LOVE has one main character - the glorious city of Rome. The rest of the cast make up little frazzled stories that each seem dispensable: a worker (Robertp Benigni) who wakes up to find himself a celebrity - for a while; an architect (Alec Baldwin) who takes a trip back to the street he lived on as a student now inhabited by a confused contemporary student (Jesse Eisenberg); a young couple on their honeymoon (Alessandro Tiberi and Alessandra Mastronardi) whose life is disrupted by a hooker (Penelope Cruz) and a movie star (Antonio Albanese); and a frustrated opera director (Woody Allen) and his wife (Judy Davis) who on a trip to Rome to meet their daughter and her fiancé (Allison Pill and Flavio Parenti) has a talent for discovering talented singers and 'discovers' his future in-law (Fabio Armiliato) who sings opera arias well - but only in the shower. It all sounds silly and it is.Were it not for the beauty of Rome the film could be easily dismissed as one of Woody Allen's 'off films'. Even a cast of very fine actors can't save this from drowning in the overdone and fallen cake. Grady Harp",2,5,9,9 May 2013
Bridesmaids," Less Funny than Sad
","BRIDESMAIDS is not a film this viewer would normally have watched, but in a week where there is very little else available On Demand on television, the button parked here. In many ways the film was a surprise, actually better than expected. The promo for the film was that it was a female version of HANGOVER or BORAT, an attempt to demonstrate to guys that women can be just as gross and vulgar as men. But actually the story is more a tale of a group of sad women, unhappy in many ways with their relationships with not only men but also with other women. Written by star Kristen Wigg and Annie Mumolo and directed by Paul Feig it is a pulled together series of vignettes about women in distress, and while it does include the gross-out promises of PR (barf/flatulence/body insert references) and the manner in which women in competition behave, it still remains a story of how sad people cope.Annie (Kristin Wiig) is a barely employed woman who has lost her dream of having her own bakery and having a meaningless physical relationship with cad Ted (Jon Hamm) relies on her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph) to get through life, until Lillian announces she is getting married and asks Annie to be her Maid of Honor. Even though Annie is broke, living with a disgusting British brother and sister as a roomer, she accepts the responsibilities. The sparkle of the wedding dream plans fizzles when Annie meets the incongruous group of women who will be bridesmaids: the wealthy, haughty Helen (Rose Byrne), the obese socially gross Megan (Melissa McCarthy), the oversexed inappropriate mother Rita (Wendi McLendon McCarthy) and the silly insubstantial Becca (Ellie Kemper). In a series of gag moments - eating in a Brazilian café, trying on dresses, a grossly overdone flight in the direction of Las Vegas, and a preposterous wedding shower - the girls fall apart as potential friends only, of course, to some together in the end.There are a few redeeming elements in the film that are worthy of attention - the Irish police officer Nathan Rhodes a sparkling Chris O'Dowd) who provides the only semblance of true sentiment in Annie's ridiculous life and Annie's mother played by Jill Clayburgh in what was to be her last role (she died of Leukemia seen after the film was completed). Kristin Wiig does carry the film, despite the fact that her expressions and character show minimal variation as the story plods along. But in the end, despite all the attempts to out-gross HANGOVER, this is a sad little film about bruised women and how their interdependence provides a way out of the meaningless lives they lead.

Non-Stop," Someone on this flight is threatening to kill someone every 20 minutes...'
","Jaume Collet-Serra directs a story and screenplay by John W. Richardson, Chris Roach and Ryan Engle and makes the audience cringe at the concept of long airplane flights. The pace of the story is harrowing and even if at the ending we are left with the feeling 'I should have figured this out', the action and the acting is first rate and the film proves to be a fine summer evening diversion.Bill Marks (Liam Neeson), a former cop now an Air Marshall dealing with his daughter's death by drinking, even as he prepares to board a flight that needs his expertise as a law enforcer. Suspicious things begin to happen when there is an argument over a window seat Zack (Nate Parker) and the inquisitive Jen Summers (Julianne Moore), an encounter with a frightened child (Quinn McColgan), a co-dependent relationship between Marks and a stewardess (Michelle Dockery), etc. While on the flight from New York to London, Marks gets a text telling him that unless 150 million dollars is transferred to an offshore account, someone will die every 20 minutes. Everyone becomes a suspect, Marks is called a terrorist, people begin dying in a string of strange occurrences, and ultimately, with craft and cunning and employing the aid of the passengers, Marks finds the truth in the situation.Supporting actors who offer fine support include Scoot McNairy, Linus Roache, Anson Mount, Corey Stoll, Omar Metwally among others. Fast action, edge of the seat suspense, and fine timing make this a film worthy of viewing (if it doesn't terrify you about booking long flights!).",Null,1,2,21 June 2014
The Chorus," 'Music that soothes the savage beast...'
","LES CHORISTES (THE CHORUS) is director Christophe Berratier's first foray into the realm of full-length films and his adaptation of the 1945 film LA CAGE AUX ROSSINGNOLS written by Georges Chaperot and René Wheeler serves to introduce his talents as a master storyteller well. This tale of how music can alter the lives of even most renegade of boys is warm, sensitive, and satisfying on every level.The story opens with the reunion of two men who were classmates at Fond de l'Etang, a boarding school for troubled boys in France in 1949. Pepinot (Didier Flammand) arrives at the door of consummate symphony conductor Pierre Morhange (Jacques Perrin) with a journal written by their beloved teacher Clement Mathieu, now dead, and the two read the journal, recalling their shared childhood experiences at Fond de l'Etang.1949 and the Fond de l'Etang is a dreary jail-like, rundown place run by the cruel disciplinarian headmaster Rachin (François Berléand). Clément Mathieu (Gérard Jugnot) is an older, bald, failed musician who seeks employment as a prefect in the school and immediately is forced to confront the rigors of the school's harsh discipline with the still flagrantly wild boys. Mathieu slowly wins the confidence of his boys by standing up to the cruel Rachin and when he is near his wits' end as to how to transform his class, he hears a boy sing and decides to use his musical talent to change these boys' lives. Two of the chief problem children are the angry but vocally gifted Pierre Morhange (Jean-Baptiste Maunier) and Leclerc (Théodul Carré-Cassaigne) and Mathieu coaxes them into the inner circle of his newly developing chorus. The other child who is without talent but for whom Mathieu empathizes when the child waits every Saturday for someone to claim him at the gates is Pepinot (Maxence Perrin) who Mathieu assigns as his assistant chorus master! Through a series of incidents including the cruelty of Rachin, the appearance of Violette Morhange (Pierre's poor working mother who cannot afford to feed him), the success of the chorus in the eyes of the Countess (Carol Weiss) who acts as benefactor to the school, and some evil doings of the more difficult children, Mathieu's Chorus becomes a symbol for how problem children can bond in mutual need to the enrichment music provides. Rachin cannot tolerate Mathieu's success and fires him without allowing him to say a farewell to his beloved choristers. The manner in which this is portrayed is most touching and spiritually enriching and serves to resolve the mystery of Mathieu's departure to the adult Morhange and Pepinot as they finish the journal.Simple story, told before, but superbly acted and performed. The music is by Jean-Philippe Rameau with original songs by director Barratier and Bruno Coulais, all beautifully sung by Les Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc with young actor Jean-Baptiste Maunier singing his own solos. The cinematography is in the capable hands of Jean-Jacques Bouhon, Dominique Gentil, and Carlo Varini. In French with English subtitles. Highly recommended little jewel of a film!

The Grand Budapest Hotel," 'I go to bed with all my friends.'
","Who would have guessed the ideas for this preposterously hilarious film came form the seeds within Stefan Zweig's mind? Well, Wes Anderson is the man about wild ideas and he surpasses his own impressive credits (Moonrise Kingdom, Fantastic Mr. Fox, The Royal Tenebaums, Rushmore, etc) with this zany and delightful romp.GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL recounts the adventures of Gustave H (Ralf Fiennes, a legendary concierge at a famous European hotel in the fictional Republic of Zubrowka between the wars, and Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori), the lobby boy who becomes his most trusted friend. The story involves the theft and recovery of a priceless Renaissance painting and the battle for an enormous family fortune -- all against the backdrop of a suddenly and dramatically changing Continent. The big-time cast includes Mathieu Amalric, F. Murray Abraham, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Soarise Ronan, Jason Schwartzman, Tilda Swinton, Tom Wilkinson, Owen Wilson, Bob Balaban and others. Granted, you must be in a good state of mind to get all the innuendos and in-jokes that fly through this film, but go along for the ride.

The Favourite," 'Oh it is fun to be Queen sometimes!'
","Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos has directed dance videos, television commercials, music videos, short films, theater plays and a few movies. He has a strange view of history and finds the secrets and bad habits of 18th century England under the brief rule of the gouty, slightly mad (in the film's stance) Queen Anne and with the screenplay by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara we have an entirely unique view of England's royalty and court manners (or lack of them).The production company offers a rather clean overview of the 'story' - 'Early 18th century. England is at war with the French. Nevertheless, duck racing and pineapple eating are thriving. A frail Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) occupies the throne and her close friend Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz) governs the country in her stead while tending to Anne's ill health and mercurial temper. When a new servant Abigail (Emma Stone) arrives, her charm endears her to Sarah. Sarah takes Abigail under her wing and Abigail sees a chance at a return to her aristocratic roots. As the politics of war become quite time consuming for Sarah, Abigail steps into the breach to fill in as the Queen's companion. Their burgeoning friendship gives her a chance to fulfill her ambitions and she will not let woman, man, politics or rabbit stand in her way.'What actually happens on the screen is naughty, spicy, indulgent and colorful X-rated survey of the sexually discordant reign of Queen Anne. Not only is there excessive raw language (were those words even in the vocabulary in the 18th century?) and considerable acting out of various forms of sensual release and nudity, but the pace is spinning, accompanied by an at times unbearably raucous 'musical score' (except for the actual insertion of classical tunes) by Komeil S. Hosseini. Granted, Olivia Colman has the work's version of Queen Anne down pat, including the post CVA weakness in her left side at film's end, and both Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz make their strange roles credible (well...?...). They are supported by James Smith as Godolphin, Nicholas Hoult as Harley and Joe Alwyn as Masham, as well as some of the most beautiful castle interiors - in lush color and bizarre lens distortion - on film.The film feels much longer than two hours, but then the time spent on the sexual proclivities maintains a strange sort of voyeurism-type attention.

Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Toots, Bells, and Whistles but No Character Development
","For those of us who didn't see MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL on the big screen but bought into the rave reviews that this is the best of all the MI pictures this 4th installment is a big letdown. Brad Bird as director may be part of the problem: his credits prior to this assignment include Up, Ratatouille, The Incredibles, The Iron Giant, The Simpsons, and such like - films that depend on the animation magic they bring to cute stories but somehow don't transfer well to the use of actors in a 'serious' film. Writers Josh Appelbaum and André Nemec based this script very loosely on Bruce Geller's original television series, but in this film they seem to opt more for inserted comedy lines when there is anything vaguely beyond the minimal conversations that occur. The film is like a ship without a sail and headed in a direction full of sidetracks.Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise in a Tom Cruise Production) and his team Jane Carter (Paula Patton), Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) are racing against time to track down a dangerous terrorist named Kurt Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist), who has gained access to Russian nuclear launch codes and is planning a strike on the United States. An attempt by the team to stop him at the Kremlin ends in a disaster, with an explosion causing severe destruction to the Kremlin and the IMF being implicated in the bombing, forcing the President to invoke Ghost Protocol, under which the IMF is disavowed, and will be offered no help or backup in any form. Undaunted, Ethan and his team chase Hendricks to Dubai, and from there to Mumbai, but several spectacular action sequences later, they might still be too late to stop a disaster.It all starts in Budapest with the assassination of Trevor Hanaway (Josh Holloway) by Sabine Moreau (Léa Seydoux), proceeds to a prison breakout (Ethan Hunt has been imprisoned for killing some Serbian guards), the Russian secrets are discovered, aborted plans lead the team form the Kremlin to Dubai (for Tom Cruise's reportedly self performed scaling of a glass tower) and subsequently to Mumbai and on and on an on for well over two hours. The movie is fast moving and the booms and blowups and car chases and pyrotechnics and absurdly one-sided fights (yes, the girls get to fight and kill each other) manage to keep our attention because of spectacle. There are a couple of moments where we get to learn just a bit about some of the characters an their motivations to be part of this invincible team, but in the end we care very little about any of them as they talk their way through a soupy ending. OK to see on television on demand but not a film to own. But that is just one opinion from a viewer who likes story in a movie. Grady Harp,",5,3,8,18 April 2012
Revolutionary Road," Formulas for Happiness and why they Crumble
","A half a century ago migration from the noisy high-powered success of the city to the serenity of the suburbs found the path of REVOLUTIONARY ROAD a common one. Richard Yates' novel about the fragility of married commitment in 1955 has been very successfully transformed to the screen by writer Justin Haythe, director Sam Mendes and a perfect cast of actors. All of the soured expectations of that period gel in this superb film - a movie that is difficult to watch at times, mostly because it rings so very true. Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) and April (Kate Winslet) Wheeler move to Connecticut from New York when the addition of children to their lives of thwarted expectations alter their once dreamy plans for their future. Once in the 'just perfect' little suburb and living in a just perfect little house sold to them by real estate agent Helen Givings (Kathy Bates) - who has a grown son John (Michael Shannon) who is in a mental institution and has undergone multiple shock therapy treatments that allow him to see things as they are no matter how cruel or rude his views - Frank settles for life in the Knox Business Machines Company, reluctantly following in the footsteps of his father while April attempts to rationalize her dreams of being an actress by appearing in an unimpressive amateur theatrical group. From the opening frames of this claustrophobically suffocating new life the once happy couple shows signs of deterioration of a marriage. The manner in which they couple attempt to dramatically change their boring life is destroyed by the realities of their situation: another pregnancy plays a significant role in the downward spiral of Frank and April's future and we as viewers are forced to watch the castle crumble. Winslet and DiCaprio are excellent in the lead roles, offering the type of sensitive acting skills that pull the audience into the film. The supporting roles by Kathy Bates, Michael Shannon, David Harbour, Richard Easton and Kathryn Hahn are cameos worthy of praise. Every aspect of the film recreates the 1955 era and in some ways that 'distance' makes observing the film emotionally more tolerable. This is a sad story that has no redeeming end. Well worth the attention it has received. Grady Harp",10,1,2,7 June 2009
Foxcatcher," Tedium

Since this is history there can be no spoilers – the real story made every newspaper in the world. Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum who sleepwalks through this role) is guided by his brother David Schultz (Mark Ruffalo) in wrestling training and medal winning until the wealthiest man in the world John du Pont (Steve Carell in a totally monochromatic somnambulistic portrayal noted only because of is cosmetically added large nose) enters and ruins it all, ending up destroying the brothers relationship and killing David only to die in prison.Sound like something you would want to watch?

Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Better and wiser than expected
","Frequently sequels or imitations or take-offs or whatever the designator you choose of famous older movies prove to be ho-hum to poor. If that is the thought about RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES then give this film a chance. It has a lot of nuances we don't expect from movies of this genre – introducing the concept of genetic therapy, for example – in addition to the fact that it has a superb cast on both extremes of the animal spectrum!The principal player is Caesar (beautifully enacted by Andy Serkis at the later age and by Terry Notary in the early phase), a chimpanzee who gains human-like intelligence and emotions from the experimental drug ALZ 112, a drug that causes neurogenesis, which allows the brain to grow new brain cells (something that doesn't happen after birth) and heal any number of degenerative brain disorders, such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. The only side effect is that the subjects exposed to the drug have a green sparkle to the eyes. Raised like a child by the drug's creator, Will Rodman (James Franco in a very fine, sensitive role) and a primatologist Caroline Aranha (Freida Pinto), Caesar ultimately finds himself taken from the humans he loves and imprisoned in an ape sanctuary in San Bruno. Seeking justice for his fellow inmates, Caesar gives the fellow apes the same drug that he inherited. He then assembles a simian army and escapes the sanctuary - putting man and ape on a collision course with dire possibilities.Blended into this story are some fine subplots and the presence of such excellent actors as John Lithgow, Brian Cox, David Oyelowo among others. The screenplay was written by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver whose ideas came form the Pierre Boulle novel, 'La planète des singes'. The direction is in the sure hands of Rupert Wyatt and of course considerable credit is due to the special effects and costume/makeup crew. This is a fine summer evening's entertainment!

Legend," 'Me and my brother, we're gonna rule London!'
","Brian Helgeland both wrote the screenplay (based on John Pearson's book) and directed this mobster movie. The sole attraction (aside form a fine performance by Emily Browning) is the tick of using actor Tom Hardy to play both roles of the twins – and for that reason it is worth watching.The film tells the story of the identical twin gangsters Reggie and Ronnie Kray (Tom Hardy in a duplicitous role), two of the most notorious criminals in British history, and their organized crime empire in the East End of London during the 1960s. Focusing on the relationship between Reggie Kray and Frances Shea (Emily Browning), the film is told from France's' point of view as someone who knew him best, as well as the mental health issues the same sex life that Ronnie Kray faced and their rise to power as the notorious gangsters of London.There are some fine roles for Christopher Eccleston, Tara Fitzgerald, Nicholas Farrell, and Joshua Hill, but the entire production is overlong, consistent fighting, and not a lot of character development. But the overriding problem of this film is that is nearly unintelligible due to the thick East Ender accents the actors use. Tom Hardy does a fine job as both twins (very different in nature) but he too is almost impossible to understand. Fortunately on DVD there are English subtitles so we can understand the dialogue.",5,0,1,25 March 2016

There is an audience (and a massive one willing to pay big bucks and stand in long lines ) who champion all of the Marvel Comics films. AVANGERS INFINITY WAR is no exception. At over two and a half hours even the huge cast of gifted actors - at their bet when being funny - explode, blow up things, zoom into outer space for a mission to find Thanos who goal is to rule the universe by obtaining all the funky jewels for his glove - all seem to wear thin from the plodding 'plot' and turn to dust. The true 'stars' of this huge effort are f course the CGI team - the special effects are truly spectacular, at least for the first hour. The characters don't get much time to develop but the actors assigned to the strange roles make the Avengers and their enemies entertaining. The 'plot'? 'As the Avengers and their allies have continued to protect the world from threats too large for any one hero to handle, a new danger has emerged from the cosmic shadows: Thanos. A despot of intergalactic infamy, his goal is to collect all six Infinity Stones, artifacts of unimaginable power, and use them to inflict his twisted will on all of reality. Everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this moment - the fate of Earth and existence itself has never been more uncertain.'Cast includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Helmsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Holland Chadwick Boseman, Zoe Saldana, Tom Hiddleston, Paul Bettany, Anthony Mackie, Idris Elba, Peter Dinklage, Vin Diesel, Benecio Del Toro, Chris Pratt, William Hurt, Josh Brolin, Gweneth Paltrow, Bradley Cooper etc etc etc.

Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," 'It's official, old buddy. I'm a has been'
","Viewing ONCE UPON A TIME...IN HOLLYWOOD is a visit to the 1960s - California/Hollywood style. Quentin Tarantino both wrote and directed this very long and lugubrious film that features some very fine acting but requires more than a dollop of patience to make it to the clever final scene.The 'idea' is to recreate Hollywood and the months leading up to the entrance of Charles Manson's tribe, as the infamous night in 1969 becomes a theatrical twist of facts. Leonardo DiCaprio is convincing as a has-been action star Rick Dalton and Brad Pitt is excellent as his stunt double Cliff Booth. Tarantino convincingly intertwines tidbits of the life of Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) and Roman Polanski (Rafal Zawierucha) and their third party Jay Sebring (Emil Hirsch), leading us to think the film will end with the Tate et al murders, but the road to that end is twisted and cleverly altered - like Hollywood. Other key actors include the very fine young Julia Butters, Al Pacino, Bruce Dern, Luke Perry, Timothy Olyphant, Margaret Qualley et al.The movie is very long, spending an excessive amount of focus on cigarette smoking and the use of the 'f word' and endless cinematic production takes, but the overall effect of the film - in retrospect - is how clever Tarantino used these 'flaws' to bring the 60's Hollywood to life. This may not be a film for everyone, but the piece works - it just needs patience.",8,0,2,13 December 2019
Behind The Candelabra," Liberace the Legend is served well
","The film is based on the autobiographical novel of the same name by Scott Thorson (with Alex Thorleifson) adapted for the screen by Richard LaGravenese about the tempestuous 6- year relationship between Liberace and his much younger lover Scott Thorson. This film along with SIDE EFFECTS are purported to be Steven Soderbergh's last films he will direct.The cast is very solid. Matt Damon embodies the role of Scott Thorson well - a young apparently bisexual man who has been tossed from foster home to foster home while he does odd jobs (he is 17 years old) tending to animals. In a gay bar he meets Bob Black (Scott Bakula) who takes Scott to a Liberace concert (his first exposure to the mega-star) and to meet Liberace afterwards. There is tension in the air with Liberace's current paramour and performing partner Billy Leatherwood (Cheyenne Jackson) and we soon discover that Liberace (impeccably played by Michael Douglas) only keeps his 'boys' around for a while before his manager Seymour (Dan Ackroyd) gets rid of them with a check. Liberace and Scott find common ground in being needy people without confidants and soon Scott becomes Liberace's next lover. All goes swimmingly until Liberace sees himself on a TV show and sees how aged he has become. He engages plastic surgeon Dr. Jack Startz (Rob Lowe in a very fine performance) to perform a youthful face lift and at the same time convinces Scott to undergo plastic surgery to make him look more like Liberace! And here begins the downfall: Dr. Startz prescribes pain meds to Scott who becomes addicted and moves into heavier drugs, and his behavior, along with Liberace's need for a 'new face' (Boyd Holbrook), signals the breakup of a 6 year relationship - the best relationship either has ever had.There are excellent cameos by Debbie Reynolds as Liberace's mother, Paul Reiser as Scott's lawyer, and others, but the star of the film is in all ways the flamboyant showman Liberace in some of the most interesting outfits ever created. The on screen relationship between Michael Douglas and Matt Damon is entirely credible and neither of these fine actors has a problem with being sexually physical without seeming to be a parody. There are moments that could have been cut, but as Liberace says, less is more and more is wonderful. Grady Harp",Null,36,46,27 May 2013
Gone Girl," 'My God, this place literally smells like feces.'
","Gillian Flynn wrote the best selling novel and then adapted his own success to the screen. David Fincher (Fight Club, Se7en, The Social Network, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Panic Room, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, etc) directs this twisted tale of hate and anger and passion and deceit and obsession and the minds of sociopaths, and out comes a film being considered for an Oscar. Wow, are we all really into this?On the occasion of his fifth wedding anniversary, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck, chubby and out of shape) reports that his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike), has gone missing. Under pressure from the police (a very well cast Kim Dickens and Patrick Fugit et al) and a growing media frenzy, Nick's portrait of a blissful union begins to crumble. Soon his lies, deceits and strange behavior have everyone asking the same dark question: Did Nick Dunne kill his wife? Nick's sister Margo (Carrie Coon, excellent) is supportive and grounded, Nick's lawyer Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry, never better), Amy's previous lover Desi (Neil Patrick Harris), and a television interviewer Sharon Schieber (Sela Ward) and other actors who can't be mentioned because doing so would give the plot away make this very long and sick film work. So, very superb acting from everyone involved, careful direction that makes sure the audience is able to witness all the disgusting twists and turns of this warped story make it obvious why this is an Oscar contender. As a story it is a profoundly sad commentary on marriage, the paparazzi, gossip, television news casting, and our current hunger for sick stories that fail to resolve anything. Watch it at your own risk – and with an antiemetic handy.",6,2,6,8 January 2015
Django Unchained," 'Django. The D is silent.'
","Quentin Tarantino has a style that is stylish! Few can outdo him for over the top blood and guts treatment of a subject matter that is inherently not funny. He knows how far he can push the limits and gathers together some very fine talent in all aspects of his creation. DJANGO UNCHAINED is certainly one of his finest efforts to date, and that is saying a lot. But a writer/director who can tackle a subject as heinous as our history of slavery and show all aspects of it - as vicious and cruel and inhuman as it was - while at the same time pepper it with outlandish parody and humor is a genius of cinema.Everyone knows the story of the film by now so a very brief statement is for openers: The time is two years before the Civil War and slavery is big business in America. Former dentist, Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz who is actually the star of the film in a brilliant portrayal), buys the freedom of a slave, Django (Jamie Foxx), and trains him with the intent to make him his deputy bounty hunter. Instead, he is led to the site of Django's wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) who is owned by the smarmiest of villains Calvin Candie (Leonardo Di Caprio in an astonishingly fine turn out of his usual character), a ruthless plantation owner. How we get to Candyland via taking advantage of bounty hunter murders and money and finally arrive in the gross estate of Candie run by his own black master Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson in a brilliant cameo) in order to free Django's wife in a wily manner may take almost three hours but there is never a portion that is dull or that fails to introduce new highlights to the story.In addition to the 'main characters' this film abounds in spectacular cameos by such fine actors as Don Johnson, Franco Nero, James Remar, Walton Goggins, Dennis Christopher, Ato Essandoh, Sammi Rotibi, Russ Tamblyn (yes, that one!), Bruce Dern, James Russo, Michael Parks, John Jarratt, among many others, and of course Quentin Tarantino himself. There are scenes such as a gathering of a Western KKK gang with maladaptive hoods that are incredibly hilarious, and scenes of torture and violent blood-gushing shootouts. It all works and even for the easily offended this is a film that entertains while it reminds us of a period in our history which is unutterably shameful. Grady Harp",9,2,6,17 April 2013
Get Out," 'All I know is sometimes, when there's too many white people, I get nervous, you know?'
","Multi-talented Jordan Peele both write and directed this controversial thriller that is likely to win awards in many categories. Not only has he selected a superb cast, but he also is willing to take the racial conflict where few have dared go - a story where the concept of being Black in a white atmosphere changes from being an advantage, a showcase for Black culture, to a nightmare of racism carried to the extreme. The film opens strangely with an incident on the street of an apparent kidnapping of a black young man (LaKeith Stanfield). Jump some time later when Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), a young Black photographer, visits Rose (Allison Williams), his white girlfriend's family estate, he becomes ensnared in the more sinister, real reason for the invitation. The parents (psychiatrist Missy - Catherine Keener and neurosurgeon Dean - Bradley Whitford) are strange but apparently conspicuously non-racist. At first, Chris reads the family's overly accommodating behavior as nervous attempts to deal with their daughter's interracial relationship, but as the weekend progresses, a series of increasingly disturbing discoveries lead him to a truth that he could have never imagined. The manner in which the Black 'help' - Walter (Marcus Henderson) and Georgina (Betty Gabriel) - interact with Chris is bizarre, as is the presence of some of the guests at a party held in the estate at night. Where it leads must be seen - otherwise the mood and story are spoiled. Unique story, well written and directed and photographed and acted, this is a fine film that makes many necessary observations.",8,19,38,14 January 2018
Drive," Transformations
","DRIVE is a fascinating character study, one that uses a minimum of words to define a complex character in a manner than seems terrifyingly quiet and mesmerizing. Based on a book written by James Sallis the screenplay is the minimalist yet secure writing of Iranian writer Hossein Amini (Wings of the Dove, The Four Feathers, Jude, Shanghai, Kill Shot, etc). Nicolas Winding Refn is the sensitive director who takes advantage of the pauses in the storyline, allowing cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel to bring this mysterious story to life.An unnamed young man referred to as Driver (Ryan Gosling) is a loner, holding down several jobs as a Hollywood stunt driver, a garage mechanic, and a getaway driver who participates in robberies as a silent, by his own rules driver. He works for garage owner, the crippled Shannon (Bryan Cranston) who in turn works for criminals Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks) and Nino (Ron Perlman). Driver meets his apartment house neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her son Benicio (Kaden Leos) and while there seems to be a chemistry quietly building between them, Driver is told that Irene's husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) has been in prison and will be coming home soon. Driver, Irene and Benicio bond and when Standard is finally released from prison Driver learns that Standard owes a huge protection debt and to befriend the only people about whom Driver cares, he agrees to help in a getaway car that turns very wrong. From this point the normally gentle and quiet driver transforms into a brutal man and the rest of the film is full of terror.Ryan Gosling is splendid in his role as the driver, saying more with his eyes and his body language and his silences than many actors say with a full script. Carey Mulligan is likewise strong and the supporting roles by Albert Brooks, Oscar Isaac, Bryan Cranston, Ron Perlman, Christina Hendricks, James Biberi and even Russ Tamblyn (!) are superlative cameos. This is a tough film, full of graphic violence, but it is such a unique story and is so well acted and directed that it is one of the year's most surprising quality movies.

The Theory of Everything," 'I have a slight problem with the celestial dictatorship premise.'
","The Oscars have been awarded and Eddie Redmayne won Best Actor for his astonishingly fine performance as Stephen Hawking. For those interested in learning more about the extraordinary mind of this physicist and his contributions to science, do not expect to be enlightened. The story is more a love story adapted from his first wife Jane Hawking's book TRAVELING TO INFINITY: MY LIFE WITH STEPHEN as adapted for the screen by Anthony McCarten. Were it not for the struggle with ALS that is depicted from the onset to the present (Hawking is 72 years old at present) and the manner in which both Hawking and Jane adjusted to this deteriorating disease, this could have been another soap opera a la Nicholas Sparks, but the actors involved make it work, aided of course by the direction of James Marsh.One summary offers the synopsis well: 'The Theory of Everything is the story of the most brilliant and celebrated physicist of our time, Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) , and Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones) the arts student he fell in love with whilst studying at Cambridge in the 1960s. Little was expected from Stephen Hawking, a bright but shiftless student of cosmology, given just two years to live following the diagnosis of a fatal illness at 21 years of age. He became galvanized, however, by the love of fellow Cambridge student, Jane Wilde, and he went on to be called the successor to Einstein, as well as a husband and father to their three children. Over the course of their marriage as Stephen's body collapsed and his academic renown soared, fault lines were exposed that tested the lineaments of their relationship and dramatically altered the course of both of their lives: Stephen remarried Elaine mason (Maxine Peake) and Jane remarried Jonathan Hellyer Jones (the very fine actor Charlie Cox). The others in the large cast who deserve mention include David Thwelis as Stephen mentor and friend, Simon McBurney as Stephen's father, and a quick little walk on by Emily Watson. The film does not fail to touch us because of the diagnosis and the performances, but it would have been stronger had more of Hawking's contributions been shared.

2012," Noah's Ark: The Haves and the Have Nots
","2012 is an odd film. It can be viewed on a number of levels: it brings to the public eye the old Mayan prediction that the earth and civilization as we know it will be destroyed on December 21, 2012, it is an exercise in computer generated graphics in the hands of Roland Emmerich, it poses a few questions as to what is important in life and how learning what is important is learning how to live in the now, and it is a roller coaster corny simplistic mess of a plot that sells out at every chance it gets to make a meaningful statement. The cast, watching the crumbling and burning of the planet, is huge. John Cusack is a satisfying hero/returned dad, Chiwetel Ejiofor represents the good in science, Oliver Platt propels the action with his usual ability to steal a scene, Woody Harelson is, well, Woody Harelson as dopey as ever, Thandie Newton and Amanda Peet add the appropriate glamour and love interests, Danny Glover makes a fine President of the USA, Johann Urb is a very screen-powerful presence as a Russian pilot, and Osric Chau makes a very positive impression as a personality the camera loves and a character with whom we can identify (he needs some important roles to allow us to further examine his potential). And there are others equally as well cast. What will bother those who find a degree of credence and associated anxiety with the Mayan prediction will be sorry to see the silly manner in which 400,000 of mankind and animalkind are saved in boats to land in Africa to restart civilization. But then this is Hollywood and Roland Emmerich tends to concentrate more on CGI than on content. It is long, but then it is entertaining - to a point. Grady Harp",5,0,1,29 March 2010
Peaceful Warrior," Be Everything You Are
","Some films make a difference: viewing them can give us a story that is memorable and leave the viewer with powerful food for thought that continues to influence thinking long after the film is over. Such is the case for PEACEFUL WARRIOR. Based on a book by Inspirational Guru Dan Millman and beautifully adapted for the screen by Kevin Bernhardt, the story combines the best in sport stories with the infusion of spiritual discovery that despite the abundance of 'Hallmark-like' imitations, stands nobly as a tool for introducing young people to a journey toward self discovery well worth taking. Director Victor Salva had the good sense not to push the story over the top, but instead to let his actors and situations grow logically into a practical demonstration of spiritual growth.Dan Millman (Scott Mechlowicz) is a gymnast bent on perfecting his skills to enter the Olympic trials. He is a fine athlete but has an ego that consumes everything around him and prevents his finding a focus to be the perfect athlete he feels he can become. After a chance encounter with a mysterious Service Station attendant whom Dan calls Socrates (Nick Nolte), Dan's inner struggles begin to surface as he sees and experiences troubling 'other-worldly' responses form Socrates. He is ultimately forced to confront that he is living for pride, for accomplishment, for competition, for recognition - yet his quiet moments remain discontent. Socrates works with Dan, helping him to find his inner self and to live in the moment. Dan suffers a life-threatening motorcycle accident that appears to doom his dreams of being the finest gymnast, but Socrates helps him discover that living in the moment, giving in to the power of focus on the present, can result in overcoming the seemingly impossible obstacles.Rather than 'preach' these concepts, the story is illustrated by physical feats of gymnastics and by meaningful encounters between Dan and Socrates, and it is this technique that brings the film above the usual 'inspirational flicks' to become a truly compelling movie. Nick Nolte has never been better as the subdued, understated, but immensely impressive Socrates. Scott Mechlowicz thankfully underplays the character of Dan: the use of a body double to perform the incredible gymnastic turns is seamlessly achieved. The remainder of the cast includes such fine actors as Amy Smart, Agnes Bruckner, and Ashton Holmes. This is a well-made film that deserves our attention, especially now.

X-Men: The Last Stand," Interesting to See State of the Art Computer Generated Graphics
","Never a fan of the comic book hero outings, this viewer watched X-MEN - THE LAST STAND with a bit of mental prejudice: action heroes capable of destroying everything in sight at the glance of a weird eye or the motion of a hand have just never seemed entertaining. But given that stance, watching this very colorful film was an art study in how far computer generated graphics have come in a relatively short time. And that makes the time spent on the non-story worthwhile.Of course it is always a pleasure to see Sir Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Rebecca Romijn, James Marsden, Patrick Stewart, and the newly buff Ben Foster in action: nice costume effects despite overdone makeup etc. But the story is so slim that it can be ignored and the viewer can watch the rather extraordinary special effects - until they ultimately wear thin (as when the house lifts off the ground, etc!). So advice for those fellow viewers who avoid these Marvel Comic movies: drop the prejudice long enough to see what is au courante in special effects. It is rather entertaining...for a while.

The Lives of Others," The Survival of the Individual Under the Cloud of Totalitarianism
","Das Leben der Anderen (The Live of Others) is a powerful film that opens a window to the West of what life was like in East Germany during the time of the Berlin Wall. It is a tense yet balanced work by newcomer writer and director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck who manages to present a tense story of espionage, suspense, intrigue, and political danger without the need for car chases, explosions, gunfire, or any of the usual accoutrements that pulse through other stories of this nature. Instead von Donnersmarck shows us the interior lives of his characters, both those working with the East German government and Secret Police and those who struggled to survive individuality. One of the primary jobs of the Secret Police (Stasi) was to spy on informers and those who would leak information about East Germany to the West. One fact that was kept under lock and key was the high rate of suicide, especially among artists who could not bear the crushing eye of the Eastern police, that would be devastating information if leaked into the press of the West: this forms the nidus for the story of this film.It is 1984 and one agent - Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe) is assigned the duty of spying on popular playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his live-in girlfriend, brilliant actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). Dreyman is a friend of blacklisted director Albert Jerska (Volkmar Kleinert) and when Jerska commits suicide Dreyman feels compelled to get in the information to the West into a popular magazine in hopes that action will be taken. Wiesler alters his spying routine when he discovers that the Stasi official to whom he reports has different designs on Georg and Christ-Maria and his spirit shifts subtly in support of the artists. It is this inner struggle within Wiesler that alters the manner in which his spying information is reported and Wiesler's courageous deeds alter the Secret Police plans to destroy the artists' venture. The manner in which Weisler interplays with the Stasi and covers for the artists is a towering example of the dignity of the individual human soul threatened by the worst of circumstances. The results of Weisler's decisions alter with the fall of the Wall in 1989 in a deeply touching yet very subtle way.The technical aspects of this film - cinematography, pacing, lighting, editing, and the splendid musical scored my Gabriel Yared - are as fine as any film created by seasoned directors. The manner in which von Donnersmarck keeps every actor focused on the inner personality, as much by body language and silences as well as by dialogue, is astonishingly fine. This is a fascinating story, told with elegant understatement and most worthy of the Oscar for Best Foreign Film. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp",10,1,1,2 March 2007
P.S. I Love You," A Nice Little Surprise Film
","Marketing P.S. I LOVE YOU was a hit/miss situation. The general trailer and the billboards seem to set the audience up for a sappy tearjerker. But happily what happens in this film is not the expected 'widowed person communicating with the dead love out of failure to get on with life' tale, but instead a look into the importance of friendship, family, and adjusting to the incomparable loss. Credit the original novel by Cecelia Ahern as adapted for the screen by Steven Rogers writer/director Richard LaGravenese for making what so easily have been a sappy, maudlin, whining tale into a touching one of human emotions with a sense of reality mixed with a mildly implausible situation, and a series of character studies that emphasize the importance of support in the time of grief. Holly (Hilary Swank) and Gerry (Gerard Butler) Kennedy are a married couple with goals and frustrations and a huge dollop of passionate love, surrounded by friends and family. The tragedy happens just as the movie starts: Gerry has died of a brain tumor leaving the copeless Holly alone with her memories and self-inflicted regrets. But Gerry, knowing he was a terminal patient, devised his own plan to help Holly through that first year of grief: he left letters in various forms and places, advising Holly how to learn about his family and how to get on with life. Holly's mother (Kathy Bates) owns a bar and has supported her little family since Holly's father deserted his family years ago. In the bar is another injured soul named Daniel (Harry Connick Jr.) who fancies Holly but realizes she is far from ready to think about dating. Holly's friends Denise (Lisa Kudrow) and Sharon (Gina Gershon) accompany Holly to Gerry's pre-planned trip to his home in Ireland to meet the in-laws Holly never knew. While in Ireland Holly reminisces on the magic of first meeting Gerry, meets Gerry's parents as well as Gerry's best friend William (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and through it all manages to appreciate the gift of PS I Love You letters and reminders Gerry has left for her. And she ultimately finds closure to her loss. The cast is strong and makes these at times strained characters into lovable people: Hilary Swank has made a successful entrance into the feminine lead role and is balanced to perfection by Butler, Morgan, Connick, Bates, Kudrow and Gershon. They make the implausible plausible and deliver a love story that goes beyond the level of superficial to join the ranks of warm and tender memorable slices of life. It is surprisingly good!

Room," 'There are so many things out here. And sometimes it's scary. But that's OK. Because it's still just you and me...'
","Emma Donoghue adapted her popular novel ROOM for the screen so we are assured the concept it contains are the original ones from her story of a kidnapped young girl sequestered in a shed, birthing a child by her abductor, and raising that child to accept his environs as real until the two breakout of the shed and encounter the world.Or as the company who created the film states, 'ROOM tells the extraordinary story of Jack (Jacob Tremblay), a spirited 5-year-old who is looked after by his loving and devoted mother Ma (Brie Larson). Like any good mother, Ma dedicates herself to keeping Jack happy and safe, nurturing him with warmth and love and doing typical things like playing games and telling stories. Their life, however, is anything but typical-- they are trapped--confined to a 10-by-10-foot space that Ma has euphemistically named Room. Ma has created a whole universe for Jack within Room, and she will stop at nothing to ensure that, even in this treacherous environment, Jack is able to live a complete and fulfilling life. But as Jack's curiosity about their situation grows, and Ma's resilience reaches its breaking point, they enact a risky plan to escape, ultimately bringing them face-to-face with what may turn out to be the scariest thing yet: the real world.The star of the film is Jacob Tremblay. Brie Larson does a credible turn as Ma and the 'outsiders' – Ma's parents Joan Allen, William H. Macy and her kidnapper Sean Bridges – carry their weight. The film is unnecessarily long and that need for editing diminishes the extraordinary impact of Jack as he discovers the real world. If young Canadian actor Jacob Tremblay secures the right agent he could become a very important actor in the future. The story concept is excellent and carries many messages to which we should all pay heed.",8,1,3,12 March 2016
Across the Universe," 'Love is all you really need'
","Julie Taymor once again uses her considerable innovative magic to create a film that not only is mesmerizingly beautiful to watch, but also a 'semi-documentary' about the world changes that occurred in the late 1960s and early 1970s as young people for the first time spoke out against the war in Vietnam, the death of Martin Luther King, and the senseless mayhem that extended from the battlefields of Vietnam to the streets of America, all set to the significant, timely music of the Beatles. It sounds like an impossible juxtaposition of themes and ideas, but in Taymor's hands it succeeds. Opening in Liverpool, England (where the Beatles began their impact on music and thought) we met Jude (Jim Sturgess), a working class boy with the gifts of an artist who decides to set off on a sea journey to meet the father he has never known. Once in New York he meets Max (Joe Anderson) and Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood) who represent the wealthy class, but who both show roots of rebellion against the comfortable norm and an objection to the war that is festering like an abscess in the rice paddies of Vietnam. Jude meets his janitor father in a union that is anticlimactic, and in disappointment he falls in with Max, living the artists' life in the Village with free-wheeling singer Sadie (Dana Fuchs), her beau/guitarist JoJo (Martin Luther) and their newest tenant Prudence (T.V. Carpio), an Asian girl trying to find her place in a confusing world. The group eventually bond with music and rebellion mixed with free love and the passion that they can make a difference, while around them racial crises are at a peak and the draft tags many of the young men (including Max) for the war they cannot condone. From all of this turmoil the story builds to a climax leading to some very touching scenes that convey the spirit of the times and the overriding importance of love and understanding in a world torn apart by political and racial crises. The cast is strong with each of the actors singing their own versions of various Beatle songs very well (the division between singing and spoken dialect favors the former). But the real magic comes from Julie Taymor's mixture of hallucinogenic visuals, wonderfully choreographed crowd scenes, and ingenious movement from reality scenes displayed on the television to the reactive scenes of the world as viewed through the eyes of the youths and the lyrics of the songs. It is at once touching in its ability to recreate a particular period of history and wholly entertaining in the inventive use of music/dance/visual effects/drama. This film is important now and will only increase in stature as a document of that trouble but exciting time in the history of the world. We can only wonder why the youth of today are not responding to the Iraq War in a like manner, or, more uncomfortable to consider, why we now adults can't muster the same degree of distress about the myriad traumas that are still happening 'Across the Universe'.

The Mist," A Movie with Many Problems
","THE MIST has the full panorama of responses, from those who find it 'the best of the Stephen King story adaptations' to those who find it a feeble attempt to wed science fiction with biblical predictions. Frank Darabont has successfully brought King's popular horror stories to the screen with great success. For this film his gathered a substantial cast, used computer generated graphics well, but in the end the result is a confusing mishmash of story versus sermon versus actors being overwhelmed by some really strange upstaging creatures.David Drayton (Thomas Jane) is a graphic artist who manages to weather a freak storm only to discover a mysterious mist hovering over his backyard lake. Going to town with his young son to get supplies at a Food Store he joins the other townsfolk in the gossip about the mist which now engulfs the town: could it be due to some experiment at the military post lab in the mountains? The store's generator sounds like it is fumbling, and while brave David tries to fix it (mind you, in this town with no electricity, the lights in the main store remain on....), he sees the back wall buckling and hears a bizarre noise. Returning to the storefront, his findings are not believed - especially by the town psycho Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) who sees all things in relation to her channeling of God via her knowledge of the Book of Revelations, and the dubious out-of-towner Brent Norton (Andre Braugher). But gradually David gathers some sensible folk (Toby Jones, Chris Owen, et al) to accompany him to the generator room and against David's warning, the back door is opened by the young stock boy and huge tentacles enter from the mist and consume the lad. Thus we have two factions: those who side with Mrs. Carmody's religious zealot need to sacrifice people to the outdoor monsters now flying about the store and those who are convinced they must fight the offenders with force and escape. The mess of a story is further confused with overlay of father/son devotion, mass hysteria, mob rule, revenge on the military for loosing these 'other world monsters' on the public, and 'what do we do if this is the end of the earth'. How it all winds down may satisfy some and may irritate others.So why rate this film with two stars instead of one? Marcia Gay Harden gives a bravura performance as the crazy Mrs. Carmody and Toby Jones offers a solid representation of the stable man as a clerk in the store who keeps his wits about him. Thomas Jane is Thomas Jane, and for an action hero, he seems to melt with the circumstances. The movie is long, silly, not scary, and suffers from a weak script. For those who are entertained by this sort of story it may be worthwhile. For those who are fatigued by the same old line of good versus evil in the form of gooey huge monsters, pass on this film.

Stardust," More then a whiff of stardust! MAGIC!
","Films that depend heavily on special effects as created by computer generated graphics have never been too interesting for this viewer - and that, of late, covers a lot of territory from the Harry Potter series through the continuous glut of sci-fi films, vampire tales, and apocalyptic epics, etc. But there is something very different about STARDUST that brings it into a realm of solid storytelling simply enhanced by well-done special effects, and that difference is in the story itself, an unabashed fairy tale populated with wonderful characters played by some of our finest actors.And it all begins with a wall (according to the narrator, Ian McKellen) that separates the real world from an enchanted place and through that wall runs a young lad who starts the frolic. Flash forward and the child of the runaway lad, Tristan (a magnetically alive Charlie Cox), has groan to maturity and has fallen in love with the beautiful Victoria (Sienna Miller) who demands a star from Tristan to prove his love. The magic begins when that 'star' falls from the sky in the form of Yvaine (Claire Danes, radiant even without the halo that surrounds her). The foul witch Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) and her wicked sisters become aware and plan to cut out the heart of Yvaine in order to gain immortality. The little village is also under the stranglehold of the impending loss of their king (Peter O'Toole) and there is a struggle among the seven sons to ascend the throne: the seventh son Septimus (Mark Strong) defeats his now spirit brothers and sets off to gain the stone that Yvaine wears which will give him immortality. The on-the-run groups encounter a pirate, Captain Shakespeare (Robert DeNiro in a splendid role), who captures lightening in a marvelous flying ship manned by a swarthy crew. Of course Tristan and Yvaine become his 'captives', only to discover that the fey closet queen captain is on their side against the forces of evil. As the film progresses Tristan and Yvaine gradually fall in love, negating their past histories, and the ending is another act of pure magic: evil succumbs to good in the best of fairytale ways.The cast is uniformly excellent, from the true star turns by Pfeiffer, DeNiro, Danes, and Cox to the secondary roles equally well cast. The special effects are beautiful and very much in keeping with the story instead of simply breeding monsters to emerge from the bowels of the earth to destroy civilization. Everyone involved, from the director Matthew Vaughn to the writers Jane Goldman with Vaughn (and of course the creator of the novel Neil Gaiman) to the cast, seem to keep tongue in cheek and appear to be having as much fun as we the audience. It is a light, exceptionally beautiful fantasy that is pure joy! Grady Harp",10,1,1,20 December 2007
The Bourne Legacy," 'Jason Bourne was just the tip of the iceberg.'
","It is understandable that there is a difference of opinion about THE BOURNE LEGACY, but comparing it to the original three Jason Bourne movies is unfair. This is a 'legacy' left by the environment in which Jas Bourne was hatched an as such, for this reviewer, it works very well. The film is beautifully shot in superb cinematography, has a series of tight incidents that demand explanation but which get little due to the fact that this is a spy film about the various intelligence agency and occult secret scientific projects that are always in progress in every country. It is an expansion of the universe from Robert Ludlum's novels, centered on a new hero whose stakes have been triggered by the events of the previous three films.As someone distilled the plot, 'this film deals with the fall out of the exposure of 'Operation Blackbriar' and how an another agency with in the government is trying to cover up their program in order not to be caught up with the coming scandal create by Jason Bourne. 'Outcome', the program in question is an offshoot of both 'Treadstone' and 'Blackbriar' but with a huge difference, they are tabbing into science to create super agents that are faster and stronger than any other agent before them.' Suffice it to say that the new cast handles this very obtuse plot with a high degree of fine acting. Jeremy Renner is excellent, always reminding us of his humanity while he flies around in incredibly impossible flight situations. The extraordinary Rachel Weisz brings a complex role into the realm of credibility. The solid support cast includes the always excellent Edward Norton, Scott Glenn, Stacy Keach, Albert Finney, Oscar Isaac, David Strathairn, and Joan Allen just to keep the balance form the previous Bourne films in place.The speed of the action, the poundingly purposeful musical score and the non-stop fascinating twists and turns make this a top-notch film. It does carry on the 'legacy' of Ludlum's ideas, but manages to hold its own without too much replay of the originals. Grady Harp",10,75,96,12 December 2012
Unknown," 'Take back your life'
","UNKNOWN is. Many aspects of this cerebral suspense thriller are given to the audience in snippets - bits and pieces that involves the audience in keeping up with the ever-changing story line or simply throws everybody for a loop - especially the ending. Adapted from the novel 'Out of my Head' by Didier Van Cauwelaert and molded into a screenplay by Oliver Butcher and Stephen Cornwell this film needs a seasoned director to make it work: Jaume Collet-Serra isn't quite there yet. American Biotechnologist Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) arrives in Berlin with his wife Liz (January Jones) for an important world conference to unveil a newly developed failsafe corn developed by Professor Bressler (Sebastian Koch) and underwritten by Prince Shada (Mido Hamada). But once at the hotel Matin realizes he left his briefcase at the airport and while Liz checks in he grabs a taxi driven by Bosnian immigrant Gina (Diane Kruger): in an attempt to race against time the taxi is in an accident and plunges into the river - Gina escapes the underwater car and saves Martin's life. Martin is comatosed in a hospital for four days attended by Dr. Farge (Karl Markovics) and wise nurse Gretchen (Eva Löbau) and when he awakens he has memory loss: he remembers his name and begins to piece together the events that brought him to the hospital, remembering that his wife Liz may be worried about him. He leaves AMA and begins a journey that proves to be a long one - his identity has been stolen by another man who claims to be Martin (Aidan Quinn) and Liz claims she doesn't know her own husband. Without identification and desperate for answers martin finds Gina who pledges to help him, supplying Martin with the name of an ex-Stasi spy Ernst Jürgen (Bruno Ganz) who helps Martin paste together his identity. But the trouble has just begun as Martin finds himself being chased by a group of thugs (Olivier Schneider and Stipe Erceg), and Gina is helpful but in the middle of the situation with her dear colleague Biko (Clint Dyer) also in danger. Even the appearance of martins old friend Rodney Cole (Frank Langella ) doesn't aid Martin's quest for regaining his complete memory until a jarring turn of events introduces a whole new explanation for the strange plot that is so full of twists it almost sinks from its own weight. The cast is strong and Liam Neeson again proves that characters such as this fit perfectly into his charismatic macho appearance. The other reliable pros - Diane Kruger, Sebastian Koch and Bruno Ganz - add credibility to their roles and there are many relatively new faces that seem to show great promise in screen presence. Yes, there are some fine car chases and pyrotechnics, all well captured by Flavio Labiano's cinematography. The driving musical score is the work of John Ottman and Alexander Rudd. Though is a bit over long at 2 hours, it does deliver some fine entertainment. Just leave the sense of logic on the shelf for this one. Grady Harp",8,0,1,22 June 2011
Call Me by Your Name," 'Nature has cunning ways of finding our weakest spot.'
","'Nature has cunning ways of finding our weakest spot.'
The brilliant novel CAL ME BY YOUR NAME written by André Aciman in 2007 has been adapted for the screen by the inimitable James Ivory and the result is a profoundly touching film as directed by Luca Guadagnino. All aspects of the film are well served - scenery, costumes, cinematography, musical score - and delivered by a sterling cast of actors. André Aciman also has a bit part that adds to the finesse of the film.CALL ME BY YOUR NAME is a sensual and transcendent tale of first love. It's the summer of 1983 in the north of Italy, and Elio Perlman (Timothée Chalamet), a precocious 17-year-old young man, spends his days in his family's 17th century villa transcribing and playing classical music, reading, and flirting with his friend Marzia (Esther Garrel). Elio enjoys a close relationship with his father (Michael Stuhlbarg), an eminent professor specializing in Greco-Roman culture, and his mother Annella (Amira Casar), a translator, who favor him with the fruits of high culture in a setting that overflows with natural delights. While Elio's sophistication and intellectual gifts suggest he is already a fully-fledged adult, there is much that yet remains innocent and unformed about him, particularly about matters of the heart. One day, Oliver (Armie Hammer), a 24-year-old American college graduate student working on his doctorate, arrives as the annual summer intern tasked with helping Elio's father. Amid the sun-drenched splendor of the setting, Elio and Oliver discover the heady beauty of awakening desire over the course of a summer that will alter their lives forever.In addition to a delicately rendered first love story, the interaction between Elio and his parents (especially the very special father/son relationship) adds depth to the story. The splendor of the foods prepared by Mafalda (Vanda Capriolo), the discovery of lost Praxiteles sculpture in the lake, the visits to the swimming hole, the visit by an elderly gay couple Isaac (Peter Spears) and Mounir (André Aciman) - make this a cherishable film. Or in Elio's father's words, 'How you live your life is your business, just remember, our hearts and our bodies are given to us only once. And before you know it, your heart is worn out, and, as for your body, there comes a point when no one looks at it, much less wants to come near it. Right now, there's sorrow, pain. Don't kill it and with it the joy you've felt.'",10,1,4,15 March 2018
Gran Torino," The Seeds of Racism and Self Loathing Implanted by War
","Few films have been able to translate an aspect that war can have on surviving veterans - that aspect being the embedded hate for 'the enemy' that dominates the world view of those who have had to fight in the battlefields, a hate that too easily translates into generalized racism that persists throughout the life of the veteran. GRAN TORINO takes on this ugly issue and works it with such compelling force that just when the audience feels is cannot tolerate any more racial slurs a transformation takes place, opening a window to understanding and perhaps altering the poison of racism's effects on our American Family. GRAN TORINO as written by Nick Schenk and Dave Johanson and as produced, directed and acted by Clint Eastwood is not a film easy to hear or watch in its early portions. Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is burying his wife, only to return to his long term home in a neighborhood that has become a sanctuary for Hmong people (an ethnic group from the mountain regions of Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and Burma who supported US troops and were evacuated to the US after the Vietnam conflict). Kowalski is a prejudiced bigot who loathes the presence of the (unnamable epithets) neighbors. Next door is a family that includes a young loner boy Thao (Bee Vang) and his worldly sister Sue (Ahney Her) - two young people caught up in the Hmong world where the girls go to school and become employed and the boys go to jail. Kowalski reluctantly befriends a gang threatened Thao and the neighborhood rewards him with endless gifts of flowers and food. Gradually an event secures Kowalski's attachment to Thao and Kowalski grows to understand and respect 'the enemy' - people who are genuinely kind and loving despite Kowalski's personality and lonely bitter veteran's life. The transformation of Walt Kowalski as played by Eastwood is genuinely touching and the way in which the movie ends is surprisingly sophisticated. There are moments in this bumpy script that are so trite and repetitive and stereotyped that the film becomes almost unwatchable. But it is to the credit of the cast and Eastwood's direction that eventually the repeated verbal slurs of racial hatred make the resolution of the film even more powerful. There are many lessons to be learned by listening and watching this film, not the least of which is insight into the psyches of war veterans from all wars. Grady Harp",10,1,8,13 June 2009
The Hurt Locker," The Most Powerful Film About Men in Wars
","THE HURT LOCKER is not an easy film to watch, especially for veterans. It may be about the Iraq War circa 2004, but it is essentially about WAR in general and the devastation created by this most foolish of human games not only on the countrymen of the site of the killing but also on the soldiers from all countries who bond to fight the 'enemy': as Pogo said in a long ago war 'We have met the enemy and he is us'. Kathryn Bigelow has accomplished the unthinkable - she has created a small, tense, breathless re-enactment of a group of men (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) whose sense of mission and sense of family and disillusion are as fragile as the homemade human and other bombs they render safe. In a minimal but terse script by Mark Boal the words are less important than the expressions on the actors faces, and with a cast as fine as this, those statements are more powerful than words. The scene is Baghdad in 2004 and we watch as an EOD specialist Thompson (Guy Pierce), a man for whom the group - namely Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) - has profound respect and love, is blown up in the first minutes of the film. Thompson is replaced by an obsessed EOD specialist with a record of over 800 bombs rendered safe, one William James (Jeremy Renner) who keeps his mementos of wasted bombs in his 'hurt locker' under his bed. The film deals with the gradual adjustment of the men to this new, obsessed EOD man as the group faces horrendous encounters with the Iraqis, both adults and children. There are surprise cameos by David Morse and by Ralph Fiennes, but they don't last long as characters. What lasts is the interdependency among the men locked into a mission more terrifying than can be imagined. Jeremy Renner delivers a finely nuanced performance of a man whose adrenaline rush with his job makes him a unique sort of being, yet a man who is capable of the most tender of responses. Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty are also superb in roles that in other actors' hands may have become trite. This is an important film for all of us to see - especially now, as war escalates over the globe. Kathryn Bigelow deserves the Oscar for bringing this stunning event to the screen.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," 'Here's an idea, how about a good old-fashioned stoning? I'd kill to be stoned right now!'
","The seemingly endless series of the Johnny Depp films PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN seems to be coming to an end with this 5th installment. For fourteen years this tale has been on screen, television, video games, Halloween costumes etc and this latest version – DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES – seems to have a prescient subtitle! The story is more reflective this time round (we see the initial seeds for the series as we face the past), most of the cast members remain (if only for a brief moment for some like Kiera Knightly and Orlando Bloom), some fresh actors enter (such as the very welcome Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario), the mainstay actors remain (Johnny Depp, Javier Bardem, Geoffrey Rush et al), and the newest aspect is the increasing imposing use of CGI graphics. But on to the story as written by Jeff Nathanson based on characters created by Terry Rossio, Ted Elliot, Stuart Beattie and Jay Wolpert and directed by Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) searches for the trident of Poseidon while being pursued by an undead sea captain Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem) and his crew and finds the winds of ill-fortune blowing even more strongly when deadly ghost pirates led by his old nemesis (Captain Salazar) escape from the Devil's Triangle, determined to kill every pirate at sea...including him. Captain Jack's only hope of survival lies in seeking out the legendary Trident of Poseidon, a powerful artifact that bestows upon its possessor total control over the seas.Oh, there is more detail to the tale and the actors employed are excellent. Nigel Phelps designed the production, Paul Cameron is in charge of cinematography and the musical score is by Geoff Zanelli. The movie is a bit long in tooth (a slow excess of two hour) and for the most part the CGI effects are the stars, but for those addicted to the Pirates series this final (hopefully) version will satisfy. For others it is a visual hallucinatory delight.",7,0,1,10 December 2017
Ex Machina," 'The good deeds a man has done defends him.'
","'If you've created a conscious machine, it's not the history of man. That's the history of gods.' 'One day the AIs are going to look back on us the same way we look at fossil skeletons on the plains of Africa... an upright ape living in dust with crude language and tools, all set for extinction.' Ava's brain is 'Impulse. Response. Fluid. Imperfect. Patterned. Chaotic.' These are but a few of the thoughts that float through this atmospheric, intelligent, beautifully written EX MACHINA - the jewel in the crown of meaningful films this year written and directed by Alex Garland.Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) a 26 year old internet programmer and coder at the world's largest internet company BlueBook, wins a competition to spend a week at a private mountain retreat belonging to Nathan (Oscar Isaac), the reclusive CEO of the company. But when Caleb arrives at the remote location he finds that he will have to participate in a strange and fascinating experiment in which he must interact with the world's first true artificial intelligence, housed in the body of a beautiful robot girl named Ava (Alicia Vikander) - 'The Turing Test' - the test to determine if a machine can genuinely pass itself off as human to another human.'To share more would deprive the viewer form the many discoveries of this very smart film. Each of the actors is in top form and the result is that we actually suspend disbelief about the entire science of Artificial Intelligence and the future of the already present robots. This is not a sci-fi movie – this is a look into the future, and much of it is exciting as well as terrifying. Highly recommended for a very large audience base.",10,3,7,1 January 2016
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," The Saga Pokes Along
","For lovers of THE TWILIGHT SERIES the second installment NEW MOON should satisfy. It apparently follows the Stephenie Meyer novel fairly well and certainly has more to look at than the first installment. For lovers of teeny bopper films, vampire and werewolf legends, and sappy highsschool romance this installment will provide many pleasures. For the rest of us it is passable entertainment.Chris Weitz succeeds in making the impossible story lines move seamlessly, and while the majority of Melissa Rosenberg's script sounds like highschool lunchtime chatter, the story of Bella (Kristin Stewart) falling in love with Edward the vampire (Robert Pattinson)only to be deserted and then protected by the apparently normal American Indian Jacob (the very buff and studly Taylor Lautner) who turns out to be a werewolf....it goes on and on until there is finally a confrontation between vampires and vampires and vampires and werewolves that provides a semblance of an ending. Part three is coming soon.The scenery in Washington State is nice and the musical score is pretty. The acting is bland as is the chemistry between Bella and Edward and Bella and Jacob. But then this film is not meant to be challenging - just entertaining. And it is.Grady Harp",5,0,3,22 March 2010
The Illusionist," A Well-Crafted, Well-Acted Atmospheric La Belle Epoque Viennese Mystery
","Steven Millhauser's brilliant little short story 'Eisenheim the Illusionist' is beautifully realized cinematically by Neil Burger who not only adapted the story as a screenplay but also directed with a great flair for the subject. Wisely using the repeated line 'Nothing is what it seems' Burger infuses this dark investigation into the lives of the divided Viennese classes and suggests the crumbling of the Austro-Hungarian Empire with the focus on the illusory magic of one Eisenheim (finely characterized by Edward Norton) and its effects on the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) and the bifurcated Duchess Sophie (Jessica Biel).As children Eisenheim and Sophie were friends despite the disparity of their class: Sophie was royalty (a Duchess) and Eisenheim was the son of a cabinetmaker to the court. They fall in love but are separated by caste and Eisenheim wanders Asia and Russia learning the vagaries of magic and illusionist tricks while Sophie is raised at court to become the wife of Crown Prince Leopold, whose plans to overthrow his father the Emperor to become the King of both Austria and Hungary have made him an obsessive scoundrel.Years later Eisenheim enters Vienna as a showman, under the tutelage of his impresario Josef Fischer (Eddie Marsan), delighting audiences with his illusionist tricks. His impossible love for Sophie resurfaces and he becomes suspect in his role as an illusionist and as a threat tot he Crown. Eisenheim is investigated carefully by Chief Police Inspector Uhl (a brilliant role by Paul Giamatti) and the manner in which the fates of the Crown versus the love of Eisenheim and Sophie are resolved is, well, 'Nothing is what it seems'.The cast is outstanding, the setting (in Prague) is incredibly atmospheric, and the costuming and lighting and cinematography marry into a perfect fit. Adding to the illusionist spirit of the film is the fine musical score by Phillip Glass so well loved for his score for 'The Hours' and one of our most important classical music composers of the day. THE ILLUSIONIST is a fine, misty, dark evocation of life in La Belle Époque of Vienna, based enough on fact that the fiction employs the concept that nothing is what it seems.

Hidden Figures," 'Despite what you may think, I have nothing against y'all.' 'I know, I know you probably believe that.'
","Writers Allison Schroeder and Theodore Melfi have adapted Margot Lee Shetterly's book 'Hidden Figures: The Story of the African-American Women Who Helped Win the Space Race ' for the screen and as directed by Theodore Melfi and a superlative cast, this film makes a major difference in the way both the space program and the ingenuity and intelligence of black women in the early days of NASA will now be forever viewed. It is a thrillingly believable film about the significance of black women producing miracles at NASA during the height of racial struggle. The time is 1961, JFK was president, Martin Luther King Jr. was the man of attention in civil rights, and the rush to hurdle a man into space was central to America's thinking and desire. As the United States raced against Russia to put a man in space, NASA found untapped talent in a group of African-American female mathematicians that served as the brains behind one of the greatest operations in U.S. history. Based on the unbelievably true life stories of three of these women, known as 'human computers', we follow these women as they quickly rose the ranks of NASA alongside many of history's greatest minds specifically tasked by Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) with calculating the momentous launch of astronaut John Glenn (Glen Powell) into orbit, and guaranteeing his safe return. Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe), and Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) crossed all gender, race, and professional lines while their brilliance and desire to dream big, beyond anything ever accomplished before by the human race, firmly cemented them in U.S. history as true American heroes. The men in the picture include Jim Parsons (thankfully stepping out of his Big Bang character), Mahershala Ali, Aldis Hodge, as well as the white women in positions of power – Kirsten Dunst, Kimberly Quinn – all offer solid support. But this is a film about a time of transition in so many arenas, and visiting the realities of colored bathrooms, prejudice, and the fierce competition with Russia are well to remember. The film is not with out flaws (the musical score is not at all form the period, though is sounds well) and there is a little too much time spent on the social lives of these extraordinary women, but it is a film everyone should see – it is just that important to realize the major role black women played in the beginning of computers and the space program.",9,4,10,15 April 2017
Lincoln," 'No one is loved as much as you by the people. Don't waste that power.'
","LINCOLN is one of those films that defies anyone to say anything negative about it. It seems that Steven Spielberg joining hands with the national hero Abraham Lincoln and the racial equality issue is a sacred marriage and to offer dissident views of the film as a film approaches sacrilege.The film is basically the last four months of Abraham Lincoln's life and the manner in which he struggled to end the war and pass the Thirteenth Amendment abolishing slavery only to be assassinated at Ford's theater For this viewer the strongest aspect of the film is Tony Kushner's magnificent script, a script that places words befitting the times in the mouths of the men and women surrounding the final days of the war and the contentious governmental debate about slavery. It is pungent, poetic, inspiring, both raw and refined, and captures an era and a time in this country's history that will be difficult to match.Yes, the cast is strong - massively collected from among some of the finest actors in film today. Everyone has crowned the head of Daniel Day-Lewis for his portrayal of Lincoln and Sally Fields as his borderline adjusted wife Mary and Tommy Lee Jones as the acerbic and convincingly committed Thaddeus Stevens, but the others in the cast deserve listing: David Strathairn, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader, Hal Holbrook, Robert Latham, Bruce McGill, Tim Blake Nelson, Lee Pace, Boris McGiver, David Costabile, Stephen Spinella, Colman Domingo, David Oyelowo, Lukas Haas and on and on.The battle scenes are as atrocious as war is atrocious and the lighting and camera work throughout the film capture that dark period in our history magnificently. Doubtless the film will always be regarded as perfect, but for some it is overly long, occasionally pretentious, at times trying - but always rescued by Tony Kushner's fine screenplay adaptation of Doris Kearns Goodwin's novel 'Team of Rivals'.

Children of Men," One of the Most Important Films in Recent Years
","CHILDREN OF MEN is a masterpiece of cinematic artistry. Director Alfonso Cuarón, using a screenplay he co-wrote with Timothy J. Sexton, has done what few artists have been able to achieve before - create an apocalyptic experience that is almost devoid of extraneous material meant to terrify the audience and focused the worst of unthinkable events into a personal story about a few people. Oh, the global destruction and masses of dead humanity are not kept from our eyes, but instead Cuarón uses these horrid images as a background for a story about the changes than can occur in each of us when our souls and lives are challenged by extinction.The story is set in 2027 and the only country that has survived some unnamed disaster is England (importantly, the only country without a constitution, maintaining its governance on history). The landscape is bleak, twisted, filthy and holds scattered cages of fugitives (immigrants from the countries no longer in existence): it is difficult to decide which is better, being dead or living in this heinous mess of a wasted world. Society is on the brink of extinction as the people are infertile and the youngest living person has just died. We meet Theo Faron (Clive Owen), a drunken bored disillusioned detritus of a man whose early years were alive with political activism. He loathes his meaningless job and he is bitter and utterly disillusioned and emotionally numb. A group called 'Angels' is lead by Julian Taylor (Julianne Moore), Theo's former significant other with whom he had a child that died of influenza, and Luke (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and their work is the protection of immigrants as well as transporting a young black girl Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) who happens to be pregnant(!) to a sea spot where Human Project will aid her in propagating a new society. Julian has Theo captured (he is the only man she can truly trust) to handle the safe transportation of Kee to the Human Project.Theo at first refuses to absorb this new direction but incidents occur which change his mind: he receives sound advice and encouragement from an old hippie friend Jasper (Michael Caine) and the trek begins. The bond between Kee and Theo is an increasingly strong one and as they follow directions that are in code they gradually discover the incentives of various people to follow the eventual birth of the first child to be born in eighteen years. The trip is harrowing, suspenseful, filled with psychological and philosophical implications, and the ending of this tale occurs in the foggy mists of the sea aboard a tiny boat - a place that has no roots.Clive Owen is mesmerizing in this tough role and his support from Moore, Caine, Ejiofor, Ashitey, as well as smaller roles played by such fine actors as Charlie Hunnam, Pam Ferris, Danny Huston, Peter Mullan, Oana Pellea and Jacek Koman to mention only a few is on the highest level. The cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is miraculous, capturing a strange world that seems very real yet not absurdly over the edge. Classical composer John Tavener (with help from Mahler, Penderecki, and others) finds just the right balance between old folk songs, contemporary requiem moments and excerpts from popular music of the past to mold a fascinating musical score: it works! Some may avoid this film because of the apparent disturbing content, but for this viewer this film speaks so cogently to the matters we should all heed to help reverse some of the destruction we have done to our world that it would be hard to imagine this film not changing people's views on immigration as an example of how confused is our sense of humanity, and that is only one issue before us. CHILDREN OF MEN is an instant classic, whether we like it or not. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp",10,8,17,29 March 2007
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Gruesome Grueling Intrigue, Swedish Style
","Perhaps it is the current need to see that evil eventually consumes itself that make films like THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO (AKA 'Män som hatar kvinnor') so successful. Or it may be the posthumous fame given Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy (from which this film is 'Millennium: Part 1 - Men Who Hate Women') that has prepared an audience of believers. Whatever the reason this first installment (the other two installments have already been filmed and are ready for release) is being hailed as an epic masterpiece, a film that will go down in cinematic history as a classic. And for that reason you may want to see this current long exploration of the evil of man. But is it a masterpiece.....? Nikolaj Arcel and Rasmus Heisterberg adapted this book for the screen and the script is interpreted by director Niels Arden Oplev who has cast the many characters of the story with some excellent Swedish actors. By the end of this multi-twisted tale we are left satisfied with the balance of good over evil - or are we? After all we're only part way there and, as in the BOURNE SERIES in this country, subsequent parts to the story become only more bizarre - and exciting. At any rate, the story in brief deals with an investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) whose apparent loss of a case of libel against a wealthy corrupt corporate group results in his being chosen by an elderly but mentally vigorous gentleman Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube) to investigate a long buried case of the apparent murder of his niece -a deed Vanger is convinced is associated with his disgustingly morally corrupt family. Blomkvist is fascinated and begins his tedious examination of film and facts that seem to add clues as to the mystery surrounding Harriet Vanger's disappearance. Enter a punk rock appearing, pierced and tattooed young girl Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Repace) who ends up assisting Blomkvist in solving the conundrum. After some rather confusing bits of replay of Lisbeth's past and the revelation of her current situation with a guardian assigned to control her after her recent discharge from an institution, we are allowed to watch the discovery of 40 years of serial killings of young girls: the fact that they are all Jewish and that Vanger's family contains a number of ex-Nazis boils the pot. Much gore, visual exposure to violence and the results of violence flood the screen as the eventual discovery of the true history of Harriet Vanger is uncovered. The film is two and a half hours long but seems much shorter because of the rapid fire sequencing by the director. Much praise has been heaped on Noomi Repace as Lisbeth and while she performs well, and looks bizarre, one wonders why all the hoopla. This is a good film of its kind, very well transforming a book into cinematic excess, and for those who crave gore and acts of depravity it will probably please. For film goers who prefer thinking to raw action this may not be the choice of a film du jour. In Swedish with subtitles and with English dubbing. Grady Harp",7,1,2,23 July 2010
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," A Powerful Film That Pleads for a Return to Meaningful Journalism
","GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK is a brilliant piece of film making, a film that recreates a period in our history when gossip mongers and fear exploiters took the lead for a terrifying few years that threatened to extinguish civil rights forever. Not unlike now! And that is one reason this film carries so much resonance: the story of the bravery of popular news reporter Edward R. Morrow (David Strathairn) and his associates Fred Friendly (George Clooney), Joe and Shirley Wershba (Robert Downey, Jr. and Patricia Clarkson), William Paley (Frank Langella) and the crew at CBS is one that begs for re-creation in the way the news is reported, analyzed, and serves the rights of the public to be truly informed.The story is the 1950s McCarthyism Communist Hunting that terrified the country unchecked until Morrow et al challenged the Senator's accusations and methodology by simply quoting the statements McCarthy made in the television series See It Now. Morrow and his associates did not elect to smear McCarthy: they instead elected to bring to the public's quivering attention just what the sick mind of McCarthy was doing to innocent people. It was an act of bravery on Morrow's part and on the part of everyone connected with See It Now.George Clooney continues to impress as a quiet, subtle voice who doesn't seek the limelight for his brilliant mind, but rather uses it to enter the arena of emerging patriots - the good kind. He wrote the script with Grant Heslov after much research and investigation and then gathered a gifted crew of actors (including himself) and directed the film using the atmosphere of black and white photography (credit cinematographer Robert Elswit) in the almost exclusively interior claustrophobic set of the television station to give the ring of honesty that pulsates this story to its powerful end. Strathairn is brilliant as Morrow, but then so are all the cast members in this ensemble effort.GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK is an immensely entertaining film on every level, but the fact that it is released in such a realistic fashion at this particular time in the nation's precarious history makes it a film that should be seen by everyone. The DVD added commentary by not only the writers and actors but also the people still living and the children of those who aren't is informative and sensitively poignant. Lightning can strike in the same place twice. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp",10,2,4,15 March 2006
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," The Wisdom of Children
","THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS is a 'compleat' motion picture: even the title states the vision of the film in a subtly powerful way. Based on the excellent novel by John Boyne and adapted for the screen by director Mark Herman, this film has the courage to re-visit the Holocaust from the child's perspective. Not that it covers up the atrocities of that horrid event and time - quite the opposite: in electing to examine that period in history the stance is that of two children, one German son of an officer in Hitler's armed forces and one son of a Jewish captive living with his father in a concentration camp. The juxtaposition of these two eight year old boys separated not only by a fence but by an ideology neither of them can fathom the other's side makes for not only a brilliant film but also an unforgettable emotional experience. Bruno (Asa Butterfield in an extraordinary performance) is eight, his sister Gretel (Amber Beattie) is twelve and the two live with their parents in 1940 Berlin - father (David Thewlis) is a Komandant in Hitler's army and mother (Vera Farminga) is a popular socialite and loving mother. Father is 'promoted' and will be in charge of a new 'position' that means moving from their beautiful Berlin home to a 'home in the country'. Though Bruno doesn't want to leave his friends the family does indeed move - to a cold house next to what Bruno perceives is a farm. The father is forbidden to share his role and the meaning of it with his family, but it soon becomes obvious by the smoke stacks spewing hideously smelling odors into the atmosphere that the 'farm' is a concentration camp. The house servant Pavel (David Hayman), though abused by the father, becomes Bruno's friend when Bruno sustains an injury: Pavel quietly admits to Bruno that despite his 'pajama' uniform from the 'farm' that he practiced medicine in the past. Bored, Bruno explores the forbidden area outside his home confines and finds a barbed wire electrified fence behind which sits Shmuel (Jack Scanlon) who becomes Bruno's friend. Neither lad understands the differences between them until Shmuel is sent into Bruno's household to polish glasses for a party: the armed forces chauffeur Lieutenant Kotler (Rupert Friend) beats the 'little filthy Jew' for eating pastries Bruno has shared with him - a fact that the terrified Bruno denies. The mother discovers the truth about the 'farm' and the smoke stacks and sinks into a depression, loathing that her husband is in charge of such atrocities. Gretel becomes transformed as a Hitler youth under the influence of the children's tutor (Jim Norton) and there are obvious philosophical schisms in the family. Bruno, regretting his treatment of Shmuel, continues to sneak food to him and plans to help his young friend save Shmuel's father: Bruno digs into the 'farm' and the results bring the film to a terrifying and abrupt end. Both young actors give enormously moving performances and the manner in which Herman directs the action underlines the blur of perception many German's had about the reality of the Final Solution. But for what this viewer perceives as the reason the film sustains the powerful message it does is the manner in which it ends. There are no attempts to 'sanitize' this film: it simply ends with a lightning bolt jolt that is one of the most powerful statements in all of the many films about the Holocaust. It is simply a brilliant masterpiece of a movie from every aspect of judging it - acting, direction, music, cinematography, editing - and why this film failed to make an impression on the critics and public (and the Oscar folks!) when it was released in the theaters remains a conundrum. Highly recommended for all audiences. Grady Harp",10,2,3,15 March 2009
The Imitation Game," 'Sometimes it is the people who no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.'
","THE IMITATION GAME is brilliant on so many levels that to single out peaks is frustrating. Fist the actual history recreated by the film is brilliant. The book by Andrew Hodges who joined Graham Moore in a the intensely intelligent screenplay, the direction and weaving in and out of clips from WW II with the tension of creativity meeting science meeting personal issues by Morton Tyldum is exceptional, the courage by all involved to share the homophobia of England during this period of time and the eventual suicide of the genius who solved the Enigma due to his 'crime' of being homosexual, and last the cast – all spot on and terrific. The startling fact is that this is a true story. Mathematician cryptanalyst Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) is in the nail-biting race against time by Turing and his brilliant team of code- breakers (Keira Knightley, Allen Leach, Matthew Goode, Matthew Beard) at Britain's top-secret Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, during the darkest days of World War II. All of the characters are well cast – a group that includes Rory Kinnear (particularly poignant as the detective), Charles Dance, Mark Strong, et al. Add to that the musical score by Aleandre Desplat and the cinematography of Oscar Faura and the costume design by Sammy Sheldon and there are still others that make this exceptional film so fine. By all means see this movie.",10,3,7,1 April 2015
The Last Emperor," 'The Americans believe everyone is born good. You must be judged.'
","Bernardo Bertolucci's 1987 extravaganza THE LAST EMPEROR is rich in spectacle, costumes, cinematography, massive crowd scenes, and history, and yet for all its grandeur some of the most touching moments are form the language of eyes, simple words of a child, and especially worlds form the teacher RJ Johnston - 'The Emperor has been a prisoner in his own palace since the day that he was crowned, and has remained a prisoner since he abdicated. But now he's growing up, he may wonder why he's the only person in China who may not walk out of his own front door. I think the Emperor is the loneliest boy on Earth.' And 'Words are important. Pu Yi, at 15: Why are words important? RJ Johnson 'If you cannot say what you mean, your majesty, you will never mean what you say and a gentleman should always mean what he says.'Re-visiting THE LAST EMPEROR 30 years after the film was made is a refreshing experience. Yes, the costumes are grand, the mass scenes are impressive, the music (the Chinese music - not the indulgent American music of the period) is special, the cast is solid, but the impressive aspect of the film is the opportunity to re-visit history in this manner. Especially, today when we are constantly reminded of China's influence in global affairs, it is interesting to recap how that country went from being ruled by a child emperor to the influx of Japan and the wars and the destruction of many of the most beautiful antiquities of China, and became the Republic of China.John Lone is especially well suited as Pu-Yi as an adult as is Peter O'Toole as his teacher RJ Johnson. As one observer noted, 'This sweeping account of the life of Pu-Yi, the last emperor of China, follows the leader's tumultuous reign. After being captured by the Red Army as a war criminal in 1950, Pu-Yi recalls his childhood from prison. He remembers his lavish youth in the Forbidden City, where he was afforded every luxury but unfortunately sheltered from the outside world and complex political situation surrounding him. As revolution sweeps through China, the world Pu-Yi knew is dramatically upended.'This is a film to visit again and again - for so many reasons.",10,0,0,2 September 2018
Clash of the Titans," A Cadre of Fine Actors on a Silly Spree
","CLASH OF THE TITANS was perhaps more entertaining as a 3D movie in theaters than it is on the small screen of the home television where the CGI effects are less impressive and at times downright silly. Louis Leterrier directed this remake of the 1981 Olivier/Hamlin epic based on Beverley Cross's take on the struggle for power between the Greek Gods and mankind: this time around the myth is manipulated by Travis Beacham, Phil Hay, and Matt Manfredi who have managed to create dialogue that must have been embarrassing for the actors to speak. The gods are either surrounded by blinding light or smog-on-a-bad-day smoke and the presence of the creatures of the very mixed up version of the myth range form beautiful Pegasus (flying horses) to a voluptuous Medusa to the bigger than life scorpions and devilish gods to the Kraken who probably wins the contest for most disgusting beastie - though the competition is tough! The story is basically an attempt of Zeus and the gods on Olympus to restore their tainted reputation as being adored and worshiped through the wiles of Perseus who is thwarted by a long standing sibling rivalry victim Hades in Perseus' travels to kill the Medusa and the supposedly indestructible Kraken. It is a tale of men versus kings versus gods versus good and evil. The very odd aspect of this dark film is the fact that of many of the cast are among the finest actors on the screen. Some are minor actors (Sam Worthington plays Sam Worthington who is placed complete with burr cut in the role of Perseus), but others include Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Hans Matheson, Danny Huston, Nicholas Hoult, the departed Pete Postlethwaite, Mads Mikkelsen (the strongest in the cast), a very chubby Polly Walker, Elizabeth McGovern, Gemma Arterton - the list goes on and on. Having never seen the original 1981 Clash of the Titans makes comparison impossible, but if the purpose for making this over the edge movie was to test contemporary 3D techniques it probably succeeds. As for the acting and the script - this film is merely a chuckle. Grady Harp",3,2,2,17 April 2011
The Adjustment Bureau," Love and Free Will and Destiny
","Philip K. Dick ((December 16, 1928 - March 2, 1982) grows more popular as a writer in contemporary culture than he was during his lifetime. He typically focused on the fragile nature of what is 'real' and the construction of personal identity. His stories often become surreal fantasies as the main characters slowly discover that their everyday world is actually an illusion constructed by powerful external entities, vast political conspiracies, or simply from the vicissitudes of an unreliable narrator. All of his work starts with the basic assumption that there cannot be one, single, objective reality. Everything is a matter of perception. The ground is liable to shift under your feet. A protagonist may find himself living out another person's dream, or he may enter a drug-induced state that actually makes better sense than the real world, or he may cross into a different universe completely.' Given this background information about the origin of the idea of THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU, the story adapted for the screen from Dick's 'Adjustment Team' by writer/director George Nolfi (The Bourne series, Ocean's twelve, etc), offers a new appreciation for this well-timed suspense thriller love story - 'Love' being the operative word. David Norris (Matt Damon) is running for New York Senator guided by the counsel of his friend and campaign manager Charlie (Michael Kelly) and they seem to be on a wining track. David meets the very beautiful dancer Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt) in the strangest of circumstances and their attraction, peppered with very fine comic repartee, is immediately apparently. Past faux pas of David's appear in the media and his chances of winning the election seem to be diminishing. At this point David meets some hatted gentlemen - Richardson (John Slattery) and Harry Mitchell (Anthony Mackie) - who represent the adjustment bureau, a group of men who follow the life plan set by the Chairman to keep people in line with their intended destinies. David is instructed to never see Elise again as she is not part of his planned life (a career that despite setbacks is supposed to eventually lead to the Presidency of the US). From this point on it becomes a challenge for David to either obey the adjustment team or follow his heart and be with Emily. After a separation of three years David sees Elise again and the fire of love burns even more brightly. David is warned that if he follows his heart (his free will) he not only will not become the man of his career dreams but that he will also destroy Elise's assigned future of becoming the world's most honored dancer/choreographer. Which drives succeed and how they happen is a wild chase by David and Elise to run toward their own free will through mazes and secret passages and strange situations a s devised by Richardson, aided by Harry, and controlled by Richardson's replacement, Thompson (Terrance Stamp). It is a struggle between destiny and free will. There is a fine line in Philip K. Dick's story ideas that teeters between the credible and the pure sci-fi direction. In this film the midline is found and the reason the strange story succeeds so well is due in great part to the extraordinary on-screen chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt, two actors who continue to grow in stature, having that ability to pull off sophisticated comedy with action packed suspense. The entire cast is excellent and seems to be responsive to the well-conceived direction of George Nolfi. THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU is first and foremost a love story, and a very fine one at that. In order to completely appreciate this film the audience must relax and go along with Dick's ideas - then it all seems very right! Grady Harp",8,3,4,24 June 2011
World Trade Center," Oliver Stone's Version of 9/11: Reductionism Attempt to Make it Personal
","Oliver Stone has always been a director of grit, one who was unafraid to take on controversial subjects and create powerful films that opened the audience's eyes to the mire below the surface. In WORLD TRADE CENTER he seems to have taken the opposite stance: take an historic tragedy that affected the entire world and reduce it sown to the entrapment of two Port Authority Police Officers in the rubble of the midline of the two towers destruction in hopes that the event might become more intimate. He manages to just the opposite - he makes a huge horrific tragedy seem like a family crisis and despite casting some fine actors in the roles of actual people, the film falls short of communicating the bigger picture.The film starts well enough with two of the policemen rising early in the Am to go to routine duty, then the unrecognizable 'bump' sound occurs and quite to everyone's disbelief the events of that terrible day unfold in a manner that does indeed convey the complete surprise of a nation of people unfamiliar with terror happening on home ground. The Port Authority Police enter the impending collapse of the towers to save victims only to become quickly trapped in the rubble, reducing their ranks to two men who hold on for survival that finally comes.Nicholas Cage is the sergeant John McLoughlin who is trapped with Will Jimeno (Michael Peña) while John's wife Donna (Maria Bello) and Will's pregnant wife Allison (Maggie Gyllenhaal) cope with the news of the day and the discovery that their husbands are trapped in the rubble. The long movie is a back and forth interplay between the trapped men and the terror of the families. Where Stone drops his credibility is in focusing on a retired Marine Staff Sergeant Dave Karnes (Michael Shannon) who upon hearing of the disaster gets a marine haircut and travels to the spot looking for survivors at night, eventually discovering John and Will and getting help for them to be rescued. That is all well and good, but the film adds the tag line 'We'll avenge the terrorists who did this' that seems like a credo for the irresponsible governmental attack on Iraq. It just takes away the film's energy and makes it a political PR piece. And that is too bad: the other film UNITED 93 is a far superior work in depicting the personal aspect of a national tragedy.

Prisoners," 'We are all just prisoners here, of our own device.'
","Director Denis Villeneuve shocked us with his masterful 'Incendies' and he does it again with this intensely suspenseful highly polished drama PRISONERS written by Aaron Guzikowski. Though the film is quite long (153 minutes) the tension is sustained making the viewer not so much an observer but a member of this funky little cold town where so much evil happens.The time is the present (the location shooting was Georgia but any small town across the country could well substitute), it is Thanksgiving and two close families are gathered in their neighborhood for the feast; the Dovers – father Keller (Hugh Jackman, mother Grace (Maria Bello), daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimovich) and son Ralph (Dylan Minnette) and the Birches – father Franklin (Terrence Howard), mother Nancy (Viola Davis), daughters Eliza (Zoe Borde) and Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons). Joy and Anna disappear and panic strikes. The only lead is a dilapidated RV that had earlier been parked on their street. Heading the investigation, Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) arrests its driver, Alex Jones (Paul Dano), but a lack of evidence forces his release. As the police pursue multiple leads and pressure mounts, knowing his child's life is at stake the frantic Keller Dover decides he has no choice but to take matters into his own hands. His methods involve capturing and torturing Alex with Franklin's help, but neither is sure of the outcome of their interrogation. Twists and turns occur involving a drunken sicko priest (Len Cariou) and the aunt/mother of Alex (Melissa Leo) – both leading to very surprising endings.The cast is as first rate as they come. Everyone is strong by Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are brilliant. Viola Davis, Melissa Leo, and Maria Bello involve with their usual excellent acting abilities. But in the end credit must go to director Denis Villeneuve for his superb sculpting of this terrifying film. Highly recommended. Grady Harp",10,1,2,19 December 2013
Silence," There's a saying in here: 'Mountains and rivers can be moved but men's nature cannot be moved'
","Martin Scorsese (The Departed, The Wolf of Wall Street, Shutter Island, Gangs of New York, The Aviator, Goodfellas) together with his frequent collaborating author Jay Cocks adapted the novel by Shûsaku Endô - and few stories could be less suggestive of Scorsese than SILENCE. It is a very long film that explores faith and Catholicism in Japan in the 17th century, a time when being a Christian was punished by torture and death. The film has moments but for the most part it moves very slowly between torture scenes and hiding from the Buddhist forces who desire to cleanse Japan of Catholicism.The setting opens in 1633 Japan as Portuguese Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) is writing a letter. Then the film jumps to 1637. Two Portuguese Jesuits, Father Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Father Garupe (Adam Driver) listen as Father Valignano (Ciarán Hinds) reads the letter, which is said to be the last known writing from their mentor, Father Ferreira. Valignano says that Ferreira eventually apostatized to avoid being tortured and now lives in Japan in an arranged marriage. The two Portuguese priests do not believe this because Father Ferreira was their mentor and a committed believer of Christianity and a powerful influence on everyone he knew. They were going to be dispatched to find Ferreira, but with this message, the task seems complete. However, Rodrigues and Garupe beg permission to go to Japan to find out the truth about Father Ferreira and clear his name. Valignano reluctantly allows them to go. Rodrigues and Garupe face the ultimate test of faith when they travel to Japan in search of their missing mentor at a time when Catholicism was outlawed and their presence forbidden. They are 'assisted by an intermittently faithful Kichijiro (Yosuke Kubozuka) and when captured are interrogated by Inoue (Issei Ogata) and after years go by the faith of Rodigues is tested and to say more would spoil the little story there is.The film is heavy handed, dark, well photographed, and has some solid points about Japanese culture versus Western culture, faith, Catholicism, Buddhism – and in many ways points out the pain and futility of entering another country's space and beliefs and the futile attempt to impose our own ways to 'make them better'. Sound a bit familiar for today's Middle Eastern world?",6,3,4,1 April 2017
Logan," 'Take your friends and run... They'll keep coming, and coming... You don't have to fight anymore.'
","For those who have been following the Marvel Comic Books cinematic transformation, the character of Wolverine – that hunk with the blades that shoot out from his hands when he is angry – is well known. LOGAN represents the end of Wolverine, and surprisingly this is a very touching film and not just excessive gore (though that is certainly present throughout the film!). One line that underscores the mood of this piece is Logan's line 'Nature made me a freak. Man made me a weapon. And God made it last too long.' James Mangold directs the story he wrote (transformed into a screen play with help form Scott Frank and Michael Green) with a great deal of empathy for the last of Logan and his return to a caring man.The year is 2029 - the mutant population has shrunken significantly and the X-Men have disbanded. Logan (Hugh Jackman), whose power to self-heal is dwindling, has surrendered himself to alcohol and now earns a living as a chauffeur. He takes care of the ailing old Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and his sidekick, the albino Caliban (Stephen Merchant) whom he keeps hidden away. One day, a female stranger (Elizabeth Rodriguez) asks Logan to drive a girl named Laura (Dafne Keen) to the Canadian border. At first he refuses, but the Professor has been waiting for a long time for her to appear. Laura possesses an extraordinary fighting prowess and is in many ways like Wolverine. She is pursued by sinister figures (led by Boyd Holbrook) working for a powerful corporation; this is because her DNA contains the secret that connects her to Logan. A relentless pursuit begins. This time around we see Wolverine as the superhero beset by everyday problems -aging, ailing and struggling to survive financially. A decrepit Logan is forced to ask himself if he can or even wants to put his remaining powers to good use. It would appear that in the near-future, the times in which they were able put the world to rights with razor sharp claws and telepathic powers are now over. Kindness prevails – as a family (Eriq La Salle, Elise Neal, and Quincy Fouse) provide caring and protection for Wolverine and his mutant daughter. The evil trackers are very well portrayed, the action is brisk, but underneath all the killing and mutilation is a story with a heart. Grady Harp, June 17",Null,3,8,11 June 2017
Everest," A docudrama made human
","The true story of a group of people who climb Mount Everest during a perfect storm is converted into a successful screenplay by writers William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy, directed by Baltasar Kormákur. One of the reasons it works it the background information supplied before the film begins: 1953: Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became the first climbers to summit Everest. Over the next 40 years, only top professional climbers attempted the same feat. One in four died. 1992: New Zealander Rob Hall pioneered the concept of commercial guiding on Everest for amateur climbers. Over the next four years his team, Adventure Consultants, successfully led 19 clients to summit without a single fatality. 1996: Other commercial operators follow Rob Hall's lead, including Scott Fischer's Mountain Madness. More than 20 expeditions compete to summit Everest in the same two week window.'It is difficult to outmatch nature, and in many ways that is why this film does not completely captivate the audience: Mount Everest and the tangles of nature are clearly the star. But the story is a true one and well enacted: 'On the morning of May 10, 1996, climbers from two commercial expeditions start their final ascent toward the summit of Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. With little warning, a violent storm strikes the mountain, engulfing the adventurers in one of the fiercest blizzards ever encountered by man. Challenged by the harshest conditions imaginable, the teams must endure blistering winds and freezing temperatures in an epic battle to survive against nearly impossible odds.'The casting director went overboard in this film – Jason Clarke is the titular star and on screen more than the others, but the supporting cast includes Kiera Knightly, Emily Watson, Jake Gyllenhaal, Marti Henderson, John Hawkes, Sam Worthington, Josh Brolin, Robin Wright, etc – all of whom climbing the mountain look the same – covered with snow, climbing dear, goggles, oxygen tanks – so that most anyone could have been placed on this treacherous climb.But where the film succeeds is the human element: man/woman against the elements and the mutual love and concern they share. A good nature epic if a bit relentlessly slow.",7,0,1,13 June 2016
Friends with Benefits," Bit of Fluff with Advantages...
","FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS is a bit of a twist on the usual run of romantic comedies; hook-ups are for sexual gratification only with no emotional strings attached -unless.... And that is where this film starts out, with a lot of promise. The story is by Harley Peyton with assistance from Keith Merryman and David A. Newman who with director Will Gluck adapted the story for the screenplay. Sound like a lot of cooks to spoil the broth? Well, in part it probably is as there are many little subplots here that bump into each other.Jamie Rellis (Mila Kunis) is a New York head-hunter trying to sign Los Angeles-based Dylan Harper (Justin Timberlake) for her client. When he takes the job and makes the move, they quickly become friends. Their friendship turns into a friendship with benefits, but with Jamie's emotionally damaged past and Dylan's history of being emotionally unavailable, they have to try to not fall for each other the way Hollywood romantic comedies dictate. Add to this fairly substantial idea the gay character Tommy Bollinger (Woody Harelson in a fine little cameo) and Patricia Clarkson as Jamie's galavanting mother and the mix becomes funny. Despite a rather intrusive copout ending there is PLENTY of eye candy from Timberlake and Kunis and lots of bed romping. It's goofy but entertaining and it does show that Justin Timberlake is becoming a fine leading man on screen. Grady Harp",7,0,1,27 April 2012
Green Street Hooligans," A High Tension Tale Examining the Extent of Human Violence
","GREEN STREET HOOLIGANS is much easier on the psyche to watch in the home DVD version than in the theater release. It is a story so packed with violence that the underlying subplots get lost until the film is reduced to the size of a television screen. Lexi Alexander wrote (with Dougie Brimson and Joshua Shelov) and directed this tense story about the strange cults ('firms') of grown men who align with the various soccer/football teams in London, accompanying the games with intense fighting in the manner of 'hooliganism'. The story is well told by introducing a Yank into this atmosphere, allowing the viewer to see the origins and machinations of hooliganism from a fairly unbiased stance.Matt Buckner (Elijah Wood) has just been expelled form Harvard in his last semester, taking the blame for his coke-snorting hotshot roommate whose family is too important for such blunderings. Somewhat without direction and not having his degree in journalism completed (Matt's father - Henry Goodman - is a high ranking international journalist whose time is spent in foreign ports since the death of Matt's mother) Matt flies to London to live with his sister Shannon (Claire Forlani) and her husband Steve (Marc Warren) and their young son. Steve's rowdy brother Pete (Charlie Hunnam) interrupts Matt's arrival with a demand for money from his older brother and reluctantly accepts the company of the new Yank Matt in order to gain cash from Steve. What ensues is Matt's introduction to the GSE (Green Street Elite), a firm of men who defend the honor and success of their chosen soccer team: there are many such firms of street violence gangs who vie for ranking within the city. Matt is plunged into this violent situation and learns form Pete the importance of gang stance: always protect your brothers and never flee a fight. The story grows increasingly complex and intense as we learn the backgrounds for hate and intolerance, one of these hates is for journalists and when it is discovered that Matt was a journalism major at Harvard the news nearly causes Matt's life. But Matt slowly identifies with the firm and grows into a sense of individuality that he has never had, giving him the ability to face the realities of his father's absence and to understand the precarious marriage of his sister whose husband is a 'reformed' hooligan. In the end there is a 'justification' for the violence witnessed, but the audience must be willing to view that justification from an altered stance.The film is paced well and the cast is excellent, with special kudos to Elijah Wood, Claire Forlani, Marc Warren, Charley Hunnan, and to the fine supporting cast members including Leo Gregory as the unfortunate snitch, Terence Jay as the coke-addicted Harvard roommate, and a large cast of 'firm members' whose fighting techniques are well choreographed and captured by cinematographer Alexander Buono. Like THE FIGHT CLUB this film is not for all audiences, but the messages underneath all of the violence are well worth thought. Grady Harp",8,3,5,12 August 2007
Blood Diamond," Tightly Directed Action Thriller
","Edward Zwick delivers the goods with BLOOD DIAMOND, a tense and very compelling film about the greed and bloodshed that surround the diamond industry of Sierra Leone. Though a bit too long at two and a half hours the story is not only a dramatically viable one for a film, but it also has much to say about human interaction and the sanctity of friendship.Solomon Bo (Djimon Hounsou) is a fisherman who becomes indentured to the evil men who search for diamonds after being separated form his family and in the course of working for the vile men who are in the illegal diamond industry he discovers a huge pink diamond and hides it form the overseers. He is caught, jailed, and while imprisoned he is observed by a Rhodesian white man Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) who discovers Solomon's secret and arranges for him to be released from prison with money to salvage his life. However, we discover that Danny is in the black market end of the diamond trade and Danny promises Solomon he will get his family back for him if Solomon shares the hidden pink diamond. A journalist Maddy (Jennifer Connelly) finds Danny and recognizes a good resource for a revealing article about the diamond trade. Danny and Maddy form an alliance: the rest of the film consists of the chases to recover the diamond with Danny and Solomon bonding and attempting to avoid every manner of interloper.The performances by DiCaprio, Hounsou, and Connelly are superb but there are also fine performances in the smaller roles filled with such actors as Michael Sheen, Kagiso Kuypers, Benu Mabhena, Jimi Mistry, and Stephen Collins. The cinematography by Eduardo Serra manages to capture the beauty of the country as well as the horror of the battles. But in the end it is Zwick (The Last Samurai, Courage Under Fire, Legends of the Fall, Leaving Normal, Glory, etc) who transforms the screenplay by Charles Leavitt and C. Gaby Mitchell into an intelligent and engrossing film. Recommended. Grady Harp",8,0,0,22 March 2007
Pride & Prejudice," Distilled Austen Makes for a Fine Brew
","Some will ask 'how many versions of Jane Austen's read-to-the-point-of-fraying 'Pride and Prejudice' do we need?' The current film archives show no fewer than ten versions and growing. But for this viewer the current P & P du jour is as satisfying as any, edited and distilled to its main story lines without diminishing the main message from the author. Deborah Moggach can be thanked for the screenplay (with some subtle revisions by Emma Thompson) and Joe Wright for his sensitive and forward momentum directing approach.So what make this version different and successful? First, the placement of the Bennet family in the pig and mud friendly country home that sets the scene properly for the driver of the film - finding proper husbands for the five daughters whose well placed marriages will assure the lower class Bennet family a future stability. Yes, it is a bit untidy, this household, but that makes it a family more dependent on the land and more prone to dreams of 'marrying up' in a country ruled by class system. Second, the casting of the Bennnet family with five truly young actresses (Keira Knightly, Rosamund Pike, Talulah Riley, Jena Malone, Carey Mulligan) instead of older types trying to appear like teenagers; a mother (Brenda Blethyn) who indeed shows her desperation of class; and a father (Donald Sutherland) who epitomizes Austen's father figure mold. Add to the Bennets the credible men characters of Simon Woods, Matthew Macfadyen, Tom Hollander, and Cornelius Booth and top it all off with a pivotal Lady Catherine de Bourg of Judi Dench and all players are in place for a fine cast. The dialogue is crisp and sharp and the usual diversions into lineage names and sidebars are eliminated, bringing this long story down to just over two hours.The scenery and costumes are superb as is the cinematography by Roman Oshin and the musical score by Dario Marianelli with a lot of help from Henry Purcell. Is it one of the best movies of the year? Perhaps, perhaps not, depending on taste. But it is nice to see Keira Knightly shine in a role more challenging than any she has had to date. She inhabits Elizabeth Bennet luminously. Grady Harp",8,0,0,1 March 2006
Taken," Breathless Action Film that remains Human
","TAKEN is a fast paced, well designed and choreographed action thriller that details the return to duty of an intelligence man, whose career distanced him from his family, when his own daughter falls victim to the crime syndicate in Paris. The driver of this well written (Luc Besson! and Robert Mark Kamen), well directed (Pierre Morel) film is the non-stop violence filled mission of a desperate father whose skills at getting to the heart of a matter have not been diminished by his 'early retirement'. Liam Neeson is in grand form as Bryan Mills, the skilled and committed father who can out kill and out wit even the most vicious of the Albanian forces against whom he must struggle to save his kidnapped daughter from being sold into human slavery to an Arab sheik. The film moves so rapidly, with the skills of cinematographer Michel Abramowicz, that the various other characters who populate this drama scarcely have time to establish an identity (Famke Janssen, Radivoje Bukvic, Maggie Grace et al). The violence is constant but due to Bryan Mills' skills each death is so rapid that the camera doesn't linger There are scenes in the brothels where the drug induced young girls serve as prostitutes that are quite disturbing, but again the camera doesn't pause long enough to make them gruesome. This is a fine performance by Liam Neeson who demonstrates a mastery of the action roles that likely will lead to others in a similar vein. It is a wild ride, but a very fine one.

Alice in Wonderland," 'After all, this is MY dream.'
","ALICE IN WONDERLAND is a merry mixed bag of a film. The criticisms range from adulation to condemnation and that usually identifies an artwork worth visiting. No, this is not Lewis Carroll's wondrous book intact: it s a variation on a theme of that book and there are so many aspects of the original here that those whose childhoods (and adulthoods) captured so much of the wild imagination and hilarious dialogue of this ma group of otherland creations that the film will at least connect on many levels to everyone. One suspects that with the manner in which the movie begins (a haughty 'engagement announcement' party at which the now 19 year old Alice Kingsleigh is set up to become betrothed to a dullard geek and runs from the gazebo setting out of dismay) is the reason for the restoration of individualism in the Alice that returns from slide down the rabbit hole return to Wonderland. Linda Woolverton's screenplay is creaky at times, but wisely keeps enough of the fantasy alive before drowning it in an ending that is perilously close to gluttonous CGI mess. The flavor is pure Tim Burton and his style fits this adaptation well. To justify the return of the elder Alice to the world at the end of the rabbit hole Burton has to have a driver: Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is needed to evict the evil Red Queen (Helen Bonham Carter so that the good White Queen (a miscast Anne Hathaway) can restore calm and order to Underland. Many of Carroll's characters are used as CGI creations - Tweedledum/Tweedledee (voice of Matt Lucas), Cheshire Cat (voice of Stephen Fry), the White Rabbit (voice of Michael Sheen), the Blue Caterpillar (a wonderful voice character for Alan Rickman), the talking Flowers (voice of Imelda Staunton), and the hound dog Bayard (voice of Timothy Spall), etc. The Mad Hatter is well captured by Johnny Depp and some genuine realism is added via the transformative presence of Marton Csokas as the young Alice's now departed father Charles Kingsleigh. Where the movie gets off track is the final battle with the monsters that protect the Red Queen. It just gets expensively silly here and certainly not a film for young children: the violence is disturbing. But there is enough to like in this DVD version - even without the advantage (I suppose there was one) of theatrical 3D. And as Alice keeps reminding everyone, 'This is MY dream.'

The World's Fastest Indian," A Beautiful, Touching, Entertaining Tale of Dreams and Aging
","It seems many viewers avoided this film when it was in the theaters because the title was confusing and not representative of the story. The fact that Sir Anthony Hopkins was the lead actor should have been a signal of sorts, but it took the release of the DVD for this viewer to reluctantly rent the film when other possibilities were low. Big Mistake! This is one of the more genuinely fine films about the idomitability of the human spirit that has been released in some time.Based on a true story, the 'Indian' of the title has nothing to do with the heritage of the character Burt Munro, a 67 year old odd but generously kind New Zealander whose lifelong passion is to race his 1923 'Indian motorbike' in the Bonneville Salt Flats Races in America. Burt lives for his dreams and despite the fact that his idiosyncrasies befuddle his neighbors and townsfolk (with the except of the little boy Tom next door who idolizes him), he manages to make everyone with whom he comes into contact admire, and yes, love him. Using his own skills he brings his old motorbike to the point that he can enter the race in the States and with the financial help of his friends he manages to board a ship with his bike and sail to America. In the US he is a fish out of water and must adjust to the city life and attitudes of the Americans, but eventually, through his innate charm and dedication to his dream, he does manage against all odds and, with the help of many American new friends, enter the race to break the world's record for speed on a motorbike.Hopkins owns the role of Burt and despite his not always on target New Zealand accent he manages to deliver surely one of his most endearing portrayals of his rich career. His encounters with Tom, with a feisty widow Ada (Diane Ladd), with a fine old wise Indian man, and with a transsexual motel clerk Tina (Chris Williams), to name only a few of the superb supporting cast - are the epitome of underplayed fine acting and engender so much warmth that tears of happiness just can't be avoided. Writer and director Roger Donaldson deserves a standing ovation for this small, sensitive, gentle, understated tale that demonstrates so well how being true to your visions and your dreams can overcome almost any obstacle. A deeply touching and completely entertaining movie. Highly Recommended for all audiences. This is one to Buy! Grady Harp",10,3,3,19 June 2006
Invictus," A One-Note Song or Short Story: Good Thoughts, Undeveloped Movie
","Clint Eastwood seems absent from this little movie until the credits at the end. What could have been a powerful little drama ends up being a volley between a hero president of South Africa and a Rugby Field. Granted we know a lot about the extraordinary Nelson Mandela and his surviving imprisonment to be released and form a government that through his inspiration brought an end to Apartheid. This little story about how he focused on encouraging a Rugby team's determination and success in winning the 1995 World Cup for Rugby and for bringing together a splintered country into a unified whole is well worth knowing, but little else happens here - we discover no insights into Nelson Mandela's character or that of his chosen inspirer François Pienaar. Clint Eastwood is usually far more sensitive and dramatic. The name of the movie is taken from the 1875 poem that inspired Mandela during his years of imprisonment. And it seems appropriate to quote that full poem here: Invictus Out of the night that covers me, Black as the Pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul. In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbowed. Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the Horror of the shade, And yet the menace of the years Finds, and shall find, me unafraid. It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll. I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul. William Ernest Henley Henley may not have become a poet known for anything else but this poem, but he will always be quoted when it comes to stories such as this one. The superb actor Morgan Freeman endures denture and facial make up and a shaky new accent as Nelson Mandela, but this is a flat performance - OK, but not memorable. Matt Damon obviously buffed up for his role and learned a new accent as François Pienaar and seems to know his mission, but again the performance is flat line and not impressive. The entire cast is adequate for the little they contribute. Yes, we want to love this movie and the ending does make us swell with admiration, but it is the getting there that seems an overwrought and excessive 93 minutes! Worth seeing if only to applaud once again the achievements of Nelson Mandela. Grady Harp",5,0,2,19 May 2010
La La Land," 'This is the dream! It's conflict and it's compromise, and it's very, very exciting!'
","Rhode Island born Damien Chazelle graduated from Harvard University with a degree in Visual and Environmental Studies. He has captured the attention of audiences throughout the country with is own story which he also directed – LA LA LAND – and likely will become a Hollywood staple. Perhaps the chaotic mess in which we find ourselves, daily sinking into a dark hole created by our change in political face, is the reason this little slight escape piece is finding such favor. Or maybe we just want to remember the happy ever after ending to dreams that were abundant in early musical films that makes this film the talk of the Oscars and making so much money.The film is about dreams - their illusions, consequences and rewards. Mia (Emma Stone), an aspiring actress, serves lattes to movie stars in between auditions and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), a jazz musician, scrapes by playing cocktail party gigs in dingy bars, but as success mounts they are faced with decisions that begin to fray the fragile fabric of their love affair, and the dreams they worked so hard to maintain in each other threaten to rip them apart.Apart from Stone and Gosling dancing and singing their way through the endless colorscapes of Los Angeles and Hollywood, there are few other actors involved – JK Simmons, Damon Gupton, John Legend, Tom Everett Scott, and others – to make the plot have any broad strokes. But it is what it is – and it is being applauded as the probable best picture of the year. Go figure.",8,2,8,4 February 2017
Super 8," A Powerhouse Movie That Doesn't Avoid Tenderness
","Though this film rings of Spielberg in action - fantasy mixed with the magic of kids' imagination and camaraderie - SUPER 8 is a very entertaining film. It is a movie within a movie - a nice twist on reality versus illusion - and the writer/director JJ Abrams has the keen idea of show the intended movie made by the kids at the end of the film during the credits. it works very well.The story involves Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) and a group of youngsters getting together to make a super 8 film of their own writing and acting and production and films: Riley Griffiths (as writer/director Charles), Ryan Lee as the zombie obsessed Cary, Gabriel Basso as Martin, Zach Mills as Preston, and Elle Fanning as Alice Dainerd. As the youngsters struggle with their film we learn of town troubles - such as Joe's dad, policeman Jackson Lamb (Kyle Chandler) and his concern with the town troublemaker Louis Dainerd (Ron Eldard) who is Alice's Dad - until everything changes as while on location at the train stop the youngster's film a bizarre train crash with a truck driven by a wise but somewhat scary science teacher. It becomes evident that there is more to the incident than meets the eye and as the youngsters realize that there is present among them a creature form space the speed of events wallops to a wild climax. In the end the Youngsters are the ones who relate to the possibilities of fantasy being real and the story ends with an uplifting sense of understanding.Placed in the year 1979 in Ohio the film manages to capture the flavor of the times and the fears of the people (could all this be a Soviet attack?!) to a tee. Joel Courtney is outstanding in his role and the supporting cast is excellent. Grady Harp",7,0,1,18 December 2011
Snowden," 'Secrecy is security and Security is Victory.'
","Now in December 2016 with the schism between the US and Russia altering because of the hacking of the elections and Russia's role in that conundrum – now is the finest hour to view this film about the very real terror of the Internet informational control of the globe. Oliver Stone with Kieran Fitzgerald have adapted Anatoly Kucherena's and Luke Harding's books and very creatively combined fact with drama in presenting a captivating expose of Edward Snowden's leak to the public of NSA's illegal surveillance techniques in the form of thousands of classified documents distributed to the press. Yes, the film focuses on the drama of the leak but it also offers a keen look at Edward Snowden's personality and intelligence and the conflicts he faced is carrying out this impart 'crime' to the world. We are all at risk.The film opens in Hong Kong, Monday June 3, 2013, as documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras (Melissa Leo) meets with columnist Glenn Greenwald (Zachary Quinto) at a hotel. They are met by Edward Snowden (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) in the lobby. Snowden brings the two to his room to begin documenting everything that has led up to this moment. In a flashback to 2004, Snowden was enlisted in the Special Forces as a candidate. Although he was persistent, he suffered an injury when he broke his legs after landing on them during a drill. The doctor tells Snowden that his legs were broken for weeks but only now have sustained a more serious injury. He warns Snowden that the bones in his legs will turn to powder if he lands on them again, so Snowden is discharged from the military. In 2006, Snowden began training for a position at the Central Intelligence Agency. He started a class under Corbin O'Brian (Rhys Ifans). One of Snowden's first tests is to solve a problem using a sequence. Snowden finishes first, and O'Brian checks his work to see what mistake he made. Snowden explains that he solved the problem by going out of order in the sequence, to the surprise of not only O'Brian, but the rest of the class as well. Snowden befriends a professor named Hank Forrester (Nicolas Cage), who appears to have had an influence on Snowden far more than O'Brian. Outside of work, Snowden chats online with a girl named Lindsay Mills (Shailene Woodley). They finally meet up one afternoon and go for a walk around the park. Lindsay takes several photos of Snowden, and they end up having their first kiss. In the present day of June 4, 2013 in Hong Kong, Snowden, Poitras, and Greenwald are joined by Ewen MacAskill (Tom Wilkinson), an intelligence reporter from The Guardian. MacAskill reports to editor Janine Gibson (Joely Richardson) in regards to the story that Snowden is telling them. In a flashback to 2007, Snowden is stationed in Geneva, Switzerland to maintain computer network security. Lindsay joins him on his trip. He meets with a CIA agent (Timothy Olyphant) who guides him through his task. The ending everyone knows. The film is quite long and the length adds to the tension and the credibility of the development of the drama. The crucial small roles are exceptionally well acted by Scott Eastwood, Ben Chaplin, Ben Schnetzer, Bhasker Patel and a host of others.This is a film that should be seen by everyone. The terror of cyberspying is a reality we all need to acknowledge.",10,3,7,31 December 2016
Stalingrad," '...62 men left out of 400': Realities from the German Stance
","STALINGRAD , released in 1993, remains one of the most brutally honest depictions of war on film. A brief history of the facts behind this film have been well stated: 'The Battle of Stalingrad was a major battle of World War II in which Nazi Germany and its allies fought the Soviet Union for control of the city of Stalingrad (now Volgograd) in southwestern Russia. It took place between 17 July 1942 and 2 February 1943, and is often cited as the turning point of the war in Europe. The German offensive to take Stalingrad, the battle inside the city and the Soviet counter-offensive--which eventually trapped and destroyed the German 6th Army and other Axis forces around the city--was the first substantial German land defeat of the war. The battle involved more participants than any other on the Eastern Front, and was marked by its brutality and disregard for military and civilian casualties by both sides. It was amongst the bloodiest in the history of warfare, with the upper estimates of combined casualties coming to nearly two million.' The horror of this battle as written by Jürgen Büscher, Christoph Fromm, Johannes Heide, and director Joseph Vilsmaier manages to allow us to see the 'other side' of the German forces, those not committed to the Nazi hunger for world domination, but instead were simply men serving their required time in the army, hoping to return to their families. The film opens with a prelude: German troops of the 6th Army are languishing in Italy after their successful mission in North Africa. They are soon assigned to attack a port in Russia - a place called Stalingrad - and off they go to what is perceived to be another quick victory. The unit is directed by Lt. Hans von Witzland (Thomas Kretschmann, in a role that should have won him every award possible, so fine is his performance): he is a man who appears more human than soldier and indeed when his troop arrives in Russian territory he is appalled by the treatment of Russian POWs by German officers, a response that places him in a negative light with the Nazis. But Witzland is assigned to take a Russian strong hold with the close help of his group of fellow soldiers (played with extraordinary humanity by Dominique Horwitz, Sebastian Rudolph, Oliver Broumis et al). For a moment in time they are successful heroes but their commitment to the war is rapidly and fully eroded by the slaughter around them and the orders from the heinous Nazi officers to treat the Russians with less than dignity. They are threatened with death by firing squad for their humanity in attempting to give aid to the Russians being constantly attacked and only released form their prisoner status when the war appears to be aimed toward loss. There are many very tender moments between the 6th army and the Russians trapped by the siege of Stalingrad and as the bitter winter sets in the battle-weary soldiers are dying, committing suicide or attempting to escape and find their way back home. The over two hour study of the cruelty of war ends with a solemn statement, both emotionally and visually and the Battle of Stalingrad, a victory of the Russians, shows the defeat of the minds (and lives) of the Germans. The film is brave in its commitment to address the fact that the universal 'German image' of World War II is a negative one. This film focuses on individual ideals and the scarring that war, on both sides, leaves on the soldiers and people who survive it. Highly recommended. Grady Harp",10,5,6,26 June 2010
Woman in Gold," 'They'll never admit to what they did, because if they admit to one thing, they'll have to admit to it all.'
","'I have to do what I can to keep these memories alive, because people forget-especially the young.' Maria Altman. What a wonder of a film this is! Unfortunately it was released so early in the year that by the time the Academy Awards come 'round few will remember to place Helen Mirren's name on the list of Best Actress nominees.Simon Curtis directs this near docudrama with a flair for genuine feeling, for art, for music, and for history. Written by Alexi Kaye Campbell and based on books and notes by both Maria Altman and E. Randol Schönberg the script rings true and while providing a fine story it also reminds us of the atrocities inflicted upon the world by Hitler's Third Reich.The story is straight forward: the 80 year old Maria Altman (a radiant Dame Helen Mirren) engages a rookie young lawyer E. Randol Schönberg (finally an excellent acting role for Ryan Reynolds) who happens to be the grandson of the brilliant Austrian composer Arnold Schönberg to help her retrieve the painting 'Adele' (now simply known as 'Woman in Gold') – a Gustav Klimt painting belonging to her family and was stolen by the Nazis and is hanging in Austria's Belvedere. Randy is married (Katie Holmes) and has a child and another on the way and finally gets a new job with a law firm, so he is loathe to accompany Maria on a trip to Austria in an attempt to restitute the theft of her aunt Adele. When Randy learns of the value of the painting together with the other Klimt paints that belong to Maria he joins her (with making money in time). Through a well developed relationship between Maria and Randy and a very fine series of flashbacks to the time when the Nazi's were condemning Jews to death camps and stealing their property Randy and Maria ultimately triumph in what seems to be an impossible quest. In doing so Randy gains an appreciation for his background, his miraculous grandfather, and the realities of the Holocaust that is his heritage. In addition to Mirren and Reynolds the cast is consistently excellent – especially Daniel Brühl, Tatiana Maslany, Max Irons, Charles Dance, Elizabeth McGovern, Jonathan Pryce, Allan Corduner, Moritz Bleibtreu and all the others. The film also sensitively includes a performance of Arnold Schönberg's string sextet Verklärte Nacht – another act of homage among the many this film makes to the Austrian Jews who escaped to America. It is an enriching experience, worthy of many awards. Grady Harp, July 15",10,4,8,18 July 2015
Invincible," Yet Another Sports Film About Personal Triumph
","INVINCIBLE, though the title of this very Walt Disney/Hallmark Card docudrama, is a term that could be applied to the plethora of movies built on the stories of down and outers who pull themselves up by the boot strings due to their success in sports. Brad Gann is responsible for the script of the life of Vince Papale, a 30ish out of work substitute teacher, deserted husband, depressed South Philly member of a gang of friends who pass the time while jobless playing football in the muddy vacant lots of their part of the world.Vince Papale is played well by Mark Wahlberg, giving a quiet performance of a deeply injured man who manages to finally succeed at something - being chosen by the failing Philadelphia Eagles football team when a new coach Dick Vermeil (Greg Kinnear) tries a desperate attempt to enliven the team by holding open tryouts. Vince's friends convince him to make the effort, the bar owners relative Janet (Elizabeth Banks) adds her encouragement as does Vince's father (Kevin Conway). Of course the obvious happens or the film wouldn't have been made! Vince becomes an Eagle and soars, not only for himself but also for his father, his friends and his new girl.It is difficult to fault this film: it is also difficult to sift out anything different from all the rest of the films that follow the same formula. Wahlberg does well, being careful not to allow his physique image to show for fear that the public will continue to think of him as an underwear model instead of an actor. And the supporting cast is well selected. There is an audience for these 'sports as king' films and this one has nothing that even kids can't watch. It unfortunately is just repetitive.

The Great Raid," Unsung Heroes
","Much of what happens during war is not apparent to the general public: events that place American military personnel in a less than gratuitous light historically have been downplayed by the media, current events in Iraq excepted. Such was the case in World War II when Washington more or less ignored the imprisonment of hundreds of GIs after the Japanese attacked and took over the Philippines. This is their story as excerpted from the novels 'Ghost Soldiers' and 'The Great Raid on Cabanatuan'.The action of the movie takes place over five days in January 1945 during which time a battalion of Army Rangers finally lead a successful raid on the POW camp in Cabanatuan to free the remaining American prisoners after their survival of the Bataan Death March and three years of beastly, brutal incarceration. The leaders of the raid are portrayed by Benjamin Bratt and James Franco and the survivors in the camp to be freed are held together by the characters portrayed by Joseph Fiennes, Marton Csokas and Logan Marshall-Green. Flashbacks to the period of time before the Death March are inserted to introduce those freedom fighters lead by Margaret Utinsky (Connie Nielsen) whose smuggling of medicine into the camp helped save the lives of her lover (Joseph Fiennes) and the others. This story is history so the ending is not a secret. The Rangers exhibit great bravery and succeed in the impossible mission of freeing the prisoners, with the important help of the Philippine military led by Captain Pajota (Cesar Montano), in a truly synchronous mission.The film is very understated for the most part: real life black and white photographs of the events in the film are inserted to add credibility and they are gut wrenching. The devastation of battle is not ignored, but the attention is focused on the very human plights of the victims and their freedom soldiers. The film is shot in the muted tones of sepia with enough color to make the effect appear as an old 1940s movie. It works. Though the script is not great, the message is and the actors committed to this retelling of an important event do a fine job. John Dahl directs with a sense of pathos and while there are no raging overblown heroes, he allows the simple men involved in this story to stand taller than most heroes of the 'big war movies'.The film met with disinterest and criticism when released. Perhaps now that people can view it in the privacy of their homes the quiet message within will make a more poignant impact. These ordinary people have dignity in the face of being ignored by their own government. And there is a lesson there we should not forget. Recommended. Grady Harp",8,3,5,30 December 2005
Limitless," Writer's Block: Two Forms
","LIMITLESS is a film that you want to see succeed - an idea with 'limitless' possibilities, a setting that involves Wall Street (part of our core issue of economic chaos), some interesting camera work, and a a script that likes to make puns. The problems with the film is that is underdeveloped: main characters are rather two dimensional, cameo characters are walk-on parts without much purpose, and the script, such as it is, relies on voice-over cop out instead of intelligent dialogue. Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper attempting to break away from his guy roles in road show movies) is a wannabe writer - a man who has been attempting to write a novel for years but has not achieved one word on a page. He lives off his girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) who finally gives up on his mess of a life. Eddie moves into a filthy flat and he takes on the appearance of a street person until he encounters his ex-wife's (Anna Friel) brother Vernon (Johnny Whitworth) who gives Eddie a pill called NZT, a medication that is purportedly able to make the brain use 100% of its capacity (fragments of memory, encountered headlines, books slightly read etc all become immediately available to the 'patient'). Eddie, seeing his life going down the toilet, takes the pill and suddenly becomes multilingual, able to figure out number sequences at the gambling table, not only start but finish his novel, etc: in other words, a genius - for the 24 hour duration of the pill's effect. His changed life introduces him to, of course, the stock market where he makes it so big that he garners the attention of major player Carl Van Loon (Robert DeNiro) - along with the people involved with the now murdered Vernon who want the drug back: evil Gennady (Andrew Howard) and his thugs (Eddie Fernandez and Ray Siegle) a strange 'man in a tan coat' (Tomas Arana) et al. Eddie struggles through the transition, sells his novel, wins Lindy back, and some years later is running for New York Senator on his way to the Presidency of the United States. And that of course leads to the messy ending that began the film. Based on the novel 'The Dark Fields' by Alan Glynn, the screenplay (full of holes perhaps due to the same writer's block as the main character's) is by Leslie Dixon and the film is directed by Neil Burger, a man with some creative ideas who concentrates on gimmicks more than plot and character development. And it does have some dazzling visual effects sequences, courtesy of Joe Willems, cinematographer and Connie Brink, Special Effects Coordinator. It is an obvious attempt to compete with the fast action films that make so much box office money, but it is flimsy and may be better off in the DVD category - a category in which it landed early for obvious reasons.

Sicario," 'Hitman, assassin for hire'
","Written by Taylor Sheridan and directed by Canadian Dennis Villeneuve (Incendies, Prisoners, Enemy), SICARIO is in need of editing and offering some back stories to make it the strong film it is trying to be. The topic of border problems is a prominent one in the media at present and this film does indeed address some of the issues the country is facing.Strong on action, weak on dialogue the story has been summarized as follows; When drug violence worsens on the USA Mexico border, the FBI sends an idealistic agent, Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) on a mission to eradicate a drug cartel responsible for a bomb that had killed members of her team. To say who is the bad guy(s) and who is the good(s) would ruin the plot, but the characters are well acted by Josh Brolin, Benecio Del Toro, Victor Garber, Daniel Kaluuya, Maximiliano Hernández, Bernardo Saracino, Jon Bernthal and other smaller but significant roles. The surprise is how well Emily Blunt drops her British accent and débutante image and plays a fine FBI agent – hard as nails on the outside and soft on the inside . The films is difficult to watch at times due to some of the gruesome events, but in all it is a worthwhile movie experience.",Null,0,0,7 January 2016
Departures," Departures/Arrivals: 'The gift of last memories'
","DEPARTURES (aka OKURIBITO) is an experience film, one of those graceful creations of cinema that finds the balance between comedy and drama, sensitive and sentimental, and is embellished by a wondrous musical score and glowing cinematography. Running time is in excess of two hours, but likely most viewers would elect to rewind and watch it again, so touching and vital is this story. Daigo Kobayashi (the enormously gifted Masahiro Motoki) was raised by his mother when his father for some reason left his family when Daigo was only six years old: his last memory of his father is a quiet scene by the ocean when the child and the father exchange found rocks. Daigo was encouraged by his parents to learn to play the cello so that he could amount to something special as a man. Things happen: Daigo goes off to study cello, his mother dies and he doesn't attend the funeral, he marries Mike (Ryoko Hirosue), and spends all their money on a prime cello to gain admission to the major orchestra in the city. The orchestra plays to near empty houses and is finally disbanded. Daigo is without an income, sells his prize cello, and with Mika's blessing, returns to his hometown to live in the home of his childhood. He answers an ad for work, an ad that uses the word 'Departures' making Daigo think this is a travel agency. When Daigo 'interviews' with the owner (Tsutomu Yamazaki) he discovers that the job in one called 'encoffinment' (a Japanese ceremonial procedure of preparing, dressing & praying for the corpse before putting them in the coffin). At first repulsed by the job, Daigo gradually discovers the importance of paying final respects to the dead and preparing them for the life ahead, and his experiences with the new found beauty of encoffinment ties in with memories of his family, recalls his estrangement from his father, and reunites him with old dear friends who run a bath house, etc. Mika is spared the truth about her husband's new job, and when she discovers the truth, Mika leaves Daigo who by now is enchanted with his position. Many experiences follow as Daigo encoffins all manner of people: there are some ugly scenes and some very humorous scenes depicting the variety of 'calls' Daigo gets. How the story winds down is not necessarily difficult to discern, but the manner in which the film ends is a work of great simplicity and beauty. Daigo's dealing with departures allows him to find his own arrivals. Writer Kundo Takita and director Yôjirô Takita well deserve all the awards lavished on this perfect little film. But much of the success of this story about another way to view death is the astonishingly multifaceted performance by Masahiro Motoki, a beautiful man and an equally beautiful actor. This is a film to watch repeatedly and definitely one to add to the personal library of DVDs. Grady Harp",10,6,8,28 February 2010
Jack Reacher," 'You think I'm a hero? I'm not a hero. I'm a drifter with nothing to lose.'
","There seems to be two camps of response to this film: those who have read the novel 'One Shot' by Lee Child and have trouble with the casting and those who come to the film without knowledge of the 'character Jack Reacher. Not having read the book this viewer found the film intensely engrossing, full of smart dialog form writer/director Christopher McQuarrie, and a finely tuned cast of actors who get the opportunity to strut their stuff in this story that seems far shorter than the 130 minutes of the film. Tom Cruise may be short in stature at 5'7' but at age 50 he is in fine shape, performs all his own car stunts (which are excellent and harrowing), and at least for the novice he does 'become' Jack Reacher.Briefly, the setting is Pittsburgh, PA and a professional sniper (an exceptionally fine Jai Courtney) shoots dead five seemingly random people. The police quickly capture on James Barr (Joseph Sikora), arrest him, interrogate him (by DA Richard Jenkins and his cohort David Oyelowo and the DA's lawyer daughter Rosamund Pike who seeks to give Barr a fair trial): Barr declares his innocence and his answer to his question of is he guilty is his writing 'Get Jack Reacher'. Barr is beaten unconscious in a van on the way to jail and is comatose. Jack Reacher, ex-military investigator, (Tom Cruise) who despises Jack Barr from their shared military history appears and the action begins. Reacher is only too willing believe that Barr did the crime he's accused of. But when Local criminals try to take out Reacher, he decides to give the case a second look. Soon he's unraveling a much deeper conspiracy.In addition to the actors mention, there are several excellent cameos by Werner Herzog as a Russian ex-prisoner who knows about survival (he chewed of his own fingers while I prison to ward off gangrene from frost bite), Alexia Fast, Josh Helman, Vladimir Sizov, and Robert Duvall. The story is rich in innuendos, insights into corporate greed and threats form outside sources to take over the country, and some serious chases both by car and on foot. The brilliant cinematography is by Caleb Deschanel and the atmosphere is greatly enhanced by the musical score by Joe Kraemer. But this is a Tom Cruise special and he proves he can still rule the roost as one of the top action heroes in the business. For this genre, this is a fine entertainment. Grady Harp",8,5,11,8 May 2013
"McFarland, USA"," 'Uno, dos, tres – McFarland'
","New Zealand director Niki Caro (Whale Rider North Country, A Heavenly Vintage) adds another success to her resume with this moving portrayal of a true story about a coach and his team in 1987 overcoming odds and learning trust, hope, and a belief in attainable goals. Based on a story by Bettina Gilois and Christopher Cleveland who also wrote the screenplay with Grant Thompson, the film may be overly long, but the emotional impact is so strong that the viewer stays with every minute of it without lapses.The year is 1987 and Jim White (Kevin Costner) moves his wife (Maria Bello) and two daughters (Morgan Saylor and Elsie Fisher) after losing his last job as a football coach because of anger management related causes. McFarland, CA is in the San Joaquin Valley, an agricultural community that is basically populated with migrant workers who make their living form harvesting crops (it is one of the poorest cities in the country). He is at the end of his rope, feeling that this assignment is his only hope for supporting his family. He struggles, fails as a football coach but gets the idea of having a cross-country track team when he observes the stamina of the young lads running after being up early to pick crops. He turns seven students with no hope into one of the best cross-country teams, learning as much about equality and fulfillment of goals as his runners do.In addition to the interpersonal reactions among the students and Jim's family (his friends create a Quinceañera for Jim's 15 year old daughter) there are many moments of inspiring beauty in this radiant film – not the least of which is a letter written by one of the runners: 'We fly like blackbirds through the orange groves, floating on a warm wind. When we run, we own the earth. The land is ours. We speak the birds' language. Not immigrant no more. No stupid Mexicans. When we run, our spirits fly. We speak to the gods. When we run, we are the gods.'This is a moving film, so very timely during this struggle with border problems and immigration and racial distrust. Films like this serve a purpose far greater than mere entertainment.",10,1,1,30 December 2015
Les Misérables," A deeply moving, masterfully crafted masterpiece
","Les Misérables Is an experience. Director Tom Hooper has realized this timeless and often repeated Victor Hugo novel that was transformed into a near operatic setting by Claude- Michel Schönberg, Alain Boublil and Herbert Kretzmer by opening up the story even more and utilizing genuinely creative musical enhancements. The result is an emotionally charged, breathtaking spectacle that while it is discussing the French Revolution and aftermath as a subject it remains a gently warm tale of love and commitment.The cast is extraordinary, down to the smallest role in the film. It is truly an Ensemble work and deserves recognition as such, but the individuals should also be honored individually. Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean is completely immersed in this multifaceted and very difficult role: it is the zenith of his career both as a film and as a stage actor/singer. Equally impressive (and a surprise to those of us who knew nothing of this early career in musical theater) is Russell Crowe's Javert - very deserving of Best Supporting Actor at Oscar time for his powerful embodiment of misguided and tortured head of police, but for some reason he is being overlooked. Anne Hathaway gives us a Fantine that will be the benchmark for all others who sing this role. Amanda Seyfried handles Cosette's difficult soprano lines with relative ease and feels completely right in her approach to the role. Another major shock is Eddie Redmayne as Marius: we all are aware of his acting sills, but this young man has a splendid voice and makes his character one of the standouts of the story. Samantha Barks as Éponine is a star turn, combining screen presence with fine acting and a solid vocal ability.Each of the lads who spark the revolutionary barricade is outstanding; Aaron Tveit as Enjolras completely wins hearts with his handsome looks, his sensitive acting and his very fine voice and close behind him is performance quality are George Blagden, Killian Donnelly, Fra Fee, Gabriel Vick and for course Daniel Huttlestone as the young spunky Gavroche. Director Hooper has given us a different take on the Thénardiers - no silly slapstick here, but instead a smarmy, oily evil couple whose behavior at other people's expense make us laugh: Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen make them unforgettable. And it is a true bow to theatrical history to cast Colm Wilkinson (who originated the role of Jean Valjean in 1980) as the Bishop.In all this is a stunning success, visually, vocally, acting, directing, costuming, and large ensemble wise. It is unforgettable. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp",10,6,11,31 December 2012
The Da Vinci Code," The Da Vinci Code: The Movie
","After all the hoopla and controversy parting the waters between the religious right and Catholic Church and the avid devotees of Dan Brown's multi-million dollar success book, the movie version is finally here. THE DA VINCI CODE makes a good movie - and that is enough.Director Ron Howard has assembled a good international cast, trusted the screenplay to Akiva Goldsman, and in fine Hollywood style has transformed an interesting premise of a story from Dan Brown's interested though unsophisticatedly written blockbuster into a suspense thriller. The story of a murder in the Louvre leading a former flatfoot detective turned writer of symbology and a French cryptographer on a chase involving the Vatican, the Opus Dei society, and the Priory guarding the Holy Grail is full of terrific visualizations of some of the encrypted secrets of Brown's novel and in the end the movie allows the viewer to follow the interesting story much more easily than did the book.The settings are magnificent (cinematography by Salvatore Totino), the musical score by Hans Zimmer sweeps the story along embracing all aspects of the atmosphere, and the visual effects department has done a fine job with some tough tasks. The actors take their characters in stride, given that many of them are over the top figures: Ian McKellen will satisfy every reader's vision of Sir Leigh Teabing; Paul Bettany is appropriately crazy as Silas; Jean Reno offers a Captain Fache who manages to hold things together; Audrey Tatou turns a fine spin as the all-important Sophie Neveu; and Tom Hanks sleepwalks through his rather innocuous conception of Robert Langdon. And the ending is a rather sappy sellout not found in the book - but this is Hollywood...This film may set box office records - which seems to be the point in making it - and serves to prove what good PR work can do for a movie. Many will put down 'The Da Vinci Code' because of religious reasons or other reasons, but in the end it is a just a good story well told - not a great movie but an entertaining one. Recommendation: a good 2 1/2 hour diversion, but not one to rush out to see until the crowds dwindle a bit. Grady Harp",8,6,11,22 May 2006
Titanic," Continues to Impress
","TITANIC, that preposterously beautiful film made in 1997 with a very young Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet, James Cameron's Magnum Opus, continues to impress, especially when viewed yet again on New Year's Day 2012 - a fifteen year old film that remains one of the most impressive cinematic achievements from Hollywood. One of the many reasons it remains resonant is the manner in which the film addresses class systems - the wealthy versus the poor is a hot topic today and the film shows us why - and the extraordinary cinematic recreation of the sinking of that mighty ship.But for many the manner in which Cameron sets the tone of the story, the reminiscence of the elderly Rose unraveling the tale to her granddaughter and crew of ship Keldysh attempting to raise the Titanic now 84 years on the bottom of the ocean and carrying that theme through the course of the film, seems more cogent today than even at movie's release. Gloria Stewart is radiant as the old Rose and her rapt audience includes Bill Paxton, Suzy Amis, Lewis Abernathy, Nicholas Cascone, and Anatoly M. Sagalevitch. From there the opulence of the 'unsinkable' Titanic unfolds and the gradual love affair between Rose Bukater (Kate Winslet) and poor artist Jack Dawson (Leonardo Di Caprio), a relationship at risk from the brewings of Rose's mother (Frances Farmer) and Rose's intended (Billly Zane). The cruise lasted from April 10, 1912 to April 15, 1912, but it was a lifetime of commitment between the young lovers.In retrospect the performances by some fine actors who would continue to rise is of note: Ioan Gruffudd, Victor Garber, David Warner, Danny Nucci etc. The film could have used some editing to reduce the length, and the presence of the unsinkable Molly Brown (Kathy Bates in a wasted role) though historically accurate ads very little to the film and even distracts a bit. Still TITANIC is just that - titanic - and no matter how many times we see it, it never fails to impress. Grady Harp",10,1,2,2 January 2012
In Time," Tedious film, but good idea: 'Don't waste my time'.
","Writer/director Andrew Niccol had a good idea - having time be the trading commodity for a future time when everything is bought and sold with a person's inherent time on earth. But is it is a one-note song and that note gets so overused that monotony sets in.The official description of the story is as follows: in a future where people stop aging at 25, but are engineered to live only one more year, having the means to buy your way out of the situation is a shot at immortal youth. Here, Will Salas finds himself accused of murder and on the run with a hostage - a connection that becomes an important part of the way against the system.' Plug into this simplistic explanation the fact that Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) lives in a time zone equivalent to living on the wrong side of the tracks. He decides to go for the gold and with the help of his buddy Borel (Johnny Galecki) he sets out to cross through all the barriers (using his allotted stored time to buy passage) to get to the wealthy part of town - an area run by the Timekeeper (Cillian Murphy) and his staff (Alex Pettyfer et at). Will gains entry into the gambling casinos, bets his hours on Timekeeper at the table, wins, and meets the beautiful Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried), daughter of the richest man in the city. From there on it is a 'catch me if you can' chase as Will and Sylvia try to outwit the Timekeeper and of course we know who is going to survive.The dialogue is plebeian, the characters, with the possible exception of Will, are only given to us in outline form, so we end up not really caring about anyone. There are some interesting bits of surrealism tossed in but even those can't alter the fact that there is very little to work with in this little star turn for Timberlake.

Thor," One of the Better Comic Book Transfers!
","Not being a fan of Marvel Comics or of the endless transformations into cinema that these silly stories are seeing, THOR was not high on the list to view. Seeing it without the 3D variation that accompanied the theatrical release was a further detriment in deciding to watch it, but when a director of the caliber of Kenneth Branagh and a cast of both seasoned performers and exciting new faces pass the credit notification then it is tempting to give it a try. The surprise is that this is a very entertaining movie. There is a lot of CGI business that probably in 3D was even more beautiful (the rainbow bridge, the ice realm etc), but even in regular vision the sets and designs are truly beautiful. Some viewers might expect a version of the Viking gods adventure, but this is clearly a fairy tale version - tripping between the earth realm and the home of the gods, and that in and of itself make the film more enjoyable: it doesn't seem to take itself too seriously and that is refreshing. Odin (Anthony Hopkins) rules Asgard and has two sons - Thor (Chris Hemsworth, an Adonis with a very magnetic screen presence) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) - by his devoted wife Frigga (Rene Russo). Odin is about to pass his crown to Thor when the latter makes some wrong decisions and is cast out of the kingdom and lands in New Mexico where he encounters a scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her father Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) and weirdo friend Darcy (Kat Dennings). From Jane, Thor learns kindness, compassion and love and has become more the son that Odin desired. Meanwhile back at home Loki is taking over (being the true son of King Laufey (Colm Feore) and as Odin lies dying Thor's buddies - Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Hogun (Tadanobu Asano), Fandral (Josh Dallas, a real find!), and Sif (Jaimie Alexander) with a bit of help from the gatekeeper Heimdall (Idris Elba) - descend to earth to aid Thor is becoming the quality of king he should be, etc etc In addition to the named cast there is a very very brief appearance by Jeremy Renner that just may be a signal that the followup THE AVENGERS will be around soon. The movie has a lot going for it, especially it the audience can sit back and enjoy the comic book atmosphere of this mixture of make believe and real life people. It is surprisingly successful!

The Shape of Water," 'If we do nothing, neither are we.'
","Another Guillermo del Toro masterpiece - story, screenplay (with Vanessa Taylor) and directed by - (Pan's Labyrinth, Pacific Rim, The Hobbit, Hellboy, Cronos, etc) deserves the Oscar he won for this fine and daring film. How this man is able to take imagination and make it so plausible is a gift - and one we can only hop he continues to share. THE SHAPE OF WATER, an otherworldly fable set against the backdrop of Cold War era America circa 1962 opens windows on racial prejudice as played in that period, the constant threat or thought that everything evil must originate in Russia, the demeaning role of women, people with special disabilities and how they cope with them, and the cruelty of secret service police, tec. In the hidden high-security government laboratory where she works, lonely mute Elisa (Sally Hawkins) is trapped in a life of isolation, living with the artist Giles (Richard Jenkins). Elisa's life is changed forever when she and co-worker Zelda (Octavia Spencer) discover a secret classified experiment - an 'alien' amphibian man (Doug Jones) whose ability to be both water born and land born introduces fears of higher intelligence that must be a Russian plot. The cruel officer Michael Shannon Shannon), is assigned to destroy amphibian just as Dr. Robert Hofstetter (Michael Stuhlberg) is determined to protect him from the Russian underground. In the scurry of the secrecy Elisa befriends Amphibian Man and a curious and tender relationship is created between a mute woman and a creature unable to speak. Odd references to old movies as shared by Giles and Elisa grow into a dramatic ending. Sally Hawkins is extraordinary as is the entire cast. Alexandre Desplat's musical score",10,41,77,18 March 2018
The Departed," Moles and the insidious tunnels they dig
","Martin Scorsese has another major hit on his hands with the release of the intelligent, chilling, violent, puzzling, and completely fascinating THE DEPARTED. This viewer has not seen the INFERNAL AFFAIRS on which this film is based so comparisons are not possible. But taking this film solely on its own merits this is one gripping piece of cinematic art. Beginning with a very smart script by William Monahan (apparently based on the original screenplay by Siu Fai Mak) and employing one of the best ensemble casts of the year, Scorsese does what he does best in giving us a film that holds our attention, our breath, and our applause throughout.The story involves two young recently graduated from police academy, men from opposite sides of the law and backgrounds, who are made moles within the Boston State Police department and the Irish mafia: Leonardo DiCaprio is one and Matt Damon is the other and both young actors turn in committed and convincing performances. On the polar aspects of the battleground are Jack Nicholson as the crime king Costello (his finest work since 'A Few Good Men') together with Ray Winstone as Mr French and on the other end are DiCaprio's mentors Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg and Damon's mentors Alec Baldwin et al. The very beautifully written female lead is played to perfection by Vera Farmiga who finally has a role (a conflicted psychiatrist for the moles) hat takes full advantage of her prodigious gifts as an actress.Some may find the violence obsessively graphic, but then this is Scorcese's style and for this viewer it is necessary for the drive of the story. It is impossible to stop concentrating for a moment during this rapid fire drama, spiced with just the right amount of wry humor, making its running time (in excess of two and a half hours) speed by as fast as the many bullets in the atmosphere. This is one of Scorsese's best films and one that begs to be seen again. Grady Harp",10,1,3,14 October 2006
American Made," 'I'm the gringo who always delivers.'
","'I'm the gringo who always delivers.'
Based on a true story as written by screenwriter Gary Spinelli and directed with skill by Doug Liman, the facts are fascinating (the back story of the Iran-Contra affair), the multileveled changes to the story line pointing out the corruption and misdirection of the US in Central American affairs - all is brought to credible levels by the superb performance of Tom Cruise. The film is cleverly related in video flashback segments made by the lead character Barry Seal. Opening in the year 1978, Barry Seal (Tom Cruise) works as a pilot for Trans World Airlines. He is married to Lucy (Sarah Wright) and has two children with her, with a third on the way. Barry was recruited by the CIA (via agent Monty Schaefer played well by Domhnall Gleeson) who offers Barry better money by taking on reconnaissance missions for the CIA in a smaller plane with cameras just south of the border. Schafer convinces Barry that he would be working for the good guys, but it would have to be kept completely secret, even from his own family. He then lets Barry take the plane out for a ride. Through a series of odd circumstances Barry becomes a drug-runner, catches the attention of the Medellín Cartel associated with Pablo Escobar (Mauricio Mejia) who needs a man with his skill set. Barry becomes a drug trafficker, gun smuggler and money launderer. Schafer asks Barry to carry weapons for the Contras in Nicaragua. Barry invites pilots that are his friends and plots routes to smuggle drugs for the cartel. The CIA closes eyes to the scheme and Barry becomes richer and richer. He uses the Arkansas town Mena to laundry his money. But the DEA and the FBI are tracking him down. When the CIA shuts down the scheme, Barry is left alone and arrested by the agencies. Barry's wife's brother JB (Caleb Landry Jones) is a freeloader who adds to the mounting problems and tragedies. To add to the sense of reality the film includes snippets of President Reagan's speeches and brig sin Oliver North (Robert Farrior), offers extended shots of flying the planes of the mission, and keeps the dialog in Central America in Spanish. The cast is strong, but the film goes on too long - the saving grace is the performance of tom Cruise who is wholly convincing as the now infamous Barry Seal> A bit of history that now somehow seems more credible than when it was first reported!",8,0,1,7 January 2018
Steve Jobs," 'I don't want people to dislike me. I'm indifferent to whether they dislike me.'
","'I don't want people to dislike me. I'm indifferent to whether they dislike me.' Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire, 127 Hours, Trainspotting) directs this intelligent script by Aaron Sorkin (The Newsroom, A Few Good Men, The Social Network, The West Wing) based on Walter Isaacson's book and the result is a challenging and stimulating evening of understanding the concept of the computer age in the social media stance. Steve Jobs will always be a controversial figure, spearheading the Apple revolution in computers, and now that he is gone many books and films and docudramas emerge as we pry into his private life and study the brain and behavior of a modern day genius.Three words describe Steve Jobs – 'reality distortion field' - his passion and ingenuity have been the driving force behind the digital age. However his drive to revolutionize technology was sacrificial. Ultimately it affected his family life and possibly his health. Aaron Sorkin's tough but brilliant script explores the trials and triumphs of a modern day genius, the late CEO of Apple inc. Steven Paul Jobs.One of the reasons this very long film works is the sparkling cast – Michael Fassbender once again proves he is one of our top actors of the day in giving us all the facets of Jobs. He is more than ably assisted by Kate Winslet's interpretation of the important woman in Steve's career – Joanna Hoffman, as well as those who were around Jobs and influenced him – Jeff Daniels, Seth Rogen, Michael Stuhlbarg, Katherine Waterston et al.A major problem wit the film is Boyle's allowing the actors to speak important passages simultaneously – a choice that may be dramatically accurate but buries the words of the lines in the process. Use subtitles so you don't miss any of the extraordinary dialogue. Despite the minor flaws this is a brilliant movie the gives insights into the contributions of one of the important figures of the 20th century.",10,0,1,21 February 2016
Crazy Heart," Same Old Tired Out Song
","CRAZY HEART is not a bad movie, it is just a repetitive movie - yet another story about a down and out alcoholic/druggie/choose your addiction who has a life turn around moment and climbs out of the mess of a soup he/she made of life. No need to go into details as this film not unexpectedly garnered many nods at the Oscars as have the many, many other films with the same theme in the past. Yes Jeff Bridges is credible as the filthy has been alcoholic country singer Bad Blake, and perhaps it is his ability to make us tolerate his abominable behavior and still stick by him (his modus operandi on his descent into nothingness) that makes his performance gather attention from critics. But unless you are willing to spend the first two-thirds or more of the long film watching him vomit and misbehave, long enough to see his typical AA turnaround and attempt to make up for the deeds soaked in his alcoholic past, you may tire of the theme. Maggie Gyllenhaal gives a solid performance as a woman so bruised by her men of the past that she is able to catch a glimpse into the potential of Bad Blake. Colin Farrell makes a brief but significant appearance as one of the reasons for Bad's going off track. The rest of the cast feels well in tune with the country western crowd and makes us understand the need for music heroes. But in the end it is just another hard luck story, of which there are just too many. Maybe reading Thomas Cobb's novel by the same name would provide more reason to care about Bad than we do.

War of the Worlds," Reason to Recall the Impact of H.G. Well's Apocalyptic Book
","The real dazzler about this reincarnation of an old story is that it IS the reincarnation of an old story. H.G. Wells published his scary sci-fi novel in 1898, Orson Welles terrified the country in his 1938 radio drama version of the book, in 1953 the book became a film, and now in the time of terrorism Steven Spielberg makes the story not an invasion from Mars but an enemy from within the bowels of the globe. Quite a fest for a book over a hundred years old to still seem pertinent.Steven Spielberg once again proves he can outdo most anyone with costly productions. His style is evident from the first moments when the actions seems centered on the broken family of Ray (Tom Cruise) and his ex-wife Maryann (Miranda Otto) as she leaves their children Rachel (Dakota Fanning) and Ray (Justin Chatwin) with Ray in New Jersey while Maryann and her new husband take a trip to Boston. The tension is obvious: Ray is not a father-type and finds communication with his children tedious at best. The Spielberg family drama recipe is set.The action starts almost immediately with newscasts of electrical field disturbances on the media and then the occurrence of lightning without thunder in New Jersey. In rapid motion the etiology of the altered weather is seen to be the emergence out of the ground of huge tripod machines that destroy everything in sight ('Is it terrorists?' Rachel repeatedly asks, driving home the underlying tone of Spielberg's intention of making the story relevant to our time). New Jersey is destroyed but Ray and the kids find a car that works and drives toward Boston for reconciliation with Maryann. What happens between New Jersey and Boston is a battle to end all battles during which time Ray discovers the importance of his fatherhood, the love of his children, and his own humbling recognition that he is but one member of the planet earth.The stars of the film are the extraordinary tripod machines, though Cruise and Fanning hold their own. One leaves the film feeling it could have had more impact had it stuck more closely to the book, but then that's been done before. Grady Harp",7,0,2,24 November 2005
Love Actually," A Holiday Reminder
","Some feel that this perennial favorite film, LOVE ACTUALLY, is a response to the global devastation and fear that the September 11, 2001 created - a deeply felt longing for a return to peace and for acknowledging love. That may have influenced writer/director Richard Curtis to create this series of stories, but whether that is the case or not, this cinematic miracle has become a holiday must see and relive-experience for many of us.The stories - and there are many of them - are set in England the month before Christmas and are as varied as the feeling of love itself: a has-been rock star ultimately discovers his true love is his male manager (Bill Nighy and Gregor Fisher), the Prime Minister finds attraction to a feisty employee (Hugh Grant and Martine McCutcheon), a desiring female longs for a fellow employee but owns her love for her ill brother (Laura Linney and Rodrigo Santoro), a married couple deals with adultery (Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson), a writer discovers true love in a Portuguese maid (Colin Firth and Sienna Guilory), a newly married couple cope with an ambiguous friend's attraction (Chiwetel Ejiofor, Keira Knightley and Andrew Lincoln), a father advises his young son about going for love (Liam Neeson and Thomas Brodie-Sangster) and more.Not only is the story well written and directed and full of Christmas spirit, but it also is superbly acted by an outstanding cast. Get the feeling of love that we need to embrace: try LOVE ACTUALLY. Highly recommended for repeated viewings.",10,1,2,26 December 2019
12 Years a Slave," 'We need a sympathetic ear. If we have an opportunity to explain our situation...'
","Based on the book by the same name penned by Solomon Northup whose biographical date is important to note: Born a free man in New York, Northup was drugged and kidnapped in Washington, D.C. in 1841 and sold into slavery there. He was soon taken with other slaves by ship to New Orleans and sold into further slavery. He eventually came into contact with a Canadian abolitionist, who was able to notify his family of his whereabouts. In 1853, after the intervention of an official agent of the state of New York, he was freed. He filed charges against his kidnappers but after a long trial, the charges were dropped on legal technicalities and Northup was never compensated for his years in slavery. He orally related his story to a New York legislator, David Wilson, who published it in a book titled '12 Years A Slave.' The book was published less than a year after Northup's freedom and it sold over 30,000 copies. He is believed to have died in 1863. The original book was transformed into a screenplay by Ridley Scott for the Cinematic version directed by Steve McQueen.The incredible true story of one man's fight for survival and freedom is disturbing to see and is a fine reminder of the horrors of man's inhumanity to man – slavery – that still exists today. In the pre-Civil War United States, Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free black man from upstate New York, is abducted and sold into slavery. Facing cruelty (personified by a malevolent slave owner, portrayed by Michael Fassbender), as well as unexpected kindnesses, Solomon struggles not only to stay alive, but to retain his dignity. In the twelfth year of his unforgettable odyssey, Solomon's chance meeting with a Canadian abolitionist (Brad Pitt) will forever alter his life. The significant polar roles between evil and good are well played by Benedict Cumberbatch, Liza j. Bennet, Sarah Paulson, Lupita Nyong'o, Paul Dano, Paul Giamatti, Alfre Woodard, Garret Dillahunt among a cast of thousands.The film is overly long, dwells on only the brutality to slaves, and fails to give us background on the most important characters – especially Solomon Northup. It is a very dark song, necessary to remand the world of the crime of slavery, but lacking in moments of light that allow the audience see the history clearly and to make the arc of the story more dramatic. Both Chiwetel Ejiofor ('I don't want to survive. I want to live') and Michael Fassbender are excellent. Grady Harp, March 14",7,1,5,6 March 2014
Wedding Crashers," Guess you have to be in the mood for this one...
","Comedies based on ideas and lines that play for laughs at the expense of other people's dignity have been increasingly flooding the cinema market in the past years. They usually tend to be summer blockbusters and because they make a lot of money and attract record crowds there must be need for them. Go figure.Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as divorce mediating wedding crashers whose chronic hobby is to womanize during women's most vulnerable hours (weddings) is the theme. The first half hour of this overly long (two hour) movie traces them through many a varied wedding circumstance where they prevaricate their way into people's acceptance, the reward being to bed the most gullible females present. Weddings have been used ad infinitum as theme parks for humor, some clever (Four Weddings and a Funeral) and others not. This one falls into the latter category as it takes a premise to extremes then shifts focus in the last half hour in an attempt to redeem itself.There are some talented actors in the cast but few of them are given enough material to justify their inclusion. Jane Seymour in a Mrs. Robinson role has moments, but Christopher Walken as a government bigwig falters. A new face, Rachel McAdams, is welcome and acts as the only truly thought out character in the story. But you have to be in the mood for some cruelty of language, some toilet humor, and a tolerance for over-extended ideas to make it through this one. Grady Harp",3,1,2,5 January 2006
There Will Be Blood," A Long, Dark Journey in the Soul of Greed and Power
","Upton Sinclair's epic novel OIL! has been successfully transformed to a film by screen writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson ('Magnolia','Boogie Nights', etc). The film is a long song (158 minutes), covering a fascinating span of time in turn of the century California when oil gained the lure of gold and transformed the land and the people into creatures of capitalism and greed and lust, and were it not for the presence of Daniel Day-Lewis' powerful performance as the man who makes it all happen, the story itself would become tiresome. It doesn't.Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a silver miner in 1898, but soon discovers oil and begins on a mission to become wealthy, owning most of the oil fields from the mountains of central California to the Pacific Ocean. With his medicine man manner of getting people to do what he wants he pursues his greed relentlessly, disrupting small sleepy towns like Little Boston as he gains access to the wealth of the black gold. There are odd characters along the way, such as the evangelist Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) who become crushable clods beneath Plainview's boots. The progress of the story is well known to most: it is the telling of the tale in the hands of wholly credible, completely physically immersed Daniel Day-Lewis that makes the story seem new.The film's grimy atmosphere is well presented in Robert Elswit's cinematography and the odd musical score by Jonny Greenwood is as ominous as the vantage of Plainview. Greenwood elects to weave classical works into the fabric of the film: when young HW falls deaf after an explosion the silence is partnered by one of Arvö Pärt's 'Fratres', and the film's credits are displayed over the Anne Sophie Mutter/von Karajan recording of Brahms' Violin Concerto. Strange bedfellows, yes, but entirely appropriate to the overall mood of the film. The journey is long and depressing, but the power of Day-Lewis' performance is magic.

Burlesque," Down and Out Good Fun!
","BURLESQUE, written and directed by Steve Antin, is a terrific cinematic definition of what the word 'burlesque' means: 'a literary, dramatic or musical work intended to cause laughter by caricaturing the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects. The word derives from the Italian burlesco, which itself derives from the Italian burla - a joke, ridicule or mockery.' This is a riot of color and good fun and snazzy production numbers a la Bob Fosse takeoffs. The story is predictable and silly and the script borders on mediocre, but with the talent and pizazz of the cast, none of that matters! Ali (Christine Aguilera) flees Iowa in hopes of a career in show biz and happens into a Sunset Strip Burlesque House run by 'still not down' Tess (Cher) who knows her business is failing, despite the solid help from her gay assistant Sean (Stanley Tucci) and the warnings of her ex- husband/partner Vince (Peter Gallagher). Tess has problems with some of her lip-synching cast, namely Nikki (Kristen Bell), and is being hounded to sell her club to the wealthy boyfriend of Nikki - Marcus (Eric Dane). Ali observes, wants to be in the show, but is offered the job of waitress in the club by bartender/songwriter Jack (Cam Gigandet), a guy so kind that he shares his little flat with her. Ali is persistent and when given a chance to audition she gets into the cast. Her trump card is that she is such a terrific singer that she converts the club away from lip-synching into a full-blown song and dance place. Romance of course flutters in as do other little sidebars (including a strange quickie by doorman Alexis (Alan Cumming), but the main attractions are the glitzy stage numbers by a surprisingly fine Aguilera and by Cher herself. It is all very corny and very wonderful entertainment. Definitely worth an evening's pleasure. Grady Harp",10,1,4,5 March 2011
Downfall," An Unstintingly Realistic Examination of the Final Days of Adolf Hitler
","DER UNTERGANG (DOWNFALL) is not only a brilliant film in its close-up dissection of the mind of a lunatic, it is an important historical document that at last gives us as realistic view as possible of the last days of the Third Reich. Written by Bernd Eichinger who based his screenplay on memoirs by Traudl Junge and Melissa Müller ('Bis zur letzten Stunde') and Joachim Fest, directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel, and acted by an all-German cast, this is about as frightening as a story can get - yet a seemingly authentic one.Bruno Ganz gives a searingly vivid performance as Hitler, and while some are enraged that the film shows too much of the human side of Hitler (as though this could make him seem less horrid!), Ganz finds that fine line of presenting Hitler as a delusional underachiever who will go to any lengths to fake a 'caring man' to some while always being short-fused into irrational rages to others. The film takes place in the final 12 days of Hitler's life while he is living in an underground bunker surrounded by many of his fellow ghouls as Russian troops rapidly advance to stamp out his existence. There is condescension as well as blind devotion among the ranks. Hitler marries Eva Braun, informs his confidants that he will never surrender (nor should they) and then proceeds on his plans to commit suicide with Eva, having extracted a promise that their bodies be burned beyond recognition to prevent desecration by the Allies and encroaching Russians. How this grand final plan is carried out is terrifying, especially watching Frau Goebbels (Corinna Harfouch) sedate then poison all her children, and quietly placing herself in front of the firing squad.The spectrum of the horror of Hitler's atrocities is not diminished by this so-called 'humanizing' film: quite the contrary - Bruno Ganz inhabits the role with a verismo that makes Hitler even more terrifying in being a credible mind gone mad. The entire cast of this claustrophobic underground bunker team is superb and the direction makes the 156 minutes speed by. The minimalist musical score by Stephan Zacharias lends just the right tone of eeriness and the cinematography by Rainer Klausmann (shot in St Petersburg and Munich) is stunning. The film opens and closes with the elderly Traudl Junge (the 'secretary' author of the book on which the film is based) commenting on the terrible tragedy in which she took part. The effect is devastating. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, August 05",10,0,1,5 August 2005
Whiplash," 'I was there to push people beyond what's expected of them. I believe that's an absolute necessity'
","Damien Chazelle both wrote and directed WHIPLASH and his film won three Oscars and a lot of fans. It is s difficult film to watch on DVD - the small screen acts life a loaded rifle timed at your head and blasting your eardrums with both jazz and the raunchiest dialogue around. It I basically a two actor show (with some incidental and rather meaningless bit parts tossed in to try to offer a bit of emotional resting during this madhouse of a film.Andrew (Miles Teller) is a young and talented drummer attending a prestigious cut-throat music academy in New York who comes under the wing of the most respected professor at the school, one Fletcher (J.K.Simmons) who does not hold back on abuse towards his students. The two form an odd relationship as Andrew drams of greatness and Fletcher (we finally discover at the end of the film) will stop at nothing to realize a student's potential.Both actors offer top performance (as do the bit part player Paul Reiser as Andrew's father and Melissa Benoist as Nicole- Andrew's minor infatuation), but the film for the most part is a barrage of gross desultory and demeaning filth that pours out of J.K. Simmons' Shar Pei face and mouth. Vicious, cruel, demeaning he finally gets his due in part because Andrew is talked into reporting Fletcher's behavior when an incident happens with a fellow student. The last moments of the film make the first long one note song payoff – Fletcher's drive is intrinsically a desire to make his students be the best they can be. But oh, before that, it gets old rather quickly.",8,2,4,8 March 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," 'The name of the game, moving the money form the client's pocket to your pocket.'
","Martin Scorsese must have had a very bad dream when he decided to translate Jordan Belfort's book 'The Wolf of Wall Street' to the screen. This is one of the loudest, crudest, foul- mouthed, misguided messes ever put on film – and it stretches to three hours (for those with a strong enough stomach to last through that much lying, stealing, crime, debauchery, all manner of substance abuse, and worse yet, the mean-spirited manner of treating gullible people who cannot afford to be scammed into poverty.Wikipedia has a bit a different stance: 'Jordan Ross Belfort is an American motivational speaker and former stockbroker. He was convicted of fraud crimes related to stock market manipulation and running a penny stock boiler room, for which he spent 22 months in prison.' In The Wolf of Wall Street Leonardo DiCaprio plays Belfort, a Long Island penny stockbroker who served 36 months in prison for defrauding investors in a massive 1990s securities scam that involved widespread corruption on Wall Street and in the corporate banking world, including shoe designer Steve Madden. But neither of those capsules prepares us for the outrageously humiliating debauchery of this film's presentation. It is noisy, unremittingly loud and crude, has a script that basically consists of expletives, and in the end makes us feel embarrassed to be a member of the human species. That the film won such acclaim and placed DiCaprio as an Oscar candidate and did so well financially tells us a lot about our current state of mind and taste. To this we've come?",1,5,9,28 March 2014
The Last King of Scotland," How Dictators Rise...and Fall
","THE LAST KING OF Scotland delves into the history of Ugandan leadership in the 1970s with gusto. One of the characters (Sarah, the doctor's wife) wisely observes that the crowds that fill the streets cheering as Idi Amin takes control from Milton Obote had the same reaction for the previous dictator and will have the same for the one who follows Amin. It is that aspect of this very fine film that hits home: the people desperately want to be ruled by a hero who will care for them and they maintain hope that each successive 'hero' will be better.Director Kevin Macdonald bases his 'biography' on the fictionalized novel of the same name by Giles Foden, transformed into a fine screenplay by Jeremy Brock. In order for us to understand the full nature of Idi Amin the story is told through the eyes of a fresh young Scottish physician Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) who leaves his home looking of adventure and settles in Uganda as a mission doctor with Dr. David Merrit (Adam Kotz) and his beautiful wife Sarah (Gillian Anderson). Garrigan learns his role quickly, is attracted to Sarah, but Sarah is wise and turns Garrigan's attention to the rising problem of the overthrow of the Ugandan government by the enigmatic Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker). An incident occurs that draws Garrigan into Amin's favor and much against the advice of Sarah, Garrigan falls under the spell of Amin, becoming his official physician. The two men form a warm bond of friendship and trust and it is through this bond that we see the human aspect of Idi Amin, a man born poor but who has risen to power due much to the connection with the British he loathes.Gradually Garrigan sees the inner workings of Amin's mind, his madness and his ever-increasing brutality as he faces a world as the dictator who will control everything. Garrigan has an unfortunate affair with one of Amin's wives Kay (the very beautiful and gifted Kerry Washington) and as the country is falling under the slaughtering of Amin, Garrigan finally sees his implication in the rule and undergoes the turnabout effects of Amin's brutal strategy. The film ends very quietly with and reenactment of the incident at Entebbe that brought the world's attention to the heinous dictator of Uganda.Forest Whitaker is brilliant as Amin: he has obviously studied the man from newsreels and has been able to go beyond press reports to find the humble man who rose to power. McAvoy embodies the fictional physician and has far more screen time and a more sophisticated role than Whitaker and deserves more praise for this performance than he has received. The entire cast is excellent. For once a film about the violence that erupts too often in Africa pays more attention to characters and the gorgeous landscape of Africa than to fighting and killing: the evidence of Amin's mass murders is shown in photographs and the monstrosity his deeds is carefully focused on one particularly heinous death. The musical score by Alex Heffes uses native songs and rarely calls attention to itself - the mark of a brilliant composer. In the end THE LAST KING OF Scotland serves up a hefty slice of history altered by fiction to enhance the storyline but presents a case for how Amin came to power and the indomitable spirit of the people of Uganda despite the government. A fine film on many levels. Grady Harp",10,2,4,18 April 2007
August Rush," Music and the Harmony of the Universe: A Film for Dreamers
","AUGUST RUSH will not go down in history as a profound film: many will even go so far as to dismiss it as kitsch, maudlin, and a simpleton take off on 'Oliver Twist', and other pejoratives. For this viewer the little film is tender and frequently requires suspension of belief, but in the end the idea of the story does indeed bring a tear to the eye.Based on a story by Paul Castro and Nick Castle and transformed for the screen by Castle and James V. Hart, the premise is that of a fairytale, but an unusual fairytale built around the impact of music. On one magic night in New York City classical cellist Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell) and popular Irish guitarist/singer Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) meet on a rooftop, languishing in their own disappointments with life and finding solace in each other's arms, and that night Lyla becomes pregnant, never to see Louis again, and struggling to keep her baby despite her father's demands to abort. Lyla delivers her baby boy, but the child is immediately taken away (Lyla is told the child was stillborn). 'Evan Taylor' AKA August Rush (Freddie Highmore) is placed in an orphanage, longing for parents he believes he can 'hear' in the music of the spheres. Compelled to find his parents he escapes the orphanage after eleven years and is taken in by Faginesque Maxwell 'Wizard' Wallace (Robin Williams) who teaches his street urchins the fine art of pick pocketing and playing music on the streets as buskers. Renamed August Rush, Evan has uncommon musical talents and rapidly becomes a big money maker for Wizard while at the same time being discovered as a potential pupil for Juilliard by Reverend James (Mykelti Williamson) and his girl singer Hope (Jamia Simone Nash) with assistance from kindly social worker Richard Jefferies (Terrence Howard). August Rush composes a rhapsody that is to be played in Central Park, a chance to place his music before the world and attract his parents, both of whom have returned to music careers after eleven years absence and learn of the existence of August Rush, their 'unknown son'. And yes, the ending is a happily ever after one...Kirsten Sheridan directs with a sure hand and a keen eye toward make believe. The cast is strong, especially Jonathan Rhys Meyers, and the musical score, a very mixed bag, provides a suitable background for the story. This is one of those movies that asks us to go along with a lot of improbable events, but the pleasure of the experience is worth the journey. Grady Harp",8,2,3,19 March 2008
"Hail, Caesar!"," 'He didn't see a Roman or a Slave, but a man.'
","The words above come from George Clooney's character Baird Whitlock (as Caesar) as he finally stands at the foot of the movie lot cross and attempts to deliver a message that gives the movie meaning. But the movie really doesn't have meaning – it is pure entertainment, compliments of the Coen Brothers. And that is why the pseudo-serious phrase is funny.To keep the scenario short, 'Hail Caesar! follows a day in the life of Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin), a Hollywood fixer for Capitol Pictures in the 1950s, who cleans up and solves problems for big names and stars in the industry. But when studio star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) disappears, Mannix has to deal with more than just the fix. Add to this the stereotype films of the 40s and 50s – romances in elegant settings, Bible epics, Esther Williams underwater ballets, Hopalong Cassidy (and all Western) movies, Gene Kelley type dance movies - and movie lots with all manner of shenanigans (star turns, temperamental stars, cowboys who become romance boys because they are 'needed', intrigue, influence of the Communist party aka blacklist, etc) and you get an idea of the fun of the spoof.The major star turn here is Josh Brolin who manages a role that is equal parts tough and likable and funny. He is aided by such stars as George Clooney (of course), Scarlett Johansson, Alden Ehrenreich, Ralph Fiennes, Channing Tatum, Tilda Swinton, Frances McDormand, Jonah Hill, and the team of 'Future Men' (the communist circle who are out to destroy capitalism – with a little help from the inside). The film is Coen Brothers fun, not to be taken too seriously but appreciated for its parody of the Holly wood of the 40s and 50s. Kick back and just laugh.",9,2,4,12 June 2016
American Gangster," A Superb Film That Exceeds Expectations
","This viewer rented the DVD form of American GANGSTER, having passed it by in the theatrical run, thinking that it was yet another 'crime and corruption in New York' genre film. It was surprising to discover that this very long film (just under three hours in the Unrated version) is completely riveting and in a way far different than the usual gangster film: this story, based on real people as outlined in an article by Mark Jacobson (transformed for the screen by Steven Zaillian), and while it has its share of grisly killings, it seems more concerned with the issues of integrity in the face of police corruption as embodied in the character of Richie Roberts, the etiology of the heroin use escalation following the Vietnam War, and the presence of a 'Black Mafia' lead by one Frank Lucas. It is delivered with compelling gusto and intelligence by director Ridley Scott and has some of the best acting of the year. In other words, this is not a film to be lightly dismissed as a Hollywood retread, but instead it is a tense drama with many very fine points.Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) follows the footsteps of his idol Bumpy (Clarence Williams III) who 'ran' the Harlem streets, and when Bumpy dies, Lucas inherits his mantle. Lucas is wise, cunning, a gentleman, a powerhouse of ideas, and quickly finds a way to bring the best uncut heroin from the Far East to the streets of New York at a price that undercuts the other mobsters' product. To establish his control he enlists his family, including his brother Huey (Chiwetel Ejiofor), and rapidly becomes the kingpin of the streets.Simultaneously within the NYPD we meet Detective Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) whose personal life is a mess but who, with his partner Lou (Ted Levine) discovers corruption in the NYPD and more particularly the Drug Enforcement sector of the police: Detective Trupo (Josh Brolin) works with the existing drug lords, grabs their drugs and money and then recycles both to his benefit. During a particular drug bust, Richie and Lou discover a stash of nearly a million dollars and turn the money into the police - a deed that makes the duo seem foolish and lose the respect of their fellow cops but establishes Roberts as a man who is committed to being a good detective.From these two separate studies the film weaves the development of each character and the interaction between Roberts and Lucas we know will take place. The end result may be known to those who followed the story as it developed in the 1970s, but for those for whom this true story is new information, the resolution of the film is fast-paced, thrilling, illuminating, and just plain fine cinema. Both Washington and Crowe are in peak form, as are those in the many small roles (Ruby Dee, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Josh Brolin, Lymari Nadal, Carla Gugino, Cuba Gooding etc). This is more of a drama than an action film and while many may feel the final moments of the movie are weak, they do reveal the true ending of the story and say a lot about the narrow line between crime and criminal investigation. This is one of Ridley Scott's most successful films and one that will be around for many years as a model for the medium.Grady Harp",10,0,1,18 February 2008
Stranger Than Fiction," Brilliant Script, Superb Direction, Best Ensemble Cast Performance: Why no Oscars?
","STRANGER THAN FICTION is one of the more wise, conceptually stunning, finely executed original films to come to the screen in a long time. How this little gem of a film went unnoticed by the Academy is anyone's guess, but viewers' alert: spend an evening viewing this film and new standards for excellence will be set for you.Director Marc Forster ('Finding Neverland', 'Monster's Ball', 'Stay', 'Everything Put Together') is a director of vision, a man unafraid to tackle testy topics, and a genius at pacing a film with a keen collaborative eye with his cinematographer, his editor, his set designer, his casting director, and his actors. Taking the chance of working with first time writer Zach Helm (a gifted artist whose niche in the business is already secure with this first venture) and assembling a cast of some of our finest actors proves successful in every graphically odd twist and turn of this unusual, compelling and unclassifiable story.Harold Crick (Will Ferrell - finally given a role in which he can prove that he is an actor and not just a foolish pratfall comedian) is a boring, number obsessed IRS agent whose every moment of every day is timed to be exactly the same (with the important co-existence with his wrist watch!)...until one day he hears a voice narrating his life, the female voice of loopy and blocked writer Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson) who is writing a story that has a 'Harold Crick' as her main character. Only our boring IRS agent can hear her voice: his loony office friend Dave (Tony Hale) empathizes but can do little else to help him. When the narrator begins to talk about ending 'Harold's' life, Harold freaks and seeks guidance from a literature professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman, in one of his most subtle and refined roles of his career) who knows Eiffel's work and aids Harold in understanding novels, be they comedy or tragedy. Harold also seeks the advice of psychiatrist Dr. Mittag-Leffler (the always superb Linda Hunt) who is of little help, and Dr. Cayly (Tom Hulce) who repairs all upsets with hugs.Meanwhile in his work of auditing citizens he encounters anti-government baker Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal, once again proving that she is one of the most formidable talents in film today), and a bizarre but tender attraction slowly ensues. And all this time novelist Kay Eiffel is struggling with how to 'kill Harold' so that she can complete her novel. Her publisher sends in 'assistant' Penny Escher (Queen Latifah) to ground her and guide her to her novel's completion by helping her observe hospital disasters, vantages, and steadying her grip on life.The manner in which the novel is finished which involves the ultimate fate of Harold and the changes the narration of the novel have had on his life makes up the resolution of the story. And a cleverly written conclusion it is. Zach Helm is obviously a brilliant, well-informed writer who knows how to balance comedy and tragedy, crises of life with the little things that count, and can mold conversations so subtle that they beg to be rewound to enjoy the words repeatedly. Forster wisely uses graphic superimpositions of numbers and graphs and lines to show us the inside of Harold's intriguing mind, all the while allowing us to draw close to the needy and tender aspect of this nerd of nerds, thus making the involvement with his narrator, his girlfriend Ana, and his doctors and professor wholly credible.Some people (this viewer being one) avoided this film in the theaters because of the fear that it may be just another Will Ferrell bit of foolishness: over the top slapstick physical comedy that grows stale after about five minutes. But Will Ferrell here opens an important new door for his career: he can act! The ensemble cast could not be improved upon and it is refreshing to see the widely disparate types of actors gathered here work as a cohesive and impeccable unit. Added to the DVD is about an hour's worth of featurettes that are, for once, brilliantly informative and well worth viewing to enhance the film just experienced. Bravo to the entire cast and crew of this little masterwork! Grady Harp",10,7,13,1 March 2007
The Reader," Literacy and other barriers
","THE READER in the form of Bernard Schlink's masterful book made an emotional impact on those who read it. And for once the book to film version holds nearly as much agony and beauty as the original. The screenplay is by David Hare (whose transformation of 'The Hours' was so worthy) and it captures not only the dialogue of Schlink's novel but fills in the silences with well-constructed added commentary. Stephen Daldry ('The Hours', 'Billy Elliot') directs with great sensitivity to not only the narrative story but to the myriad metaphors that fill the quiet spaces in both the novel and the film. Michael Berg (David Kross, a significant discovery!) lives in Berlin, falls ill with Scarlet Fever, and is given shelter from the rain and cold by a stern appearing Hanna (Kate Winslet). When Michael recovers from his illness he returns to Hanna's flat to thank her for her kindness and there begins a strange and beautiful love affair between a virginal shy lad and an older but obviously emotionally flat yet needy woman. Despite Michael's family's disdain for his absences away from home, Michael surrenders himself to the passion of love and Hanna softens as she pleads for Michael to read to her. Reading and sex become exchanges for this rare couple until Hanna disappears. Michael discovers her some ears later when Hanna is on trial for war crimes (she had been a guard in the concentration camps). Hanna allows her guilt to override reality in confessing she had been the one who had written the orders for the extermination of Jews - this despite the fact that Hanna is illiterate, a fact known only to Michael. While Hanna is imprisoned Michael (now Ralph Fiennes) records his reading of books to send to Hanna and during Hanna's twenty years of confinement she learns to read and write because of Michael's efforts and gifts. Once Hanna is scheduled to be released from prison and the prison matron convinces Michael to be in charge of the aging Hanna, the story takes turns and the ending is so gently painful that sharing it would ruin the impact for those who have neither read the book nor seen the film. Winslet, Kross, and Fiennes are excellent in these very difficult roles. Their performances are enhanced with the supporting cast that includes special cameos by Lena Olin and Bruno Ganz and some other fine German actors. The mood of the film is gray except of the isolated moments of bliss Michael and Hanna share and the atmosphere is well balanced by the musical score of Nico Muhly. This is a film worth viewing repeatedly, there are that many layers of meaning to glean from this cinematic triumph. Grady Harp",10,3,5,16 April 2009
Hitch," Where oh Where was the Script Doctor for the Date Doctor?
","Now and then movies with big name stars and expensive production budgets and PR hype that convince audiences that the Rapture is at hand hit the mat with a thud - and this HITCH is floored in the first half hour (of an overly long two hour movie!). Using a script that uses every cliché from the myriad other films that tell this same story gimmick using females in the Smith role of date doctor, this movie limps along with silly dialogue and pratfall type of comedy, all of which could be forgiven if there was a magical chemistry between the two top stars to make it click.For all the talent Will Smith has demonstrated in the past (despite his recent over the top laffapaloozas like 'I, Robot', 'Men in Black I & II', 'Bad Boys I & II') such as 'Ali', 'Six Degrees of Separation', 'The Legend of Bagger Vance', he seems bent on accepting roles that are beneath him. In this bit of fluff he wastes time talking directly to the audience about the fine art of capturing a girl and then demonstrates his techniques ad infinitum on some blundering characters, ultimately trying to apply his own wisdom in courting Eva Mendes. At this point there should be romantic magic to make this dud work, but the chemistry between the two is so polar that we are forced to wait out a dating game that is less interesting than a Home Depot commercial.The direction is sluggish when it begs to be slick and the acting is rudimentary at best. NOT for fans of the gifts of Will Smith, but if you're in need of a popcorn summer flick to fan away the heat, you might try this lump of ice. Grady Harp",2,1,3,16 June 2005
Shooter," Things are not what they seem: A Study of Governmental Abuses
","SHOOTER is a fast paced, well-photographed, imaginative thriller - the kind of movie that does not allow the attention span to wander for a second if the full impact of the drama is to be appreciated. Based on the popular novel 'Point of Impact' by Stephen Hunter and adapted for the screen by Jonathan Lemkin, this is a story we don't want to know: the Intelligence and Security of the US are shown to influenced by financial gains, greed, and lawlessness - all undercover in the most frightening ways. Director Antoine Fuqua ('Training Day', 'Tears of the Sun', 'King Arthur') knows his way around this kind of material and it is to his credit that he keeps the tension almost unbearably high for nearly two hours.Retired military sniper Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) is living a lonely but secure life in the mountains until he is approached by Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover) to return to the art of killing: the President is threatened by an assassin and only Bob will be able to trace the paces that will prevent the event from happening. Bob returns to Washington, DC, Baltimore, and Philadelphia (the three places where the possible assassination could take place) and leads the FBI and CIA to the point of discovery, and at that time everything changes: to share the facts and events would be to spoil the innumerable surprises that alter the events of the story. Bob discovers who his real friends are (Kate Mara and Michael Peña) and the rest of the film is a chase and destroy mission that has the viewer gripping the chair.Mark Wahlberg continues to prove that he is more than a hunky underwear model (though he is keeping his physique in perfect form!) and delivers one of his most completely realized characterizations of his career. The supporting cast includes such stalwarts as Ned Beatty, Elias Koteas, Rade Serbedzija as well as Glover, Mara and Peña, and each manages to make some fairly unbelievable roles credible. SHOOTER is not a great movie, but as an action/thriller/suspense film it ranks with the best of them. Grady Harp",8,1,5,28 June 2007
Murder on the Orient Express," 'I can only see a world as it should be. It makes an imperfection stick out like the nose on your face.'
","'I can only see a world as it should be. It makes an imperfection stick out like the nose on your face.'Michael Green's adaptation of Agatha Christie's famous novel MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS is updated and at times thinned out so that the Christie trademark tension slags a bit, but Kenneth Branagh does his best both as the director and the star of the film to recreate enough mystery and visual splendor to make the film work well.Many of Agatha Christie's insightful comments are intact - such as 'You know, there is something about a tangle of strangers pressed together for days with nothing in common but the need to go from one place to another and never see each other again.' The plot (which must be guarded well for future viewers) is as follows: Having just solved a mysterious theft in Jerusalem, the famed Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh), is in need of balancing things in his life with a small vacation, in 1934 Istanbul. Instead, the vigilant detective will soon find himself aboard the luxurious Orient Express on a trip to Calais, sharing a carriage with an eclectic assortment of first-class travellers (Penelope Cruz, Johnny Depp, Derek Jacobi, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe et al) and an invisible murderer who walks unnoticed among them. When a sudden massive avalanche blocks the tracks, trapping the passengers in the locomotive, the gruesome murder of a commuter in his cabin will force Poirot to solve a conundrum where everyone is a suspect. In the end, who could be the killer?The cinematography by Haris Zambarioukos and the musical score by Peter Doyle add atmosphere. It is a worth re-statement of the Christie story if a bit too drawn out.",8,2,5,3 March 2018
Defiance," 'Our revenge is to live.'
","This motto serves to sum the feelings of the Bielski brothers as they escape the horrors of the Nazi extermination of Jews in 1941. Adapted from Dr. Nechama Tec's book DEFIANCE: THE BIELSKI PARTISANS by director Edward Zwick and Clayton Frohman this film is as much about family devotion as it is about extended family. It is a touching story of survival under the most impossible conditions and a story of heroism that is far too unknown among even scholars of the WW II period. Set in 1941 DEFIANCE introduces four brothers of the Bielski family (the parents have been victims of the Nazi Final Solution in Belorussia) - the compassionate brother Tuvia (Daniel Craig), angry and reactive brother Zus (Liev Schreiber), and the younger brothers Asael (Jamie Bell) and Aron (George McKay). In response to the war the brothers find refuge in the forest where gradually they encounter other Jews hiding from the Nazis and through thoughtful and clever means form an ever enlarging community where their extended family is fed and cared for and prepared with weapons stolen from the Nazis to defend their existence and protect them from being placed in the death camps. The film is a series of encounters with the enemy but it is also a very touching collection of stories of survival in the wilderness by such concepts as allowing men to have 'forest wives', pitting the religious teachings of a professor Haretz (Allan Corduner) and the pure intellectualism of writer Isaac Malbin (Mark Feurstein), and other interludes of interpersonal coping with tragedy. The cast is a fine one with Liev Schreiber the most convincing, but with a fine new role type for Daniel Craig. There is an odd mixture of accents from each of the actors - each trying to imitate the Russian sound. But in the end the viewer is left with a sense of respect and even awe at the courage and discipline of outcasts surviving a hideous nightmare, simply by staying alive. Grady Harp",8,2,5,6 June 2009
Lord of War," Business as Usual: A Peek at the Weapons Trafficking World
","Director/writer Andrew Niccol makes films with layers of meaning, the kind that find us laughing at inappropriate moments because contemporary life is like that: what on the surface seems like an entertaining story has very dark roots. His previous strange films include 'The Terminal', 'The Truman Show', 'S1m0ne 'and 'Gattaca' and now LORD OF WAR takes its place in that arena of black comedy. Niccol really releases his last spear when at the end of the film there is a statement 'Based on Actual Facts' and at that point the film takes on an altogether new significance.Yuri Orlov (Nicholas Cage) and his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) immigrate to the US to Little Odessa with their parents (Shake Tukhmanyan and Jean-Pierre Nshanian) who have posed as Jews to escape the Ukraine in 1980 - before Glasnost. Yuri is bright and sees gunrunning as a lucrative business and after his first tiny success in the gang infested Little Odessa, he convinces his dreamy-eyed brother to be his partner. The business grows exponentially as Yuri discovers his best customers are countries at war: in time he is wealthy, has married his dream sweetheart Ava (Bridget Moynahan) and settles in as one of the more successful gunrunners in the world. He buys weapons from stockpiled American ordnances after the US has 'finished' a war and sells them to Eastern European, African and South American revolutionaries. He is tracked/stalked by Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) who in his role as a government agent is determined to stop Yuri's dispersal of deadly weapons that result in needless deaths when disseminated to countries in the throes of political change.Though Yuri is first for business, he does care deeply about his wife and child, and about Vitaly whose entry into the world of wealth is soon squandered on a cocaine addiction requiring frequent detox. Yuri is not a mean spirited man: he sees his business as just that, salesmanship of items for which there is a huge demand and he does not see himself as the perpetrator of violence. His life has moments of compassion, many moments of financial success, moments of pride in being the gifted gun-runner he has become, and moments of introspection. He hobnobs with dictators, revolutionaries, fellow gunrunners and the law. The resolution of the story is not an end but merely a tapering off.The film is narrated by Yuri and for the first part sounds almost comedic - until the visual depiction of the killings are on screen. Niccol appears to be showing us a factual business that is legal in the eyes of the government ('Washington encourages gunrunners to take care of aspects of world control they can't be seen as condoning') and it is his gift to drive his message home about how human lives are wasted for the sake of business and weapons proliferation. The film is painful to absorb on this level.Nicholas Cage gives a powerful performance as the opportunistic Yuri and the criminally under-used Jared Leto once again proves his fine-honed acting skills as the drugged addled innocent Vitaly. Likewise Bridget Moynahan is excellent as the wife who elects not to question her source of wealth. Key cameos are keenly provided by Ian Holms and Eaamonn Walker. The film is rapid-fire paced, the cinematography is excellent, and the impact of the film is powerful. It is unusual for a director to take on topics this controversial and end up with a film this entertaining. Recommended. Grady Harp",8,1,2,21 January 2006
Sherlock Holmes," Sir Arthur Conan Doyle Transmogrified by Guy Ritchie
","SHERLOCK HOLMES a la Guy Ritchie - seems like a non sequitur, but the trade off of Doyle's cerebral manner with Ritchie's visceral visual version makes for a very interesting if at times frustrating film. The rather silly screen story was hatched by Lionel Wigram and Michael Robert Johnson (who also penned the screenplay in tandem with Anthony Peckham and Simon Kinberg) and despite the general lack of resemblance of Ritchie's concept of a messy, hygiene-challenged sot of a Holmes (as portrayed by Robert Downey, Jr) the overall result is a Victorian London come alive in a richly colorful way. Jude Law is placed in the shoes of Dr. Watson and makes them fit despite the original's more dignified persona. And the ever present quintessential evil - Professor Moriarty - becomes a rather excessively far-fetched immortal presence of Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), his accomplice is one Lord Coward (Hans Mathesen). Rachel Mc Adams adds to the flavor of Ritchie's kickboxing fast forward fighting Irene Adler, and Watson's affianced Mary Morstan is a look-quickly-before-she- disappears Kelly Reilly. To be fair much of the original smart and sharp witted conversations and mind-workings of Holmes have been preserved: the dialog of the author's style comes in quickly delivered digressions amongst the explosions and CGI effects. The film is a long song and may lose a few to nodding off before the final credits, but stay awake if you can, because the artwork of the credits is startlingly fine! Grady Harp",8,1,2,4 April 2010
The Good Shepherd," Espionage, One Slow Step At A Time
","THE GOOD SHEPHERD may take a lot of patience to sit through the nearly three hour tale written by Eric Roth (Munich, Forrest Gump, Ali, The Horse Whisperer, etc) and directed with meticulous attention to detail by Robert De Niro, but in the end the film about the creation of CIA ('ever notice that no one these 'the CIA' just like no one use 'the God'?'). And although the script confuses the viewer by its propensity to meander over many time frames and many places, the result is a tense attention holding look at the machinations of big government and frightening big Intelligence organizations.We first meet Edward Bell Wilson (Matt Damon, who carries the film well) as a son who witnesses his father's suicide, a fact he will hide for years. He follows in the family footsteps of attending Yale, participating in the infamous Skull and Bones secret club, and progressed to join the government as an agent for Intelligence, eventually helping to form CIA and participate in the Cold War tension with Russia and the Bay of Pigs incident. Wilson is a nebbish on the surface, but underneath lies a man devoted to his country and a man capable of maintaining heavy secrets, even from his wife-of-necessity Clover (Angelina Jolie) whom he marries solely because he got her pregnant. He is distant, covert, and seemingly cold, a trait that he will pass on to his son whose life following CIA results in tragedy.Along the way from this personal side of the story the plot is filled with politicians, spies, Russian, moles, double agents - all the expected and needed characters for a story of this sort. The cast includes such important actors as Billy Crudup, Joe Pesci, Alec Baldwin, a superb Tammy Blanchard, Robert De Niro himself, Keir Dullea, Michael Gambon, William Hurt, John Turturro, Timothy Hutton and Gabriel Macht, each performing excellent cameos. The production values are equally strong with Robert Richardson as director of photography mixing historical footage with atmospheric cinematography, a fine musical score by Bruce Fowler and Marcelo Zarvos, and a tight editing by Tariq Anwar. The film could easily have been cut by an hour without damaging the effect, but there is something to be said for the level of tension achieved by De Niro's choices that gives us a feeling of being a part of the Intelligence schemes. It takes patience, but the film is worth viewing. Grady Harp",8,6,9,4 April 2007
Arrival," 'If you could see your whole life from start to finish, would you change things?'
","ARRIVAL is a refreshing science fiction story that allows the audience to approach the concept of alien visits as something of value rather than the beginning of the end. No comic book antics in this sensitive film based on Ted Chiang's story 'Story of Your Life' and adapted with great skill by screenplay author Eric Heisserer. This is a film that asks us to ask questions about our place in the universe and in the cycle of life using the visitation of extraterrestrials as the stimulus. Denis Villeneuve directs with consummate skill.The dialogue of the film has many rare insights – words that come form the characters such as 'Language is the foundation of civilization. It is the glue that holds a people together. It is the first weapon drawn in a conflict' and 'But now I'm not so sure I believe in beginnings and endings. There are days that define your story beyond your life. Like the day they arrived.'The story line as action is simple – a factor that enhances the importance of the message of the film. Twelve mysterious spacecraft appear around the world. Linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is tasked with interpreting the language of the apparent alien visitors with the assistance of theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner). They join the Army team led by Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) in Montana – one of the twelve areas where the craft have landed. Banks job is to try to learn the aliens' language and enable communication with them. Through regular meetings with two of the aliens she starts to compile a record of the aliens' 'language' - a series of drawn symbols. The important question is - are they friend or foe? Other nations with alien landings are starting to view them as a threat, making it a race against time as war with the aliens could erupt at any moment.With extraordinary cinematography by Bradford Young and a pitch perfect atmospheric musical score by Jóhann Jóhannsson (with a little help from Antonín Dvořák!) and first class acting by both Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner, this is a film that should be marked as a 'must see' experience – for many many reasons – especially at this point in our earthbound history.",10,0,6,18 February 2017
The Blind Side," 'I haven't changed your life, you've changed mine.'
","BLIND SIDE is a quiet little film, one of the type we usually see on Hallmark Hall of Fame on television, that carries a tender message without really offending anyone or challenging the mentality of the viewer. It just happens to be based on a book by Michael Lewis who in turn based his writing on a true story 'the story of Michael Oher, a homeless and traumatized boy ho became an All American football player and first round NFL draft pick with the help of a caring woman and her family.' John Lee Hancock adapted the novel for the screen and directed it. He scored a hit when he decided to cast Sandra Bullock as the brave society no nonsense mother Leigh Anne Tuohy, giving Bullock the opportunity to polish her acting chops to a fare-thee-well. Tim McGraw is very strong as the husband/father Sean Tuohy and the two young actors who play the biological Tuohy children - Jae Head and Lily Collins - are equal to their 'parents' performances. Quinton Aaron is the quiet pacifist Michael Oher who is taken into the household of a Southern family as an equal in Memphis Tennessee where racial bias still exists. It is the transformation of Michael as well as the florid transformation of the Tuohy family (especially the brilliantly realized Leigh Anne) that makes this little film glow. Kathy Bates makes a brief cameo as a tutor for Michael and Ray McKinnon makes his role as the coach credible. And the rest of the cast offer of a very high quality of support. BLIND SIDE is not a great movie, just as 'PRECIOUS etc etc etc' is not a great movie: at the core of both of these films are the moments of light that enter the lives a unfortunate youngsters who then radiate the lives of those who have the courage to believe in the equality of mankind. They deserve our attention. Grady Harp",8,1,2,24 March 2010
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," The parts are greater than the sum
","Well, so the Academy awarded BIRDMAN Best Picture of the Year. Strange choice but perhaps it means that the Academy is taking a different look at Indie- type films instead of the all too huge glut of Marvel comics (though there are certainly elements of that in this movie – the main character does fly solo over NYC and moves objects with a flick of the wrist etc) and potty mouth dialogue (though there is considerable of that in this film, also) and rehab druggie overtones (though that too is part of the story). The acting is very fine from the entire cast, the cinematography is interestingly claustrophobic in the St. James Theater (except for the sci-fi elements outside), and the story has some solid philosophical bits about family, parenting, hopes, dreams, delusions, etc. All good. Much of the dialogue is buried in what has to be one of the most irritating soundtracks ever created. Individually the constant drumming bit is well done – if it weren't competing with the story or the dialogue. The excerpts from Mahler's Symphony No. 9 and the Rückert-Lieder excerpt 'Ich bin der Welt abhanden gekommen', Tchaikovsky's Symphony No 5, Rachmaninov's Symphony No. 2, John Adams' Prologue from 'The Death of Klinghoffer, and Ravel's Passacaille movement from his Piano Trio– all gorgeous and well performed by various groups – simply made no tangential sense, fought with the drumming, and again covered the dialogue.But, this was an experimental movie and as such was a breath of fresh air to be even considered for an Oscar. As for the participants, Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, Andrea Riseborough, Zach Galifianakis, Natalie Gold, and Merritt Wever and, of course, writer/director Alejandro G. Iñárritu all are in top form. Maybe on the big screen it doesn't appear so dissociative.",7,0,4,23 February 2015
Centurion," Futility of Invasion: A Lesson Yet Unlearned
","CENTURION may not be a great movie - very entertaining, but not great - but it does make some points that are worth considering today. The concept of a big power (here the Roman Empire AD 117) making a preemptive war on a smaller, 'different' culture (the Picts of Scotland) cannot help but muster comparison to current US preemptive (and unsuccessful) attacks in the Middle East. Though it is doubtful that the writer director Neil Marshall's cinematic vision included this idea, the historic decimation of the Roman Ninth Legion's failure to conquer the Picts is poignant food for thought. But on to the story. In 117 AD one of the few areas not controlled by the Roman Empire was the northern portion of the British Isles, land of the Picts, a strange tribal like people with determined, terrifyingly ferocious fighting techniques. General Titus Flavius Virilus (Domenic West) is given orders from the Roman Emperor to capture that stronghold, and he is off with the Ninth Legion to conquer. A born leader and beloved by his troops, Virilus fights valiantly but is captured and there is only one man deemed his replacement - former gladiator Centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbinder, a major actor remembered for this disparate roles as in 'Hunger', 'Inglourious Basterds', '300', 'Band of Brothers' etc). Centurion is finally left with a handful of men (JJ Field, Lee Ross, David Morrisey, Liam Cunningham, Noel Clarke, Dimitri Leonidas, Riz Ahmed) who attempt to complete the mission. One mute female warrior Etain (Olga Kurylenko), a Pict turned Roman Guide, quickly turns her allegiance to her homeland and becomes the most treacherous fighter of them all. At one point the son of Gorlacon (Ulrich Thomsen), the leader of the Picts, is killed by a Roman and the ferocity of the battle is heightened. The Roman troops endure untold hardships, are given hospitality by a Pict castaway Arianne (Imogen Poots) with whom Centurion becomes enamored, and eventually only Centurion remains as the sole survivor of the Roman Ninth Legion. The effect of his experience and knowledge of the war failure causes the Roman Empire to decide a fate for him and the rest is best left unsaid. There is little dialogue, but what there is is solid. The battle scenes are appropriately gory and the cinematography by Sam McCurdy and the musical score by Ilan Eshkeri sustain the atmosphere. Michael Fassbinder proves that he is indeed a major talent, and the entire cast is excellent. It is a great little film for diversion, it could easily have been extended (only 98 minutes) for better fleshing out of the characters, but the final words of the Centurion suggest that there likely will be sequels.

The Big Short," 'People are going to be doing what they always do when the economy tanks - blame immigrants and poor people.'
","Adam McKay directs this American historic nightmare for which he also wrote the screenplay with Charles Randolph based on Michael Lewis' book. Despite the fact that the film recreates the (in many ways) origin of Wall Street corporate greed and the loathing of the wealthy bankers for the rest of us who suffered because of their illegal shenanigans, and is cast with some fine actors, the taste the film leaves in the mouth is so bitter that it is difficult to honor this award-winning film with a review.The plot is far too well known to us all (though the language of the film â€“ all in corporatese and financial mishmash is tough to follow) and is best left with a brief synopsis: Revisit the stock market crash and near dissolution of American economy as Michael Burry (Christian Bale), an eccentric ex-physician turned one-eyed Scion Capital hedge fund manager, has traded traditional office attire for shorts, bare feet and a Supercuts haircut. He believes that the US housing market is built on a bubble that will burst within the next few years. Autonomy within the company allows Burry to do largely as he pleases, so Burry proceeds to bet against the housing market with the banks, who are more than happy to accept his proposal for something that has never happened in American history. The banks believe that Burry is a crackpot and therefore are confident in that they will win the deal. 'Four denizens in the world of high-finance predict the credit and housing bubble collapse of the mid-2000s, and decide to take on the big banks for their greed and lack of foresight.'The funky weirdo characters are well portrayed by Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt, Maria Tomei and on and on. They pull off the disgust we feel for corporate greed and manage to recreate this nauseating time in our history very well. It just is not a pleasant film to watch.",8,0,0,17 March 2016
Platoon," Remembering
","Twenty years later, after PLATOON was released in 1986 and brought some of the horrors of the Vietnam experience to the public's media-jaundiced eye, at last the film can be seen and discussed critically. 'At last', in this viewer's vocabulary, includes the fact that more time for healing from actually being in Vietnam in 1968 and 1969 has passed, making the response to Oliver Stone's film more rational. Now the film is a film, not a nightmare memory inducer, and that fact in no way diminishes the power of the message.Oliver Stone wrote and directed this musing on the effect of war on the psyche and emotional crippling that Vietnam produced in those who survived. Stone was there and that makes his cinematic lead Chris (Charlie Sheen), an random kid from a privileged family who volunteers to go to Vietnam for 'patriotic reasons', an exception in the platoon to which he is assigned, the leader of which is the mentally broken and emotionally scarred Staff Sgt. Bob Barnes (Tom Berenger). Chris' positive influence is Sgt. Elias Grodin (Willem Dafoe), and the two are the polar opposites of evil and good. But the main characters of this gripping film are the other kids who daily are subjected to the horrors of life in the Vietnam jungles with the atrocious living conditions of filth, rain, heat, vermin, and the constant threat of the VC hidden in the atmosphere, ready to kill them at any moment. And these conditions along with the destructive effects of the government's insane war result in mankind stooping to its lowest level, such as decimating a village of people in the manner of My Lai.The combat scenes are viscerally rigorous and well staged, but the odd thing about seeing this film as a veteran of that war is how watered down the atrocities now seem: scenes of dead bodies, both US and VC, lying on the ground or being scooped into mass burials ignores the fact that in reality what would have been seen are strewed body parts, unrecognizably torn by booby traps, mines, and powerful gunfire.But there is only so much the public can tolerate and so the film must be tidied up a bit. The impact remains in the eyes of the actors called upon to recreate the veterans. Stone does his best to show the insanity of war, a statement as powerful as any that war must not be the answer in today's world. And we haven't learned. And that is what this viewer is remembering.

Never Back Down," And we wonder about the influence of violence....
","NEVER BACK DOWN is one of those movies you may happen upon while surfing the available films released on television and, out of curiosity or lack of better choices, inadvertently watch. The story by Chris Hauty seems to be a popular one, so many versions of this plot are floating around out there: angry lad meets his match in a high school kick boxing cum brutal fighting smooth ruffian and finds his way back to some semblance of normalcy by a dedicated coach. Jeff Wadlow directs this endless violence parade with some interesting faces - the angry young man Jake is portrayed by Tom Cruise lookalike Sean Faris, his 'underground fight club' opponent Ryan is Cam Gigandet - but the reason to keep watching this otherwise bloody mess of a film is the always fine Djimon Hounsou as the coach with experience and heart Jean Roqua. There is little character development and the dialogue is thankfully sparse, but if watching young men beat each other up is entertaining for you, then this is a film to sit through - unless you happen to locate a good book to read.

The Water Diviner," 'Because he is the only father who came looking.'
","As written by writers Andrew Knight and Andrew Anastasios and directed by Russell Crowe, THE WATER DIVINER is one of the most profoundly moving stories about the devotion between fathers and sons that has been placed before us on the screen. The photography in both Australia and Turkey is astonishingly beautiful and the interplay between past actions and current circumstances that create this story is sensitively interwoven, emphasizing the passionate need for re-connection even after war has torn a family asunder.Based on real events, the story opens in Australia in 1915 where we find Connor (Russell Crowe) divining for water and successfully discovering a hard won well. He returns to his farmhouse and we meet his wife Natalia (Isabel Lucas) whose mind has been damaged by the loss of her three sons away at war – the Battle of Gallipoli. She pleads with Connor to find them, not admitting to herself that they are war casualties – a state of mind that eventually leads to her suicide. After burying his wife he promises her he will find their sons and he travels to Turkey to gain permission to get to Gallipoli, believing that his water divining powers will help him find their graves. He meets with obstruction form the English and Australian military (Jai Courtney) still mopping up after the horrendous defeat by the Turks and gains help from a compassionate Turkish Major Hasan (Yilmas Erdogan) and his assistant Sgt Jemal (Cem Yilmaz). Meanwhile while awaiting papers to gain permission to go to Gallipoli Connor stays in a 'hotel' in Istanbul where he meets hotel manager Ayshe (a brilliant Olga Kurylenko) and her son Orhan (Dylan Georgiades). The relationship is strained because Connor represents the 'enemy' (Australian) but there is a chemistry that sparks and a tenderness and mutual help results. Connor ultimately is allowed to go to Gallipoli ('Hope's a necessity where I come from'), finds the bones of two of his sons, but the third is missing – he was taken prisoner – and it is this remaining live son that binds the story of the love between the Connor, his deceased sons and his deceased wife together in an ending that will gnaw at the emotions long after the film is over.The cast is uniformly excellent with Russell Crowe in an especially brilliant and subtle performance. THIS is an Oscar worthy film. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, September 15",10,6,11,12 September 2015
Wonder Woman," 'I will fight for those who cannot fight for themselves.'
","Director Patty Jenkins knows how to make us appreciate that once tired cliché of Wonder Woman and in her new feminist viewpoint this Wonder Woman is indeed a wonder. The screenplay of the DC Comics perennial favorite comic book heroine was written sensitively by Allan Heinberg based on the story by Zach Snyder, Allen Heinberg and Jason Fuchs who remodeled Dr. William Moulton Marston's original creation from 1941! One of the reasons this version works so well is sharing the origins of Wonder Woman so well: her beginnings as a child ('sculpted from clay by Zeus) being raised by Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) and Antiope (Robin Wright), and finally flying off to defeat the god of war Ares (whatever happened to Mars?). Gorgeous scenery and terrific special effects offer a springboard to the story that follows.When a pilot crashes and tells of conflict in the outside world, Diana (Gal Gadot), an Amazonian warrior in training, leaves home to fight a war, discovering her full powers and true destiny. Before she was Wonder Woman, she was Diana, princess of the Amazons, trained to be an unconquerable warrior. Raised on a sheltered island paradise, when an American pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crashes on their shores and tells of a massive conflict raging in the outside world, Diana leaves her home, convinced she can stop the threat. Fighting alongside man in a war to end all wars, Diana will discover her full powersand her true destiny. In the setting of WW I in Germany the bad guys are Ludendorff (Danny Huston), Sir Patrick (David Thewlis), and Dr. Maru (Elena Anaya), and Diana's allies are Steve (Chris Pine), Sameer (Said Taghmaoui), Charlie (Ewen Bremner). The supporting cast is excellent also.For once the CGI effects enhance rather than distract (until the final confrontation between Diana and Ares), the musical score (Rupert Greson-Williams) fits the film, and the photography (Michael Jensen) is rather splendid. There is enough pungent anti-war philosophy to make the film sail. This is bound to be followed by a series of more adventures: the public loves DC Comics – and in this case the praise is worthy.",8,11,22,22 September 2017
The Queen," Helen Mirren Creates Another Triumph!
","THE QUEEN seems like one of those biographical features that would be difficult to hold anyone's interest - on the surface, without the benefit of knowing much about the content. Queen Elizabeth II is not exactly a figure who generates anything but a response of boredom, so flat and uninteresting is her persona. But enter Helen Mirren, one of the finest actresses on the screen today, and this potentially boring potentate becomes a vibrantly detailed and fascinating portrait of a queen at odds with the times. It is a staggering achievement.Director Stephen Frears, using a superb script by Peter Morgan, details the time from the election of Labor Party Prime Minister Tony Blair (a brilliant Michael Sheen) to that momentous international outpouring of grief and love that followed the tragic death of Princess Di in 1997, showing the bifurcation of response between the Royals and the People as represented by Blair. Instead of the insensitive cold figure that the world witnessed as QE II, Mirren shows us that the woman who is Queen actually had feelings for her grandchildren, a respect for her station as royalty, and was gradually responsive to the cry of the people via Blair's influence, allowing the world to pay proper tribute to a heroine. The ogres in the Balmoral Castle were in fact Prince Phillip (James Cromwell) and the Queen Mum (Sylvia Syms) abetted by the very proper Robin Janvrin (Roger Allam) and the wishy washy Prince Charles (Alex Jennings).The entire production is beautifully filmed with the use of clips from Princess Di's life (and death) instead of creating an actress role to portray her - a very wise choice. The musical score by Alexandre Desplat is superb (with a little help from Verdi's 'Libera Me' as sung by Lynn Dawson and the BBC chorus for the funeral portion). But indeed the accolades go to Helen Mirren in an Oscar worthy performance - with the very strong counterbalance by Michael Sheen. An excellent film about a moment no one will ever forget.

Taken 2," Or 'take 2'; 'What are your gonna do?' 'What I do best.'
","TAKEN released in 2008 was a tightly woven thriller that boosted Liam Neeson's already burgeoning career: he was a killer's killer and managed to garner acclaim from critics and audiences alike. Now we have a sequel (and there may be more, as the end of the film suggests) that just isn't up to the same standard as the original, but for those who saw Part 1, then Part 2 will likely not disappoint.The film opens in Albania where the old father Murad Krasniqi (Rade Serbedzija) is burying his son and some villagers killed by Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) and he vows revenge. Switch to Los Angles where we see Bryan and his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen), who is recuperating from her second divorce, and their daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) who is entering her first relationship with Jamie (a promising Luke Grimes) arguing over priorities. Bryan still loves Kim and Lenore and when Lenore tearfully confesses her frustration that her plans to take Kim to China to regroup emotionally have fallen through, Bryan announces he has a job in Istanbul, Turkey - 3 days worth - and invites them to join him after his job is complete. But of course in Istanbul Bryan's mission involves offing all the people from the Albanian crew and when Lenore and Kim arrive the family is re-bonded until Murad directs that all three be captured and killed. From there it is the predictable cat and mouse games of capture/escape/killing by every means possible/ car chases action and the few who are left in the end make a pact of sorts...and more need not be said.Oliver Megaton directs a screenplay by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen. One of the glories of the film is the opportunity to see the many sites of Istanbul. This is not a bad film at all - it is just not up to the standard of the original even thought he players are the same. Grady Harp",7,0,0,9 April 2013
The Woman in Black," A Smidgen of Edgar Allen Poe, Henry James, and British Gothic
","This is the second cinematic adaptation of Susan Hill's novel of the same name (the last was made in 1989), this one written for the screen by Jane Goldman and directed by James Watkins. As with many British ghost stories (termed Horror, Drama, Thriller by the press) the themes remain the same - just the locales and the names of the characters change. Not that that is a bad thing, but it is nothing novel and if such stories are your cup of tea - shadowy images in darkened house windows, incidental dead children, a suspicious group of townspeople, a lots of candles flickering out because of mysterious doors opening and closing at will - then this incarnation will please. There is very little dialogue and very little character development, but the locations are magnificent, the cinematography is glorious (Tim Maurice Jones) and the musical score (Marco Beltrami) is chilling. THE WOMAN IN BLACK is an elegantly creepy, atmospheric, British period style ghost story.When a friendless old widow dies in the seaside town of Crythin, young solicitor Arthur Krips (Daniel Radcliffe), who lives with his four-year old son Joseph (Misha Handley) - Arthur's wife Stella (Sophie Stuckey) died in childbirth) - and Joseph's Nanny (Jessica Raine), is sent by his firm to settle the estate. Arthur finds the townspeople reluctant to talk about or go near the woman's dreary home and no one will explain or even acknowledge the fact that he inadvertently incurs the wrath of a malevolent spirit, the woman in black. She is no filmy, gauzy wraith, but a solid black silhouette of malice and evil. The viewer only sees her a few times, but you feel her malevolent presence in every frame. Ignoring the towns-people's cryptic warnings (they are trying to conceal a deadly secret), he goes to the house where he discovers its horrible history and becomes ensnared in its even more horrible legacy.Along the way Arthur is befriended by Dailey (Ciarán Hinds) and his strange insane wife (Janet McTeer) and Dailey is the only man willing to transport Arthur across the tide covered marshes to the haunted estate. The story is basically dealing with life after death - in the person of ghosts who stay around to wreck vengeance for their deaths - and the many events that suggest that indeed there is a place after death is borne out by story's strange ending.Daniel Radcliffe manages to carry his role well (the designers keep him with a fashionable 5 o'clock shadow to prove he has outgrown Harry Potter) and the subordinate cast is strong in the miniscule parts they are given. This is a mood piece, a ghost story of the old-fashioned sort, and it doesn't pretend to be otherwise. You either like these films or you don't. I do.",8,0,1,26 May 2012
Saints and Soldiers," On the Battlefield, Personal Survival and Bonding are Essential
","So many films about war, and especially about WW II, focus on the 'good guys' (read Allied troops) versus 'bad guys' (read Germans) and the monumental confrontations that have gained heroic monikers like D-Day, Normandy, Battle of the Bulge, etc. The film crews spend millions to re-enact these epic battles. At times the individuals within the massive units are brought into focus ('Saving Private Ryan', etc) but primarily they are frontal decoration for the Big Effects created to stun the audience.Then comes along a small scale independent film like SAINTS AND SOLDIERS and while the battles are there and realistically created, this time they are background settings for this intimate story of the survival of four men and how that survival and a concerted mission serve to allow each to become wholly vulnerable despite all the societal taboos for honest, fragile emotions in men at war. The only other film of this scale and intent that comes to mind is the Peter Berg 1992 film A MIDNIGHT CLEAR.The story of SIANTS AND SOLDIERS revolves around true events - the massacre of US soldiers at Malmedy, Belgium during the Battle of the Bulge. Four young soldiers escape the German horror: Deacon (Corbin Allred), a lad without vices who had been a pre-war missionary (?Mormon) in Berlin and speaks the language; Medic Steven Gould (Alexander Niver) who was forced to give up Medical School to go to war; Gordon Gunderson (Peter Holden) who has bonded with Deacon; Private Shirl Kendrick (Lawrence Bagby) who is a simple Mississippi boy who has never been kissed. Joining them early on is the parachute entrapped Flight Sergeant Oberon Winley (Kirby Heyborne) who has urgent intelligence gained from reconnaissance during a shot-down plane mission. Together these men survive the cold of winter, lack of food and shelter and adequate arms, and set out on a mission to help Winley deliver his coded intelligence to the Allied troops, a fact that could save thousands of lives.Along the way we learn the various secrets about the individual men's lives back home and their psychological baggage that accompanies them in the snow forests of Belgium. Each has a burden and each learns from the others, agonizing as some are lost, yet compelled to complete their task: Deacon copes with the fact that he mistakenly destroyed a mother and children in a raid, disillusioned Medic Gould has lost faith in a higher being because of the sights of the war and languishes over Deacon's humanity to even the Germans, Gunderson is obsessed with defending Deacon's near fall into shell shock, etc. The now five men are propelled along the course of the war growing from each other's spirits.The photography for this low budget film is utterly magnificent and was shot by the director Ryan Little himself. The story, based on fact, was altered and adapted for the screen by Geoffrey Panos and Matt Whitaker. The actors are true to ensemble acting - all sensitive, each well performed. And while it is difficult to isolate individuals, the work of Alexander Niver and Corbin Allred is extraordinary. Crowning this deeply moving film is the powerful, sensitive, beautiful musical score by J Bateman and Bart Hendrickson. This is one of those perfectly written, directed, acted, photographed, and scored little wonders that restore faith in the integrity of movies. Highly Recommended for all audiences.

X-Men: First Class," Starting from the Top
","Having not followed the various forms of the Marvel Comics X MEN series except for a glance at Wolverine can be beneficial in watching this Prequel. The fantasy is explained rather coherently - mutants have developed and must be undercover for their own safety until leaders emerge, young lads from the year 1944 struggling with their peculiar identity until something pushes them to the point of taking advantage of their supernatural powers and they become committed to gathering all the other mutants together as a positive force by the time they reach adulthood. Or as the PR piece states it 'Before Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr took the names Professor X and Magneto, they were two young men discovering their powers for the first time. Before they were archenemies, they were closest of friends, working together, with other Mutants (some familiar, some new), to stop the greatest threat the world has ever known. In the process, a rift between them opened, which began the eternal war between Magneto's Brotherhood and Professor X's X-MEN.' James McAvoy is Charles Xavier and Michael Fassbender is Erik Lensherr and the mutants the gather around them include Jennifer Lawrence, Lucas Till, Nicholas Hoult, Caleb Landry Jones, Edi Gathegi, Álex González, and even a quick peek at Hugh Jackman. The year switches to 1962 when Russia and the USA were coming close to nuclear war so of course the mutants fight for the end of the attempt while another set of bad mutants under the leadership of Kevin Bacon and January Jones and Jason Flemyng et al face off battling powers of telecommunication and various forms of super human acts an by the end of the film the 'together boys' - Charles and Erik have become Professor X and Magneto. Doting the over two hour long landscape are appearances by Rose Byrne playing the love interest and Oliver Platt simply called the Man in Black. it is a game of subterfuge as well as a gradually coming to terms with being a mutant that keeps the ball rolling to a rather spectacularly staged battle scene as the Russian missiles are making their way toward Cuba and the United States. Matthew Vaughn directs the screenplay written by no fewer than 6 writers ad there are some impressive special effects demonstrated as the characteristics of each of the mutants. Entertaining, yes, and it stands alone well enough so that those of us who have not seen the other installments in the series can enjoy it as a 'beginning'. Grady Harp",Null,1,2,17 September 2011
Fifty Shades of Grey," ' Roll your eyes at me again and I will put you across my knee!'
","Though a few years late in viewing this immensely popular film and not having read E.L. James series of novels on dominant and submissive sexual experiences, the 'better late than never' applies. No, this is not a 'great movie' but as adapted for the screen by Kelly Marcel it is entertaining (though a bit long) and it is cast with credible appearing characters (the central focus couple spends the better part of the 125 minute film without clothes and pushing the usual standards of X rated to the limits - almost). Sam Taylor - Johnson, the British female director manages the situation well. Shy literature student Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) rooms with the worldly Kate (Eloise Mumford) and goes to interview the wealthy Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) as a favor to Kate who is to interview Grey for the school paper. She encounters a beautiful, brilliant and intimidating man. The innocent and naive Ana starts to realize she wants him. Despite his enigmatic reserve and advice, she finds herself desperate to get close to him. Not able to resist Ana's beauty and independent spirit, Christian Grey admits he wants her too, but on his own terms. Ana hesitates as she discovers the singular tastes of Christian Grey - despite the embellishments of success, his multinational businesses, his vast wealth, and his loving family, Grey is consumed by the need to control everything. He gradually introduces (? seduces) into the realm of submission and dominance - and the film ends with a cliffhanger that guarantees the continuation of James' novel. Johnson and Dornan have fine chemistry and make the affaire noir credible. The others in the cast who contribute well are Jennifer Ehle (Ana's mother), Marcia Gay Harden (Christian's mother) and bit parts by Victor Rasuk, Max Martin and Luke Grimes among others.Be prepared for a lot of visual body contact - but of course everyone knows the story and its reason for being because of all the flutter about James' novels.",7,1,2,8 March 2018
The Wolverine," W'hat they did to me, what I am, can't be undone.'
","By now even non-Marvel comics devotees know the persona of The Wolverine, primarily because he has been recreated by actor Hugh Jackman six times (and if you pay attention to the film's ending it seems there will be more). Writers Mark Bomback and Scott Frank have elected to place the action of this version in Japan – both in the time of the Atomic Bombing of Nagasaki and the present. Much of the reason this version works well is due to the fact that the action is all in the beauty of Japan of today – not only the scenery but also the symbols and traditions. Director James Mangold gives this version of Wolverine adventure a hefty dose of compassion and human feeling and that adds significantly.According to the short synopsis form 20th Century Fox, 'In modern day Japan, Wolverine is out of his depth in an unknown world as he faces his ultimate nemesis in a life-or-death battle that will leave him forever changed. Vulnerable for the first time and pushed to his physical and emotional limits, he confronts not only lethal samurai steel but also his inner struggle against his own immortality, emerging more powerful than we have ever seen him before.' That states it well. Add to that description the many fights and magic that occur before our eyes and the content is complete.Hugh Jackman is in buff form as a very tender Wolverine (Logan) this time around (flashbacks to his loss of his love, Famke Janssen, add spice). Others who make solid appearances include Tao Okamoto as the important Mariko, Rila Fukushima as Logan's sidekick, Svetlana Khochenkova as the evil Viper, Hiroyuki Sanada as a credible Shingen, and Ken Yamamura and Haruhiko Yamanouchi sharing the role of Yashida.A bit on the long side, the film provides the expected visual entertainment, and this time there is a bit more humanity infused as well.

Win Win," Needs and how we meet them
","Tom McCarthy is a young gifted artist - actor, writer, director - who has gifted us in the past with such memorable small films as writer/director of 'The Visitor', 'The Station Agent', and as writer for 'Up'. He deals with simple people encountering complex problems and shows us how cooperative relationships make life OK. McCarthy both wrote (with Joe Tiboni) and directed WIN WIN and if there were two words that would best describe this film the title supplies them. It is real, touching without becoming saccharine, and populated by a cast of some very fine actors who deliver a very human story. Mike Flaherty (Paul Giamatti) is a sown on his luck lawyer in poor economic times who deals with elderly people as clients. His loyal wife Jackie (Amy Ryan) keeps their small house in Providence, New Jersey (McCarthy's home town, by the way) in order, managing their two daughters, the funky Abby (Clare Foley) and Stella (Penelope Kindred), in tow. One of Mike's clients Leo Poplar (Burt Young) is entering early senility and the court wants him placed in a home. Discovering that Leo pays good money for a guardian Mike accepts guardianship but moves Leo into a rest home, keeping his house locked up. Mike discovers a young 16 year old kid on Leo's doorstep and learns that the lad is Kyle (Alex Schaffer), Leo's grandson form Ohio who has run away from home because his mother (Melanie Lynskey) is in rehab and Kyle has escaped the abuse of her boyfriend. Kyle is taken in to the Flaherty family (tough Jackie melts and insists they support him). What Mike discovers is that Kyle is a Wrestling Champion and Mike happens to coach the high school wrestling team with his law partner Stephen Vigman (Jeffrey Tambor) and Mike's buddy Terry Delfino (Bobby Cannavale). Kyle's presence eventually leads the losing team to a winning position: Kyle is sensitive to the nerdy loser Stemler (David Thompson) and boosts the entire team's spirit. Problems arise: Cindy comes to town to claim Leo (and get his money) and hires lawyer Eleanor (Margo Martindale) to meet her aims. Mike's finagling of Leo's money backfires, Kyle loses faith in his new family, Leo only wants to go to his home, and all things seem to fall apart until unexpected changes occur in each of the characters. Some viewers will see this as yet another 'Blind Side' type movie - and that is a Positive! Too few films deal with the sanctity of the family and the manner in which true family relationships can improve society at large. Tom McCarthy has managed to create a tender, humorous, realistic, and deeply touching film. Paul Giamatti and Amy Ryan once again prove they are among our finest actors, but it the surprise debut of Alex Schaffer, a 17 year old lad who has been a wrestler but has no prior acting credits, that makes this film glow. The cameos by Burt Young, Jeffrey Tambor, Bobby Cannavale, Melanie Lynskey, and Margo Martindale along with all the other minor characters are superb. This is a film to restore faith in human kindness - a film that would benefit time together with youngsters and adults to observe how the world can tick. Grady Harp",Null,0,2,24 August 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," 'Remember when you left Gotham? Before all this, before Batman?'
","Christopher Nolan strikes again. Perhaps this is the final segment of the ongoing Batman epic, and if so it is going out with a big bang. The film lasts around 2 1/2 long hours but is packed with action and a continuing storyline that basically stays on line for the most part. The special effects are fine and the cast is huge.Without summarizing the plot, we meet a physically and emotionally broken Bruce Wayne aka Batman (Christian Bale who despite his apparent physical limitations still maintains a hunky buff body - that is, the little bit that we see of him in this incarnation), grieving over his lost love form the previous episode, and disappearing form the public spotlight. Even his trusty allies Alfred (Michael Caine) and Fox (Morgan Freeman) fear for his welfare. But trouble arrives in the personage of Bane (Tom Hardy, completely unrecognizable in a funky mask) who is out to destroy all Gotham policemen and Batman. The good guys are Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) and officer Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who stay in the fray despite the appearance of the vicious Selina (Anne Hathaway, who practically steals the show) and her associate Jen (Juno Temple). The supposed savior of the mess Wayne that has allowed to disintegrate as his foundation is a society dame named Miranda (Marion Cotillard), but of course she has other plans. The plan to destroy Gotham is planned by Bane and his associates and the rest is the long long long finale.The cast includes many bit parts for some fine actors such as Matthew Modine, Alon Aboutboul, Ben Mendelsohn , Daniel Sunjata, Nestor Carbonell, William Devane, Liam Neeson, Cillian Murphy, Tom Conti, and Desmond Harrington among MANY others. The writing is fairly well done and does leave the end as either a farewell or a jumping off for yet another installment. Entertaining but a bit long and oblique. Grady Harp",8,1,4,5 December 2012
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Updated and dumbed down: 'I've killed monsters from other worlds before.'
","Someday we will run out of interest in the revisions of Marvel Comics, but for now yet another mind-blowing CGI monstrosity comes out – fine actors attempting to make this thin line of story work. Entertaining? Yes, it did well in the box office, but at over three hours in length and the introduction of yet another enormous hulky beast destroying everything in sight it just gets dreary.The plot, though minimal is as follows: Society is fearing there should be no Superman because of his alien like actions and Batman is the one who agrees and will also take Superman down. While Superman fears that Batman's actions are wreckless and fearing others, owner of Lex Corp, Lex Luthor is plotting something that will destroy mankind. Will one of the heroes fall or will Lex Luthor take over Metropolis? Ben Affleck is Bruce Wayne/Batman (his supporting helper Alfred is Jeremy Irons), Henry Cavill is Clark Kent/Superman and Amy Adams is his Lois Lane while Diane Lane is his mother. Jesse Eisenberg is the evil Lex Luther, Gal Gadot is Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (yes, they did that), while Lawrence Fishburne and Holly Hunter play significant roles. Of course Krpytonite plays a major role but now as huge as the comically ugly beastie that likes to destroy everything – including Superman.We may ask 'why don't they just leave the comic book heroes alone?' But obviously there is a paying audience for this. And after all, it is a chance to seem some popular actors play!",5,3,6,21 July 2016
The Greatest Showman," 'No one ever made a difference by being like everyone else.'
","THE GREATEST SHOWMAN will likely come as a surprise favorite of audience - especially people who avoid sappy musicals. As written by Jenny Bicks and Bill Condon and directed by Michael Gracey, this biography of the life of Phineas Taylor Barnum is a treasure. Rarely doe a movie full of glitz and glamour and over the top antics and dances and big ensemble numbers make sense, but this film does. The film opens with Phineas Taylor 'P.T.' Barnum (Hugh Jackman) joining his circus troupe in a song ('The Greatest Show'), playing to an enthusiastic crowd as he and his performers put on a dazzling show. Cut to Barnum as a young boy (Ellis Rubin) in the 1800's orphaned, penniless but ambitious and with a mind crammed with imagination and fresh ideas, the American Phineas Taylor Barnum (Hugh Jackman) will always be remembered as the man with the gift to effortlessly blur the line between reality and fiction. He marries the girl of his dreams - Charity (Michelle Williams) - and has two daughters who play a major impact on Barnum's life. Thirsty for innovation and hungry for success, the son of a tailor will manage to open a wax museum but will soon shift focus to the unique and peculiar, introducing extraordinary, never-seen-before live acts on the circus stage. Some will call Barnum's wide collection of oddities, a freak show; however, when the obsessed showman gambles everything on the opera singer Jenny Lind (Rebecca Ferguson) to appeal to a high-brow audience, he will somehow lose sight of the most important aspect of his life: his family. In many ways the show take a turn for the better when wealthy young Phillip Carlyle (Zac Efron) joins the company. But the joy of the show is in part due to the ebullient cast of circus players (Zendaya, Keala Settle, Sam Humphrey, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, etc). Sparkling, a bit long on the repetitions of the songs, but a show with a message that leaves your heart hopeful and luminous.",10,2,4,13 April 2018
Casino Royale," Notes from the Other Side
","Not being a James Bond addict this viewer approached CASINO ROYALE in the quiet of the home with the DVD form of the film. For the first time the unique appeal of this 007 character makes sense under Daniel Craig's interpretation. Prior Bond films with the varied actors who have portrayed him have gone for the slick, tricky, smart killing machine whose eyes seemed always on the outlook for the next gorgeous babe he treated with little respect except for physical favors. The various villainous characters seemed to blend and the stories appeared to be more interested in that tired musical soundtrack theme and carnage than they were in character development.Enter Daniel Craig, all buff and uber-masculine, and the beginnings of James Bond's character are explained in a touching manner, making this machine-like concept a deeper being. Of course, credit must go to director Martin Campbell working with an intelligent script by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade which travels Craig's Bond from Uganda, to the Bahamas, Miami, Montenegro and Venice. The chief bad guy this round is Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) who complete with scarred blind eye and cruel gaze is Bond's nemesis. Judi Dench turns in another strong performance as the ubiquitous 'M' on charge of 007's ventures and along the way Bond meets such good/bad characters as Giancarlo Giannini, Jeffrey Wright, and the very elegant and stylish French actress Eva Green whose complex character provides all the information we needed to know about James Bond's view of women.CASINO ROYALE is a strong 2 1/2 hour film that for this viewer makes James Bond an interesting character in addition to being a suave stunt/lady-killer man. Daniel Craig is in fine form (literally) and proves his mettle here. This viewer will see the next Bond/Craig film in the theaters! Grady Harp",8,1,3,10 April 2007
La Vie En Rose," The Fragile yet Indomitable Little Street Sparrow: Édith Piaf in Fragments
","That 'La Môme' AKA 'La Vie En Rose' is a triumph for actress Marion Cotillard who manages to inhabit the persona of Édith Piaf is a given. This is a powerful, deeply moving tribute to a musical phenomenon whose impact on the world remains as heady as during her short lifetime (December 19, 1915-October 11, 1963). She remains a French icon but her singing and her life belong to the world: who can resist her 'poignant ballads performed in a heartbreaking voice', the result of her life as an unwanted child, raised in a brothel, starting her career as a street singer with her circus contortionist father only to be discovered and given the opportunity to sing in a cabaret, a move that brought her to the attention of the world and made her one of the most sought after singers on the world's stages? No matter the degree of involvement in music, everyone has heard and reacted to her most famous songs 'La vie en rose', 'Hymne à l'amour', 'Milord', ' and of course her signature song 'Non, je ne regrette rien'.Writer/director Olivier Dahan (with assist from Isabelle Sobelman) has elected to present Piaf's impact on the world not as a linear biopic but rather as fragments from her existence as a child protected in a brothel by prostitute Titine (Emmanuelle Seigner), her life as a street singer with her pal Mômone (Sylvie Testud), her 'discovery' by Louis Leplée (Gérard Depardieu), her descent into alcoholism and drug addiction after the loss of the love of her life - a married boxer Marcel Cerdan (Jean-Pierre Martins), and her eventual fame in New York. Oddly the impact she had on the French people during World War II is ignored and there are other large chunks of her life story that are missing. But in the end the fragments we are given allow us to empathize and understand the persona of Édith Piaf, and that makes any other misgiving irrelevant.Devan obviously found the perfect actress in Marion Cotillard ('A Very Long Engagement', 'A Good Life', 'Pretty Things', etc) whose immersion in the role is breathtakingly brilliant. The feature accompanying the film on the DVD (already 141 minutes in length!) allows us to see and hear the manner in which Devan and Cotillard recreated Piaf in makeup, costume, body language and of course impeccable lip-syncing of Piaf's songs. This is a film that lingers in the mind not only as a memory of a great artist but also as a reminder of how even the most broken of spirits can survive and succeed. Stunning!

Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Woody Allen's View of Love, Infatuation and Relationships
","Woody Allen has written and directed another European based film that feels like a view across the pond toward America: Allen is still Allen, but with the comparison of European attitudes with American narcissism makes this little film a bit more bitter than most of his others. As with most of Allen's movies, as fine as they are there are usually some annoying elements. In VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA that element is in the presence of an unseen narrator (Christopher Evan Welch) who provides the bridges among the various aspects of the film, bridges that in the presence of such a fine cast are unnecessary in fleshing out the characters and their odd situations. Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) are best friends who have elected to spend a summer in Barcelona: Vicky intends to pursue her studies of Catalan art and architecture while Cristina needs to recover from her completion of a disappointing 12 minute film. Vicky is a pragmatist engaged to a 'good prospect' named Doug (Chris Messina) while Cristina longs for the unusual - something that will fill the gap in her perception that she is without talent. The two girls meet a famous artist Juan Antonio Gonzano (Javier Bardem) who, recovering from a strangely abusive marriage to the flamboyant Maria Elena (Penélope Cruz), puts the make on the two girls for a ménage a trois. Vicky is disgusted, Cristina is fascinated and somehow the trio is off for a wild weekend that turns into a strange interplay of even stranger personality types. Juan loves both, beds both, and problems arise - especially when his still beloved tempestuous Maria Elena arrives on the scene. Just about every variation of relationships is explored during this film with the audience more than willing to go along with the twists and turns that never cease to surprise and entertain. Once again Javier Bardem proves he is one of our strongest actors on the screen and Penélope Cruz lights up the story like a rocket. Watching them both is reason enough to see this film. As for the script, Allen allows each of the characters to reference an aspect of Allen's own quirks, and in the end we have indeed heard yet another diatribe of how Woody Allen sees himself and the people who enter his sphere. The film is colorful, rich in fine music, and blessed with an impeccable cast. If it just didn't superimpose that narrator as a tour guide....Grady Harp",8,1,4,31 January 2009
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," A Visual Feast, A Tedious Film
","ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE isn't golden. Expectations were high after Cate Blanchett's first foray in 1998 as Elizabeth I, but somehow this follow-up film, with the same director (Shekhar Kapur) and writer (Michael Hirst with assistance from William Nicholson), does not reach those heights. Visually stunning, with an endless array of knockout costumes for Blanchett, special effects and scenery as majestic as any that have been photographed by fine cinematographer Remie Adefarasin and a musical score by Craig Armstrong and AR Rahman - all of these fine attributes cannot cover the weak script and the general lack of character development that hampers the usually exceptional core of actors.The portion of Elizabeth's history covered by the film is the battle with Spain, England being the only country not participating in the Holy War in Europe under the direction of King Philip II of Spain (Jordi Mollà), complete with the surprise decimation of the approaching Spanish Armada due to the heroism and commitment of Elizabeth with her people. The surrounding events include Elizabeth's dalliance with Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) and the traumatic (for Elizabeth) beheading of Mary Stuart (Samantha Morton), under the advisement of Elizabeth's trusted Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush).Blanchett is a consummate actress and manages to inhabit the persona of Elizabeth as much with her glances and body language and silences as with the meager material from the script. She IS a Queen reborn. The remainder of the cast is adequate though shallow, and while each has very little to say they maintain an atmosphere of Elizabethan England. This is a DVD that could well be watched without the soundtrack and still be entertaining for the visual splendors. It could have been so much more. Grady Harp",6,1,2,8 February 2008
Saving Mr. Banks," 'Don't you ever stop dreaming. You can be anyone you want to be.'
","The cinematic version of story of PL Travers' book-into-film that was to become Walt Disney's Mary Poppins, written by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith and directed by John lee Hancock, is light and fluffy and fun – and a bit too long. It boasts a fine cast and for the most part is credible.The plot has been described as follows: 'When Walt Disney's daughters begged him to make a movie of their favorite book, P.L. Travers' Mary Poppins (1964), he made them a promise - one that he didn't realize would take 20 years to keep. In his quest to obtain the rights, Walt comes up against a curmudgeonly, uncompromising writer who has absolutely no intention of letting her beloved magical nanny get mauled by the Hollywood machine. But, as the books stop selling and money grows short, Travers reluctantly agrees to go to Los Angeles to hear Disney's plans for the adaptation. For those two short weeks in 1961, Walt Disney pulls out all the stops. Armed with imaginative storyboards and chirpy songs from the talented Sherman brothers, Walt launches an all-out onslaught on P.L. Travers, but the prickly author doesn't budge. He soon begins to watch helplessly as Travers becomes increasingly immovable and the rights begin to move further away from his grasp. It is only when he reaches into his own childhood that Walt discovers the truth about the ghosts that haunt her, and together they set Mary Poppins free to ultimately make one of the most endearing films in cinematic history.'Emma Thompson offers a fine caricature of PJ Travers, Tom Hanks is Tom Hanks as Walt Disney, but the credits for stunning performances go to Colin Farrell and Ruth Wilson as the parents of Travers as young child. If the rest of the film feels a bit 'pushed' then remember it is about Walt Disney.",7,1,3,2 November 2014
Thor: The Dark World," 'Well done, you just decapitated your grandfather!'
","Nine screenwriters assemble the dissociate jumbled element of this second installment in the THOR series (the first being directed by Kenneth Branagh and this one directed by Alan Taylor) and despite the presence of a very similar cast this version depends more on spectacular CGI effects than on acting. It is a movie for lovers of comic book tales and it just bounces between firestorm and dissolution of nine realms to London and back. The plot? This synopsis makes a little sense of it: ' Thousands of years ago, a race of beings known as Dark Elves tried to send the universe into darkness by using a weapon known as the Aether. Warriors from Asgard stop them but their leader Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) escapes to wait for another opportunity. The warriors find the Aether and since it cannot be destroyed, they try to hide it. In the present day, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) awaits the return of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) although it has been two years since they last saw once another. In the meantime, Thor has been trying to bring peace to the nine realms. Jane discovers an anomaly similar to the one that brought Thor to Earth. She goes to investigate, finds a wormhole, and is sucked into it. Back on Asgard, Thor wishes to return to Earth but his father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins) refuses to let him. Thor learns from Heimdall (Idris Elba), who can see into all of the realms, that Jane disappeared. Thor then returns to Earth just as Jane reappears. However, when some policemen try to arrest her, an unknown energy repulses them. Thor then brings Jane to Asgard to find out what happened to her. When the energy is released again, they discover that when Jane disappeared, she crossed paths with the Aether and it entered her. Malekith, upon sensing that the time to strike is now, seeks out the Aether. He attacks Asgard and Thor's mother Frigga (Rene Russo) is killed protecting Jane. Odin wants to keep Jane on Asgard so that Malekith will come. Thor disagrees with his plan, so with his cohorts, he decides to take Jane away. He enlists the aid of his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Unfortunately, Loki's motivations remain unknown.' The other good folks on Asgard are portrayed by Jamie Alexander, Zachary Levi, Ray Stephenson, Tadanobu Asano, and the folk down on earth are Stellan Skarsgård, Kat Dennings, Jonathan Howard, and Chris O'Dowd. Oh and there is a cast a thousands of Asgardians and Dark Elves to tear up the screen. The real star is the team of CGI artists.For THOR addicts, this is an entertaining film. For others, not so much...",4,0,2,1 April 2018
Lucy," 'Life was given to us a billion years ago. What have we done with it?'
","Viewers can elect the mindset to watch this strange but extraordinarily beautiful (splendid special effects by Philippe Hubin and crew, cinematography by Thierry Arbogast, and music by Eric Serra) film written and directed by Luc Beeson (Transporter series, Taken series, The Fifth Element Taxi, etc). It is a film that pushes our imagination, offers fascinating insights about the possibilities of brain function, and takes a different stance on fantasy thrillers.Opening in Ethiopia we meet Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) and Richard (Pilou Asbæk) – Richard is asking Lucy to deliver a mysterious briefcase to Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi). But immediately Lucy is caught up in a nightmarish situation where she is captured and turned into a drug mule for a new and powerful synthetic drug. When the bag she is carrying inside of her stomach leaks, Lucy's body undergoes unimaginable changes that unlock her mind's full potential 100%. With her newfound powers, Lucy turns into a merciless warrior intent on getting back at her captors. She receives invaluable help from Professor Norman Morgan Freeman), the leading authority on the human mind, and French police captain Pierre Del Rio (Amr Waked). Watching Lucy's expanding brain power provide extensive insights and control is astonishing and the entire film is enhanced by not only the intelligent words from Professor Norman but also the flashbacks to the beginning of life on the planet, dizzyingly fast forwarded to now and the world Lucy must face. Try to pay less attention to the plethora of Chinese gangsters and focus on the intelligent possibilities and the film will remain in the back of your mind long after the credits run.",9,3,9,27 January 2015
RED," Ripping Good Entertainment!
","RED (aka Retired Extremely Dangerous) is the moniker assigned to four retired CIA operatives, and if ever there were a film that demonstrates that folks beyond retirement age are still impressively functional, this is it. The story is adapted from the graphic novel by Cully Hamner and Warren Ellis by screenwriters Jon and Erich Hoeber and directed with great style by Robert Schwentke. But has been said often, it is the brilliant cast of experienced actors that makes this film one to treasure as simply splendid entertainment. Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) is bored in his retirement; his only point of interest is a recurrent telephone conversation regarding his pension check with an equally bored government worker Sarah Ross (Mary-Louis Parker in a role that finally gives the range of her comedic talent its due!). Their conversations are overheard by the CIA - William Cooper (Karl Urban) and his boss Cynthia Wilkes (Rebecca Pidgeon) - and Frank is marked for assassination. Bu told frank is wily and outsmarts and out shoots his intruders, escapes to take Sarah away from her boring desk job and a caper begins. It seems there is a plot to uncover the USA Vice President's involvement in a Guatemala coups and Frank seeks out his old confreres - Joe (Morgan Freeman, living in a nursing home but very alert and involved with CIA thinking patterns), Marvin (John Malkovich, a half crazy near delusional but very fine marksman living in an underground hideaway), and Victoria (Helen Mirren, living the elegant life of teas and social activities while privately still taking contract jobs to knock off bad people). At first Sarah is perplexed by the 'abduction' on the part of Frank, but soon becomes an involved participant in the drive to expose the secret of the Vice President. The group engages a retired Russian spy (Brian Cox) who just happens to be Victoria's old boyfriend, and together these REDs use their skills, and brains, and great humor to achieve their goal. It is the old REDs against the young CIA agents that provides the tug of war that makes the film soar. The cast sparkles in this richly colorful movie brimming over with CGI effects and impossible situations. This is not a deep film but a movie that will entertain form the first frame to the final rather surprising episode. It is a pleasure to simply watch the talents of Willis/Mirren/Freeman/Malkovich/Parker/Cox interact like so many pieces of a fine Swiss watch: they obviously love what they are asked to do!

Flight," 'Nobody could've landed that plane like I did.'
","FLIGHT is a film that attracts devotees of Denzel Washington - and for good reason because he gives a convincing performance as a conflicted alcoholic cocaine addict who despite the fact that he wastes most of his life and relationships with his substance abuse, he still is one of the finest pilots in the air. And if that is the reason for watching his overly long attenuated movie then the rewards will be there.The story as written by John Gatins and directed by Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump, Back to the Future etc) begins correctly enough with a wasted Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) still drunk and drug addled with his flight attendant girlfriend Trina (Nadine Velazquez) interrupted by a telephone call form Whips ex-wife requesting tuition, money for their son. The two snort cocaine to get going from their hangovers and they are off to a flight to Atlanta. Once aboard Whip's instability is noted by his anxious new co-pilot Ken (Brian Geraghty) but despite poor weather the flight takes off only to crash a bit later: Whip manages to pull it together enough to bring the airplane down in a field losing only six people in the crash (one being Trina). The rest of the film is an endless diatribe of Whip recovering, getting control of his substance abuse only to repeatedly lose if again, meeting a pretty junkie Nicole (Kelly Reilly in a stand out role) who becomes his lover, meeting a terminal cancer patient Tiki (Charlie E. Schmidt), being counseled by his best friend Charlie (Bruce Greenwood) who brings in a lawyer Hugh (Don Cheadle) to attempt to cover-up the fact that the investigation of the crash has shown that Whip was impaired by his excesses. A 'resource' Harling Mays (John Goodman) keeps Whip supplied with drugs up to the last moment and it is only at the hearing (finally) that Whip confesses to investigator Ellen (Melissa Leo) that he was indeed drunk during the flight and in turn pays for the guilt with which he has been struggling in his semi- sober moments.The cinematography during the airplane crash is excellent and the supporting cast is very strong, but despite Washington's performance the movie misses on so many levels due to incomplete working through of sidebar plot lines. The salvation for the film is in the last five minutes of fine acting by Washington, but by that time the audience is very tired of the manner in which a gifted pilot has wasted his (and everyone else's around him) life that clock watching takes over.

Unbroken," 'A moment of pain, is worth a lifetime of glory.'
","Biopics touch people in a way few other stories do. In the case of UNBROKEN the film detailing the life of Louis Zamperini, from childhood in Torrance, California where he was a problem child until his brother Peter challenged him in more ways than one (and who has the most memorable lines in the script) to encourage Louis to run until he not only became part of the school track team but also an Olympic Gold Medalist and ingrained in his the indomitable spirit sense that reigns throughout this story. From the Olympics Louis joins the armed forces during World War II, sustained fighter plane crash only to be afloat at sea with his two companions for 47 challenging days then captured by the Japanese and placed in prisoner of war camps where he endures the cruel harsh punishment POWs traditionally undergo. The story is well known because of the history books and because of Laura Hillenbrand's novel. The screenplay is pasted together by Joel and Ethan Coen, Richard LaGravenese and William Nicholson and the film is directed sensitively by Angelina Jolie. Louis is portrayed by Jack O'Connell and his two at-sea mates are played by Domhnall Gleeson and Garret Hedlund. They all give credible performances as do Takamasa Ishihara the head of the prison camps, and Jai Courtney and Finn Wittrock who play major roles while the lads are airbourne. A point is made during this very long film that Louis tells God and Jesus that if he survives he will devote his life to their service – and then that is dropped somehow. The film does a fine job portraying the horrors of war, of prisoner of war camps, of the act of survival and in doing so it becomes a very moving experience. One wishes an editor would have been more sensitive to the prolonged sequences – at sea, in camps – but the film should have been made and we should never forget stories of truth such as this.",8,8,13,7 April 2015
Munich," 'Home is all that matters'
","Attempting to understand what drives people to kill other people for any reason is, in the pit of the soul, a challenging enigma. Whether that 'reason' is war between countries at odds, protecting one's self when endangered, revenge or vengeance for deeds perpetrated by 'the other', for panic in the moment of survival - each of these feels wrong despite the fundamental belief to the contrary at the moment of killing. MUNICH is about killing, about vengeance, about protection of 'home', about existence in a world so bifurcated by age-old schisms, and about us. And while absorbing all of the 2 1/2 hour plus visual and philosophical information put forth in this epic film, the viewer is so paralyzed by the story that blinking for a second seems irreverent.The tragedy of the 1972 Olympics - the brutal kidnapping and murder of eleven Israeli athletes by masked Arab/Palestinian marauders - is brought to the screen with brave and gutsy realism by a brilliant script by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth based on George Jonas' book Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team, directed with straightforward, no-nonsense sensitivity to all participants by Steven Spielberg, and brought to life by a cast that simply could not be finer. From the opening of the film sans credits with the Black September act of breaking into the Olympic games in Munich, the film moves swiftly through the formation of an anti-terrorist league of Israeli assassins whose job it is to hunt down the killers and murder them, to the final painfully unsettled end. This is all under the instruction and guidance of Golda Meir (brilliantly played by Lynn Cohen) and her advisors.The team of Avner (Eric Bana), Steve (Daniel Craig), Carl (Ciaran Hinds), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), Hans (Hanns Zischler), and Mossad Accountant (Oded Teomi) are instructed by Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush) and stripped of their identities to enter this mission. They roam the world based on information purchased from a secret group led by Louis (Mathieu Amalric) and Papa (Michael Lonsdale). Gradually growing into the roles of assassins the group begins to murder each of the perpetrators until their success is noticed by all manner of secret agencies (including the American CIA) and the tables are turned: the lives of the Israeli assassins are as endangered as those of the Arab murderers. In a particularly touching moment in the dark, Avner and a Palestinian soldier debate the need for the state of Israel and the opposite need for holding onto home by the Palestinian: it is a moment of writing that sums up the entire Israeli conflict.The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski and the music score by the always fine John Williams add dimensions of atmosphere to this dark film, but it is Spielberg doing what he does best in directing attention to moments in history that will never be buried that makes this phenomenal movie an emotional experience for everyone, no matter their political or religious beliefs. It is simply a brilliant film about the need for Home - that sacred place whether internal or external that maintains the reason to live and even to die for it. Highly Recommended.

Looper," 'You're going to kill this guy, your own self?'
","LOOPER did fairly well in the box office in October 2012 and now that it is available on Instant Video and in DVD the popularity grows. Written and directed by Rian Johnson it is another take on the concept of time travel (a topic that never seems to miss with audiences) and while the film is entertaining, it is very bloody and gory and the only salvation is the fact that the cast contains some of filmdom's more popular actors.The story is best summarized by the lead character in the film, Joe played with skill (despite phony makeup trying to make him resemble Bruce Willis – his looper self) by Joseph Gordon- Levitt: 'I work as a specialized assassin, in an outfit called the Loopers. When my organization from the future wants someone to die, they zap them back to me and I eliminate the target from the future. The only rule is: never let your target escape... even if your target is you.' Or, stated another way, in 2074, when the mob wants to get rid of someone, the target is sent 30 years into the past, where a hired gun awaits. Someone like Joe, who one day learns the mob wants to 'close the loop' by transporting back Joe's future self (Bruce Willis). So the film opens in the year 2044, and Joe is a looper, friends with Seth (Paul Dano in a very brief appearance) and lovers with Suzie (Piper Perabo) and working for head looper Abe (Jeff Daniels). Joe discovers his next assignment is himself (Bruce Willis, Joe from the future). He also encounters Sara (Emily Blunt) who knows the strange coincidences that are about to happen (!) and mothers a child Cid (Pierce Gagnon) who has particularly useful end-of-the - world powers etc etc.It is a clever idea and if time travel and assassinations fascinate you, then this is a well-made move in that genre.

Life," 'I know what I feel is not rational, not scientific.'
","LIFE lacks life. Screen writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick have attempted to offer the audience the feeling of discovering life on another planet but the story is slime and gets lost in the camera work and fascinating (for a while) floating crew and corridors of a space station. Daniel Espinosa directs – or rather manages the action.Six astronauts aboard the space station study a sample collected from Mars that could provide evidence for extraterrestrial life on the Red Planet. The crew (Ryan Reynolds briefly, Jake Gyllenhaal, Rebecca Ferguson, Kiroyuki Sanada, Olga Dihovichnaya, Ariyon Bakare) determines that the sample contains a large, single-celled organism - the first example of life beyond Earth. Bu things aren't always what they seem. As the crew begins to conduct research, and their methods end up having unintended consequences, the life form (oddly octopus like) proves more intelligent than anyone ever expected. Despite the paucity of story the fine cast manages to make us care about each other and each tragedy they encounter and offer a quiet warning of how perhaps exploring life on other planets is not that great an idea. Special effects (Celia Bobak et al) are spectacular but become wearing, and the camera work by Seamus McGarvey tends to produce vertigo. Interesting film, but slight.

Heat," Another look 17 years later
","HEAT made a big splash in 1995 and there was a lot of controversy about the amount of violence in the film. Now 17 years later the film still remains a strong hallmark of cops and robbers genre films but the violence pales in comparison to what we are exposed to at present. Michael Mann who both wrote and directed this suspenseful thriller went on to direct and produce such films as Public Enemies, Miami Vice, Collateral, Ali, The Insider, Texas Killing Fields, Hancock and The Kingdom and he hasn't lost his touch with action cinema. Another entertaining aspect of looking at these big films of the past is seeing the beginnings of the careers of some young actors and observing the work of the solid character actors at their prime.One summary of the plot that briefly lays out the story follows: Neil McCauley is a thief... an expert thief... one of the best. His philosophy in life - become attached to nothing in life that you can't walk away from in 30 seconds if you spot the 'Heat' around the corner. His crew of criminals is a high-tech outfit pulling off professional jobs that impress even the likes of Detective Vincent Hanna. But Hanna, a man driven through life only by his work, becomes obsessed, at the expense of his private life, with bringing McCauley down. As McCauley's crew prepare for the score of a lifetime, and Hanna's team tries to bring him in, the two find that they are challenged by the greatest minds on the opposite side of the law that either one has ever encountered.The superb cast includes Robert DeNiro as McCauley and Al Pacino as Hanna and the multiple supporting roles are filled by the likes of Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Diane Venora, Amy Brenneman, Ashley Judd, Mykelti Williamson, Dennis Haysbert, William Fichtner, Natalie Portman, Kevin Gage, Hank Azaria and Jeremy Piven. The cinematography and special effects are ahead of their time and the movie plunges the viewer into the underbelly of Los Angeles like few other films have been able to match. It is still a viable contender for one of the 'famous cops and robbers' films. Grady Harp",10,0,2,28 February 2013
50_50," 'We all have to die at one point. It is part of life.'
","It is unclear why this film - 50/50 - isn't in the lists for Academy Awards nominations. Perhaps it is because the subject matter (cancer) is tough or because the PR for the film wasn't broad enough. But watch it for yourself and marvel at the script (written by Will Reiser based on his own story of having cancer), the direction by Jonathan Levine who understands how to balance the two faces of life - comedy and tragedy - as well as anyone, and the astonishing sensitive acting of Joseph Gordon-Levitt and one of the finest ensemble casts assembled. This is a film that examines the effect of a cancer diagnosis on a young man, his friends, his love life, and the people with whom he comes into contact because of his disease. And those people include us, the audience.Adam Lerner (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a 27 year old writer of radio programs, happy with living with his artist girlfriend Rachel (Bryce Dallas Howard) and spending his idle hours with his wisecracking goofy friend Kyle (Seth Rogen), has some back pain while jogging, visits a cold impersonal doctor (Andrew Airlie) who flatly diagnoses Schwannoma/Neurofibrosarcoma and informs Adam he must undergo chemotherapy to shrink the tumor of his spine before he can undergo surgery - the combined treatments offer a 50/50 chance of survival. Adam blindly accepts the information, shares it with Kyle, Rachel, and ultimately his mother (Anjelica Huston) and Alzheimer father (Serge Houde) - each of whom has a different reaction to the news: Kyle worries the Adam's relationship with Rachel is bogus (Rachel is having an affair despite the fact that she claims she will 'be there' for Adam), his mother overreacts a bit and joins a support group for families with cancer diagnosed, Rachel leaves, and Adam begins chemotherapy.At the hospital Adam joins two cancer victim men undergoing chemotherapy (Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer) and the three become close, sharing marijuana macaroons and keeping things light. Adam is assigned to a psychotherapy doctoral student Katherine (Anna Kendrick) who is younger than Adam and the two begin a series of sessions that, though awkward, open windows onto reality and to their individual and shared emotional backgrounds. Adam's chemotherapy succeeds in causing hair loss, headaches and vomiting but doesn't shrink the tumor. Adam is lined up for surgery and each person in Adam's life shows Adam their true colors.Author Will Reiser has said 'Adam is very much an extension of me. But I didn't intend for that, it just happened. I just had so much I wanted to say. There's a real limitation on what you can and can't say - like you can't make fun of this, because it's taboo.' The result of his sharing his own experience is deftly portrayed in this rare comedy drama, allowing the viewer to see all sides of Cancer and how that diagnosis alters the life view of the victim and their support group. Seth Rogen has slimmed down and proves in this portrayal that he is capable of superb acting and character creation. Anna Kendrick, Anjelica Huston, Serge Houde, Philip Baker Hall, Matt Frewer and Bryce Dallas Howard render exceptional supporting roles. But the extraordinarily subtle and sensitive acting on the part of Joseph Gordon-Levitt is brilliant: this is an actor who proves his chops in this career making role. His balance between pathos and the lightness of his comedic touch is simply worthy of an Oscar - or more. This is a surprising excellent film. Highly Recommended for all audiences.

Deadpool," 'Looks ARE everything! Ever heard Dave Beckham speak? It's like he mouth-sexed a can of helium'
","DEADPOOL is a spoof of MARVEL comic book characters, directed with panache by Tim Miller, rich in one-liners such as 'Life is an endless series of trainwrecks with only brief commercial-like breaks of happiness. This had been the ultimate commercial break. Which meant it was time to return to our regularly scheduled programming.' It is apparently based on the Marvel Comics character by the same name (Deadpool is a fictional antihero Initially Deadpool was depicted as a supervillain but later evolved into his more recognizable antiheroic persona. Deadpool is a disfigured and mentally unstable mercenary with the superhuman ability of an accelerated healing factor and physical prowess. He is known as the 'Merc with a Mouth' because of his talkative nature and tendency to break the fourth wall, which is used by writers for humorous effect and running gags). Even for those saturated with the endless expensive overblown repetitious Marvel Comic films that flood the market (making billions of dollars), This film is funny, not only due to the comedic writing of Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, Fabian Nicienza and Rob Liefeld, but also due to start Ryan Reynolds inimitable talent for admixing silly banter with heroic handsome good looks and fancy footwork. Very briefly (because there isn't much story), 'This is the origin story of former Special Forces operative turned mercenary Wade Wilson, who after being subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers, adopts the alter ego Deadpool. Armed with his new abilities and a dark, twisted sense of humor, Deadpool hunts down the man who nearly destroyed his life.'Much of the success of this film is due to the cast – Ryan Reynolds of course, but also a brilliant role for Ed Skrein as Ajax, T.J. Miller, the every glamorous Morena Baccarin (of Homeland fame), as Vanessa, Gina Carano as Angel Dust, Leslie Uggams as Blind Al, etc.The film does go overboard in noisy destruction and massive killings and foul language, but hey, this is a Marvel Comics outing – so you expect something different? Entertaining if a bit too long.",9,4,12,14 May 2016
300," HaRoo, HaRoo, HaRoo: Cinematic Overkill
","Writing a review of a film such as '300' when not a fan of comic book style, superheroes, violent games carried on by children's hand held instruments, a film so overwhelmingly popular with the public that it promises to be the largest grossing film in history, and a film based on a 1999 'graphic novel' (read comic book) by the talented writer-artist Frank Miller and colorist Lynn Varley in an updated version of the famous battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC, places a viewer in a vulnerable position. Yet every film made deserves the attention of a well-rounded examination and with that in mind this viewer offers the following thoughts.Zack Snyder directed this screenplay, sharing the writing credits with Kurt Johnstad and Michael Gordon about Spartan King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and his group of 300 trained from birth soldiers to know no fear and to die as heroes who together fight the huge forces of King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) while leaving behind Queen Gorgo (Lena Headley) and the venomous Theron (Dominic West) to end to matters at hand in Sparta. A keen plan to meet the Persians (Persia of yore is now called Iran!) at a narrow gulch at Thermopylae supported the courage of the mighty buff Spartans to have a logistical advantage. But of course Xerxes' legions of rhinos, elephants and warriors ultimately kill all the Spartans: it is a story of heroism in the face of extraordinary odds.With the exception of a few moments at the beginning and a few well placed breathers through the long two-hour film the subject matter is fighting, blood, decapitation hither and yon, and piles of corpses used as barriers as the huge animals of Xerxes tumble off the cliffs. Blood spatters the air and the actors and the story, giving credence to the illustration used to promote the film. The problems, other than the 'overkill' of endless battle to the tune of soldiers shooting repeated 'HaRoos', for this viewer lie with the script which mixes contemporary slang with pompous Grecian proclamation - stretching the credibility of the story beyond the limit of tolerance; the excessive noise of battle in competition with a 'musical score' that keeps the volume to maximum level; the fact that the acting is minimal at best, though this may be part of the 'comic book' concept; and the apparent emphasis on having every Spartan look like the same beefcake mold form from an art department.There are a few moments of tenderness as when the Captain (Vincent Regan) watches his son's decapitated head float to the ground in slow motion and he for the first time offers human anguish. But for the most part this is a blood red movie that relies on audience appreciation for gore. Yes, it is a successful cinematic transition of a comic book, but the real story of history being told is so much more moving. Yet the lines at the movie theaters remain long after 4 weeks of release... Grady Harp",4,6,13,31 March 2007
Kingsman: The Secret Service," 'The suit is the modern gentleman's armour. The Kingsmen are the new knights.'
","Full court press with a British action thriller served up with a generous dollop of humor, this very successful film is based on the comic book 'The Secret Service' (writers Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons) and transformed into a screenplay by Jane Goldman and director Matthew Vaughan – that guy responsible for 'Kick-Ass', X-Men: First Class', 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' 'Layer Cake', 'Stardust'. For those of us who are not comic book fans or have not heard of the comic book on which this fantastic movie is based, the following is an explanation by Colin Firth's character in the script:' 'Since 1849, Kingsman Tailors have clothed the world's most powerful individuals. In 1919, a great number of them had lost their heirs to World War I. That meant a lot of money going uninherited. And a lot of powerful men with the desire to preserve peace and protect life. Our founders realized that they could channel that wealth and influence for the greater good. And so began our adventure. An independent international intelligence agency operating at the highest level of discretion. Without the politics and bureaucracy that undermine the intelligence of government-run spy organisations. A suit is the modern gentleman's armour. And the Kingsman agents are the new knights.'And that is only the explanation of the Kingsmen title. The film is blessed with a superb cast. The plot is all over the place and the action speaks louder than ideas of words. It tells the story of a super-secret spy organization that recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius. Among the featured actors are Colin Firth as Galahad/Harry Hart, Michael Caine as Arthur, Mark Strong as Merlin, Jack Davenport as Lancelot, unrecognizable Mark Hamill as Professor Arnold, Sofia Boutella as the lower extremity enhance weapon Gazele who assists Samuel L. Jackson as super bad guy Valentine, Jonno Davies as Lee, and the very impressive new face hunk Taron Egerton as Eggsy. Cinematography is by George Richmond, and the musical score is by Henry Jackman, Matthew Margeson with a bow to Sir Edward Elgar. Great special effects and an ending to end all endings make this a full evening of pleasure.",10,6,13,4 July 2015
Fast Five," Camaraderie
","The title for this ongoing sequel to Fast and Furious is, it seems, related to the number of films based on this fast driving bunch of car fanatics than to the number of people in the tribe. What makes this series of Pow and Wow action flicks stand above many of its competitors is the tremendous sense of fun the cast seems to be having - leaping over rooftops, driving fast cars, pulling off impossible heists. It all ends in a sense of fun and introduces the teaser for the next in the series (a bit with Eva Mendes and Jason Mignot in a brief talk after the credits run pretty much guarantees the next installment).This time the guys and girls - Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel), his sister Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster), her boyfriend ex-cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), Vince (Matt Schulze), Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson), Tej Parker (Ludacris), Han Lue (Sung Kang), Gisele Harabo (Gal Gadot) Tego Leo (Tego Calderon), and Rico Santos (Don Omar) - gather in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - each in various stages of running from the past - hunted by FBI Agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and in desperate need for money to escape Rio to countries where they cannot be extradited. They discover the one last job opportunity - taking away the money that billionaire Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) takes from the money houses in the infamous Rio favelas district. It takes the talent of the entire crew to make the heist of heists as the safe where the illegal money is kept is in the police station in a huge vault that is impenetrable - until our gang takes over in likely the most interesting and entertaining chase scene on film. The rest of the story is fluff but nice - with a little love interest thrown in for good measure. This cast is strong and they pull of the fine line between comedy and drama very well. In the end this is a fast and entertaining escape film. And #6 will probably come soon! Grady Harp",Null,0,1,6 October 2011
Green Book," 'You never win with violence. You only win when you maintain your dignity.'
","Director Peter Farrelly co-wrote with Brian Currie and Nick Vallelonga, brother of the main character, this true story adaptation for film. It succeeds on many levels, not the least of which is a reflection on the racism of the 1960s era as a too close comparison for the current status of prejudice. It is a powerful movie that makes its point simply and strongly, largely due to the very fine performances By Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali.Briefly, the story takes place in 1962 when Tony 'Tony Lip' Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen), a tough bouncer at the Copa, is looking for work when his nightclub is closed for renovations. The most promising offer for employment is to be the driver for the African-American classical/jazz pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) for a concert tour into the Deep South states. Although hardly enthused at working for a black man, Tony accepts the job and they begin the concert tour armed with The Motorist Green Book, a travel guide for safe travel through America's racial segregation. They are accompanied in a following car by the other two members of the Don Shirley Trio (Dimiter B. Marinov and Mike Hatton). Together, the snobbishly erudite pianist and the crudely practical bouncer can barely get along with their clashing attitudes to life and ideals. However, as the disparate pair witness and endure America's appalling injustices on the road, they find a newfound respect for each other's talents and start to face them together. In doing so, they would nurture a friendship and understanding that would change both their lives.One reason the film works so well is the use of bipartite examination of the response of each man to the stat us of the other: Don Shirley gains respect for the importance of family milieu (especially the Italian-American version) as Tony learns by direct observation the African American plight in a world of prejudice. Of note, a post-script after the film reveals that in real life, Tony became the maitre'D of the Copa, and Dr. Shirley continued being successful in music. They remained friends for the rest of their lives.Both Ali and Mortensen provide outstanding performances and head a cast that is consistently of high caliber. This is a powerful film with a very important message. Recommended.",8,0,2,16 March 2019
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," And the music lays on and on...oh oh oh oh, oh oh and it sounds like Eclipse
","There are legions of ardent fans of this Twilight Saga - this third installment is ECLIPSE - and they obviously have their reasons for loving both the books and the movies. That's good news, especially for Stephenie Meyer who is probably only second to JK Rowling (Harry Potter series) in skyrocketing income from the transformation of book to screen adventure. The scenery in Vancouver,BC is pretty and the music and lyrics for the film by Howard Shore is meant to add to the story line. The script by Melissa Rosenberg (who has done some fine work on the television series 'Dexter') is written in staccato phrases - one-liners that don't really allow the actors to express much real emotion under such confines. For this viewer this is one of the main reasons the film doesn't fly. Even if one can buy into the fairytale atmosphere of flatline normal human girl Bella (Kristen Stewart) falling for rather stiff and distant and oh so proper vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson, who has proved in his other films 'Remember Me' and 'Little Ashes' that he actually CAN act) while at the same time falling in love with werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner, ever more buff and using his physique to great advantage in almost every scene), there are problems with the story for the casual viewer who hasn't read the Twilight Saga or followed the previous films. Despite the film's building to the altercation and confrontation between Seattle vampires versus the small town Cullen vampires now supported by the town's werewolves courtesy of Jacob et al the story feels static. No emotion: script versus acting - it is a toss up. Once again Billy Burke and Anna Kendrick (so fine in 'Up in the Air') add to the quality. The werewolves are huge and cuddly, and the blue meadow flowers serving as background for Edward and Bella that open and close the film are nice. And we have two more episodes to go - or more... Definitely an acquired taste. Grady Harp",4,6,8,8 December 2010
Spectre," 'You are a kite dancing in a hurricane, Mr. Bond.'
","Though we've been through years and years of James Bond movies and they all have the same basic recipe – impossible action, exceptional photography, superb stunts, beautiful women and a solid cast – this SPECTRE for this viewer beats them all. Sam Mendes directs a committee script (8 writers including Ian Flemming original characters)), uses a fine cast, allows us some of the beautiful views of many countries and the result is a completely satisfying experience – for Bond lovers.The story line (much like all the others) is as follows: A cryptic message from the past sends James Bond Daniel Craig) on a rogue mission to Mexico City and eventually Rome, where he meets Lucia (Monica Belluci), the beautiful and forbidden widow of an infamous criminal. Bond infiltrates a secret meeting and uncovers the existence of the sinister organization known as SPECTRE. Meanwhile back in London, Max Denbigh , the new head of the Centre of National Security, questions Bond's actions and challenges the relevance of MI6 led by M (Ralph Fiennes). Bond covertly enlists Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and Q (Ben Whishaw) to help him seek out Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux), the daughter of his old nemesis Mr. White (Jesper Christensen) who may hold the clue to untangling the web of SPECTRE. As the daughter of the assassin, she understands Bond in a way most others cannot. As Bond ventures towards the heart of SPECTRE, and its head Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) he learns a chilling connection between himself and the enemy he seeks.'Splendid locations, terrific opening graphics, fine musical score by Thomas Newman, and magnificent cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema all add to this echt James Bond mood.

","Annie Mumolo and David O. Russell provided the story and David O. Russell wrote the screen play and directed this engrossing film about the determination of a little girls whose need to create things is squelched by life in general until she has a big break, invents a mop, makes it big, loses is all then climbs out of the hole of bankruptcy and depression and wins - supremely!Jennifer Lawrence is splendid in the role of Joy but she is supported by some of the best written minor character roles in recent movies – her grandmother Mimi (Diane Ladd), her mother (Virginia Madsen), her errant father Rudy (Robert DeNiro) and his current (among many) affair with Trudy (Isabella Rosselini), her divorced but support husband Tony (Edgar Ramírez) who lives in the basement with Rudy, her best friend since childhood to present Jackie (Dascha Polanco), the man to whom she is referred to start her business Neil (Bradley Cooper), and the cast from the dopey soap opera that constantly plays on her mother's TV, etc.The story blends the multifaceted cultural flaws we observe daily – dysfunctional families save for the matriarch grandmother who has wisdom, step-sibling greed, failed marriages, the effect on children living in the midst of constant squabbling, dreams that are trampled by insecurities and life changes, corporate greed and corruption, etc – but it also shows how stamina and determination and believing in one's self can ultimately allow a person with vision to rise above it all.Great cast, good script, fine film – all underlining the realm of possibility of the American Dream.",10,4,9,18 June 2016
The Nice Guys," A comedy with brains
","Shane Black (the Lethal Weapon series, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Last Action Hero) wrote (with Anthony Bagarozzi) and directed this combination thunder and hilarious spoof of a tow guy crime film and wisely chose Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling to be the pair du jour to pull of this zany and entertaining film.A mismatched pair of private eyes investigate the apparent suicide of a porn star in 1970s Los Angeles. Jackson Healey (Russell Crowe) is a fixer who fixes things with his fists. Holland March (Ryan Gosling) is a cop who following his wife's death became a drunk, a sometimes-present father to his very bright daughter Holly (Angourie Rice). He would become a P.I. who takes on weird cases. He is currently working for a woman (Lois Smith) who wants him to prove that her niece a porn actress (Murielle Telio) is alive when everyone knows she died recently. His investigation takes him to a girl named Amelia Margaret Quailey) who avoids him. She then hires Healey to tell him to leave her alone which he does. But later some guys go to Healey and want to know where Amelia is. When he handles them, he asks March to help him find Amelia. They learn that Amelia's boyfriend, a filmmaker, was killed and his house was burned down along with the film. They later learn the Porn star's producer is also dead. So what is going on.a complex plot to show the world a film about corruption and greed. It is always surprising when directors and costumers go to such extremes to recreate a period (the 1970s Los Angeles) and yet allow such oversights as the au courante five o'clock facial hair that would never have been around so ubiquitously during that time. Now that the porn industry is everyday news that portion holds no secrets, but in the 1970s? But those are small issues in a film that keeps us entertained from the first scene through an hilarious men's restroom scene (Ryan Gosling is extraordinarily funny) to the last expected explosion/bang-bang close. Kick back and just prepare for some belly laughs. Adult themes throughout.",9,3,8,27 August 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," 'Help me get one more.'
","Seeing and experiencing films such as HACKSAW RIDGE during Memorial Day is a strong reminder of the honor we owe to the men and women who have fought to protect us. Though wars continue, around the globe and within our strife-ridden country, the horror of war is ever present, but the courage and sacrifice veterans have made and continue to make deserve our honor.HACKSAW RIDGE is a very fine film about the battle of WW II on Okinawa as written for the screen by Robert Schenkkan and Andrew Knight and direct with great sensitivity by Mel Gibson. This, as we all know, is a true story of a young conscientious objector Desmond Doss (Darcy Bryce/Andrew Garfield) who entered training for WW II having had a terrifying experience as a child with his brother Hal (Roman Guerriero/Nathaniel Buzolic), enduring the PTSD alcoholic father (a brilliant performance from Hugo Weaving), growing up as a 7th Day Adventist, and how he adjusts to military life in training, nears court marshal because of his refusal to carry a gun, and ends up in Okinawa where unarmed he save the lives of 75 fellow GIs. Thankfully the script allows the first half of the film show the character development of Desmond, introducing the men in his company (Luke Pegler, Luke Bracey, Nico Cortez, Farass Dirani, Jim Robison, Goran D. Klet, Damien Thomlinson, Sam Worthington, a brilliant Vince Vaughan, and more), and Desmond's love interest (Teresa Palmer) and his mother (Rachel Griffiths).The fighting action is brilliantly depicted and well photographed by Simon Duggan – and of course directed by Gibson. Rupert Gregson-Williams supplies the very appropriate musical score. The film is violent to watch: war is violent to watch. The message of Desmond Doss's honor is underlined by images at the end of the film. This is a very fine film – particularly on Memorial Day.",10,2,3,28 May 2017
Me Before You," 'You are pretty much the only thing that makes me wanna get up in the morning.'
","This film is one of those rare instances where a novel (by JoJo Moyes) is adapted for the screen by the novelist and finds a sensitive director such as Thea Sharrock and the result is a story that could have been sanguine but instead is an enriching emotional journey. To discover this film among all the crime and killing and morbid vampire or other undead creatures stories and overblown CGI comic book/fairy tale adventures is a breath of fresh air.The story takes place in England and in a very subtle way shares an insight between the wealthy and the poor – emphasizing that richness is truly in the spirit rather than the bank account. Lou Clark (Emilia Clarke) knows lots of things. She knows how many footsteps there are between the bus stop and home. She knows she likes working in The Buttered Bun tea shop and she knows she might not love her long-term boyfriend Patrick (Matthew Lewis). Her family (Brendan Coyle, Jenna Coleman, Samantha Spiro and Alan Breck) needs money and insist Lou seek employment when Lou loses her job: it is out of pure fortitude that she finds one - as caretaker of a young wealthy quadriplegic – a job that ultimately keeps her sane. Will Traynor (excellent Sam Claflin) knows his motorcycle accident took away his desire to live. He is supported by his male nurse Nathan (the superb Stephen Peacocke) as well as his loving parents (Janet McTeer and Charles Dance). He knows everything feels very small and rather joyless now and he knows exactly how he's going to put a stop to that – a planned death after fulfilling his parent's plea for a six month reprise. What Will doesn't know is that Lou is about to burst into his world in a riot of color. And neither of them knows they're going to change each other for all time until Lou concocts a bucket list of events that brings light into her life as well as joy into Will's final days.Without becoming morbid, the interplay between Lou and Will is a transformation and due to the splendid script and sensitive direction and a cast of superb actors in every part this little film makes a lasting impression, restoring our faith in what friendship and love can achieve. In short, this is a brilliant little film worthy of at least one watching- if not multiple! Highly recommended.",10,11,15,4 September 2016
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Perhaps Seeing It In 3D Helps.......?
","Being curious about the current 'state of the arts in Hollywood' is possibly an acceptable reason for viewing this grueling 2 1/2 hour + mechanical mishmash, but after enduring the storyless CGI exercise in visual and auditory assault the viewer can only hope that in the theaters, with the added dimension of 3D to the soup, the film might have had some saving graces.Apparently the 'story' goes something like this (at least in a neutral writer's words): 'Autobots Bummblebee, Rachet, Ironhide and Sideswipe led by Optimus Prime, are back in action taking on the evil Decepticons, who are eager to avenge their recent defeat. The Autobots and Decepticons become involved in a perilous space race between the U.S. and Russia, to reach a hidden Cybertronian spacecraft on the moon and learn its secrets, and once again Sam Witwicky has to come to the aid of his robot friends. New villain, Shockwave, who rules Cybertron, is on the scene while the Autobots and Decepticons continue to battle it out on Earth.' In other words this is an action film where the main characters are expanding and imploding auto parts in some semblance of a battle for taking over the earth. What little dialogue there is was written by Ehren Kruger and the comic book cum video game cum 3D epic was 'directed' by Michael Bay.Given that the film did so well in the theaters (likely due to the novelty of 3D) it made a lot of money. The cast assembled is an admirable one: Shia LaBeouf, Josh Duhamel, John Turturro, Tyrese Gibson, Patrick Dempsey, Frances McDormand, John Malkovich (for his brief few seconds on screen), Ken Takemoto , and the voices of the mechanical dolls supplied by such actors as Hugo Weaving, Frank Welker, Leonard Nimoy, Robert Foxworth, James Remar, and Francesco Quinn. The problem is that there is so much destruction of the city of Chicago and the flying pieces of the fighting Autobots and Decepticons that finding a story and caring about the non-mechanical actors is tough. But then this is what the public is spending money to see so it is obvious why Hollywood is making movies like this. Could there possibly be another installment coming? Probably..... A must miss award to TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON. Grady Harp",Null,1,4,1 October 2011
The Social Network," THE SOCIAL NETWORK: The Zenith of Privacy Deprivation
","The amount of information about the film THE SOCIAL NETWORK driving it toward being named Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor etc etc etc can only be compared to the global blast of privacy invasion that the topic of the film - FACEBOOK - has caused. The story of Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg, acted with as much flatline self absorption as the character he portrays - a compliment) and Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield in the most sensitive, multifaceted performance in the film) and their brainy computer manipulated program that became the ruler of the computer universe is well told. The fact that the idea was 'lifted' from the Winklevoss twins (recreated a la 'The Parent Trap' concept by one actor - Armie Hammer) and Harvard sidekick Divya Narendra (Max Mingella) provides the story driver here: the history of Facebook is told through back and forth sessions at the depositions for law suits alternating with transmission of the incidents of the developmental struggles of the toy. It is story of obsession, of the fragmentation of trust between friends, of the proliferation of a challenging brainy idea into a billions of dollars scheme, and it is a documentation of how the current state of mind of the students to adults feed on gossip and instantaneous information dissemination, the results of which we are only beginning to appreciate as individual privacy becomes a relic. Ben Mezrich's book 'The Accidental Billionaires' as been transformed to the screen by writer Aaron Sorkin and director David Fincher (Seven (1995), The Game (1997), Fight Club (1999), Panic Room (2002), and Zodiac (2007), The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008). As with his other films Fincher successfully creates an atmosphere that captures the message of his films. Here that atmosphere includes degrading women, drowning dialogue with inordinately loud music on the soundtrack (courtesy Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross), maladaptive behavior, and the gradual loss of dignity of those young people who propel this concept of Facebook to success - not the least of which is a study of Napster Pro Sean Parker well played by Justin Timberlake. This is a long, loud, noisy, crude, roller coaster ride of a film that probably is true to the mark as a docudrama and as terrifyingly thought provoking. Grady Harp",3,13,23,13 January 2011
In the Land of Blood and Honey," A Very Dark and Controversial Movie
","THE LAND OF BLOOD AND HONEY is stirring a lot of controversy, both bad and good. This is actress Angelina Jolie's first outing as writer/director of a film and for many reasons she deserves applause for tackling such a subject as the Balkan War from 1992 - 1995. Unless the viewer has studied the conditions in the once Yugoslavia, a bit of history may help the view to understand the conflict. 'In 1992, conflict engulfed Bosnia and Herzegovina. The war was predominantly a territorial conflict between local Bosniaks and Croats backed by Zagreb, and Serbs backed by the Yugoslav People's Army and Serbia. The Yugoslav armed forces had disintegrated into a largely Serb-dominated military force. Opposed to the Bosnian-majority led government's agenda for independence, and along with other armed nationalist Serb militant forces, the JNA attempted to prevent Bosnian citizens from voting in the 1992 referendum on independence. This did not succeed in persuading people not to vote and instead the intimidating atmosphere combined with a Serb boycott of the vote resulted in a resounding 99% vote in support for independence. On 19 June 1992, the war in Bosnia broke out. The conflict, typified by the siege of Sarajevo and Srebrenica, was by far the bloodiest and most widely covered of the Yugoslav wars. Bosnia's Serb faction led by ultra-nationalist Radovan Karadzi promised independence for all Serb areas of Bosnia from the majority- Bosniak government of Bosnia. To link the disjointed parts of territories populated by Serbs and areas claimed by Serbs, Karadzic pursued an agenda of systematic ethnic cleansing primarily against Bosnians through genocide and forced removal of Bosniak populations. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in the United States reported in April 1995 that 90 percent of all the atrocities in the Yugoslav wars up to that point had been committed by Serb militants. Most of these atrocities occurred in Bosnia. In 1994 the US brokered peace between Croatian forces and the Bosnian Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. After the successful Flash and Storm operations, the Croatian Army and the combined Bosnian and Croat forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, conducted an operation codenamed Operation Maestral to push back Bosnian Serb military gains.Together with NATO air strikes on the Bosnian Serbs, the successes on the ground put pressure on the Serbs to come to the negotiating table. The fighting in Croatia ended in mid-1995, after Operation Flash and Operation Storm. At the end of these operations, Croatia had managed to reclaim all of its territory except the UNPA Sector East bordering Serbia, however most of the Serbian population in these areas had become refugees, and these operations have led to war crimes indictments by the ICTY against elements of the Croat military leadership. The areas uncaptured by the Croations forces in 'Sector East' came under UN administration (UNTAES), and were reintegrated to Croatia in 1998. The war ended with the signing of the Dayton Agreement on the 14 December 1995, with the formation of Republika Srpska as an entity within Bosnia and Herzegovina being the resolution for Bosnian Serb demands.From this background Jolie has fashioned a story that relates a strange love story that is difficult to define. Danijel (Goran Kosti) and Ajla (Zana Marjanovi), rare in a dance hall when the explosive war begins Danijel is a a Serbian policeman, becomes a captain, and Muslim artist Ajla becomes a captive. When Ajla ends up in Danijel's camp, he attempts to protect her without attracting undue attention, so she serves the men meals, but the threat of rape is ever present. Danijel's father Nebojsa (Rade ÂŠerbedzija) is the general of the Serbs and discovers that his son is hiding a Muslim woman, discovers her, has her tortured, and condemns his son. Lack of trust between the 'lovers' leads to a tumultuous end.The script is slow, the movement slower, but the impact of the bestiality of war, once again based on religion, demonstrates how cruel people can become when it is Serbs against Muslims, even when the individuals are lovers. The point is made, perhaps too repeatedly, but Jolie has assembled a fine cast and manages to give us as raw a picture of war and the camps always associated with the captured ones as can be shown on the screen. It is a necessary subject to examine: t is not an easy film to watch. Why is it controversial? The answer lies in why is war controversial - who 'wins' when all lose?

Macbeth," Shakespeare En Plein Air
","Australian director Justin Kurzel directs Shakespeare's magnificent drama (as adapted for the screen by Jacob Koskoff, Michael Lesslie, and Todd Louiso), moves the action outside of the claustrophobia of a stage castle and into the breathtaking majesty of the land of Scotland and the result is an epic film populated with some of our finest actors of the day who are able to deliver Shakespearean poetry with the finest seasoned Shakespeare actors of the day. The result is a dark look at a story we all know and the changes in scenery create a dramatic turn of stance in the way we interpret Shakespeare's brilliant drama.Brief synopsis: 'Macbeth, the Thane of Glamis, receives a prophecy from a trio of witches that one day he will become King of Scotland. Consumed by ambition and spurred to action by his wife, Macbeth murders his king and takes the throne for himself.' What this quick dollop of a plot synopsis fails to render is the extraordinary altered viewpoint that Macbeth is not simply a ruthless power hungry man driven by his equally power obsessed wife, but instead is a man whose battle time and the mass killings for which he is responsible have created a PTSD personality change that is gripping and very moving to watch his descent into his fate.Michael Fassbender continues to grow and impress as one of our finest actors of the time and he delivers the poetry of Shakespeare with eloquent and raw dignity. Likewise, Marion Cotillard as Lady Macbeth is inordinately impressive â€“ a very fine portrayal by an exceptionally gifted actress. The cast is uniformly fine â€“ Paddy Considine as Banquo, Brian Nickels as the Thane of Cawdor, Malcolm as portrayed by Jack Reynor, David Thwelis as Duncan, Sean Harris as Macduff, et al. The glorious cinematography is by Adam Arkapaw and the eerie musical score is by the director's brother, Jed Kurzel. The only criticism this viewer has is the need for subtitles in order to hear and understand the perfection of Shakespeare's words. This likely is the reason this film did not do well in theaters. It should have been considered in almost every category for Oscars and it's omission points out the sad state of all award consideration. Perhaps 'Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow...' A wholly brilliant film.",10,3,6,11 March 2016
The Pursuit of Happyness," Running Toward Happiness: The American Dream Revisited
","PURSUIT OF Happiness is a film that despite all its flaws (repetition of chases, repeated encounters that mirror the last, emotional overload, excessive playing time of two hours, etc) reinforces some truly important human values: love between a father and son, pushing forward toward success despite all the roadblocks, kindness for the plight of the homeless, and strength of character in the face of hopelessness. Knowing that the story (by Steve Conrad) is based on fact, that Chris Gardner really existed to survive these hardships, makes the film even more impactful. Director Gabriele Muccino knows how to aim for the heart and the film is bound to touch all who view it.Chris Gardner (Will Smith) is an African American very bright young man married to Linda (Thandie Newton) who has a difficult time working double shifts at a thankless job to support the family due to Chris' inability to sell Bone Density Evaluators that he used the family's life savings to invest in for a future that looks increasingly grim. Chris and Linda and their young son Christopher (Jaden Christopher Syre Smith) live next to the poverty line and finally Linda leaves, frustrated, angry and hurt. Chris and his son strike out on their own: the relationship between father and son as enacted by the Smiths is as touching as any on film. Bruised by the lack of success in selling his machines, Chris encounters a happy man who says his secret is working as a stockbroker with Dean Witter in downtown San Francisco. Chris applies for employment, passes an entrance exam and is taken on with the firm - only to discover he is an unpaid intern who must pass a hefty exam and perform at top speed in order to succeed.With no income except from Chris' continued attempts to see his medical machines poverty embraces the father and son and they end up homeless and hungry. The only things keeping Chris afloat are his love and concern for his son and his intense will to survive and succeed. How this works out is known because of all the PR from the film and from the actual facts of the story.Will Smith and his son Jaden give warmly human performances, giving the camera as much with the silence of their faces as they deliver with lines. Yes, there are many moments when the heartstrings are heavily plucked, but there is no problem defending that in a society too famished for stories of human dignity in the face of tragedy. The large supporting cast is well directed and the production values are excellent. PURSUIT OF Happiness is well worth the journey. Grady Harp",8,0,0,28 March 2007
The Great Gatsby," 'All the bright precious things fade so fast... and they don't come back.'
","From the encyclopedia the facts are here: 'The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel written by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional town of West Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922. The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion for the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald's magnum opus, The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Jazz Age that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream.' Pretty well said and for those many of us who have read the novel that straightforward description serves Fitzgerald's story well.Enter Baz Luhrmann who adapted Fitzgerald's novel with his constant co-writer Craig Pearce (Moulin Rouge, Romeo + Juliet, Strictly Ballroom) and director this Rose Parade Float version of Gatsby and the emphasis is different from the book - and that really is OK; it is a visualization of the raucous flamboyance of the Roarin' 20s pushed to extremes and decorated with Luhrmann's fetish for across time music themes and songs. The story remains intact for the most part as narrated by faux writer Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) and the epitome of the American Dream Jay Gatsby is pasted on Leonardo DiCaprio while the vapid Daisy is well underplayed by Carey Mulligan. The spectacle settles down for moments offering some fine cameos by Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan, spectacularly beautiful and talented Elizabeth Debicki in the small but significant role as Jordan Baker, Isla Fisher as the doomed Myrtle Wilson, Jason Clarke as Myrtle's husband George Wilson, and Callan McAuliffe as the teenage Jay Gatsby plus a 'cast of thousands'. It places rich man poor man and the opportunities for role reversal at a new level and Luhrmann and company make that happen. Yes, it is overdone and over the top as is Luhrmann's style, and no, I wouldn't watch it again, but as entertainment on the grand scale it is not bad! Grady Harp",7,0,2,29 August 2013
The Proposal," Surprisingly better than expected!
","THE PROPOSAL as written by Pete Chiarelli and directed by Anne Fletcher looks on the surface (posters, promos. trailer) like yet another version of tough woman manipulates subservient guy in a toss that ends up in a role reversal. And in many ways that is what this film is about: hard-as-rocks but beautiful editor Margaret (Sandra Bullock) verbally abuses her assistant, wannabe author Andrew (Ryan Reynolds), until her employers discover her visa is expired and she is to be deported to her native Canada. A fast thought drives her to claim that she and Andrew are engaged in a ploy to avoid deportation. Shocked at first, Andrew decides to make this ultimate blow to his ego work for him and takes Margaret to his home in Siska, Alaska to meet his family - mother (Mary Steenburgen), father (Craig T. Nelson) and wildly alive grandmother (Betty White) - where Margaret must play the charade. Of course in the beauty of Alaska and under the influence of the warmth of a family Margaret never had, the expected magic happens and ... you know the rest. Sandra Bullock is good and creates a solid character, but it is Ryan Reynolds who proves his chops as one of the best comedic actors on the screen today. It is a fun outing. Whether or not it deserves the Golden Globe attention mush less Oscar attention is up for question, but it is a pleasant diversion for some very fine comedians. Grady Harp",8,0,1,13 January 2010
Hustle & Flow," 'Talk the talk or walk the walk'
","Terrence Howard is one of those actors who seemingly can do anything. No matter what the role he intelligently chooses to play he is always phenomenally fine (Crash, Ray, Lackawanna Blues, Their Eyes Were Watching God, Four Brothers, Hart's War, etc etc etc). In HUSTLE & FLOW writer/director Craig Brewer has finally given him a vehicle that allows him more screen time and the opportunity to create a character that burns his image on our memory indelibly.The story of a pimp and drug dealer in Memphis, stuck in the poverty level and rapidly drowning in mid-life crisis, who pulls himself into the stream of his need and dream to be something different, a rapper star, has been told before but never in the gritty realistic atmospheric way this film does. One of the most telling sequences of both writing and acting is the opening scene of the film when Djay (Howard) quietly talks his philosophy to Nola (Taryn Manning), his primary prostitute, simply sitting in the front seat of his car, awaiting johns. Howard makes this soliloquy pungent yet quiet and in the words we hear provide the outline for the story to follow.While Terrence Howard's is towering, the supporting cast is superb also. Anthony Anderson, DJ Qualls, Taraji P. Henson, Paula Jai Parker, Isaac Hayes, and Ludicrous all offer genuine portraits of difficult characters. The smarmy side of Memphis is well captured by cinematographer Amy Vincent. This is a fine film, a bit difficult to watch at times because of the bruises of poverty and the depths to which people must descend at times to survive. But the story is pungent and tough and Terrence Howard is a marvel to watch. Grady Harp",8,0,0,11 January 2006
Sully," 'It's not a crash, it was a forced water landing.'
","Topical docudramas don't always work; this one does. This once in a lifetime incident was reported in the book Brace for Impact: The Chesley B. Sullenberger Story (2010) by Chelsey Sully Sullenberger, well adapted for the screen by Todd Komarnicki, and adroitly directed by Clint Eastwood. The manner of telling the story on film is at times a bit disconcerting because of the manner in which the screenplay jolts between after the event, dreams by Sully, and the even and the final 'trial'. But in the end it works – largely in part due to the reliable Tom Hanks as assisted by Aaron Eckhart.Captain Chesley B. Sullenberger (Tom Hanks), with his co-pilot Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart), made aviation history on January 15th, 2009 when he successfully landed an Airbus A320 flight 1549 on the Hudson River instead of the intended LaGuardia Airport: a flock of birds flew into the engines, disabling and breaking them. 155 people walked off the plane that day. However, even as Sully was being heralded as a hero by the survivors and the public and the media for his unprecedented feat of aviation skill, an investigation was unfolding that threatened to destroy his reputation and his career. Further tension is provided by Sully's frightened telephone calls with his wife Lorraine (Laura Linney). A fine cast of actors hold the hearings in which Sully defends is actions and proves his heroism.This is a solid film, ell photographed and acted and directed and brings to the public eye the action of a living hero. It is inspirational – especially today.",8,0,0,14 February 2017
Cinderella Man," Brother can you spare a dime...
","Not being a fan of boxing I usually avoid movies about the sport unless there is some other reason for watching (as in Million Dollar Baby, the initial Rocky film): the idea of watching two people beat each other bloody while crazy crowds cheer just doesn't register as entertainment (the American gladiator syndrome). And while Cinderella MAN is clearly about the game of boxing, the true story of a real boxer, and contains long spans of beatings, this film is not so much about boxing as it is about the indomitable human spirit. It is also one of the finest films depicting the Great Depression in the 1930s that is a timely moment for us all to remember...In 1928 Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe) was a top contender for boxing fame, supporting his wife Mae (Renée Zellweger) and three children, wisely investing his earnings form his winning fights in the reliable stock market, devoting his time to his family and securing their future. Then 1929 happened and the stock market crash destroyed his savings and damaged his ability to fight, plunging him into the mass of poverty accompanied by nearly all Americans. Jim and Mae struggle to feed and clothe their children, and Jim is unable to win at boxing, becomes a 'loser', loses his license, and survives by daily showing up at the docks for the negligible chance of work. The times are bleak, and there is a moment when Mae shifts the children around to family members because they have no food or heat. But Jim's fight manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti), himself surviving the bad times under a hollow facade, manages to gain Jim a fight. Despite his advancing age, broken hands, fallen reputation, and challenged ego, Jim manages to sustain his spirit and fights for the survival of his family. The rest is history.Ron Howard directs this story of a man's indomitable spirit with a fine sense of pacing and manages to hold this two and a half hour movie together without a moment of wasted time. With cinematographer Salvatore Totino and musical score writer Thomas Newman he manages to recreate the gray brown mood of the Great Depression better than any film to date. There are small supporting roles that truly shine: the grossly underused Paddy Considine, Craig Bierko, and Bruce McGill among them are beautifully carved creations. Russell Crowe gives his most understated, credible role and truly inhabits 'Cinderella Man' (his moniker) as a desperately needed hero of the people of the Depression Era. Renée Zellweger once again plays, well...Renée Zellweger. The surprising acting comes from the solid support by Paul Giamatti. If he isn't nominated for best supporting actor then people aren't watching! Cinderella MAN is a strong film, one that sweeps you up and carries you along - even if you don't care about boxing!

Valkyrie," An Unexpected Triumph
","VALKYRIE deserves wider attention than it received during its theatrical release, a theater run mired by the media emphasis on the tacky behind the scenes stories of the making of the film and the character destruction of Tom Cruise. This is a fascinating bit of World War II German history that is not as well known as the other aspects of the Third Reich and it bears telling. Writers Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander have used the facts of the 15th unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Hitler as spearheaded by Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) and molded a thriller and a classy drama populated by some of our finest actors. Director Bryan Singer manages to recreate Germany of 1944 and make it all look real - too real for comfort - and paces this complex mission with steady and harrowing momentum. The film belongs to Cruise who is rarely off screen. His acting is solid and credible. The other actors whose presence gives the film a sense of realism are Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Kenneth Branagh, Terrance Stamp, Thomas Kretschmann, Eddie Izzard, Christian Berkel, Tom Hollander, Jamie Parker, Carice van Houten, and David Bamber (excellent in the role of Adolf Hitler). What makes this cast stand above the average ensemble crew is the sense of selflessness each actor brings to his/her role. Even though many of these fine actors are only on the screen for moments, their contribution is so well crafted (and directed) that the audience feels as though each is fully understood as members of this infamous historic event. This film appears to be an honest, non-sensationalized view of history about which too few people are informed. As a quasi-documentary it holds up well: as a thrilling drama it deserves kudos.

The Soloist," A Lot of Questions, but Few Answers
","THE SOLOIST is a difficult film to review. First, the subject matter: a newspaper writer of a human interest column for the LA Times, with personal problems of his own, encounters a schizophrenic homeless man who spends his days playing classical music on a two string violin and provides fodder for a new human interest column - an accidental encounter that develops into a friendship and challenge and some semblance of change in the personalities of both men. Second, the cast: performances by Jamie Foxx as the gifted homeless Julliard trained cellist Nathaniel Ayers and Robert Downey, Jr. as the troubled and frustrated but kind hearted writer Steve Lopez turn in very fine and credible performances. Third, the message: calling attention to the plight of the homeless and their need for simple acts of kindness is well portrayed. Fourth, the music that serves as a character in the film: the cello solos are played with grace and style by LA Phil cellist Ben Hong and the LA Philharmonic as conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen and present in the background and on the screen with in the grandeur of Disney Hall create as solid a film score as possible. Fifth, the supporting cast: with Catherine Keener in a thankless role as Lopez' boss and ex-wife, Marcos De Silvas as LA Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Tom Hollander as a cello instructor make the best of the poorly developed roles they are given. So what goes wrong here? For this viewer the problems lie with the screenplay by Susannah Grant, an acceptable adaptation of Steve Lopez' novel, but so loaded with LA Times promo and info and mawkish sentimentality that the story all but drowns. Director Joe Wright seems to take the stance of letting the story flow on its own, the only relief being the use of flashbacks that attempt to explain the mental and physical state of Nathaniel Ayers. This is a film that longs to be loved, but in the end it is only a passable human interest story. Grady Harp",5,0,0,9 August 2009
The Martian," 'Every human being has a basic instinct: to help each other out'
","'Every human being has a basic instinct: to help each other out' Odd that everyone is raving about the acting in this film. Yes, it is a good idea to watch the survival of a lone man on another planet, but the acting and the dialogue are so flat line and the actors seem so uninvolved with this read-through of a script that after a while all the fancy special effects even get more interesting than the story. Some are remarking how far better Andy Weir's book is in comparison, but even Ridley Scott has slow moments in trying to keep this space venture airborne.The story (brief as it is) – 'During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive. Millions of miles away, NASA and a team of international scientists work tirelessly to bring 'the Martian' home, while his crewmates concurrently plot a daring, if not impossible, rescue mission. As these stories of incredible bravery unfold, the world comes together to root for Watney's safe return.'The cast includes such winning actors as Michael Peña, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain, Kate Mara, Kristen Wiig, Sean Bean and others but there is little to no development of their characters until the very end. Jump on if you must see every movie that is nominated for best film/actor but be aware this tale goes on for well past 2 hours in length.",6,2,4,14 January 2016
The Fighter," A Familiar Story
","THE FIGHTER breaks no new ground as a film. There are many films with the same theme ('Fighting Tommy Riley' is one of the best, but there are many others) despite the fact that this one is based on a true story. There is nothing to really fault in this film: it just doesn't quite live up to the honors and hype afforded it. Writers Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy and Eric Johnson have managed to create dialogue and encourage accents specific to the Lowell, Massachusetts setting and their script has a steady flow that makes the film work. David O. Russell directs a fine cast and makes the most of the secondary stories that take the film out of the ring and into the lives of the Ward family in a credible way. Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg in a very sensitive, underplayed and under-appreciated performance) is the younger brother of Dicky Ekland - same mother, different fathers - (Christian Bale, gaunt and frighteningly real as a crack addict) who came close to the big time in boxing, a potential hero of Lowell, MA. Dicky is Micky's wholly unreliable trainer and the devotion between the two brothers is palpable. The 'manager' of Micky's would-be boxing career is the boys' mother Alice (Melissa Leo). Micky fights losing fight after losing fight until he meets a bartender girl Charlene (Amy Adams) who steers him away form the bad influence of his family - a move that allows Micky to begin to rise in the boxing ranks. Dicky is imprisoned for multiple charges and gets clean and upon release works with Micky again to lead him to victory. The Ward family - including father George (Jack McKee) is a mangy bunch- the sisters are made up to appear as tacky as young girls can look and talk. Melissa Leo is credible as the arrogant yet devoted materfamilias, Christian Bale is stunning in his portrayal of the pathetic Dicky, but Mark Wahlberg is rock solid as the quiet but committed fighter/brother/son. This is probably not a film to see twice but the first viewing is entertaining. Grady Harp",8,0,0,18 March 2011
Law Abiding Citizen," A Solid Thrilller
","All the internet chattering aside, LAW ABIDING CITIZEN is just what it sets out to be - a thriller that keeps the viewer involved in the mind games of a passionate man right up to the end (uh, well almost - except for the needlessly sugary revolting Hallmarky last few frames meant to clean up the mess the movie suggests...) Kurt Wimmer wrote this 'taking justice into our own hands' story with a good deal of imagination and gadgetry and F. Gary Gary keeps the momentum of the story going along at a breakneck pace. Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) opens his home door to face two thugs who beat and kill his wife and daughter and injure him substantially. Shelton seeks a good lawyer and finds himself in the hands of smarty guy Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) who sets the film in motion by accepting a plea bargain on behalf of the killers - one will be sent to prison with the death penalty and the other just gets a little time. Shelton is distraught at this abuse of the justice game. Jump forward 10 years and the one killer has a botched heinous execution while the other, now free, is is laughtered hideously - both by Shelton. There is a plan in Shelton's head to destroy everyone who allowed justice to misfire and the rest of the film is how the genius mind of Shelton (jailed after his slaughter of the killer) manages to wipe out everyone involved in the court system that instigated the terror.Butler and Foxx make a good sparring pair and there are some excellent cameos by Colm Meany, Viola Davis, Bruce McGill et al. Yes, this is a violent film, and not for the squeamish, but it does make us look at the judicial system with different eyes. If only the director hadn't glopped on the sloppy goodie-two-shoes happy-wappy scene that ends the film and feels like a purging cathartic....Grady Harp",8,3,8,22 February 2010
Up in the Air," A Brave, Compassionate, Brilliant Film: Examining the Now
","Jason Reitman (director and co-writer with Sheldon Turner based on Walter Kirn's novel of the same name) is a bright light among the new directors of important stature. He has a style: he makes comedy films touching on serious matters (JUNO deals with teen pregnancy, THANK YOU FOR SMOKING deals with the dangers of tobacco); his films open with significant and elaborate sequences; his main characters offer highly subjective narrations and tend to be self-confident people who end up re-thinking their lives; he tends to favor continued using of a troupe of ensemble actors (here JK Simmons, Sam Elliott, James Bateman). UP IN THE AIR shares all of these traits and more. It dares to talk about firing people in a time when everyone in this country is frightened about the job market and somehow manages to show the compassion for both the victims and the perpetrators. It is a challenge of the first order and Reitman makes it work very well. This is not a feel good comedy; this is a drama with comic relief that addresses serious issues and people's responses to them - employment, relationships, marriage, and apparent self-sufficiency. Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) spends his time in the air, flying to companies across the USA whose CEOs don't want the job of informing employees they are no longer needed. Ryan manages to make these encounters as human as possible and he is an artist in his work. His personal life is rather arid: his love needs are met by women on the run, he has distanced himself from his family, electing to maintain a sterile one room apartment in Omaha which he uses the few days out of the year when he is not flying. He meets a very beautiful, smart, and seductive woman Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) and a crazy courtship ensues as they meet in different cities - both being traveling business people. Things change when Ryan's boss Craig (Jason Bateman) takes on a fresh graduate student with big ideas for reducing the costs of the company. Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) is smart, a focused designer of telecommunications who has sold Craig on the idea of doing the firing remotely rather than spending the money to fly Ryan et al around the country. Ryan bristles and demands that Natalie accompany him on his personalized interview firings before the company goes Skype. The two - Ryan and Natalie - are paired for an excursion of real life jobs terminations and both learn from each other. Ryan continues to have trysts with Alex and eventually Ryan, Alex and Natalie party together. Natalie discovers the human side of Ryan's work and finds the person to person contact difficult. At the same time Natalie challenges Ryan's inability to form realistic relationships with women. Hurtful things happen to each to the three fliers, causing each to re-think their career goals as well as their personal needs. Clooney, Farmiga, and Kendrick deliver first class performances (very obviously Oscar worthy), but then so do the many cameo actors in the film: Amy Morton, Melanie Lynsky and Danny McBride as Ryan's needy family, and a long list of very brief but deeply moving cameos of people being fired by an extraordinary group of actors (casting director Mindy Marin deserves an Oscar also). The gorgeous cinematography is by Eric Steelberg and the music score is by Rolfe Kent (with a special nod to the composer and singer and guitar player who ends the movie credits with a song that summarizes the ideas of the film). And shining over all of these factors is the superlative, flawless direction of Jason Reitman. This film may have unpopular themes, but it is most assuredly on of the best films of 2009. Highly recommended. Grady Harp",10,0,4,7 February 2010
Atonement," Cinematic Splendor: ATONEMENT reaches the standard of the novel
","For those who have had the immense pleasure of reading Ian McEwan's ATONEMENT not once but several times, basking in not only the brilliant story/mystery but also in the inordinately beautiful language, rest assured that the film not only does the book justice in the transference to the screen, but in the hands of screenplay writer Christopher Hampton (we know that McEwan approved of the modifications as McEwan is one of the producers of the film) becomes even more clear in its realization of the complex plot and finds the visual beauty inherent in McEwan's prose. Joe Wright as director steers this story well, finding just the right amount of back and forth nonlinear development that formed the magic of McEwan's initial weaving.The cast is uniformly superb. From the initial self-centered liar Briony Tallis (an impressive Saoirse Ronan) to the years' later sorrowfully guilty young nurse Briony (Romola Garai) to the 'epilogue' Briony of Vanessa Redgrave, the entire story is adroitly centered on this perpetrator of tragedy. But without the power of James McAvoy's falsely accused Robby Turner and Keira Knightley's tragic Cecilia Tallis the triad would not work. Even the smaller yet important roles assigned to Gina McGee, Brenda Blethyn, Jérémie Renier and countless others are played to perfection.The cinematography by Seamus McGarvey captures not only the misty tranquility of 1935 pre-war England complete with creative use of luminous light sources as well as the raw brutality of the battlefields as England enters WW II. Dario Marianelli's music score (much of it played by pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet!) incorporates the superb Sir Thomas Beecham recording of 'La Boheme' with de los Angeles and Björling as incidental music to the typing of Robby's fateful note and then proceeds to incorporate the typewriter as if it were an instrument in his orchestrations.Rarely has this viewer been so moved by a film (and perhaps that may have been related to just having heard a performance of Britten's WAR REQUIEM at the Los Angeles Philharmonic the previous night!): it is the perfect marriage of novel, cinematic realization and commitment on the part of all concerned in the creation of this superlative film. Highly Recommended on every level. Grady Harp",10,3,6,26 January 2008
V for Vendetta," A Spot-On Movie for our Time
","Though the packaging of both the theatrical release and the DVD suggest that V FOR VENDETTA is yet another action hero comic book foray, nothing could be further from fact. James McTeigue has directed this Wachowski Brothers adaptation of Alan Moore's comic book into a story that is intelligent, frightening, spectacularly produced and acted and the result is a fable for our minds to consider.Swooping out of the time in England in 1605 for some background as to the mission of our hero, V (Hugo Weaving) appears as a masked grinning man who uses terrorist tactics to take down a British government as corrupt as any one might imagine. The time is 2020 and England rules in a totalitarian manner, its greatest enemy, the United States, has self destructed, and the government controls the lives and thoughts of the British citizenry. One remnant of the government's destructive forces is a beautiful girl Evey (Natalie Portman) who rapidly becomes V's apprentice/accomplice in the fight against the corrupt powers. The police (Stephen Rea and Rupert Graves) work to capture V and Evey, thinking they are terrorists out to destroy the government. But the heads of state (John Hurt et al) fanatically attempt to brainwash the populace through the television madness of a talk show host. Gradually the horrors of the current regime are revealed and it is a case of the good guys versus the bad guys with Portman and Weaving towering in importance by the end of the film. The quality of acting form this fine cast (including such actors as Stephen Fry among many others) is first class, making the potential silliness of the story dissolve into horror.Well crafted films such as this serve the public well: sometimes it takes a visual depiction of the 'comic book look' of government officials to make us more sensitized to the direction we could be taking. It is an entertaining, fine movie - but it is more importantly a red flag warning we should all be heeding! Grady Harp",8,4,8,3 August 2006
The Island," A Good Idea in the Beginning Trickles off into Noisy Nothing
","Had the writers and director of THE ISLAND been able to sustain the fascinating first half hour of this flimsy film, the result might have been an enlightening examination of the current discussion of cloning. But as soon as the movie captures our attention it fizzles and what is left is two and a half hours of noisy endless destructive chase sequences that put this reviewer to sleep.Using fine actors like Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson and Sean Bean one would think more attention would have been paid to a good script. They have us in the beginning as we slowly come to realize that this space-age environment is not the 'rescue place' from the end of the world by contamination, but rather a very expensive human cloning lab where wealthy people up on top of the subterranean lab life have paid huge sums of money to have duplicate donors on whom to rely for organs and integument as age begins to erode their own. Every 'person' in the lab (thinking that they are waiting transfer to the Garden of Eden Island of the title) is actually a manufactured copy of the owners topside.Well, not all secrets can remain hidden and McGregor follows a butterfly to discover the truth about the venture and the rest of the tale is McGregor's and Johansson's escape into the world above in search of their 'real' counterparts. Once on the surface of the earth the movie goes downhill fast in a mixture of special effects and destruction derby that it just loses all interest. This is a movie that only avid fans of McGregor and Johansson will want to see - because there is little else to recommend it! Grady Harp",4,1,2,22 December 2005
Furious 7," 'Dominic Toretto. you don't know me, but you're about to.'
","So we speed up to #7 in this gigantically popular action series. Don't expect much meaningful storyline, but do expect a lot of action form a crew that seems to love blowing up cars and driving them through the air and through the tall buildings of Abu Dabai and other fascinating locales. The film is overly long for the paucity of content, but for F & F fans it will satisfy. Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew thought they'd left the criminal mercenary life behind. They'd defeated international terrorist Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) and went their separate ways. But now, Shaw's brother, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), is out killing the crew one by one for revenge. Worse, a Somalian terrorist called Jakarde (Djimon Hounsou) and a shady government official called 'Mr. Nobody' (Kurt Russell) are both competing to steal a computer terrorism program called 'God's Eye,' that can turn any technological device into a weapon. Torretto must reconvene with his team to stop Shaw and retrieve the God's Eye program while caught in a power struggle between the terrorist and the United States government. The '7' of course are Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Michelle Rodriguez, and Lucas Black and the cast is rounded out with some other strong actors.It is a speed action genre film and if that is your bag you'll love it and likely forgive the shallow content.",6,1,14,20 September 2015
