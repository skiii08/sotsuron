Vertigo," An Incredible Movie
","This movie is an incredible work of art by the master of suspense. There are so many things great about it. Directing, acting, camera work, musical score, and just about everything else is wonderful.James Stewart and Kim Novak give truly remarkable performances in one of the best movies I've seen in a while. The acting is good from all of the actors. Even the nun in the final scene of the movie is memorable.I was drawn in with the opening scene. I rated this movie 9 out of 10.",10,2,4,6 October 2001
Chinatown," Very good, but not excellent
","This was a movie that I had never seen completely until recently. I had really high expectations for Chinatown. From what I had heard and read about this film was that it was as good or better than other 1970s movies such as 'The Godfather', 'The Conversation', 'The Sting', or 'Taxi Driver'. I thought this was a very good movie, but not an excellent movie and definitely not as good as the Francis Ford Coppola movies of this time.Chinatown seemed a bit slow and long to me. I did like Jack Nicolson's performance however, but his acting along with the good directing wasn't enough for me to call it an excellent movie. The performances of the other actors was good, but I didn't think it was great.I'll watch this movie again in a few months, maybe then I'll feel more highly about it.I rate this movie a generous 7 out of 10. I was thinking of rating it a 6.",7,2,6,3 September 2001
Se7en," Possibly the best crime thriller ever
","Se7enRating: 9 out of 10. Directed by David Fincher.When I first saw 'Se7en' eight years ago, I thought that I'd never see it again. The first viewing left me in a horrified and miserable mood. Even though I felt the movie was really well made, the dark empty feeling was so intense. Eight years later, I find myself viewing 'Se7en' for the eighth time. So on average, I see this movie once a year. It is still intense to view, but much easier to take in, yet on each viewing, I notice little details that I missed on previous viewings.'Se7en' follows the story of a deranged killer John Doe played brilliantly by Kevin Spacey. John Doe viciously kills his victims, treating his acts as sentences for those who sin.Investigating the murders are Detective Somerset played by Morgan Freeman, and Detective Mills played by Brad Pitt. As their investigation goes deeper, the two detectives find themselves subjugated in John Doe's plan.Some quotes from 'Se7en':William Somerset (Morgan Freeman): If we catch John Doe and he turns out to be the devil, I mean if he's Satan himself, that might live up to our expectations, but he's not the devil. He's just a man.
William Somerset (Morgan Freeman): This guy's methodical, exacting, and worst of all, patient. David Mills (Brad Pitt): He's a nut-bag! Just because the f#@ker's got a library card doesn't make him Yoda! 
John Doe (Kevin Spacey): We see a deadly sin on every street corner, in every home, and we tolerate it. We tolerate it because it's common, it's trivial. We tolerate it morning, noon, and night. Well, not anymore. I'm setting the example. And what I've done is going to be puzzled over, and studied, and followed... forever.",9,0,1,31 October 2003
Memento," Excellent and unique
","I gave Memento a 9 out of 10. I did not get a chance to see it in the theatre when it came out but I bought the DVD recently.
A friend mentioned to me what a great movie this was and mentioned the plot and some details to me - usually this does not bother me, but unfortunately, this time it made the movie slightly less enjoyable for me since I knew too much about the movie. If you have not seen this movie yet, try not to learn too much about it before you see it.I thought Memento was well directed and well acted by all the lead actors. The movie goes backwards in time and it works well, going backwards is not done often, but for this movie it was necessary - if it was aired in the correct order, Memento would have been less remarkable. I wonder if the original story was meant to go backwards in time?I have to admit, the only thing I find disturbing about Memento is the high ranking it has in the IMDb top 250 movies. This movie was enjoyable, but I don't think it should be up there with movies like The Godfather, and The Shawshank Redemption. It belongs in the IMDb top 250, but not in the top 100.",9,0,1,29 October 2001
12 Angry Men," Excellent Acting, Incredible Story
","This is one of the best movies ever made. I found it incredibly captivating from start to finish. What I liked most about 12 Angry Men are the characters. Talented actors and the great director Sidney Lumet brought them to life. I think the most powerful scene was when Henry Fonda's character pulls out the knife and throws it onto the table. I almost got up from my chair just like the rest of the jurors. I've been watching dozens of classics in recent months, and 12 Angry Men is the best pre-1972 movie that I've seen.The 1997 remake is supposed to be very good as well. I can't wait to see it but I can't imagine it to be as good as this version. I rated this movie 10 out of 10.",9,0,1,16 June 2002
Insomnia," Watch This One Wide Awake
","Insomnia is another great movie from Christopher Nolan. While not as avant-garde as Memento or Following, it is still very suspenseful, and it makes the viewer focus on the moment rather than thinking about the sequence of events.What makes this movie interesting is that Dormer (Pacino) knows who his adversary is early on. Finch (Williams) makes Dormer suffer for the rest of the story, sometimes it seemed almost unbearable to see Dormer being tormented.As for the acting, Pacino, Williams, and Swank are well cast and gave remarkable performances. I expected good acting and an excellent story. However, I found the story good and the acting excellent. Will Dormer is one of Al Pacino's more memorable roles, ranking up there with the characters Frank Serpico, Michael Corleone, Tony Montana, and Vincent Hanna.This was a movie that I could not rate right after seeing it. I had to sleep on it...when I woke I rated it an 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,2 July 2002
Ocean's Twelve," Mixed feelings towards this movie
","Rating: 7 out of 10. Directed by Steven Soderbergh.I have mixed feelings about Ocean's Twelve. It has some good moments in it and I plan to see it again when it comes out on DVD, but at times I found myself quite bored during some scenes and found myself desiring to see Ocean's Eleven.Its fun to see all the actors back together, especially George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Andy Garcia. I also liked the humorous scenes, even the cameo appearance of Bruce Willis worked well.As a huge fan of the first movie, my expectations were high, unfortunately this movie did not measure up. However, my rating is relatively high since it is a movie that I'd like to see again, perhaps it would work well as a movie to put on in the background during a session of poker.",7,0,2,30 December 2004
The Grapes of Wrath," Sad and Inspirational at the same time
","Rating: 8 out of 10. Directed by John Ford. 'The Grapes of Wrath' is based on John Steinbeck's novel, takes place in the Great Depression, and effectively portrays the grief and hopelessness of what many people went through during this time. Henry Fonda plays the lead character as the eldest Joad family son returning home from serving time in jail for manslaughter. Expecting to work on the family farm, he finds the farm deserted and run-down. His family has been kicked off the land. After reuniting with his family, they begin a long difficult trip to California in search of work.Nominated for seven academy awards, winner of two, including John Ford's second of four best director awards.",8,1,4,21 April 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," This One does not deliver
","Rating: 7 out of 10. Directed by Andy Wachowski and Larry Wachowski.As I left the theater I couldn't help but feel disappointed. The Matrix trilogy was 95% build up and 5% let down.What were the Wachowski Brothers thinking? While 'The Matrix Revolutions' isn't an awful movie, it isn't an incredible one either. It did not not deliver the big ending that fans were hoping for. Most viewers were looking forward to a climax that was going to be surprising and amazing. So instead we saw something that is somewhat surprising, but simple and uninteresting.The first move 'The Matrix' was entertaining and fun to watch even with all its flaws. The second movie 'The Matrix Reloaded' was also entertaining but not as fun to watch as the original. Unfortunately, 'The Matrix Revolutions' is barely entertaining and at times, will make the viewer feel melancholy.
If you must see this movie, see it as a matinee and keep your expectations low.",7,0,0,5 November 2003
North by Northwest," A good action thriller
","I gave North by Northwest an 8 out of 10. This is a really entertaining movie by Alfred Hitchcock. It keeps the viewer glued to the screen since you don't want to miss any key moments. As always with Hitchcock movies, the casting is excellent. Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, and James Mason are all great to watch. I've read that the Mount Rushmore scene was an actual movie set since Hitchcock was not able to use the real thing. That was a very impressive set they made, it's too bad that the set designers did not win the academy award for set decoration. They were nominated though.From the user comments on this website, it does seem that North by Northwest is a fan favourite. I suppose that's because this Hitchcock film is a bit lighter and comedic compared to the others. I really did like this movie, but if I had a choice to watch a Hitchcock movie again, I'd probably pick Vertigo or Rear Window instead of this one.",8,0,0,27 October 2001
Apocalypse Now," Francis Ford Coppola's Third Masterpiece
","Apocalypse Now Redux.Rating: 9 out of 10. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola. The original version was excellent, which I rated 9 out of 10 as well. The Redux version is a really long 202 minutes but is slightly better. The scenes that make up the extra 49 minutes give the movie a more complete feel.After seeing Apocalypse Now Redux for the second time recently (the first time was a year and a half ago), I just had to write a comment about it. While a really long movie, I find that it goes by really fast, a sign that the film is truly interesting. For some strange reason, the Redux version seems to go by faster than the original version to me.Some believe that Coppola failed to make a great movie here. Don't listen to these type of comments, this movie is a wonderful piece of art deserving a viewing every couple of years.The great things about Apocalypse Now:1. Martin Sheen as Captain Willard.2. The sardonicism of the Vietnam war.3. Marlon Brando as Colonel Kurtz.4. The music. 5. Robert Duvall as Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore.6. The narration by Martin Sheen.7. Francis Ford Coppola's personal touch.",9,0,0,27 August 2003
Spider-Man," Amazing movie from a comic book
","I was afraid that Spider-Man was going to be disappointing like The X-Men movie which I found to be more form than substance and lacking lighter moments. After seeing Spider-Man yesterday, I am glad to say that it was far better than I expected. Except for the corny lines in some scenes and the Green Goblin's armour, the movie is spectacular. I am undecided on the biological web shooters. When I first heard about them, I didn't think it was a good idea, but after seeing it in the movie, the idea works well.Besides the Goblin armour which many viewers will like but I did not and the biological web shooters, Spider-Man follows the comic book very closely. More so than any other comic book brought to the big screen. Fans of the comic book will appreciate Director Sam Raimi's efforts, we should all be happy that he'll be directing the second Spider-Man movie as well.
The lead actors Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, and Kirsten Dunst were very good. Dafoe is an excellent choice for the Green Goblin. Maguire and Dunst are not exactly what fans picture for Peter Parker and Mary-Jane Watson but few fans will complain.The actor who plays J. Jonah Jameson looked extremely familiar to me, but I could not figure out who it was, so I had to look it up here on the IMDb. Jameson is played by the actor J.K. Simmons, who plays Vern Schillinger in the prison drama OZ. He is also a recurring character on the Law & Order shows playing Dr. Emil Skoda.Spider-Man is a wonderful light action movie and is a treat to all Spider-Man fans. I rated this movie a strong 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,4 May 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Engaging and exciting
","This movie did not look very appealing when I saw trailers or TV spots for it. It has a superficial and commercial look to it that I hate in recently made movies. Expecting to give this movie an unremarkable rating of 6 or a 7, I was really quite surprised to find O11 engaging and exciting. My final grade is an 8. While not the best movie ever made (that would have to be The Godfather), it is worth watching and I highly recommend it.O11 has a large cast full of recognizable names. Lead actor George Clooney was excellent as Danny Ocean, and in my opinion Andy Garcia as Terry Benedict was equally as good.",8,0,0,13 February 2003
Moulin Rouge!," Not an Incredible Movie
","Based on some excellent reviews that I had read about this movie and the positive comments of a good friend of mine who saw it twice at the theatre, I thought Moulin Rouge! was going to be an amazing movie. After watching it, I thought it was a very unremarkable movie, maybe my expectations were too high. It just did not appeal to me as a musical or a drama. I actually have to consider the movie a fantasy movie to justify the relatively high rating that I gave it. The best thing about the movie was Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, they were great, especially when they were singing. But I found the movie really hard to watch overall, I found the fast paced music video style sequences in the movie terrible. The movie cost fifty-three million US$ to make, but it has only made an unremarkable fifty-eight million US$ in North America up until March 2002, this movie has really been over hyped. Moulin Rouge! is not for everyone, but some viewers sure loved it. More than 40% of the IMDb members that voted on this movie gave it a 10 out of 10. My rating is 7 out of 10.",7,1,2,15 March 2002
Mulholland Drive," Perplexing allegorical mystery
","Rating: 8 out of 10. Directed by David Lynch. I felt confused and cheated right after watching Mulholland Dr.' the other day, I suppose that I was expecting more explanations during the conclusion. The movie continues to haunt me since seeing it, and I've been thinking about the story scene by scene, I have come to appreciate it now. David Lynch has made a winner here and I look forward to another viewing of this film.The first two-thirds of the movie is extremely engaging, I didn't want to take my eyes off the screen for even a second. It has been a long time since I've felt so hypnotized by a movie. Lead actors Naomi Watts as Betty Elms/Diane Selwyn, and Laura Elena Harring as Rita/Camilla Rhodes are fantastic and both are visually stunning.A movie about dreams, love, relationships, and the darker side of Hollywood, Mulholland Dr.' is a wonderful piece of cinematic art. Even though there are many unanswered questions, I would highly recommend Mulholland Dr.' for its intrigue.",8,0,1,20 July 2003
8 Mile," Not bad at all
","Rating: 7 out of 10. Directed by Curtis Hanson. This movie is quite good and has an uplifting climax. Here we have Marshall Mathers portraying a young man in Detroit aspiring to become a rap star. Since the character he portrays is a lot like him, Eminem is able to deliver an honest and acceptable performance.Like other viewers, I also noticed the similarity to `The Karate Kid', the overall plot is similar  a tale of a young man going through struggle, pain, and then triumph, but instead of karate fighting, we have rap competitions in `8 Mile'. I didn't think that I was going like `8 Mile', but it really surprised me. I'd actually recommend this movie to people who have absolutely no interest in Eminem or rap music. Check it out.",7,0,0,7 October 2003
From Hell," Dark audacious thriller
","Rating: 7 out of 10. Directed by Albert Hughes and Allen Hughes.'From Hell' stars Johnny Depp as police Inspector Fred Abberline investing a series of murders in the Whitechapel area of London. His partner is Sergeant Peter Godley played by Robbie Coltrane. Heather Graham plays Mary Kelly, an Irish prostitute that helps Abberline with the investigation.
Abberline is an opium addict whose dreams provide a clairvoyant insight into his investigations. In fact, the movie opens and ends with Abberline in an opium den. Depp does a great job with this character, showing the viewers that his acting ability improves as he ages. The story has a number of subplots that are interconnected. The Royal family is somewhat involved due to a little problem in their family that could cause a scandal; we see a secret society that is linked to Royalty and the government - even Abberline's superior officer is a part of this group; there is also a secret police described as the Special Branch involved with the plot. To top it all off, an appearance of the 'Elephant Man' makes its way into the movie. All these subplot points make this movie sound like an 'X-Files' story. 'From Hell' is dark and violent, similar to 'Se7en' and '8mm', yet the first three-quarters of the movie is quite stimulating. In my opinion the movie doesn't finish well. The alternative last scene shown on the DVD special features would have been better since it would have been less ambiguous with what happens to Abberline after the case is closed.",7,0,1,30 November 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Enjoyable
","Rating: 8 out of 10. Directed by Andy Wachowski and Larry Wachowski. I just saw `The Matrix Reloaded' today on its opening day. Ever since the `The Matrix' came out in 1999, fans have eagerly waited for this sequel and the upcoming `The Matrix Revolutions'. I waited several minutes in rainy cold weather to buy my ticket, and while waiting, I was constantly thinking that this better be worth it. It was worth it, but barely.Three good things about `The Matrix Reloaded': One, the special effects are great. There is this highway chase scene that is visually stunning. Two, it is appealingly stylish in a very artistic way. Three, it doesn't suffer from the strong beginning but weak ending' syndrome, it gets better as the story progresses, however, the ending is a cliff hanger that shocks the viewer.Three terrible things about `The Matrix Reloaded': One, the trite annoying dialogue that plagued the first movie is here as well. Two, there are several new characters that are not well introduced, and therefore, become distractions that add little to the movie, however, a couple of these characters are visually welcoming diversions. Three, the fight scenes get a bit tedious.Like the first Matrix movie, the special effects and fight scenes dominate, and the story is lacking in substance, but I gave it a high rating anyways for its entertainment value.  I also found myself laughing several times, there is some subtle humor thrown in.",8,0,0,15 May 2003
Signs," Well Executed
","Rating: 8 out of 10. Directed by M. Night Shyamalan. I have to say that before seeing this movie, I was bracing myself for a disappointment due to mixed reviews. I must now say that I found the movie to be quite remarkable, well executed, and nicely crafted. M. Night Shyamalan rightly deserves respect for putting out a film with a lot of his personal touches instead of putting out something that people expect to see. While `Signs' will have scenes of the traditional or convention variety, it is the ambiance of the scenes that is unique.Shyamalan made good use of the films lead actors. Mel Gibson as recent widower Graham Hess, and Joaquin Phoenix as the younger brother Merrill Hess are both well cast and interesting to watch. They both brought a lot to the movie. Shyamalan himself has a somewhat key supporting role in the movie as well.It was a good choice to make the movie focus on the Hess family instead of the global distress of an alien invasion. The few times that we did see an alien during the middle of the movie was really frightening. Especially the first time Graham Hess (Gibson) sees one right outside the window of his children's bedroom. I believe we see an alien (or part of one) seven times in the movie, and the first six appearances were only for a split second, at first I was dissatisfied that we didn't see more. Yet in hindsight, less appearances of an alien does accomplish more for the movie.We never find out why the aliens were invading, but the viewer does realize that they were hostile. Here is one qualm that I have with this movie, it seemed a little illogical to me that the aliens would think that humans wouldn't realize their (the aliens) weakness since this substance is so abundant on our planet.`Signs' really held my attention and I highly recommend it. In fact, I look forward to seeing it again.",8,0,1,10 August 2003
Rear Window," Fascinating movie
","While glancing at my IMDb votes, I noticed that I gave 'Rear Window' an 8, thinking back to the movie, I wondered why I didn't give it a 9.'Rear Window' is one of the best movies from the master of suspense himself Alfred Hitchcock. Many consider this the best Hitchcock flick(Vertigo is my personal favourite).The three best things about this movie are: (1) James Stewart's excellent performance as the wheelchair bound photographer, (2) The apartment set used for the movie, and (3) the music and sound effects in the movie. If I had to pick the next best thing, I suppose it would have to be Grace Kelly, she looks stunning here.If you have not seen this Hitchcock classic, you are missing out on a great thriller.",8,0,1,12 February 2003
The Matrix," Refreshing
","Rating: 8 out of 10. Directed by Andy Wachowski and Larry Wachowski. `The Matrix' is an action packed science fiction story full of movie aphorisms, but fortunately has many innovative ideas. The surprise hit of the summer of 1999 grossing over $170 million, `The Matrix' was the fifth highest grossing movie in North America that year.I love many genres of film, but I mostly watch drama or thriller movies, and generally avoid the action genre. So I was pleasantly surprised by `The Matrix', it was a great diversion that was welcomed when I first watched it. Having just seen `Matrix Reloaded' today, I feel the need to see this movie again sometime soon.There were two things I didn't like about this movie. One, the acting is unremarkable and nearly nonexistent, there is more dancing than real acting. Two, the dialogue is terribly cliched. Even with its flaws, `The Matrix' isn't bad at all and worth viewing for anyone that has not seen it yet.",8,1,2,15 May 2003
The Birds," Unique Movie
","I saw this movie on TV fifteen to twenty years ago and just saw it again recently. 'The Birds' seemed like a really scary movie the first time I saw it as a kid. Watching it now, it really does not seem that scary, most episodes of the X-Files are more scary.This is the first of two Hitchcock movies with Tippi Hedren, the other being 'Marnie'. Hedren does a good job here, as does Rod Taylor.
The lack of a musical score is unusual, especially for a Hitchcock movie. Instead, Hitchcock uses a lot of bird sound effects.I don't think this is one of Hitchcock's better movies, but it is still good and unique. On my recent viewing of the movie, I was shocked to see how the last scene turned out, I really didn't expect the movie to end the way it did, I thought it was going to continue and give the viewer an explanation to the birds behaviour.I gave this movie a 7 out of 10.",7,0,1,10 November 2001
All the President's Men," Exciting Investigative Journalism
","Rating: 9 out of 10. Directed by Alan Pakula. Robert Redford does a great job playing the role of journalist Bob Woodward. The more talented Dustin Hoffman gives an excellent performance as Carl Bernstein. I once heard that this movie is a good guide for 'how-to' and 'how-not-to' conduct investigative journalism.The two journalists team up right after the Watergate burglars get arrested. They follow their own clues, but these tips only lead to dead ends, the puzzle is complicated. However, these Watergate burglars seem to be linked to the Republican Party and possibly to the White House.Alan Pakula does an incredible job of keeping the movie suspenseful and intriguing. As the story progresses, the viewer feels deeply involved in how these two journalists uncover the conspiracy. The contrast between the two main characters adds to the movie. Redford as Woodward has a relaxed and charming approach, while Hoffman as Bernstein is more persistent and sometimes daring.Woodward has a White House contact played by Hal Holbrook named 'Deep Throat' that he meets in 'Cloak and Dagger' style in a dark undercover parking lot, we never see his face clearly and he speaks in a rough rasping voice. 'Deep Throat' provides Woodward information in an indirect manner and keeps the journalists on the right track. This type of informant character has been replicated many times over in suspense movies and TV, especially on the TV series 'The X-Files'. Jason Robarbs as Bill Bradlee, editor of 'The Washington Post' performs remarkably as boss of the newspaper. Constantly reminding Woodward and Bernstein to find good solid evidence, but he also gets frustrated when none of the informants will go on the record with what they know. Robarbs won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this role. I never get bored with watching this movie. If you have not seen it before, treat yourself to a viewing.",9,56,81,28 May 2003
