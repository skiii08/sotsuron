The Blair Witch Project," Something real at last?
","Having just returned from my first, but definitely not my last, encounter with the Blair Witch Project I feel compelled to praise and scorn this intuitive piece of film. The film is, point blank, scary as hell. I think it's amazing how three egos with shaky cameras and a whole lot of nothing could grip a nation with hype and hysteria. Even more intriguing is the air of mystery which surrounds the truth of the whole plot.  Now really, is the whole thing a sham cooked up in hype in order to sell the story; or is the hysteria genuinely based on the tapes that where found. You will ultimately have to decide!",Null,0,0,10 August 1999
