Skyfall," Great for a Bond lover, Good for everyone else
","In my opinion this is by far the best of the Daniel Craig Bond Films. Without spoiling the film, it gives some hints of back-story for Bond before he joined MI6. The film was shock full of references to old bond films, and I believe that that is what made it great. However, I loved it because I loved those older films. It is a good movie on its own, but to really enjoy this movie you should have seen Bond films to truly appreciate all the references. The themes of the movie were very different then most other bond films, but the villain was one of the best in the recent films. This is a must see for any Bond lover, but if you haven't watched the other films first you miss out. I gave it a 9/10 for a Bond lover and 7.5-8/10 for someone who hasn't seen the previous films.",9,3,11,17 November 2012
