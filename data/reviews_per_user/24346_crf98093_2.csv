Requiem for a Dream," Darren Aronofsky is a genius, Requiem is a classic
","Believe it or not, I watched this movie while I was in inpatient alcohol/drug treatment for my own addiction. The treatment center actually showed us this movie, there were a few sequences towards the beginning that somewhat triggered my previous affliction. But as the movie progressed I was able to understand what Darren Aronofsky was trying to present.The way the actual scenes of 'using' were shown was very life-like, it briefly displayed the initial high followed immediately by the ongoing sorrow...Which progressively got worse just as it is in the real world of chemical addiction. It is a very heartbreaking and depressing film, but for anybody who has been through similar situations as the four characters, I'm sure it will give them a sense of gratitude that we hit a higher bottom than they did...it did for me.The camera-work and heightening of the emotions was extremely powerful. Even the sequences with the refrigerator and the continuing decline of Harry's abscessed arm were done with great raw emotion. I watched it the first time, in treatment, and had a few complaints, then I watched it again and understood in full what Aronofsky was trying to accomplish. All four actors were superior (particularly Marlon Wayans in a serious dramatic role), and the music was passionately haunting.A great vision for anybody who has been through heroin (or other drug) addiction, is currently involved in it, or wants to understand more about it. Letme repeat myself...Darren Aronfsky is a genius. (See his other classic 'Pi'. 10/10",10,0,2,8 January 2005
Into the Wild," Excellent film
","It has been years since I've seen a film that has captured some emotion and thought. Emile Hirsch brilliantly portrays the role of Chris McCandless and Sean Penn's directing is absolutely astounding.Chris is looking at a promising and financially secure future, but due to past impacts at the hands of his parents and the yearning for personal freedom without personal attachment to other humans. He sets out on a journey to end up in Alaska, he meets many characters along the way who he impacts and in return they impact him so that he can achieve his dream of living off the land in absolute freedom. By far, this is one of the best films I've seen this decade. The philosophical and voice over narration are grounds enough for viewing this masterpiece. Definitely a must see",10,2,6,31 March 2008
