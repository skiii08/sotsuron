Blade Runner 2049," Great visuals, dull and predictable story
","Unfortunately, this movie is quite long and dull except for the visuals. Story is completely predictable and dull. At close to 3 hours, it drags. The ending is awful. The original had a unique premise. This movie tries to follow that story but in the end, it is quite boring, unimaginative and implausible. Better sci-fi movies on AI, watch Ex-machina or Westworld on HBO. Or Arrival by the same director.",6,15,35,6 October 2017
Interstellar," A weak film from a favorite director
","Interstellar is visually quite arresting, dust storms on earth, space flight in a very complicated looking spacecraft., landing on strange planets, visuals of the wormhole etc and the movie is worth watching just for that experience. I watched it in IMAX and the music at some points in the movie was deafening and I couldn't hear the dialog. MM mumbles quite a bit (not as bad as in True Detective) and I had a hard time understanding him.I won't even go over my perceptions of the plot holes (if any) in the film because ultimately, it is a story about humans and their humanity as exemplified by the father-daughter relationship between Coop and Murph. Here it is at its weakest because the relationships are not developed and I felt that it was forced. Christopher Nolan's films have increasingly taken on a more pompous tone with important - sounding dialog that I don't particularly care for (Dylan Thomas quoted 4 times in this movie) although I loved his earlier movies, The Following, Memento, Insomnia, The Prestige and the dark knight. I would give this the same rating as Danny Boyle's Sunshine which somehow got ruined in the third act. Actually, this movie is way too long and I was getting bored in the end.",7,2,6,12 November 2014
