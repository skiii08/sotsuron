Iron Man 3," Damn shame to be honest...
","I just want to say marvel really had me fooled. With the thanos appearance, infinity gauntlet, the dark elves, the guardians... I thought we were in for a treat with phase two. I thought that marvel had dug up deep into comic lore and was going to pull out the stops with references of the winter soldier and Dr. Strange. Some people said we could hope for a Sin in capt. America 2....HOWEVER, after seeing Iron Man 3 tonight, I realize: Captain America might not be in Captain America 2...nuff said. Man of steel take the crown from the reigning champ. Marvel has obviously decided that the money made up front on Basically a computer programming career advertisement was more important than keeping long time fans interested. Not a terrible film overall, but it doesn't deserve to have anybody's stamp for a comic book film.",3,5,11,4 May 2013
