The Blair Witch Project," Worst camera work i have ever seen
",I know camera work isn't the most important thing on a motion picture but i care a whole lot about it.  For me a movie with bad camera work reflects the disrespect the director has for the film itself.  They could have least told the actors/cameramen some hints about how to use a camera.I'm thinking of something positive to say about this film...  Nope can't think of one.,1,14,27,7 April 2001
