The Blair Witch Project," Where o' where was the scare, Blair?
","The Blair Witch Project was perhaps the greatest cinematic disappointment I've experienced.  Having gotten caught up in all the hype, I was expecting something at least moderately terrifying.  As the three campers became more and more desperate, I became more and more desperate for something to frighten me, scare me, move me in anyway.  The only thing that caught my attention was when the credits began to roll and I thought 'that's it?!?' If you end up going, please lower your expectations dramatically, because there's very little terrifying drama to be found in the BWP.  Good luck next time, fellas.",1,1,3,24 July 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Disappointed
","I was disappointed with SPR.  Unfortunately, I found the movie terribly sappy, maudlin, cheesy.  Especially the frame.  I really agree with what Spielberg said about himself:  he makes movies that he would have enjoyed as a child.  This movie would have been more entertaining to me if I were 10 or 11 years old.",1,4,8,2 January 1999
