Walk the Line," Take away the Music...Take away Reese Witherspoon.....
","As a 60-something disabled man without transport, living 25 miles from the nearest cinema and a mile-and-a-half from the nearest bus stop, I bought 'WALK THE LINE' on DVD because I wanted to see the movie. Wish I'd WALKED that Mile-and-a-Half to the bus stop: it would have taken me 30 minutes each way, but saved me the cost of a most disappointing DVD.I have always been a fan of Johnny Cash's music, and am a fast growing fan of Reese Witherspoon. But even with those two attributes in favour of the film (the two reasons I wanted to see it), I think I can honestly count the number of times I shall run this DVD in the future on the fingers of one hand.True to say that the film was very well acted by the two main characters: but if you take away the music, and take away Rees Witherspoon, there is nothing left in this film to either interest or admire. I found vast chunks of the film to be a total disappointment, and nothing to what I had been lead to expect.I have given this movie 7/10 primarily because of the Oscar Winning Skills shown by Reese Witherspoon as both a superb actress, and a great singer. I found her singing voice to be 'Out of This World' with its wonder and beauty, and her acting in the role of June Carter was fully deserving of the Oscar that came as a result of it. In fact, I feel it would have been an injustice if M/s Witherspoon had not received an Oscar for this role.The Johnny Cash music was also very faithful portrayed; but not enough to hold my interest for very long.The music, and Reese Witherspoon ARE this movie. Take THEM away and there's simply nothing left to get excited about.Reese Witherspoon EARNED her Oscar here, and EARNED ALL of those 7 points out of 10 that I have given this movie.",7,1,2,28 May 2006
Pride & Prejudice," There, but for the superb acting of Miss Keira Knightly.....
","I had not seen this film prior to ordering my copy of the DVD over the Net. If I had, I would not have bothered buying the DVD.This particular story is a favourite both of my wife and myself: with the BBC's 1995 version on both tape and DVD, and at least the Greer Garson black & white film version on tape in our possession. Against the BBC's 1995 version, this latest travesty doesn't stand up. I fully appreciate that I am comparing a feature film of 2 hours duration with a serialisation of almost 3 times that length; but the actual production of this latest version leaves so much to be desired. It is disjointed, devoid of some of the main features and speeches, the majority of the cast seemed to have no ides of the story or of what they were supposed to be doing with it, and quite frankly, I considered the film a total disappointment: giving it only 2 marks out of 10 - both of those for the simply superb acting of Miss Keira Knightley.Miss Keira Knightley, who plays Elizabeth Bennett in the movie, was nominated for an Oscar for her role here. I can well understand why. Apart from Miss Knightley's superb acting, and that of Dame Judi Dench as Lady Catherine DeBourg, the film would, in my opinion, have been a total disaster. I doubt I shall bother running my DVD again before passing it to the same charity as Miss Knightley passed her Oscar Dress to.To vote on all 3 versions now in our collection, using the name of the Elizabeth Bennett Actress to name the version, I give marks out of 10 as under:For her part as Miss Elizabeth Benett: Greer Garson 10, Jennifer Ehle 10, Keira Knightley 10.For the Production as a whole: Grear Garson Version 10, Jennifer Ehle Version 10, Keira Nightley Version 0 (plus the 2 I give it for Miss Knightley's work.).R.P.Q.",2,2,12,14 May 2006
