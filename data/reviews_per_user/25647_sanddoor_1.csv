3:10 to Yuma," somebody must be crazy
","somebody must be crazy, either me, or the script writer, or the IMDb viewers who give a 8 to this movie.the most unbelievable, unforgivably stupid plot in decades.the most obviously stupid and incompetent 'character-developing' in decades.the worst and least credible psychological fake-depth in decades.the most outrageous overrating in IMDb in decades.i just can't believe people were really moved by it.yet it's true, people did.oh yeah...the guy who wrote 'the best western since Unforgiven' owe me the money for buying the DVD.the director owe everybody the money for the movie ticket.",1,9,17,27 May 2008
