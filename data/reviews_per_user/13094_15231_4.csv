The Blair Witch Project," Cool concept - in this case
","Sure there are those who are going to complain about what appears to be home movie quality film being pushed as a major motion picture.  There also are those who will claim the movie is not 'scary' because it never shows what exactly is chasing/stalking the three students.  These type have missed the whole concept of the film.  The purpose is to confuse and disorient the viewer while showing the characters slowly breaking down into exhaustive fear.  The audience is never fully sure of what is happening and only sees a limited bit of the story through the lens of a camera focused as a point of view from whoever happens to be holding it at the time.  The audience is left with more questions than answers, but that seems to be the intent of the producers.It is the disorientation and limited visual information that help bring on the fear factor of the story.  The plot alone is weak, the dialogue is nothing special (it does appear to have been made up as the actors went along) and the cinematography is poor considering only the cameras' mounted lights or natural sun light were used.This movie works, though.",8,0,1,29 April 2002
Citizen Kane," Great 'Art', little else
","Even though I have studied this film numerous times and fully appreciate its artistry  for which it deserves praise  the basic pace of this film and its script leave me wondering if so many 'critics' place it as the best simply because it is the 'enlightened/snobbish' thing to do.Although it has a deep, sad story within it; the film, to be blunt, is boring. Each shot truly is a wonder of technical staging, special effect, and cinematography, but the film itself lacks life.The scenes are presented one at a time as different pieces in the puzzle of who Kane really was, but there are too many pieces and so little connectivity between them that they become a confusing blur from which little understanding is gleaned. The individual scenes themselves actually can be distracting from the overall film in that their rich qualities, lavish sets, and dramatic lighting often overshadow and overpower whatever information they contain. Even though the audience is supposed to be going through the same dilemma as the investigator, there are far too many lengthy subplots and red herrings. By the time the final scene is presented, the significance of what is seen is easily lost on an audience that has to think back across the entire movie to determine how it all fits together. So many with whom I have seen this film were asleep before that last scene.The film was so well hyped at its release - and has such a great story of Hearst trying to destroy it, that it is a kind of legend in film history. I simply fail to see how it is the 'greatest' film ever made. Technologically beautiful, yes. An overall great film, no.",2,9,24,5 July 2003
The Others," One of the BEST ghost stories ever done
","This movie is one of the very few examples produced by Hollywood of how a great ghost story may be done without gore or cheesy special effects or dead teenagers or some ghoul jumping out of a dark corner to grab the heroine. As so many have said before, the film's story and script themselves are solid and compelling. The direction, acting, cinematography and editing are excellent. The suspense is genuine and the audience really feels for the characters and their emotions.If Freddy and Jason and the other slashers are your thing, then by all means stay away from this film as you will be disappointed that no one is cut or tortured or hunted down in a screaming mayhem to die a gruesome death. If, however, you want a true, old fashioned, ghost story with well developed characters and a mysterious plot, then you will love this one!",10,1,1,20 July 2002
The Birds," One of Hitchcock's Best
","There are so many wonderful Hitchcock elements within this movie.  The silent scenes in which tension is built and a story told with almost no dialogue or explanatory sounds, the slow building of suspense mixed with misdirection and bewildering amounts of detail in the story, the supporting town characters that are all too real in their attitudes and actions, the then state-of-the-art special effects of the birds themselves, and the excellent point-of-view camera work all add up to a great movie that does not rely just on the gore of the victims to keep the audience engaged. 
The Birds is best watched and taken at its face value without trying to find symbolism or meaning in what is presented.  I think that is what Hitchcock intended.  The terror is that the birds are attacking for no apparent reason - and no reason is hypothesized in the movie.  It simply is happening.  The characters have to adapt to the situation and try to stay alive.Tippi Hedren's character of Melanie Daniels is all too typical of a type of rich, sophisticated woman of the late fifties and early sixties who lived off of Daddy's money and had no real purpose for her own life.  I knew women like her.  The problem with the movie comes from all of the main characters having too much emotional and historical baggage carried with them that for some unknown reason has to be exposed and discussed.  These elements add nothing to the movie and drag down the pace of the story with long scenes of dialogue during which the characters talk about past romances, insecurities, family problems, etc. Hedren's, Tandy's, and  Pleschette's characters all are plagued with so many emotional encumbrances that at times their characters just look silly or pathetic.  Such neurotic-type problems may have been fairly common of movie characters of the sixties, or it may have been Hitchcock planting proverbial red herrings, but it gets annoying at times.  The innuendo about sex in what had to have been an attempt to make the film look more `mature' now looks childish.Ultimately, though, I still place The Birds up there with Psycho and think it remains one of the best suspense/thriller movies ever.",Null,0,0,12 October 2003
