Ford v Ferrari," Proper Filmmaking.
","After what feels like an endless stream of appallingly made movies full to the brim of woke politicising, finally, finally a movie that just wants to tell a good story in a fluent and thrilling manner. Bale is absolutely perfect as Ken Miles, Damon less so as Carroll Shelby but still very decent. The racing scenes are totally engrossing, the settings are evocative and the film flies by despite coming in at more than 2:30hrs. Do yourself a favour and go see it.",9,4,7,21 November 2019
