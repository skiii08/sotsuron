Your Name.," Unique story but overrated
","When I first watched this I was impressed. It is a really good movie, but everyone is treating it like the next 'Spirited Away' which I think is a little much. It's a unique story, with great animation and well written characters, not to mention an open ending. But it's not what everybody makes it out to be.",7,1,1,12 November 2018
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Perfect
","Great cast, interesting and well written story, satisfying ending. What more could you ask for, really? The characters were really well written and easy to relate to even if you haven't gone through the same they have, and the way all the scenes flow into each other is superb. I honestly can't think of a single thing wrong with this movie.",10,1,2,22 December 2018
