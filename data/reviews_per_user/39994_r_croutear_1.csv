Alien 3," Worthy successor to Aliens
","While I appreciate that Alien 3 had numerous flaws, I can't help but wonder why so many people hate it so.The new Special Edition only re-enforces how fantastic this movie is. From the characters to the music, Alien 3 excels on all fronts, and with a constant tone of tradegy and hardship, the finale of Ripley's sacrifice becomes so profound.Other scenes, such as the cremation of Newt and Hicks, are very powerful. The relationship between Ripley and Clemens is perhaps her only tether to a normal life (until the Alien comes along in the infirmary to remind her otherwise!) There are aspects of the theatrical release I prefer over the Special Edition. I think the birth of the Alien from a dog was better than from an ox. Plus some genius ruined the emotional ending in the Special Edition by cutting the music in places and rushing through the swan dive sequence.Still, the Special Edition adds so much more to the characters in the film, especially the Golic character, who mysteriously disappeared in the theatrical cut. He has a much more significant role in the Special Edition.I think David Fincher is foolish for disowning this movie. Had he pushed for the cut footage to be restored sooner, he may have elevated both his and the films stature to at least equal that of the first two films.At times, Alien 3 is much better than Alien or Aliens.",9,6,9,23 May 2005
