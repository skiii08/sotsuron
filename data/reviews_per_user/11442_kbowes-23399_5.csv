Howl's Moving Castle," Beautiful
","A very cinematically beautiful film with characters you just fall in love with. I won't lie, the plot is very hard to follow. If you've read the book, you can tell that miyazaki focused less on following the plot, more on making the film beautiful to watch, and as a result we are left with a story that has huge chunks missing and frankly doesn't make a lot of sense in places. But I'm not mad, because it is very, very beautiful to watch.",8,5,6,23 September 2018
Closer," Just plain cringey
","I don't even know where to start. The characters resemble the tropes you normally see written by teenagers in sub par fanfiction: Law's character is the classic quirky writer, self-insert male lead, and Portman is his manic pixie wet dream. I will refer to the other two characters as the other two, because they exist solely to round off the awkward love square that the film is centred on, and have no other attributes to speak of. Love at first sight is a very prevalent theme in this film. You will know the characters are in love when they caress each others faces on their first meeting. This happens often.The writers are also very liberal with 'deep and intellectual' lines such as 'I love everything about you that hurts', which are unorganically shoe-horned into scenes as often as humanly possible, and usually don't make sense. I say liberal because the dialogue consists of these profound words of wisom more than, you know, actual dialogue.I see a lot of people describe this film as 'real' and 'raw', probably because it contains a lot of crude sexual language. Its not that I'm a prude, but for a scene to be sexy you have to establish some sort of chemistry between characters. Otherwise, crude language just comes off as a poor attempt to be edgy, like a kid discovering swear words for the first time and over-using them to sound cool. It's not often I go out of my way to write a long review like this, but this film was really, truly abysmal. I'm actually not sure if the director has ever seen two real life humans interact before.",1,1,1,23 August 2018
The Men Who Stare at Goats," So much wasted potential
","The premise is very unique, and Bridges, Clooney and Spacey are fantastic. I wish they had interacted more, but it felt like the film kept jumping from one scene to the next without letting the actors really act. Also, McGregor felt like a poor casting choice to me. His comedic delivery was a little off and a lot of his 'funny' lines didnt land quite right, which brought down the energy of the film in my opinion.",5,0,0,4 June 2020
Grave of the Fireflies," Overhyped
","A lot if people say this film is 'beautiful' and 'tragic'. To me the whole thing just feels like a very forced and heavy handed attempt to make the audience sad, while putting as little effort as possible into writing a good plot and compelling characters. It's easy to make us cry by forcing us to watch dying children, but that isn't good story-telling, it's just emotional manipulation. I'm reminded if that episode of friends where Ross writes a speech that makes everyone cry, and Monica tries to do the same thing, but instead of actually trying to write something beautiful and touching she just talks about the dead family dog in a really forced attempt to move people.",4,7,16,23 September 2018
The Artist," Not just for film buffs
","I love films, but Im not the pretenrious sort, so honestly I thought I would find a silent film incredibly dull and hard to focus on. But once I was invested in the plot, I was captivated. Great acting, very compelling plot. Loved it",8,1,5,23 September 2018
