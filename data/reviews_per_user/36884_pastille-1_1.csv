Requiem for a Dream," this is by far one of the best made movies i have seen.
","it really gets you involved in the desperation plagueing the characters especially the one played so beautifully by Ellen Burstyn. darren aronofsky's Pi was good but nothing had me prepared for this one. jennifer connelly, jared leto, ... everyone is brilliant.. the beauty of the movie lies in the way it is made, the plot is great but personally it is the direction that made all the difference to me.. if you are one of those who likes movies that mean something or show hope and positivity, i suggest you stay away from this movie.. but if you are one who enjoys the ride, this is a good watch. just don't save it for family night.",9,3,6,28 September 2006
