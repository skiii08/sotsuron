The Benchwarmers," Stupid movie
","As I saw this movie I thought it would never end...this movie is a nightmare waiting to happen. A very bad movie...it wasn't even funny..and the movie makes no sense..if you want to see a movie that's tries to hard to be funny, but does work or if you want to just go somewhere you can sleep this is the movie for you(its not funny). Don't bother spending $7 to see this it's not even worth it. The characters in this movie are ususally funny but not in this one......this movie just doesn't work for I'm just mad that I wasted $7.25....the good thing I got out of this movie was the fresh nachos. The movie would have been better it was silent movie.",1,1,3,11 April 2006
