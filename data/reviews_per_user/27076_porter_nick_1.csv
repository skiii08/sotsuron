The Longest Yard," not bad
","i enjoyed the film but it was a copy of mean machine with Vinnie Jones, just with American football not football. that was very annoying for me being a fan of the original. guy gets sent to prison, starts football team, some psycho dude plays for the team, half time gets told if he doesn't deliberately loose then he'll be sent to prison for a long time. a lot of things annoyed me about this film, and to be honest i don't think that it was a good idea for it to be made, it lacked originality and the original mean machine with Vinnie Jones is a lot better in my opinion. so i would recommend that you see that. All in all, i give it 3 out of 10 purely because it is a bed copy of a good film.",3,3,6,18 January 2006
