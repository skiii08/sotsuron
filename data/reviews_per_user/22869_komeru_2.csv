Blade Runner 2049," 2040 hours of Ryan walking.
","I'm serious, most of the movie is Ryan walking, somewhere or other, very slowly! I get the visuals are stunning, but too much time is spent admiring the scenery. Also parts of the premise are under-cooked. Mainly, Jared Leto's character, Neander Wallace, wants to know how to make replicates that can reproduce because raising a grown person to 20 years of age is supposedly easier than manufacturing a replicate...wtf. And somehow this genius thinks it's actually a good idea to give a slave race that's stronger than them, the ability to reproduce. Consequently, this would also bring the ability to mutate and evolution, but whatever. I also had issues with some of the performances and found that I didn't care quite as much about the characters as I should.Not to say it's all bad the detective work was interesting, it doesn't spoon feed you, and it's hypnotic and visually rich. Because it's brilliant at times it's just all the more frustrating where it",8,1,3,17 January 2018
It," Another of the many films this year to be sacrificed to 80's filler
","What can I say bad CG, every clich√©d jump scare you could image, and a mix of juvenile humor that wasn't even funny when I was a kid with a general lack of tension. Needless to say it's not scary and doesn't hold a candle to the original.Why they tried to turn the 'It' into an 80's Spielberg rip off is beyond me. But those films were for kids. Here the comedy is too juvenile for adults and the horror too much for children. So who is this movie for? Pretentious hipsters...I mean film critics. Don't get me wrong I love the 80s and don't mind homages but when every film starts doing it, eats up so much run time, and lacks any subtlety it's a marketing formula not an homage.",1,3,4,21 December 2017
