Casablanca," The Greatest Movie Ever Made!!!
","Was there ever a better cast, better acted, better scripted film? The critic's can ooh and aah all they want over 'Citizen Kane,' this film outstrips it in every respect. Bogie was never better than as Rick, Ingrid Bergman glowed as Ilse, Paul Henreid had a part to sink his teeth into as Laszlo, Conrad Veidt was appropriately menacing as Maj. Strasser and Claude Rains was simply superb as Capt. Renault. The film is loaded with classic lines and characters. Even down to the minor players, it was perfectly cast. Thank heavens that the original casting fell through. George Raft, fine actor though he was, could not have played Rick, Hedy Lamarr would not have been able to pull off Ilse, and it would have been even more dreadful if Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan had been cast.As it is, 'Casablanca' is the greatest film ever made.",10,2,3,13 January 2005
