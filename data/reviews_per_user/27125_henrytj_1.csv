Sucker Punch," Great eye candy, but lacking story
","The visuals and fight scenes are of the best quality of eye candy. The CGI is fantastic. But sadly the title says it all. On a story level it comes across as just that, the writer/director sucker punching the audience. The story made a faint attempt to hint at some kind of philosophy, without actually providing any. The warrior women seemed to be instantly endowed with fantastical fighting abilities without have to attain them. Those parts of the movie is all sugar but with no real taste. The rest of the movie is all like meat gone rancid. Just filming a movie, despite high production values, with such extremes does not necessarily a good story make.I liked Watchmen a great deal and re-watch it often. I just hope that this director is not getting intoxicated on his success and developing contempt for his audience.",Null,0,0,30 August 2011
