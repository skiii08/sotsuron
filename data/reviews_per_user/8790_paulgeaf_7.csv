Angels & Demons," Good all rounder with a fast pace!
","Well I can't say this is in my top list of movies. I don't think it would even come close to making it. However, I am most definitely giving this movie a POSITIVE review. The reason for this is that it is simply an enjoyable ride from start to finish! The description I read from another comment of the movie being 'A Roman Cat and mouse with Forrest Gump' is close although maybe just a bit too harsh as I felt a bit more entertained than that would give! I watched 'The Davinci Code' too and like many others I really didn't think too highly of it. This time around, different movie I know but similar in m,any ways and of course the obvious one being the backdrop of the Vatican and all its glorious architecture. Some might say it is worth seeing the movie for that. I wouldn't. :-) I'll just say if you want a nice, enjoyable watch, nothing too serious and scientifically and historically, complete fabrication (although there are lots of nods to real events etc, the whole premise is fantastical!), plus you like a movie to have the mysterious killer (although it was far too predictable at times!) and the high speed chases to save people, the big ending and well...you want to waste a couple of hours, ...... then I would say you really should watch this movie.It's good. Just not great.6 stars from me.",6,1,2,13 July 2009
Memento," Creative Masterpiece!
","On my top movie list now too, this film is a creative masterpiece! I love the way the story unfolds in small parts, just enough to let you feel exactly as the main character is feeling, and remembering, the events after he lost the ability to remember. The narrative by him when he is htinking or alone, is also a good thing which makes you feel closer to him and what he is going through. When the end of the movie is reached, you find.. ..it has only just begun.I want to talk about it! I want to watch it again!GREAT. GENIUS! 10 out of 10",Null,0,3,5 November 2003
Hostel," Takes trash to a lower level
","Let me start this by saying I love trashy films. I love those cheap B movie horror gore-fest films that take a certain mindset to appreciate. I have that mindset. No question. I also enjoy a good movie too. A well written, thought provoking storyline with well developed characters and maybe something to leave you pondering even after it is over. This movie fits into neither category. In fact If pushed I wouldn't know what category to put this into except for to say it is complete rubbish! If you are reading this in the hope for some kind of help in making the decision whether or not to watch or Gasp!-buy(!) this film then I am really glad to help: DO NOT BOTHER FOR YOU WILL REGRET IT! On the other hand, if you like watching breasts and don't even require that they even partially fit into the storyline then go on, punish yourself with this nonsense. The storyline: what storyline? The Horror rating: ha-ha not even so bad it's good. not funny and not scary! The gore: Even more pathetic than the storyline. I HATE the way this film took minutes from me. I want them refunded!!",1,2,5,23 May 2006
The Polar Express," Kids can't get enough.
","If you have young kids and want to remind them or even teach them about the 'true (WESTERN)spirit of Christmas' (hehe), by which I mean Santa and presents and gluttony, then take them to see this film and you -and they- will not be disappointed! Seriously, it is a very fun and adventurous film that definitely appeals to young eyes.My four year old was glued to the screen from beginning to end and still asks about the movie.I can't say a bad thing about it.Brilliant.",7,1,4,6 January 2005
District 9," Very Entertaining!
","Amazing to sit and read some of the reviews here. Either people love it or they really have some vitriolic sniping against it!!!Why all the worry and seriousness?!I watched this film with my girlfriend and we expected a sci-fi movie about aliens. We hadn't looked up any further information or read any reviews so we were pretty much at the mercy of the movie.Yes there were nods to apartheid, racism and other slight slithers of social commentary... I didn't expect too much as it was a sci-fi film, NOT a documentary!At the end we both agreed that it was a great movie, it made you feel good. It brought out something human in you whilst you watched. It was a feel good movie with a few feel bad parts in it.I think it said a lot more about the human condition and our tribal/selfish ways ... how WOULD we react in a situation like the film puts us in?The answer could very well be quite similar to the way the film's characters acted...not exactly welcoming!!All these people saying 'Go watch Gandhi' or other silly comments ... No one is here to watch a film like Gandhi! They were looking for a good Sci-Fi film.That is what this is.A GOOD SCI-FI FILM.So go and enjoy it and please, don't take life so seriously!",7,2,4,6 January 2010
Final Destination," High Speed Deaths..
","This is definitely NOT one of the best Horror movies I have seen. I find that review of it quite amusing. This movie could so easily fall into the category of American movies that are too much like trashy American Supernatural series that are being shown in their thousands from one side of the world to the other.. But! But, the way in which the director controls the atmosphere, especially when a frightening scene is coming up, also the suddenness of some of the deaths; which really does grab you from the back of the head and get you sitting up straight in your seat; for all of the above reasons this is truly a good movie.It is not a 'great' movie.The all too worn out and common 'American Teenagers Horror Movie' is enough for me to give it a lower rating -Unless it is strikingly different...which this film isn't. 6 stars",6,1,2,8 January 2005
Moon," Even if you're not into Sci-fi ... this is a great film about humanity.
","I just wanted to add another positive comment here for this film as I just watched it and thoroughly enjoyed it.There are many elements to the movie but it's real bullseye is the space/moon location with it's loneliness and isolation, as you watch you get sucked into a world that, although far from anyone's reality, you kind of feel inside that one day people could be living lives like this. I even found myself wondering just if I would be able to cope with such a life. Probably not! My reference to this film saying a lot about humanity...you will have to watch and go through the experience, to understand my comment there.It's hard to comment on much of the film without giving anything away so I'll just say that the acting was really good, superb. The direction and script, again, great. The screenplay was also highly rated for me, in fact I struggle to find anything negative to say at all so I won't!Thinking about seeing this film? THINK NO MORE!7 stars.Go see it!",7,1,5,10 November 2009
