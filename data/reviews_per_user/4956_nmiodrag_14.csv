Blade Runner 2049," OK,now what?
","Denis Villeneuve is undoubtedly Ridley Scott of present day. The film is a visual orgy from the first scene to the last. it has moments of pure genius and a few scenes are anthological with many references to the original. Gosling and Ford are both perfect, but the film as a whole isn't, it has two major flaws: the first one is that is too fairytale-ish and 'in the clouds' - it does not provide that dirty feeling of real life on the streets that the original had. The second one is that it was obviously made as the middle part of a trilogy - the audience is left with a smack on the face in the closing scene with the question: 'Now what'? I can hardly wait to see Villenueve's Dune and Blade Runner 3 of which I have no doubt it will come :) In my opinion 9/10",9,1,5,7 October 2017
Star Trek Into Darkness," Moments of brilliance drowned in a sea of pretentious pathos and downright stupidity
","** No spoilers in first part ** I saw Star Trek Into Darkness yesterday in IMAX 3D and although it's visually stunning and has a superb cast with great chemistry it falls short in the storytelling department. This is one of those movies that leaves you with the impression that it has very little to offer aside from what it flaunts in the trailer. I am a huge fan of its 2009 predecessor, and can only conclude that adding the third writer to he mix resulted in three being a crowd. It has moments of brilliance drowned in a sea of pretentious pathos and downright stupidity. It opens strong and promises a great ride but then some 30 minutes into the movie abandons the potentially exciting and epic plot for a lame 'character development' story.** Spoilers follow from here on ** First thing that offends that they evidently fired the science advisors or never bothered consulting them in the first place: while in the predecessor you had the mysterious red matter that is never explained and causes planets to go black hole, it works because it remains a mystery - here Spock freezes a super-volcano that is about to wipe out a civilization with a make-shift COLD FUSION device. Fusion, hot or cold, generates energy instead of absorbing it. Later on, there is this long sequence of Enterprise free falling through Earth's upper atmosphere with the saucer placed horizontally and entire ship slowly rotating, yet gravity aboard has gone completely haywire: in some parts of the ship people are flying alongside the hull, in others running along the sides of the saucer corridors, and in others still running on a gantry avoiding debris falling down. I will not even start on Kirk knocking the warp core into alignment hanging from the rafters while in free fall. Or parking a star-ship on the ocean floor for that matter.Second thing that offends is the overdone 'emotional journey' of the characters. OK, I can buy that admiral Pike has become a surrogate father to Kirk and the obvious LOVE, care and respect they have for each-other is plausible, to the point that Kirk is emotionally shaken by admiral's sudden death. What I don't buy is that Spock - who is accused by Uhura of not showing affection - completely breaks down emotionally when he believes Kirk is dying, everything made worse by 'holding hands' through the radiation chamber glass door.However, the worst offense is using Klingon home-world and a group of Klingons as a cheap teaser. The movie promises an imminent all-out Klingon/federation war with Khan involved in a middle of it; to abandon that storyline and Klingons altogether in a few minutes, and offer a sappy Kirk / Spock love story with Khan stuck in between.",4,95,155,10 May 2013
Alexander," Dark and disturbing? Yes. Excellent movie? Yes, yes, yes!
","I saw Alexander last night on a midnight screening in Zagreb, Croatia. Even though I'd usually be fast asleep at that time the film kept me wide awake every minute of it's long three hours. Going out of the theater, my verdict was: Mr. Stone, you have two thumbs up. Why is it than that I see mostly negative reviews from the few viewers who have posted their opinions so far? Allow me explain myself and venture a few guesses about that.*Spoilers start*Is this film dark and disturbing? Yes, it is. But such were the times and the circumstances in which Alexander lived. The myths he grew up were dark and disturbing (which is well portrayed in the movie when young Alexander is taken to a sort of crypt by his father Fillip, and shown the wall paintings representing those myths); seeing his father rape his mother when he was a young boy was disturbing; having grown up with a mother who was constantly afraid of being killed and replaced by another queen and who had his father assassinated to avoid such fate was disturbing; being rejected by his father at age of 19 when he decided to take on another queen (a Macedonian woman unlike his Greek mother) was disturbing; seeing his father behaving lewdly with both mean and women on drunken feasts was disturbing; being convinced by his mother that he is a son of Zeus, and therefore a god, was disturbing - but such were the circumstances in which he lived.There was a lot of controversy related to this film pushing some kind of 'homosexual agenda' from mainstream Hollywood. I think this film puts homosexuality well within the context of the Greek culture. Aristhoteles explains this in the movie when teaching young Alexander, Hephaestus and their peers. The context was the myth of Achilles and his lover Patroclus, whose death he had mourned and avenged (we know that Alexander was fascinated with this mythos more than any other, and saw himself and Hephaestus in such a relationship): for a man to lay down with another man driven by lust was considered inappropriate, without any merit for the men involved in such an act, and therefore shameful. On the other hand, for two men to lie down together when they were in a relationship of mutual love, respect and edification was considered appropriate and stimulative for the culture of the time. The mythos of Achilles (which was so badly misrepresented in the recent blockbuster 'Troy') gives a great example of this: Achilles and Patroclus were lovers, not cousins as presented in 'Troy', and that fact was acceptable by both the culture and their gods (obviously not acceptable for the Hollywood moviemakers). There was, however, an incident by which Achilles incurred the wrath of Apollo on himself, and it wasn't the killing of the Apollo's priests or desecrating his statue (as shown in 'Troy'), but something else altogether. The old king Priam had numerous sons (about 20) with different wives, and not just Hector and Paris. One of the Trojan princes was Troilus for whom it has bean prophesized that if he lives to be 20, the city of Troy would never fall. Achilles saw the young prince and lusted after him. The prince fled to the temple of Apollo to seek sanctuary. Achilles followed the boy (who was 19 at the time) into the temple and after the boy refused to satisfy his lust, slew him right there on the Apollo's altar. That is why Apollo turned against Achilles and that's why he had to die. We find a parallel in Alexander: Alexander is portrayed as being in a love relationship with Hephaestus and he is not judged for it by his culture (although he is advised by his mother to marry and produce a successor to the throne), but only by his non-Greek wife. The film depicts the two men professing love to each other and hugging each other on numerous occasions, as well as Hephaestus massaging Alexander's neck and shoulders in one scene and giving him a ring in another, and Alexander inviting his lover to spend the night with him - none of which was unacceptable for Greek culture of the time. However, as Achilles gives into his lust, so does Alexander, as he is seduced by a male Persian exotic dancer/escort at one of the drunken feasts. The movie portrays Alexander kissing the dancer during the feast, and being tended by him the next morning when Hephaestus enters his tent to 'straighten' him up.*Spoilers end*Can Mr. Stone be blamed for showing things as they were? Not in my opinion. He had courage to show what we know about Alexander's life without changing it to fit our present day (false) morality. Some may call it an 'agenda'; I call it being true to his subject (both the culture of the time and particularities of Alexander's life). Could he have done it differently? Of course. He could have altered the facts as they did in Troy, or be more discriminate as to what he chose to portray. In either case we would have not been presented by the culture of the time or the facts of Alexander's life. If this is too disturbing for you, go and see sugar-coated Troy instead. This is one of the rare movies that Mr. Stone made where there is no Star-Spangled Banner waving and pampering to the America's national pride (for which I have very little respect, being a typical European) - but showing just ugly, dirty, disturbing story of one man's life and his time. Is it strange that he is being rejected by his American audience (that so loved his 'patriotic' movies)? No, not at all.What of the other aspects of this movie? I think acting was superb, especially that of Mr. Farrell and Mrs. Jolie. Brad Pitt (whom I personally like very much) as Achilles in 'Troy' has nothing on Mr. Farrell (who is to me convincing both as 19 year old, and as a grown-up Alexander), and Mrs. Jolie has proved to be a really good actress - other than looking simply gorgeous. One thing I was annoyed by was Mrs. Jolie's accent (other accents did not bother me as much as they seamed to bother some people); since it sticks out as a sore thumb (I guess they wanted to point out her being a foreigner and not a Macedonian woman). I particularly like Sir. Anthony Hopkins's aged Ptholomeus who speaks of Alexander (at the end of the movie) both with adoration and a dose of cynicism which gives him a note of reality.Finally, I am amazed by the people who bash on this movie because someone has a bad hairdo?! If we are to judge movies based on the hairdo than planetary popular original Star Wars would be a total dud (being renowned for some of the worst hairdos ever seen on the silver screen) - but it isn't.Is Alexander a dark and disturbing movie? Yes. Is it for everybody's taste? No. Is it a good movie? Yes, yes, yes. I give it 9/10.",9,1,7,21 November 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Which captain has a bigger looking glass?
","I've seen 'At World's End' on the Croatian premiere last night and liked it. However, it does suffer from 'too much of everything cramped into three hours' syndrome and it's hard to digest all at one sitting. Definitely less dark and more twisted (multiple Jack hallucinations) than the 'Dead Man's Chest'.It does seem to suffer from some major plot holes  or not?*** MEGA SPOILERS START *** From the fact of how Elizabeth became a captain and a Pirate Lord, one would conclude that it's done by appointment from the previous Pirate Lord you serve under. If this is so, how and when did Barbosa become one? In the 'Curse of the Black Perl' we learn that he was serving under Jack and mutinied against him, stole his ship and thus became a captain, and fallen to the curse shortly after that. But, according to Calypso, he was already a Pirate Lord when he died  which is why she resurrected him in the first place. How is it that one Pirate Lord is serving under another? It may well be that Barbosa was a captain and a Pirate Lord before he came to serve under Jack and did so under false pretenses to steal his ship and treasure, but would Jack (as a Pirate Lord himself) have not recognized him?Also, what exactly and in which order happened between Davy Jones and Calypso? Who first betrayed whom? He fell in love with her while she was still 'unbound' and cut out his own heart. She took pity and gave him the task of ferrying souls to the other side. When she failed to show up after 10 years he grew bitter and betrayed her to the pirate council  or not? *** MEGA SPOILERS END ***'At World's End' has lots of funny moments, especially with competing captains (e.g. whose looking glass is bigger), and yes the special effects are amazing.Definitely a 'must see' and if you are a fan like me  more than once.",9,2,4,24 May 2007
Spider-Man: Homecoming," A perfect 10
","To clarify why I think Spider Man - Homecoming is a perfect 10: they made another genre movie - high school coming of age movie to be precise, but with this they made a true marvel (pun intended). For example, they never tell you 'With great power comes great responsibility', they show it in a best possible way. Perfect from the first second to the last (and stay till the end of credit roll - there is an important lesson ;-) )...",10,114,227,6 July 2017
Interstellar," Visually stunning treatise on humanity - not for everyone's taste
","I just saw Interstellar and out of 4 people in our group I was the only one who liked the whole package. Caveat emptor! To me the main theme here is HUMANITY and the message is crystal clear: it's not our mind that defines us but our heart; and it's not by our mind that we (as species) are eventually saved but by our heart. No it's not a new Odyssey 2001 since Nolan tackles a different theme and in some ways ventures where Clark wouldn't. For me everything was logical in the end and sat in it's place. I can see why some people might not like or appreciate it as much - but I do. Bravo!On the flip-side in our little group one did not like Anne Hathaway and seemingly arbitrary choice of upholding or breaking scientific principles, another did not like the singularity, and the third did not like the ending...",9,3,9,6 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Not perfect but I don't mind the imperfections
",My non spoiler Star Wars the Rise of Skywalker thoughts: in given circumstances (Carrie Fisher's untimely death => improvised plot & raging fans) they did the best they could. My inner child is happy and was entertained. I am a proud fan and I got exactly what I expected. I understand that people who expected something else may be disappointed but I'm not. I give it 8 out of 10 and it may change on subsequent viewings :-),8,5,16,19 December 2019
The Matrix Revolutions," If only they have taken it one step further...
","Having been bitterly disappointed with Matrix Reloaded, I went to see this last installment with much lower expectations. My first impression was: better than Reloaded, not quite up to the original. This movie is by far the least mystical in the series, more on the «let it all hang out» side. Everything is now shown and revealed. This movie is visually stunning, quick paced, action packed extravaganza that doesn't suffer from pointless, boring, never-ending scenes as Reloaded did.*Spoilers*I do have a problem with it, though. And that is in the half-a** resolution in the end, a seaming peace that is no real victory. Originally I wanted Neo to destroy the machines, liberate mankind, restore the world.... but then I reconsidered.Having read another viewer's comment I understand why that wouldn't be right: Neo is and must be the savior of all: men and machines/programs made in human image alike. However, I wish they have taken it just one step further.The scene with him and Trinity flying into the scorched skies, over the clouds where sun still shines had such potential for a proper resolution: after Neo defeated Agent Smith (liberating the machines from him), brokered peace between Zion and Matrix and died, he should have been revealed as truly «the One» - the one who can (no longer living in flesh) restore the skies and truly liberate both machines and men: machines would have been given the proper power source and be truly free of their need of men as power sources, and men would be free to live alongside the machines.
«Machine City» and «Human City» would coexist as two civilizations living in peace, and the Matrix would no longer be a prison but a world that bridges the two: where programs live and people can visit and exchange knowledge and experiences. This is the ending I would like to see as the proper resolution to this story.Still, I give this one 8/10.",Null,0,0,6 November 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," We want more!
","I've seen the movie twice, during its premier week of late night showings. Both times it kept me on the edge of my seat. Both times my friends and I left the theater with the same thought: we want more!!! The movie showed everything I wanted to see from the book. The special effects are breath taking and Gollum is superb. Yes, the movie does depart from the book (I have read the trilogy twice) and I have heard disgruntled LOTR fans commenting on that while leaving the theater, but to me it does not take from its value. I'll definitely see it again, and again. One viewing (and in my case two) is not enough to catch everything that this visual feast offers. In comparison with Fellowship of the Ring, this movie is lighter, both in appearance (wide open sunlit spaces of Rohan) and character (the comic angle added in competition between Gimli and Legolas amidst the darkness of Helm's Deep), and the darkness is now more within (the `possessed' king Theoden, the tormented Gollum/Smeagol, and Frodo becoming more and more like the wretched creature). Thumbs up and we can not wait for the Return of the King.",10,0,0,12 January 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Much ado about nothing
","This has got to be the WORST sequel I've ever seen (with possibly the exception of Return to the future II), and this is why:The first Matrix movie had everything: mystery, spirit, originality of approach and technical bravado of new inventions that made it 'fly'. But first and foremost it had an intelligent Sci-Fi rendition of the New Testament story complete with all the archetypes: John the Baptist, disciples, Judas, demons and of course the Savior (I will not bore you with the all the fine and not so obvious details that parallel the Biblical account). Just to make it clear: I have it in my DVD collection and consider it a masterpiece.As opposed to that, what does this sequel have to offer? Tones of special effects blown out of every proportion to the point of being distracting (I heard chuckles from the audience during the action scenes). And this is quite deliberate. They have to distract you from the fact that there is no substance to this hodge-podge. There is no story (what story there is, can be told in one sentence), there is no spirit, and there is no mystery aside from what is cleverly 'concealed' within the title.This distraction is brilliantly executed, no mistake about it, but the fact remains: this is all much ado about nothing. In the first half hour of the movie hardly anything significant happens and there is one excruciatingly long scene that had me thinking 'oh, for crying out loud - get it over width!' Someone from behind me actually voiced the same opinion.I am stupefied by the fact that the same crew that made such a masterpiece as the first Matrix movie could produce this. My only hope is that they redeem themselves in the next (and hopefully last) sequel.",4,0,0,22 May 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Nice flick  where's the rest of it...?
","I have seen ROTK last night and it took almost a day for the emotions to settle enough to write this review. I had such high expectations for Jackson's big finale, and mostly they were met. Mostly, I say.Met because: Minas Thirit and everything around it was breathtaking. Paths of the Dead were great, Shelob too. There was suspense, the emotions were running high and three hours went by in a blink. The several fade-outs in the end seemed to annoy people (thinking, 'this is the end  no wait, then this must be the end, no wait...'). For me they seemed like appendices and I liked that too  especially the Gray Havens. Not met because: there is one thing that really bothered me (and have in mind that I'm NOT a Tolkien purist); it was evident  much more so than in the first two movies  that big portions were cut out of ROTK to squeeze it into the present running time of three and a half hours.This film leaves me wanting for the extended version much more so than the first two (of which I thought even the shorter versions were excellent, while the extended ones are brilliant). For this one I can say it's good, quality wise on the level with the first two, but it's missing big chunks in it  and I'm not speaking from a standpoint of missing parts of the book, but simply missing parts of the logical plot development. For example:*** Spoiler ***You see Éovyn head over heals for Aragorn before the battle, and immediately after she's with Faramir on the coronation.*** Spoiler ends ***So, all 'n all I say 7/10 for the theatrical version and expecting at least 9/10 for the extended version.",Null,0,0,19 December 2003
Godzilla," A major letdown
",The facts we learned about Godzilla from the most recent movie: 1. Godzilla must have started using Listerine(R) at some point because his atomic breath is now blue (we can infer that it's also minty fresh) 2. Godzilla is now an elderly gentleman who needs a nap after a battle and before going on for a few final laps in the pool (ocean) The facts we learned about movie-making: 1. It's a BAD idea to kill off your A list cast that people relate to just to set up a background story for your B list lead with zero charisma that no one gives a damn about 2. When making a monster movie give us more than 15 minutes of that monster so we can at least root for Godzilla since there's no (relatable) human element therein,5,12,24,17 May 2014
300," Perfect from technical and stylistic standpoint; history it is not
","I just saw 300 yesterday and I liked it for the visual style and perfection. I especially liked all the blood spatter and scene composition (very comic-book like).However, history it is not. By any stretch of imagination: 1. Greeks did not build their cities with holes in the middle of the square (about 30 feet in diameter and several thousand feet deep) that have no apparent purpose except throwing the enemy messengers into it...2. Greeks did not build their temples on the top of a spire with 80 degree angle slopes...3. Ephors were not mystics, but retired spartan officers 60+ yo, who had an advisory role to the rulers 4. Sparta had no governing council, nor was it a democracy 5. Xerxes was not 9 feet tall...6. Spartans did not wage war naked in leather thongs...And so on, and so forth...",8,0,1,19 April 2007
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Unoriginal, special effects orgy, farewell to logic
","Most of this film feels like a re-hash of the previous installment, only with better graphics and a bigger quantity of everything – except for logic. Bigger quantity of action and special effects does not necessarily make for a better movie. At some point it becomes tedious and you just want it to end but it drags on, and on, and on. The attempts at comedy were annoying and so were the two leads. I honestly expected something from Shia LaBeouf after the first movie, but the sequels left me sadly disappointed. The two saving graces for me in this film were John Turturro and Frances McDormand. Back to the issue of logic: *** SPOILERS AHEAD *** Problem #1: Sentinel repetitively states that they were gods on Cybertron – however if the entire planet is inhabited by autobots, who were they gods to? The entire idea of autobots is ridiculous to begin with, for such creations have no purpose except to make interesting toys. Problem #2: as demonstrated by the scene of decepticons invading from the Moon – the pillars create a portal – one that is entered on one end (Moon) and exited on the other (Earth). When they want to teleport Cybertron to Earth, they surround Earth with pillars, but the Cybertron appears OUTSIDE of the pillars, and there is obviously no entrance portal because Cybertron is abandoned. Problem #3: when the teleportation is interrupted a black-hole like funnel sucks Cybertron in – it is the size of the Earth and very close, but nothing happens to earth's atmosphere?",3,5,12,3 July 2011
