3:10 to Yuma," 3:10 to yuma
","i went and saw 3:10 to yuma today and it seemed like a great movie,cast and story. but it was riddled with mistakes that made it unrealistic and worst of all it really got confusing towards the end you'll know what i mean if you go and see it. i think there was a casting issue in this movie to the x-men star who played the flying boy was unbelievable as a bad guy, russell crowe was good and Christian bale and the rest of the cast were good but that one mistake stood out for the whole movie. i was going to walk out on this movie but the story was strong and i wanted to see the end but i was disappointed in the fact that the ending was very poorly done id like to know who writes these endings its like they live in a fantasy world.",3,5,13,7 September 2007
