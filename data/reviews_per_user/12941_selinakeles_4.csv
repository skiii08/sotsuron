The Incredible Hulk," I wish Mark Ruffalo played this
","I mean I love the original actor, but Not as hulk. This movie was just very cheap and the character didn't fit him at all. I don't recommend, there plenty good other marvel movies out there",6,1,2,20 July 2018
Captain Marvel," Seemed diff than regular marvel movies but amazing!
","I am getting annoyed by the amount of hate it is getting. I watched it on March 7th, in the advanced screening, and everyone seemed to enjoy the movie. There was a lot of laughter too! The fight scenes were shot very well, and I didn't cringe at the cgi. The music score was amazing! I really liked the acting in it too. I have been praising it to everyone that I know. Please go see it!!",10,6,21,17 March 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Veryyy Funny!!
","I enjoyed this movie very much. Every time I watch it, I'm at the edge of my seat, and I laugh as well. It is truly rare that the second or third movie outdoes the first one but this one really did. After the second Thor movie, I was concerned, but Thor Ragnarok definitely redeemed and saved the Thor franchise. I even liked this one more than the first one. It was great that they changed the vibe and tone of the Thor movies with this one because the cast like Chris H himself is very comedic and it's perfect for his character and the movie to be funny. Taika Waititi did amazing.",10,2,6,20 July 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Just great!!
","I mean it was almost perfect. This movie is also good for people that don't usually fan over marvel movies. It's like a line where marvel fans and not necessarily 'fans' meet. It was an amazing teen movie but it wasn't so easy for grownups and parents to enjoy as well. I'm a hardcore OG first Spider-Man fan with the goat Toby Maguire but we can't ignore the fact that he was way older than his character. Tom Holland looks so young and is actually young! With his great acting skills, he really sells that he is actually Spider-Man. I also loved the casting. Everyone's role did fit. Great job to Tom Holland and even watching his interviews, you can see that there is no one better for the role than Tom. I definitely recommend!",10,0,3,20 July 2018
