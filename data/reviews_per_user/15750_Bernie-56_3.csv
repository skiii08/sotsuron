"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Ho Hum
","This film tries hard but fails. Perhaps to non-Australian audiences it may have appeal as a travelogue, but to the native it is merely tedious.Anyone who lives here knows Broken Hill is a rough, tough isolated mining town.  If a couple of citified fruits turn up in drag, well it's all so predictable.  Where have I come across that well-worn theme before? Oh yes -- Town Mouse and Country Mouse. Spare us.I kept hoping it would improve but after the Broken Hill scene I could see where this was heading and so turned off the TV and went to bed.",4,3,16,23 September 1999
Stripes," Dated. Plagiarised.
","Perhaps this film was regarded as original and rather humorous in its country of origin way back in 1981, but it's now dated. Two idiots join the army and get knocked into fine servicemen -- wow, I'd never have thought of a plot like that! Come to think if it, I have heard of it before.  It's a cheap knock-off of Boulting Brother's Â‘Private's Progress' (1956) in which an all-star cast playing a squad of misfits is knocked into fine servicemen, watched over by a tough, gruff about-to-retire drill sergeant.  This downmarket US plagiarised version is just not in the same class.  Bill Murray is just a dull pain-in-the ass who self-centred child-like persona is supposed to be comic.  Warren Oates and John Candy in supporting roles are acceptable, with Oates almost reaching the standard set by William Hartnell.",2,18,31,9 November 2002
Bridget Jones's Diary," Pride and Prejudice II
","Hugh Grant and Colin Firth reprise 'Pride and Prejudice' in modern dress. Heavens, Firth's character is even called Darcy!  Well, at least he didn't have to rehearse his expression or learn a new character. And he still gets the girl by playing the serious, brooding type. For all that, 'Diary' is a lightweight, pleasant but improbable diversion. Not hard to see how how Zellweger's character got to 32 without getting married. Not real bright, no interests, no talent for anything much other than feeling sorry for herself. Felt like screaming 'get a life, you dozy cow'. Her best feature: voluptuous figure, even if a little on the short side (similar build to Marilyn Monroe).",6,0,0,8 January 2002
