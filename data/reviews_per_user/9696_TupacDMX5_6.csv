E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Outstanding
","This film is clearly the most up-lifting film in the history of cinema. I wouldn't know another film where you can just sit back over and over again and forget the world around you and get trapped in a different reality. Henry Thomas acts an unforgettable role, as does Dee Wallace and Drew Barrymore. Usually I look for answers or points in a film, but this one I didn't even bother. I just got so trapped away in it's story that I threw out the books and just enjoyed the film. I am happy that Steven Spielberg created this film, for this film has made me a better person today. Whenever I need to escape this everyday world, I just stick in E.T. and wash my troubles and worries away. Definately my favorite film.
Clearly a landmark in cinema as well.",Null,1,2,17 July 2001
Fight Club," Great Film
","For one, enough with those that call this film a waste with no morality, consequences, or point. This film dug deep into the idealism that would drive any man mad. This film pushed the point that possessions, money, idealistic thinking, and the social fabric of this world can and will push any man to the point of retaliation. I know that this man had problems because he was an insomniac and projected the image he always wished himself to be. People don't realize that the point was for this man to become someone he always wanted, a free man that can do as he pleased. Fight Club was not a movie about a psycho who got a bunch of guys together to form a cult to destroy the social fabric of this world. It was about a man who was sick and tired of the phonies, pointless possesions, lies, and bondage in a life he could not escape. This man found a way out of the idealism and projected an image of himself that was buried deep in his mind. Everything pushed him to the point where this man became a normal part of his life. Little did he know though that he was this man, and was performing everything he witnessed. He found a way out and shared it with other men. For the first time in these mens lives, they felt free and rejuvinated. If their is no point in that, I don't know where it is. The consequences did not come to these men, it came to the world that trapped them in a social slavery. It came to the world that pushed them to do this, and if that is immoral, too bad, the immorality came from the world. The point is harder to realize. The point basically to me is that people need to find a way out. That their is no point in living a life that leads nowhere. If it takes creating a group of obsessed brainwashed men to show this world how to be free, than so be it. But people need to get out of a life that has no point, if that's the case, what's the point of even living. For the first time in these mens lives they felt like they were a part of something noble, important, and felt like they were living for something. I was happy to actually see a film that showed how phony and pointless some films really are. This film had many points. The points are deep and are really decided by the viewer. But to say that this film has no point or dosen't even deserve to be called a film is preposterous.Definately one of my favorites.",Null,0,1,13 July 2001
Taxi Driver," Masterpiece!
","What else can I say other than how unbelievable Robert Deniro's performance was! His acting in this film clearly ranks among the best performance's in cinematic history. An actor did not do a good job if you can not feel for or relate to the character in any way. Because in reality if you can't, your not going to care for the person performing the roll, nor the film. I had just recently bought this film, after watching it over a friend's house. I was astounded by this film's message's and realism. This film clearly show's how dirty and sick this world at times really is. Martin Scorsese picked the right idea on a man whom was in this mess, was actually a decent human being. The only thing that turned this man mad, was in turn the world. The world as to which he fought for in Vietnam, yet no one respected or cared for him in any way. I like how they incorporated Travis Bickle's sanity and insanity at the same time. At time's I was a little confused if he was sane or insane, which was great. Only because this gave you the chance to deside for yourself, if Travis was either trying to make good with his sanity, or just rampaging while killing people with his insanity. I (like many others), think that he was sane. He was perfectly sane. The only times I felt he was insane was when he did not care for his health or his own decency. When he started to care (the supposed insane stage), he took care of himself, and treated himself with respect. I feel though, at both times, he was still a little sane. Basically because this man was willing to sit down and write about his day, which is a great thing to do if you deal with 'scumbags' all day. That I feel, helped him keep his sanity.I think though, that the thing that made him this angry, was when he realized and saw what he had fought and killed for in Vietnam. Many think that the war made him crazy, I don't. I think that the people (the pimps, prostitutes, perverts, murderers, scumbags...etc...all of it), drove him mentally unstable.Jodie Foster played probably her best roll as Iris as did Cybill Shepherd as Betsy. I think everyone that was in this film though did an outstanding job.
This film definately ranks in my top 5. Great (unbelieveable) film.",Null,0,0,16 July 2001
2001: A Space Odyssey," Landmark In History
","This film is not just a landmark in cinema, it's a landmark in history. The creative ingenuity of both Kubrick and Clark is just absolutely meticulous. What stunned me the most is that Kubrick completely blew the names like Asimov out of the water. He blew every science fictionist out of the industry. His theatrical prediction of evolution was just absolutely stunning. It left you for more questions as you were getting more answers, and no film has ever been able to accomplish this end without criticism. This film not only showed you that evolution was is possible, but it showed you that science plays a role just as big as religion. What struck me really odd about Kubrick (and is the reason he's my favorite director), is the way he dosen't explain his films to the public. He just puts out it, and we are just going to have to figure it out ourselves. I think Kubrick gets a thrill out of this, but I also think that its pure genius. I think he is a real artist, it's just that he's painting a picture of a broken reality, not a perfect one. I feel that this is the motives behind his films and what seperates him from other directors who try to explain every detail of a film. What also struck me as odd was how Kubrick's prediction of the lunar landscape was so accurate just a year shy of Neil Armstrongs first steps on its surface. Kubrick also started many ideas that are still being considered by NASA, and they are also reconsidering some of their ideas purely on this film alone! Like the computer HAL, sure he had the ability to connect with humans, but humans have a dark side just as they have a light. So one must consider that the principle of contradictions plays a part in machines just as humans. I recently watched A.I. and I have to say that their theory on artificial intellegence was pretty similar to that of 2001. Though I don't see how (a boy that was built to love), feels nothing but love, when all in all, he's hated. HAL demonstrated A.I. wonderfully. Dave Bowman demonstrated human emotion to its fullest extent, and portrayed it perfectly. This film has not only sparked my mind, but the minds of millions of philosophers, theologist, scholors, scientist...you name it! I know for sure that this film has sparked my mind in the quest for answers behind reality, as it did millions of people around the world. Kubricks ideas are going to be well a reality in the future, and the irony is, why this film is a landmark in history.",Null,0,3,18 July 2001
The Matrix," Philosophically Accurate
","As much as one would like to denote this films intellegence, one has to look at the actions and the meanings behind them. Rather than just laughing out loud at its action sequences. At times yes the action did seem uneeded and un-called for, and at first I could have done without them, basically because the story lines meaning was enough that caught my attention. But whether or not you wanted to believe it, this film contained enormous amounts of philosophy. These days it's hard to see a new movie that can incorporate action and philosophy in one film. The only film to incorporate philosophy (that's worth attention) would have to be Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odessey'. Never once did I question 2001's integrity without philosophy involved, and neither did I with The Matrix. Sure The Matrix could have had some cheesy lines like, 'It's our way, or the highway.'...but hey it's the real world and not everyone can come up with new original lines every second. I did question though something that bothered me. For one, even though we are in something called 'The Matrix' and have the ability to perform any task we wish, as long as our 'will power' and mind can achieve such a state, how come is it that Neo and Morpheus and all of them are the only ones who can perform such feats? I thought about this for a while and than realized that they were the only ones in this world who had the knowledge, which really makes me question our own reality. That maybe there is something else out there, waiting for the person to gain the knowledge. A lot of human beings now have the 'will power' and the right state of mind, all they need is the knowledge of whatever it is out there, and than they can perform whatever task is it that they can do. I guess that this movie reminded me a lot of something called 'Astral Projection' where as unlimited realms of existence giving you the ability to fly, jump dimensions, use abilities that are unfathomable to man. Which is something that hit me when I saw Neo flying in the end. That only made me question and give me the anxiety to wait for the next one. My point is, basically, that if any movie can make you question everything or anything as a whole, than that film was indeed philosophical. This film definately ranks up there with 2001: A Space Odessey, and many other films like it.If I am the only one that not only looks for great cinematography, acting, etc...and philosophy as well within a film...I feel bad cause it needs to be known to people. Philosophy was actually the first kind of theator in a way. Socrates and others would perform acts that would in turn demonstrate philosophical meanings.",Null,0,0,14 July 2001
The Matrix," Great Film
","This film shows something that not many films attempt. What struck me the most is that they dealt the pure enigma of life and fate as a whole. Despite the lack of story and the countless meaningless action, they replaced it well with the meaning of the film. This movie showed something that I can figure, not many people noticed. They completely flipped reality as a whole upside down, but the directors knew that this would be a hard task. So they incorporated truth behind the complexity. I know that I might be digging too deep within this film, but from watching interviews of the directors and listening to what the actors were saying. I feel that they made this film to show, not just comic book action, but to pretty much show how abstract this world can be, despite what we think about it. It was made to show how the human mind is a such a fragile yet powerful thing. Despite our knowledge and our own thought of superiority in this universe, in the end, our ignorance got the best of us. This film demonstrated that well, and despite having Keanu Reeves as Neo, he was probably the only person that could have played that part well. What struck me, was how they demonstrated the use of the mind. Alot of people crave meaning and answers behind alot of the metaphysical uses in the film, but the directors did a good job in just saying that the mind is the answer behind all reality and answers. These demonstrations that were being projected in the film, were their for a reason, not just random pointless scenes. My favorite scene in the film is when Neo watches the little bald-headed girl bend the spoon with her mind. Neo than attempted this next, and she then told him something that was the answer behind the entire film and the answers Neo had been looking for. She told him that that it is not the spoon he should attempt to bend, but his mind. After she said that, the meaning of the whole film unfolded for me. The point I feel behind that saying, was that we should see through the cracks of reality as we know it, and look to where it all is... our minds.
That is why I feel this film ventured places that not many films have gone and why I think it is a great film",Null,0,0,12 July 2001
