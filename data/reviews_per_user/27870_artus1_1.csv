Marie Antoinette," A Historical film
","Basically some people say it's boring, that the ending was bad, etc etc. All I can say is, if you're into that time period then you should have a blast. It's a bit of a 'no hoper teen' film that's gonna end either in tragedy or with some good twist of fate that makes a happy ending, only it's set at the end of the 18th century. Thing is, I'm sure most people know the story of Marie Antoinette, so just remember that before you watch it, if you don't like the end it's probably your fault for watching. I personally am into that era and had a glorious time looking at sets and costumes. Probably the main reason I watched it, and I wasn't disappointed.Overall, I'd rather watch this than the same type of movie set in the modern day. Take it for what it is and appreciate the design work that's been done if you ask me.",Null,0,0,16 February 2008
