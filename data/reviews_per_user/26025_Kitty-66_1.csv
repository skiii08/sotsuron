Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Don't let the critics or hype decide for you...
","My first viewing of TPM was, to put it mildly, sheer sensory overload. The second viewing, things flowed much better and I sat  back to enjoy it for what it was. Loved getting a taste of what Jedi could do at the height of their abilities, and the conflict with the Sith. Liked the conflict with the Naboo/Trade Federation.  Tolerated the Gungans. ;) The podrace was technically impressive, but wears a bit thin on repeated viewings. My favorite part of it ended up being Qui-Gon and Padme' discussing Jedi recklessness, go figure. IF you haven't seen it yet: Ignore the critics. Ignore the hype. Don't go expecting SW, ESB or ROTJ. Judge it on its own merits and be ready to see it at least twice, once to take it all in and another (at least) to enjoy it.",8,5,7,27 May 1999
