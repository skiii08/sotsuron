Changeling," Review of Changeling
","I enjoyed watching Changeling. It is unbelievable that something like this could have really happened. It is sad enough that Christine Collins lost her son, but to go through all of the horror that the police put her through is just unimaginable. As for director Clint Eastwood, I applaud him with a job very well done. I think it is important to portray true-crime stories in a way like this, that does not glorify the killer. I believe there are too many true crime films out there that allow young adults to idolize killers, therefore making them want to reenact the things that they see. Eastwood did not do this. Although he told the story of the Wineville chicken coop murders, in my opinion he did it in a much better way. Christine Collins was a very brave, courageous woman and I think she is someone that should be idolized, rather than a killer. This film effectively portrays Christine Collins' story of terror, hope, survival, and the power of true love.",9,2,3,2 December 2013
