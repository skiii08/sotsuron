The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Book fans: Watch this movie with an open mind
","I went into this movie expecting perfection because the guy who wrote the book would be writing the screenplay AND directing it. I'm not going to lie-I was disappointed to a certain extent. I'm one of those people who is crazy about books and if the book doesn't match the movie it bothers me. HOWEVER, I've come to appreciate this movie for what it is as a completely separate work. There were some important parts in the book that didn't make it to the movie and some that were glossed over that I feel shouldn't have been put on the back burner. With that being said, I know how difficult it can be to transfer everything that happens in a book to the screen without it being three hours long. So I will say this...The actors did a phenomenal job-all of them. I didn't once cringe at certain moments that could have been easily over the top. They handled it well. And Logan Lerman who plays Charlie...wow. It was like the character walked right out of the book and on to the screen. I was very impressed. Emma Watson and Ezra Miller as Sam and Patrick were great in their roles as well. What I liked the most was how this had an indie feel to it that Hollywood rarely does. Nothing about it felt forced or clich√©. Probably has to do with Chbosky having control of everything. Great job, man. Great job.",9,0,1,24 December 2012
Twilight," pretty good for what they had to work with
","I am a huge twilight fan and I must say that while it's not the greatest movie in the world with some of the parts being a little over dramatic and cheesy, it still did pretty well. Many people who haven't read the books don't understand why Edward acts as he does, so they may think Pattinson overacted his part but I think he did it just right. The cast they picked for the characters were well chosen..I can't say I'm disappointed with any of them and kristen stewart plays the perfect bella..just how I imagined bella to be. Overall pretty good with some scenes being corny but what romance, especially one involving a vampire, isn't going to be from time to time? And of course it's true that most movies based on a book almost never measure up to it because it's limited, so it is difficult to compare.",8,4,8,13 March 2009
Pineapple Express," Perfect stoner movie
",Seth Rogan has done it again. But who I really liked was james franco. It just wouldn't have been the same without him. Who knew he could play the perfect pothead?I literally laughed out loud during several parts of the movie which is very rare for me..I usually can only laugh on the inside. This movie is basically about a pothead and pot dealer who are always at the wrong place at the wrong time. A lot of this movie doesn't even seem plausible but still managed to impress with me with its laughable stupidity. This will be marked down in history as another classic stoner movie.,9,2,6,12 August 2008
