Mission: Impossible III," Alias: The Movie
","Whatever this was, it was not 'Mission: Impossible'. It felt more like 'Alias: The Movie'. It's clear that no one involved has ever seen or understood the concept of the grand old 60s spy series. The original dealt with intelligent people conning intelligent bad people into a corner which they couldn't escape. The keyword is 'intelligent'. The heroes were normal people, each with a distinct specialty, and they planned everything carefully. And no matter what happened or what we, the audience, thought had happened, the heroes (and the writers) were always ahead and in control.In this movie, physical superheroes stumble from one impossible situation to the next, and survive by sheer luck, like rolling in front of a taxi (or was it a bus) while fighting the bad guy, conveniently killing him.The direction was quite awful. What, please, was the purpose of the pre-credit sequence? The movie would have worked better without it. Way better. Things like this work in a TV show, where there's no time, but not in a two-hour movie. The camera was used in the nowadays so prevalent, but still awful, shaky-cam-close-up style. Which reduced it pretty much in a mediocre mess. What's the point of setting a story all over the world and making the movie look like it was filmed on a back lot? Considering the talent available to Abrams (Vic Armstrong as stunt coordinator? The Vic Armstrong?), nothing ended up being shown. Gone seem the times when directors appreciated the talent of stunt people, location scouts and casting director. Speaking of casting, this movie was one of the most sexist I've seen. All kinds of male body shapes, but ALL the females were of the extreme skinny model type. Frankly, I want to see shapely women. To me, no hotness here. (There was scene, when the 'hot' heroine pulled out something strapped to her thigh. Classical gratuitous sexy scene, right? Not with this stick figure. Shudder.) I have a very bad feeling for 'Star Trek XI'.",2,0,1,31 October 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," One of the best thought through movies.
","I disagree completely with all the people, who criticize the film, because there's nothing really bad in it. George Lucas and  all of the others worked very hard on TPM, and it shows. After seeing the film a couple of times, I am more and more amazed, how good the script is. GL really thought all details through to make an entertaining experience, and there ARE NO PLOT HOLES. I know that a lot of people out there disagree with me on that, but all of the little problems a lot of people have with the plot can be explained with a little thought, and I believe that GL really thought everything through -- he just didn't tell us the whole story. What surprised me was the German dubbing -- it's really good, and sometimes even better than the original version (I've seen both). Unfortunately we all have to wait too long for the next two episodes...",9,59,91,4 November 1999
Saving Private Ryan," The best (Anti-) war film I ever saw
","I remember very good my feelings when I first saw the soldiers standing in the landing boat at the beginning--if I were born 40 or 50 years earlier, I could've been standing there myself, and I could feel the horror all of those men must have felt.A lot of people call this film too US-centered, but I thought the film did every soldier in WWII justice. There were no good or bad soldiers in it, just poor fellows in one of the worst possible situation a young man can find himself in.I could identify with every one of the guys in the platoon. If I would been forced into military service now, I would end up like  Tom Hanks' character.Someone wrote that the movie praises the USA for fighting good wars by showing the star spangled banner at the beginning and the end. Well, I didn't understood it that way. Could one really be proud of a country, who forces his young men into such a hell?",10,0,0,4 November 1999
From Dusk Till Dawn," What's this film about?
","That's what I thought after I watched the film. What's it about? Is there a some kind of message in there? I actually quite liked it while I watched it, but then the end came. Clooney and Lewis on the parking lot before the Titty Twister, and the thinking set in. The film made absolutely no sense, and I don't think I will watch it again, which is probably the worst thing I can think of saying about a film. I know that a lot of people think of Quentin Tarantino as a good author--well, i don't believe he is. A good film script consists of roughly two parts--a plot and the dialogues. Tarantino is good on the latter, no doubt there, but none of his films have a really good plot. Pulp Fiction was a handful of filmed short stories thrown together, without much sense if they would fit together. From Dusk till Dawn was worse--the pulp-fiction-like first half and the vampire slaughter fest in the second just didn't fit together. At one point I thought I spotted some kind of message in this piece of crap--when Harvey Keitel's character revealed his loss of faith and had to believe to go out and fight the vampires, but Tarantino never worked it out. And the end I felt cheated--I have lost two hours of life which won't come back. There's nothing in this film i can recommend--not even the special effects were really good. They were technically OK, but the design was just crap, senseless, and not thought through, just like the rest of it.",5,0,0,4 November 1999
