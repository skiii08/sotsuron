Lincoln," Day-Lewis Stole the Whole Movie
","I understand not much English words in this movie. But, When I learn English Language Much and Much...I'll See Again this movie to understand each and every wise words in it. I loved the performance of Day-Lewis, his wife and Tommy Lee. I was loving Day-Lewis Soft Spoken Voice, speaking nature and acting in film. Very Great Leader Sir Abraham Lincoln Was.. Abolishing slavery and not discriminating by color. He was the leader of Blacks I guess in his era. Casting Was Very awesome picked gems from industry. Eventually, I can give credit to Direction too. Well Directed by Steven Spielberg and Congrats to whole team of Lincoln who made success film.",10,1,1,18 April 2020

Into the Wild," Direction at it's peak
",I loved the film from beginning to end. Story Narrating was awesome and fascinating. Chris was an outstanding actor. He never bored me by his acting and coming to the point of real character of Chris. Why he really wanted this kick at his early 20's? He would had a good and great life ahead. Killed himself by roaming around without food and eventually starved to death. Be passionate but not insane. If you want to do something prove yourself but don't take your life randomly.,10,0,0,16 April 2020
