Requiem for a Dream," I just bought it today...
","And I am counting down the minutes until tomorrow, when I can get rid of it again.I found Requiem For A Dream to be more like a documentary than a film, in the way of the lighting, the cuts, and the overall feel of it. The acting is superb, and cannot be faulted, particularly Ellen Burstyn's.
The reason I didn't like this film was because of the way the cuts were used. I can see why they were used in the way they were, but I felt that at times they got in the way a little bit, almost as if instead of more scenes the director just decided to fill up the time with lots of cutting of short scenes which seemed to be almost the same every time. Because of this, I felt it got boring.Also I felt there was a slight lack of explaination in the film as to why the people got hooked on drugs in the first place, with the exception of Ellen Burstyn's character. I understand that in some films, explainations are not always necessary, but I feel that more explaination would have worked better in this film.The plot itself isn't overly complex, but I felt some things were hard to follow, though this could just be that in some scenes the score was louder than the people talking. Because of this, some parts can be very boring, as the viewer does not know how that scene came about, or what the actors are saying in the scene.Overall the film is well acted, but incredibly extremely boring. Watch it only to admire Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto's acting abilities.

The Ring," Pretty good I guess...
","The film itself was fairly good- it was a suspense thriller instead of a slash-em-all-up horror movie. V.G. I like that. Even though I knew what exactly what was coming where, (I always pump my friends for every little detail before I fork over the money),  I still felt jumpy where the movie called for it. Another point scored.I was quite impressed by the lead's acting. Even better.
The only major gripe for me was the kid. I'm not talking about Samara, I mean the Kid. The boy. During his scenes he seemed so smug, I wanted to leap up to the massive cinema screen and punch it.Everything else though, was not too bad.",8,0,0,8 March 2003
