Ford v Ferrari," Cheesy american patriotism, heroism
","Yes it is entertaining. But sooo cheesy. So corny. Really sick of cheesy American heroism movies. 'Lets go to war against Europe?' really??? Why you would even remind about World War 2 in some racing car movie? Is it not enough millions of movies every year about a war? Can you leave this brainwashing, cheesy American patriotism out of racing movie",2,5,12,21 February 2020
