Iron Man 3," gr8 movie
","I was amazingly surprised for how good the movie is, it combined adventure, comedy and suspense...and very well done. Robert Downey is so pretty, aging made wonders for him, or the photo shop... but really,he is awesome, the movie gets you connected from beginning to end, people did not stand up even during the credits in the end....I guess we all wanted more....loved it. I watched at the XD 3D movie theater, but XD is enough, don't need to be 3D. I love it when I see a sequel which I consider better than all the previous ones, means that the movie makers really took the audience seriously. Money well spent watching this movie in the movie theater.watched two times in threat re",10,9,21,3 May 2013
