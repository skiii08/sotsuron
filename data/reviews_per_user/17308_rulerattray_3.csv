Casablanca," No wonder we love it!
","Rick loses the love of his life suddenly and without a comprehensible explanation from Elsa.  If anything like that has ever happened to you, you know how devastating it can be.  After you've walked around like a stunned ox for a time, you start to feel a need for revenge.  'How could she leave me when I loved her so much?' followed by 'she must have never loved me at all.  She lied to me.'That, of course, makes her a terrible person, and terrible people should be made to suffer, right? In real life, we seldom get the chance to make the one who rejected us suffer as we have.  But that's only part of the dream.  Underneath that is the fondest dream of all; that someday, somehow we will learn that they DID love us after all.   Rick gets both dreams fulfilled, and thus we who have been through what he has (and who hasn't to one degree or another) get a little of our own back through Rick.  No wonder we love it.  Everyone we care about in it wins.  Rick gets one last romp with Elsa, then gets to be the one who gives HER up. ('Closure' at last!)  Elsa gets to explain that she isn't a bad person, Laslo gets his wife back, and just about everyone (except the Nazis) gets to feel noble. Even the womanizing Chief of police gets a new friend!Don't think I'm putting it down, gang.  I love it too.",Null,0,0,9 October 2001
The Princess Bride," They tried, I guess...
","Sorry, I found it pretty lackluster. The problem, I suppose, is that I made the mistake of reading the book first, and there were passages so brilliant I found myself jumping up and down at the sheer audacity of Goldman's prose and wanting to read it out loud to anyone who would listen.  Wonderful and funny and wise and witty.Goldman may have had a hand in the script, but I think some heavy handed clutz must have been guiding it.  For instance, they missed the crucial point about Buttercup completely.  Sure, she was the most beautiful girl in the world, but she was still just a young, silly girl, and a shallow one at that.  I could go on, but let me just say that if you loved the movie, fine, but if you REALLY want to have a good time, go find the book.  The story of Inigo and his father alone will be worth the search, and the description of the swordplay on top of the Cliffs of Insanity will knock your socks off!God!  I wish someone would remake this one and do it the way it deserves to be done!",Null,2,6,9 October 2001
Bruce Almighty," Good news for whining, shallow boobs!
","At last!  A real 'message' movie!Forget about trying to be thoughtful, kind, responsible and God-fearing. All you have to do is act like a whining, shallow boob, and God will single you out and let YOU be God for a week or so.I never realized before how EASY it is to attain grace!(Who says movies aren't educational!)",Null,0,1,6 June 2003
