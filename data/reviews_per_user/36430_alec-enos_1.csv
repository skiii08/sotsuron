Sucker Punch," Loved it.
","To keep his short sucker punch has many different levels to it and the movie can be interpreted in so many different ways and that is what Snyder was looking to do. He wanted the movie to leave people think 'Holy f***, what the f*** happened.. my brain is now full of f***!' and that's exactly what it did to me. I plan on seeing this movie again.. and again.. and again. I plan to buy the DVD directors cut to see all the extra features, watch all the deleted scenes, and get everything that I can out of it. I don't usually see movies in the theaters but I knew I had to see this one, and I've never seen the same movie in the theaters more than once, this movie will be the first time I do so, and I'm loving every moment of it.",10,4,11,27 March 2011
