The Blair Witch Project," Great movie... wish it would have been in theatres
","Okay... at the risk of sounding like a moron who has been brain-washed by the Blair Witch, it was a good movie. Give it 4.75 stars out of a possible 5.Yes, the camera work was bad... there was almost no TV commercials about it... it was still a good movie.  There aren't that many movies made these days which can bypass the theatre and still draw attention like this one did/still is.  I have yet to see a movie drive the tension and the fear home like this one.The realism and the real fear are what make this so good of a movie.  The legend is put together seamlessly as are the stuff they go through.Like has been said so many times already, 'The last ten minutes are perhaps the most frightening ten minutes of footage of anything that you will ever see.'",Null,3,6,9 February 2003
The Ring," Darn good movie - no spoilers
","Personally, I consider myself a seasoned veteran of the movie world, and I gotta say this one was probably the best that I've seen. Excellent usage of photography and suspense through-out was just awesome (the video they watch was probably the most intensely scary part of the movie... made the little hairs on the back of my neck stand on end). I haven't seen the original Japanese versions yet, so I can't compare it to those, so I'll just give it ****3/4 off the bat.The story was well-written (a bit confusing at times, but overall, well written).  The music actually did a lot for the movie;it kept the suspenseful atmosphere going without getting in the way (thumbs up to Hans Zimmer).When I first saw it, I kept thinking it would be the normal cat-in-the-closet type thing... boy, was I wrong!And, this is one of those movies that has definite rewatchability (to catch all the little subtle things included in it). It's well-deserving of at least one Oscar (at least)!",Null,1,1,6 March 2003
