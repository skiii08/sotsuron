Hereditary," All those that rated this 5+ should start a professional prankster carreer.
","Explaining the title for my review:Those that rated this above 5 stars, must be awarded with some sort of emmy for the best prank ever. Because boy did you succeed!It started out as a dreary family drama, which is enterily plausible for a horror.But for a dramafilm, it felt like it lasted for 2 hours already watching the first 30 minutes. 
And it goes downhill very very fast.. but the movie becomes even more slow.Anything that seemed remotely interesting was destroyed almost immediately whenever something was introduced that might have saved it from utterly failing as a horrorfilm. It was a pure horror idd, a horror to watch and realize i've wasted 2 hours of my life. In that essence it was the best horror film ever. with other words, the best prank ever pulled on a international level.If you are a horrorfan, even in the B-movie segment, ignore this film. I beg of you, don't make the same mistake as I did.the end.",4,0,1,26 August 2018
