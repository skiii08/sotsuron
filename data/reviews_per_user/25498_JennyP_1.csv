The Blair Witch Project," A for effort, but I wish I could forget it.
","I'm very passionate about this film. I passionately hated it!Not that it was a bad film - maybe I just don't like horror films. But since we know going in that the three college filmmakers are doomed, it plays out more like a tragedy. Or a nightmare, especially towards the end as the lost & hungry & (supernaturally?) threatened students get what you knew was coming to them. (At least with Titanic we knew some people survived!)It wasn't really scary for me. More like relentlessly depressing, with a very disturbing ending. If you can get off on that, you'll like it. The premise is definitely inventive, and I thought they pulled it off well enough. (You gotta love an inventive $60,000 major release film. :-)But I still wish we had the ability to forget things at will. I wish I could forget this movie!",3,0,2,13 August 1999
