Iron Man 3," Enjoyed it but have a question......where did they get those extreme heat proof clothes?
","Don't get me wrong i enjoyed it. but i cannot get over the fact that those extremely heated people burned through pretty much everything except their clothes. okay they might have made those clothes specially for themselves which can take that kind of heat. but when rhody/war machine was captured and killian was trying to get him out of the iron man suit , he melted the armour to make rhody release the suit. it needs at least 1500 Celsius ( or something like that) to melt iron. but when rhody jumped out of the suite his shirt and skin remained untouched. then when pepper pots fell in the middle of a fire and walked right out of a it her clothes also did not show any sign of burning. okay i get it wearing an iron man suit protects you not only from bullets but also an impact from a free fall from the sky and also melting armour!!! but pepper pots was not wearing iron man suit.other than that it was typical. fun , action and end.By the way if you are willing to wait till the end and sit through the boring and very long credits, be prepared to be disappointed.",8,5,19,23 April 2013
District 9," Just brilliant!!
","Well i didn't know what to expect, i saw peter Jackson and i decided to watch it. Went to the movies it started within first 15 minutes i saw few people walked out thinking it might be a documentary sort of movie.You may get the same idea if you are expecting a typical alien movie where they just attack and abduct human and they become a threat and big war and we win at last. No it is totally a different kind of alien related movie.I won't tell you the story to spoil the fun.Another thing don't take your kids as they may not enjoy it.As i said its different.every part of the movie was exciting and thrilling. Good action at the end , a great story.",10,2,6,16 August 2009
Insidious," The devil looked more like Darth Maul than a devil...very funny ending
","well after going through the other reviews i am kind a scared to right what exactly i have thought about the movie.Well it started very well till the point where the alarm went off. Now alarm went off husband running around the house with an iron bar and wife was staying in the kid's room without even trying to call the police. Well I am a bit realistic freak. What would you do?? call the cops or wait for your husband to be a hero or get killed? Second point when they moved into the new house where did the 2nd boy go?? Did not show him for a bit.The ghost catcher lady said the husband was scared to take pictures. When she said that the wife looked really surprised!! Well you are married to someone for years who does not have any photo since child hood will raise some questions.and also the grand mother knew her son had the same problem. But she did not think it is important to share that. specially when they moved house because it was haunted and strange things were happening.At the end the whole devil trying to get into the real world scene was more funny than scary.Anyway I normally do not analyze too much,come on it's a movie!! But when I sit down to watch a scary movie I do not expect devil to look like a joker from a circus or more appropriate he looked more like darth maul from star wars.After this time I am never watching a movie reading reviews from IMDb. To be honest I would be really scared after watching this if I was 10 year old.",4,3,8,29 May 2011
