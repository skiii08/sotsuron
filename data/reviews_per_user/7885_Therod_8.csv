Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," My favorite Star Wars movie
","Why do people continue to slam this movie?  This is without a doubt the best Star Wars movie ever.  The visuals and special effects are stunning and the character interactions are memorable.  The fight scenes (between the Jedis and Darth Maul) cannot be topped.  I can't say enough good things about this movie.Common complaint:  'It didn't live up to its hype' My Response:  Well duh!!!  A movie starring God Himself wouldn't live up to the hype the public created for Phantom Menace.Common Complaint:  'Jar Jar was too annoying' My Response:  George Lucas was trying to expand to a younger target audience (which the originals did not do until much later, they are VERY adult-oriented).Common Complaint:  'It's all show and no story' My Response:  So?  That was how it was advertised.  If you go into a Star Wars movie expecting a deep, thought-provoking plot then you have bigger problems than not liking this movie.My Score: 11+ out of 10",Null,0,1,7 April 2001
The Doors," Pretty good, pretty neat
","The Doors are one of my favorite bands (perhaps my favorite).  And this movie is probably the biggest reason why.I'm not saying this movie is without its flaws, because it is not (the one-dimensional portrayal of Morrison, most noteably).But great music and stunning visual effects more than make up for those few flaws.As I mentioned above, there's more to Morrison than is portrayed in the movie.  Sure, he was over the top and larger than life sometimes, but he was also, more often than not, an oridinary guy with ordinary feelings and problems.  But the spirit of Jim Morrison and the Doors endures and inspires regardless of what you think of him.I would have liked to have seen more emphasis put on the other band members (since the movies is called 'The Doors' not 'Jim Morrison') but hey, I'll forgive Stone -- he did an incredible job.My Grade:  A",8,1,1,12 January 2002
Predator," They just don't make em like this anymore (WARNING: Spoilers ahead)
","I just got done watching this movie on TV, and now I want to go out and buy the DVD!  This has always been one of my favorite action/sci-fi movies, and with good reason. Everything was appropriate for the tone of this film.  The actors (especially Schwarzenegger and Weathers) played their roles superbly.  For the time, the effects were cutting edge and setting was so fitting that it was spooky. Now to the show stealer of the movie -- the Predator itself.  Kevin Peter Hall was a perfect choice for the headhunting alien.  He was tall but well-toned, massive yet graceful.  He made the Predator look so real! I can go on and on about this movie, but I will spare you my ramblings. In closing, what really sold me on this movie was at the end, after a fight sequence that would make Mohamad Ali cringe, when Arnold looks over the dying Predator and asks 'What the hell are you?'  To which the creature squawks back, 'What . . . the hell . . . are YOU?' Goosebumps every time!Grade: A",Null,0,0,5 August 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A masterpiece!
","I was cautious of this movie at first, considering the mixed reviews it was receiving, but after seeing it, there is no more doubt in my mind -- this movie was nothing short of spectacular!Every aspect of it was fine-tuned to perfection.  The casting, acting, visual effects, musical score, etc. were all superb.I honestly have no clue why anyone would dislike this movie.  Die-hard Tolkien fans will pick it apart, I'm sure, but I think they need to enjoy the movie for what it is instead of what they think it should be.Why are you still reading this?  Go see it now! ;)My Grade:  A+",10,1,1,12 January 2002
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Beautiful film
","I am truly disappointed in those reviewers who cannot suspend disbelief long enough to enjoy this film. The characters are floating and flying because the China portrayed in Lee's film is a place full of wonder, tradition, and mysticism.  Remember, this was based on a book so Lee was most likely interpreting the author's 'flying' the best he could.  Besides, it's Lee's film, he can do whatever he darn well pleases.  If you can do better, then please, by all means re-make this movie, I will watch it. Anyway, on to the film.  Beautiful in every detail.  The choreography, cinematography, and all the other -ographies were superb.  The acting was appropriate to the movie (Michelle Yeoh, Chow-Yung Fat, and Ziyi Zhang are stand-outs). The action sequences are awesome (especially the courtyard scene between Yeoh and Zhang) and the flying scenes are breathtaking (my favorite is the treetop scene between Zhang and Fat). On the surface, it appears to be an attractive martial arts movie.  But underneath the surface, it is SO much more.  It is a love story, a story of revenge, a tragedy, an artistic vision. Simply beautiful.  This movie deserved every award it received.

2001: A Space Odyssey," Great Movie!
","What can I say?  Superb in every respect!  Kubrick gives us enough during the movie to totally entrance us, yet leaves us with enough unanswered questions to keep us open-minded.  You owe it to yourself to see this movie! 'Nuff said",Null,0,1,7 April 2001
Braveheart," The Legend is more important than the facts
","This movie is very dear to me. So what if it's historically inaccurate?  So what if it's embellished? The point of this movie was to entertain and to tell the story of a legend, not to give a history report.  I don't go to the movies to be lectured to (I already get enough of that at college).  I go to be entertained -- I go to be told a story -- I go to capture a certain emotion that enriches my mind and sparks my imagination.  Seeing this movie has in a small way improved how I see life and movie-making. Critics of this film should try watching with their minds and hearts instead of their history books.",Null,0,1,11 April 2001
Contact," Loved it!
","Most people either loved or hated this movie.I, for one, absolutely loved it.The emotion, the acting, the visual effects, the musical score -- all felt real (perhaps a little too real at times).Perhaps Foster and McConaughey's best work (especially Foster, who stole the show).As a human being, you owe it to yourself to see this film.My Grade:  A+",10,0,2,12 January 2002
