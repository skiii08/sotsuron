Blade Runner 2049," Paradox
","First they make a film to put us to sleep. It is boring, slow, tedious and quite sleep-inducing. We fall asleep and catch up on some much needed rest.Then the 'music' is a series of farts and tears and explosions and keeps waking me up. Look either get a soundtrack with music or skip it. What is with all the hi tech special effects' sounds instead of music???",3,54,86,29 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Spammer Gonna Spam
","They get paid hourly by JJ Abrams after all.Yes, it wasn't good. Skywalker was going to bring balance as expected and that's exactly what he did in this cliche-ridden rip of the Episode VI. People are so hung up on praising the corporate overlord Disney they can't see past the plot holes and atrocious acting. There are too may unanswered questions but that is not balanced by a good story. Do not go watch it and remember love always wins over spammers...love Star Wars and ignore Disney Star Wars.",2,16,25,29 December 2019
