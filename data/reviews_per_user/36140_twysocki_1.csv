50 First Dates," Please, I think 25 would have been more than enough!
","I like Adam Sandler. At least I used to until he fell into the business of doing movies just because they're there. Like so many 'Something About Mary' movies before this (cute, sexy, virginal blonde girl meets doofus, bungling, but adorable guy who wants her at all costs), the entire plot (if you can call it that) was exhausted in the first 15 minutes. Absolutely nothing original here. They thought that they'd take the success of Groundhog Day, turn it upside down (the star stands still while the calendar moves), and have a hit. It didn't work. Add to this, textbook acting by a moronic dad and a stupid brother (that can't even spell act) and the heroine actually comes across as the best actor in the film. I guess that after you saw the credits go by, you'd sympathize with Adam and like the movie. Hmmm...Maybe I was jaded when I saw this on an eternal flight from Germany to Los Angeles. But after 10 hours in the air, it was only slightly more entertaining than the crying baby next to me as I sat in a middle seat.",1,10,27,16 June 2004
