The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," Delicate feeling well expressed
","This film has such a richness that it's enjoyable to watch it over and over again, each time I could discover some thing new about music (which is great), character etc.  And every time I feel like waking up from a beautiful dream.It's a bit hard at first to fully understand the character's feeling of 'at two places at the same time'.  The only way I could relate is by recalling my own feeling of 'Deja Vu', which is so fleeing that I suppose only French could give it a name.I don't know how much Ms. Jacob's acting benefited from Kieslowski's directing, but result is a joy to watch. Esp. like her expressions when she asked 'pourquoi?', so many times, every time is different.It's a film has to be watched at least twice.  First time just to know what happened (or didn't happen).  With the expectation of a nice story out of the way, viewer could relax and just let the film take you into a dream world.",10,2,4,10 April 2000
Saving Private Ryan," Blow up the bridge already!
","The one thing doesn't make sense to me is, (and I'm no military history expert), Why don't they blow up the bridge in the first place. 
If everybody has a little child's voice inside of their subconscious, when it comes to movie viewing, there must be a voice of this little old country lady inside their head.  Imagine this lady with her arched back, half-opened mouth, and commenting 'Oh, lord, look at that.  Isn't that something'.   I sure feel that way.",Null,0,0,4 September 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Entertaining, not perfect
","I was originally from China, so I could listen to the dialogue instead of reading subtitles, and I found Chow and Yoeh's chinese are surprisingly good, considering Yoeh doesn't read/speak Chinese (any dialect) at all. Maybe I was not hurried to read subtitle and have some time to feel unsatisfied.  Yes, the action seq. is fantastic (maybe too much wire, that depends on your taste).  The scenery and music are outstanding, but something is wrong with the rhythm.  From action to story telling sequence makes you feel you just drove from airport runway to a dirt road at 100 m/hr.  The non-action scenes are too streched without much happening.   Since this film is so over-hyped as art film and action combined, I can not help but feeling dissapointed.  It's not 'Sense and Sensibility'.  Maybe it's just bad enough to be nominated an Oscar.P.S. I saw it in San Jose, CA.  Tampa ppl has to wait a few more weeks.",8,0,0,9 January 2001
