Alien 3," I'm speechless!
","I can't believe the amount of abuse this film receives. I adore this film, it's my favourite of the series. Never before has Ripley had to confront her worst fear in such a way. The sheer terror on her face in the scene where the Alien come right up close to her is almost disturbingly terrifying. The drama in the film is amazing, the cast brilliant, the alien looks better than ever, and aside from a few bad special effects, I think of this as the perfect film. The ending is beyond compare, no film has ever left me so sad to see a character die. The music is excellent, and creates the perfect atmosphere and it amount of subtext is so deep, it reaches beyond say that of even Blade Runner. I love this film, I cannot praise it enough, and I'd have to say it's my favourite film of all time!",Null,1,6,24 September 1998
Alien: Resurrection," Something went horribly wrong........
","Oh dear, oh dear, what have we here? It seems like it's not even part of the series. Alien was a land-mark in terror (still the scariest of the series), Aliens was quite good, a little over rated and talked about too much, Alien3 was amazing, fantastic atmosphere, great drama, floods of emotions, and then there's this.....this thing! Ripley's not a character you fear for anymore, like in the first film, cheer for as in the second film, or even grieve for like in the third film, she's just some character who has seem to have been put in so that people will go to see it because Weaver's in it. Too much gore?? Huh??? I think not! Too little gore. The first film is still sickening when Kane gave birth that it just beats all competition, Alien Resurrection's so over-the-top in its attepts to be slightly gorey that it makes no difference. If you want gore, see something like Hellraiser or the later Halloween films, or even Event Horizon, because this film even falls short in the gore factor. It's story is ludicrous, the newborn is pathetic, and its birth scene is even worse. Call (Winona Ryder) is just the mouldy icing on the rotting cake! The only redeeming factors about this film are Elgyn and Dr. Gediman. Other than that, this is a joke!",Null,1,1,24 September 1998
