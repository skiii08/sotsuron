The Ring," Not Bad
","I enjoyed the movie and found it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, considering it's a low budget film with, to me, all unknown actors. I was disappointed in the ending. They could've stopped the movie when they were in the car, driving home and reaching to hold each others hands but they had to stretch it another 10 minutes and ,make it worse.",Null,0,0,5 May 2003
The Rookie," Excellent movie
","It's hard to believe this is a Disney movie. It's one of the rare movies that Disney makes that has a Mother and Father together in one movie. It's one that the whole family will enjoy, whether your a fan of baseball or not and an inspiration to never let go of your dreams.The movie is based on the book by Jimmy Morris and Joel Engel 'The Oldest Rookie: Big-League Dreams from a Small Town Guy'. Although Dennis Quaid is older than the 35 year old Jimmy Morris he portrays, he does an excellent job of giving you the sense of emotions that Jim Morris has experienced over time. This movie also has a wonderful supporting cast of unknowns which makes the movie even more believable. It's too bad that Hollywood doesn't make more of these types of movies. Ones that have a believable story or plot without all the sexual affairs, car crashes and explosions.",10,1,3,1 August 2005
Little Miss Sunshine," Garbage
","This was a piece of crap for a movie. I expected a movie in which 'There's been no more satisfying American comedy of this year' just as Newsweek said. It must've been a terrible year for comedies. Yea, Alan Arkins character not waking up had me in stitches. Not! Funny and Hilarious, this movie is not. Well, maybe for a 15 year old but not for adults or should I say grown up adults. I guess the crowd that loved this movie also loved O Brother, Where Art Thou?, Bean and Borat.I expected far more from Toni Collette, Alan Arkin, Greg Kinnear and Steve Carell. They are very talented but what possessed them to sign on to this piece of garbage. What's worse was that the day I rented this movie, I had gone and seen Evan Almighty and thought Carell did a wonderful job with that role and laughed throughout the movie. I didn't laugh once for this one.The grandfather dying and left in the vehicle was a reminder of the movie 'Vacation' along with getting stopped by a motor cop who always seem to be portrayed as a bunch of dimwits even though in Vacation, the aunt was still alive. How that van must've smelled after having left the body in the van and in the heat for so long.As for the beauty pageant, it must've been a pedophiles delight. They must love seeing all those young beauty queens dressed as Jon Benet Ramsey. And how about all the Patsy Ramsey's sitting in the audience, which Olive's mother was one of them. And just what talent did Olive have to get her in the beauty pageant in the first place? They also needed to cut out the Burger Kings for the kid. And I busted a gut laughing with this kid jumping around on the stage like she had ants in her pants. That was the most ridiculous scene of the movie.Then you have the son who won't speak until he gets into the Air Force to fly jets then goes berserk when it's found he is color blind. What makes him think he'd even pass the psychological in the first place? I'm just glad I rented this movie instead of seeing it at the movies. I'm only out $3.69 for these piece of crap of a movie rather than 30 plus dollars (after paying for 2 tickets, 1 popcorn and 2 drinks).My advice for you all is to rent. With more and more pieces of crap the movie industry is turning out, like this one, you'll save money rather than blowing it at the theaters.",1,13,27,21 July 2007
Pearl Harbor," Horrible
","This was in the top 5 for the worst movies i've ever seen. Fortunately I viewed it on a borrowed DVD because had I viewed it at a movie theater, I would've walked out and demanded my money back. You'd of thought from the movie 'Midway' that they would've learned to omit a love story. Can you imagine a movie like 'Saving Private Ryan' if they inserted a love story? What a hero that Ben Afleck is single handedly taking on the Germans and Japanese. First he's a fighter pilot then switches to bombers. He was there for it all. The Battle of Britain, Pearl Harbor and the Doolittle Raid. Did he drop the bomb on Hiroshima too?I wasn't even impressed with the special effects. The attack looked like they were attacking the 'Death Star' from Star Wars. So much was omitted like when there's a brief shot that was stuck in the storyline where Yamamoto says 'I fear all we've done is awaken a sleeping giant' made no sense in this movie as to why he said it and why it was just stuck in as filler. If you want to watch a historically accurate movie about the attack on 'Pearl Harbor' which had more realistic special effects, watch Tora, Tora, Tora and you'll even see at the end Yamamoto saying 'I fear all we've done is awaken a sleeping giant.....' and you'll know exactly why he said it.",1,2,5,1 August 2002
Midway," Horrible
","I saw the original when it came out in 1976 and now this one which I felt like I was watching a video game with their cheap CGI rather than a movie. On the plus side, there was no Matt Garth, not 'I'm in love with a Japanese woman' junk and the Japanese spoke, well, Japanese but that was about the only redeeming value. And just like the movie Pearl Harbor, they went to a brief clip of Yamamoto uttering the line 'I fear that all we have done was to awaken a sleeping giant.......' and just like Pearl Harbor, the audience who has little clue of the history of the Pearl Harbor attack, do not know why he would've said such a thing or even thought it since it's still debatable if he actually said that line in real life or something similar. In Tora! Tora! Tora!, the audience knew exactly why such a line would've been said. The flying sequences were downright ridiculous with planes flying so low that they flew in between the battleships and 20 feet off the ground and down a street and in between buildings, trees and telephone poles or the way Dick Best would land his plane on the carrier. I just wish these movies would focus more on the historical accuracies rather than focus completely on dazzling us with their CGI. At least this wasn't a romance movie in which a war inconvenienced them and Benn Affleck taking to the skies during the Pearl Harbor attack, and taking part in the Doolittle Raid, after coming back from England of course where he defeated the German Luftwaffe!",2,22,46,9 November 2019
