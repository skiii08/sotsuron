The Devil's Advocate," Passed up a great ending. Good work by actors.
","I liked this movie more than I thought I would. Al Pacino attacked this role with gusto bordering on glee. Keanu Reeves wasn't THAT bad. And at least the characters made some attempt at a proper accent, instead of just pretending that everyone sounds like L.A. But some really great work also came from Charlize Theron, who I've heard of, but not seen before, and Connie Nielsen, who really burned up the screen. Judith Ivey deserves mention, also. SEMI-SPOILER AHEAD: I thought that the movie would have been MUCH better if director Taylor Hackford would have ended the movie at the end of the penthouse scene, rather than adding that last part. It would have been unexpected and powerful. The last scene had commercialism plastered all over it. It cost the film one point in my rating. Grade: B",7,2,3,2 July 2001
The Blair Witch Project," Different, but still crummy
","I suppose you do have to give it some credit for originality. This is not the same tired stuff that Hollywood is so good at cranking out. Having said that, this was not a very good movie. There seemed to be far more about the characters arguing and blaming one another than anything about the subject. This ruined the feeling of suspense from the the other scenes that could have been better maintained. All in all, this film blows.",4,0,2,17 July 2000
"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Disturbing, but shallow
","Basically a road movie. The gay, transsexual, and other gender-bender themes are rather disturbing, particularly when the child is involved. You do have to hand it to the costume designers. As for the actors, the only one I was familiar with was Terence Stamp. I suppose it was a very good performance, out of his (or anyone's) normal range. The movie as a whole was shallow, just a vehicle for the clever, bitchy banter. All in all, I don' recommend this one.",4,5,21,12 April 2000
Black Swan," Obvious Oscar bait
","This film is obvious Oscar bait. Whenever you have a late-year film with a well known actor or actress, whose role requires madness or retardation, then you know what it's all about. Mission accomplished, I guess. Natalie Portman, of course, plays an extremely demanding role. It is also extremely unattractive and unappealing. Many scenes are downright ugly and very hard to watch. Okay, I understand that this not supposed to be light entertainment. But man, this is hard. Mila Kunis was also excellent in the contrasting role. The direction was a bit too full of itself, long shots following the back of Portman's head, etc. Following Nina into the depths of her madness is difficult but not completely unrewarding.",6,1,2,15 June 2011
Love and Death," Bo-o-o-o-o-o-ring
","Boring. Not very good. Before I drown in indignant e-mails from Allen fans, let me make a few comments. The aforementioned Allen fans always smugly say that those who don't rave over Allen's films are Philistines who just 'don't get it.' Well, I do get it. It just isn't very funny. Yeah, I caught the references to Tolstoy, and was mildly amused by the riff working in all of the titles of Dosteyevsky's books, and the mention of Raskolnikov. Allen's humor is wry and absurdist, and was something different when he first hit the scene. But it is all the same. Allen always plays Allen, basing everything on his New York, Jewish angst. And of course his vanity knows no bounds, in spite of this persona. Seeing nothing wrong with porking his (more or less) stepdaughter is Exhibit A on this. Unless you are a fan of Allen, or want to seem to be, skip this one.",4,8,33,10 December 2004
Walk the Line," One of the better recent biopics
","One of the better recent biopics. I had never paid much attention to Joaquin Phoenix before. But I must say now that he is an actor that must be taken seriously. He neither looks nor sounds much like Johnny Cash, but I don't think that is absolutely necessary to evoke the character, which he did very well. The middle sequence about addiction, and overcoming it, was a bit tiresome. I understand that it had to be there, that it was a big part of Cash's life, but it seems like they all go through it. Phoenix did that well, too, and I presume that he knows more than a little about addiction. Kudos to Ginnifer Goodwin for her performance as Vivian Cash. She was excellent in the role. I had seen her on a TV show (Ed) and am glad that she is getting quality parts. By the way, some of Cash's survivors have publicly complained about the portrayal of Vivian Cash. With one small exception, she (Vivian) never came across as a bitch, or a harridan, but as a real woman, a wife and mother, with real and serious concerns. I haven't read Cash's book, but I imagine that he would be the first to admit that he was responsible for Vivian's travails. And this brings me to Reese Witherspoon as June Carter. It seemed to me that she absolutely stole the show. She deftly mixed comedic and dramatic acting. Who knew she had this sort of range? A well-deserved Oscar for her. And while she may not look that much like June Carter, she was able to sound very much like her when she sang. I have a feeling that Miss Witherspoon might be quite formidable at a karaoke contest. This film is worth seeing even if you're not a Johnny Cash fan.",8,1,2,19 June 2006
Alien 3," Could have been better...or worse
","Sigourney Weaver definitely looks better with hair. But however she looks, she always brings that indefinable something when she plays Lt. Ripley. No, this film is not as good as the first or fourth in this series, (haven't seen the second) but it's not a bad movie. It could have used a few more sympathetic characters, though. Grade: B-",6,0,2,28 August 2001
Captain Phillips," No way to maintain suspense
","Well, the actors playing the two main characters, Tom Hanks as Richard Phillips and Barkhad Abdi as Muse were excellent. Particularly Mr. Abdi, as a non-professional actor. I expect that he will find a dearth of roles in the future, however. There was very little character development or exposition on any other character. Outstanding cinematography on the ocean, the port, and the giant ship. Quite a contrast, taking the action from the huge cargo vessel to the claustrophobic enclosed lifeboat.But there was really no way to create or maintain mush suspense, which the film really needed, since the ultimate outcome was known to me.",6,2,4,9 November 2014
Catch Me If You Can," Mildly entertaining
","Everybody did an OK job here, but I guess the movie was less than the sum of its parts. The film just fails to engage. I expected more from Spielberg. The plot had Abagnale doing some really dumb things, he would have never been caught otherwise. I suppose these things were supposed to be poignant, but were just really dumb. One example: setting up his print shop in the French town his mother was from. He had five million dollars. He could have gone anywhere. And why did Christopher Walken get an Oscar nomination for this? He is a fine actor, but I didn't think that this role was really worthy. Overall. this is mildly entertaining, but all involved can do better. Grade: C-",6,0,3,1 June 2003
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Classic Spielberg
","A very famous action film from the early Eighties. Harrison Ford looks so young in this film now. This was one of his iconic roles, and he chews the scenery with the best of them. The action is relentless, and despite a few plot holes, is immensely satisfying. Karen Allen looked great, and played her tough-girl role with relish. This being a Spielberg film, it is a visual spectacle, with high production values, outstanding photography, and lots of stunts and effects. Everyone should see this film.",8,0,0,30 September 2017
Casablanca," Here's looking at Ingrid Bergman
","Wow! Ingrid Bergman was at her best in this one, as well as her most sad, doe-eyed, beautiful. The part of Rick seemed made for Bogey, with the snappy repartee, and the cynical shell around what Renault refers to as 'a rank sentimentalist'. It seems like every time I see this film I notice something new. This time it had to do with the Bulgarian woman, Annina Brandel, who Rick rescues from the carnal plotting of Captain Renault. I never gave this scene much thought, just assuming that it was a way to plumb the limits of Rick's cynicism, as noted above. But later, during the scene where Ilsa tells Rick that she'll stay with him if he will use the letters of transit for Laszlo, I realized that the two scenes were a common theme, that Rick realizes he'd be no different from Renault if he followed through with that. I guess one gets lazy seeing modern Hollywood fare. Nowadays, the director would have used a flashback image or something, in order to bludgeon the viewer with the correlation. But back then, with a better-educated public, one could allow audiences to discover things for themselves. It was also skillful how these films could be more or less suitable for children, as well as adults. When I saw this film as a child, it never occurred to me that Rick and Ilsa had had sex. But the clues, while too subtle for a child, were pretty obvious to me as a man. Like many people this film is my all-time favorite. Grade: A+++++",10,5,6,30 November 2004
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Cartoon Noir
","This was such an amazing piece of work when it came out. I just saw it again, and it was just a bit dated. But while the physical part of mixing cartoon and live action was excellent, the best part was the writing, the envisioning of a world where interactions between 'toons' and humans were commonplace. Fantastic work by Bob Hoskins, particularly in losing his English accent and sounding completely like a bitter, hard-boiled, mid-40's, SoCal, PI. Most of the time, when an actor fakes an accent, it will bleed through a bit in some scenes. One could blame the director for this, not being willing to take enough takes to make sure that he never has to use one that doesn't sound right. But Hoskins was utterly Streepian here.
Interesting that some felt there were themes of racism and genocide in this movie. OK, I guess the genocide angle is fairly explicit, except that it never really occurred to me because the 'toons' weren't seen as human. (Although now that I think about it, the weasels were depicted as having souls) But it's just too much of a stretch to see 'toons' as being analogous to 'coons'. I cannot imagine Disney or Zemeckis going there at all. 'Toons' were, in this film, gently treated as subhuman, simply because they WERE subhuman, and nobody was interested in denying that reality out of some sort of cartoon political correctness. Anyway, this film is a masterpiece, even if a silly one, and it comes highly recommended by me. Grade: A",8,0,0,22 June 2004
Finding Neverland," Entetaining
","I would never have watched this film if it hadn't had Kate Winslet in it. It was a lot better than I thought it would be. Kate Winslet has to be the top tragedienne in the business today. She was perfect, understating her beauty, and playing the Edwardian mother role wonderfully. Johnny Depp is a phenomenal actor, playing the widest variety of roles. He hit the accent as well as Meryl Streep, never missing a single line in it, yet never overdoing it. The whole thing is kind of creepy nowadays though, in these Michael Jackson times. It is really unseemly for a man to pay too much attention to someone else's sons. The idea, I suppose is that Barrie was a child-man, someone who never wanted to grow up. Well, that's how they used to describe Jackson, too, and of course he named his molestation-hideout, uh, I mean, ranch, Neverland. Kinda weird. Anyway Radha Mitchell looked wonderful, and played her part beautifully as well. It ended up being a really entertaining movie, well worth a place in a Netflix queue. But it's not among the top 150 movies of all time. C'mon.",7,1,3,24 March 2006
Lifeboat," Masterpiece from Hitchcock and Bankhead
","Did Hitchcock make any bad movies? I haven't seen any. This one was a little different, and lacks the visceral suspense of some his other films. However, it's still a great movie. Tallulah Bankhead was excellently cast, and was great. Everyone should see this film.",9,10,16,10 January 2001
Gravity," Very intense
","I don't often go to theaters, but I did see this one in IMAX 3-D. As expected, the 3-D aspect of the film was considerably annoying, but the IMAX aspect was awesome. Clooney largely played himself, not that there is anything wrong with that. Sandra Bullock was fantastic, particularly considering that most of what was around her, and that she was reacting to, were not there at filming, but added in post-production. While there were certainly some plot holes, and the physics were not one hundred percent accurate, the filmmakers went out of their way to demonstrate on of the big problems about working in microgravity, that is, the Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum. Poor Dr. Stone got just beaten all to hell trying to stop, and perhaps they should have put some bruise make-up on Bullock for that. But, then again, the film only spans maybe two hours of time. Anyway, the film is very intense.",9,2,4,3 November 2013
To Be or Not to Be," Delightfully droll
","Not exactly hilarious, but more delightfully droll and witty. Carole Lombard was just amazing. Her beauty and charm were, I'm sure, mourned deeply when lost so early. Most of the humor here was lampooning the Nazis. As someone else mentioned, it's one thing to mock Hitler and his ideology in the 1980's, and quite another to do so in 1942, when the outcome of the war was in serious doubt. Grade: A+",9,4,11,6 September 2002
Erin Brockovich," Roberts' hard-edged role lacks her usual charm
","The film was pretty good. Julia Roberts shows a lot of real acting range here, as was obviously the intent. Her hard-edged portrayal of the character, though, left me feeling that something was missing. In most of her other films, she exudes a certain charm that was missing here. I presume this was deliberate, so it is hard to criticize, but in the future, please, give me back the other Julia!",6,1,3,29 May 2001
Fury," A very intense war movie experience
","While I was certainly aware of it, this film brings home the horrible brutality of tank warfare. The constant expectation of fiery death must make one rather fatalistic. Aside from the modern tendency toward excessive gore, this movie was evocative of war films from the Fifties and Sixties. Pretty decent acting all around, led by the low-key Brad Pitt. A couple of notes on plot holes. By April 1945, the German army was extremely depleted due to the millions of casualties sustained up to that point, doubtless including even Waffen SS units. So the extreme expertise that some have speculated about in previous comments may be exaggerated. However, as has also been noted, no military unit will allow itself to be chewed to pieces by immobile troops in a defensive position that can easily be bypassed. This has been military doctrine since the Hittites. Still a very intense war movie experience.",8,3,7,8 May 2015
As Good as It Gets," Well-deserved Oscars
","Nicholson's portrayal of an obsessive-compulsive misanthrope is pure gold. Helen Hunt's performance was also masterful. The rash of criticism about 60-ish actors getting the 20-30-ish actresses is well-taken here, although I don't think anyone else could have done the part. I was impressed by the director's courage with political incorrectness, although it was negated toward the end. All in all, a very good flick.",8,1,1,21 March 1999
Citizen Kane," Quality film, especially for its time
","I don't know how I've lived so long without ever having seen 'Citizen Kane'. So, I have now rectified that situation. I won't disparage it, I enjoyed the film. It was fairly astonishing for a twenty-five year old first-time director to put out this quality of a movie. and Welles was able to do all these things in the direction without them becoming annoying, or looking like showing off. I'm not enough of a film geek to know about 'deep focus' or when it was first used, or by whom. While still a good movie, I don't get the greatest-of-all-time meme about CK. It may have been at the time, but then again 1941 saw some of the all-time classics come out. But every cinephile should certainly see Citizen Kane. Rosebud.",7,0,4,5 April 2017
Monster," Good work here, but a really depressing film.
","What a depressing movie. Yes, there were a lot of things done very well in this, but overall it is a real downer. Charlize Theron did what everyone says she did. But all the wonderment at her uglifying herself for this role overshadows the performance by Christina Ricci, who turned in an excellent piece of work herself. She must be taken seriously as a dramatic actress now. Patty Jenkins' direction was good inasmuch as she never called attention to herself. Kudos also to Annie Corley in a small role.A word about Aileen Wuornos. It is too bad that she had such a terrible life. But lots of people have terrible lives and yet do not go on killing sprees. While one may come to understand her a little better from watching this film, she was nonetheless someone to be despised, and upon whom justice was properly served.",7,1,2,26 February 2005
Two for the Money," Largely a modern version of the Icarus story
","There seems to be one huge, giant, all-encompassing plot hole in this film that I couldn't quite forget. Roger Ebert discusses it in his review, so I won't re-capitulate it here. Aside from that, it is a reasonably entertaining film. Matthew McConaughey turns in a fine performance here, I have to say, even though I am generally not a fan. Al Pacino chews the scenery the way he does in recent years, and it would be hard to avoid being entertained by that. Rene Russo was very good, and quite beautiful, as usual. The direction was unobtrusive, and the photography good. The story arc is largely a modern version of the Icarus story, with some Hollywood-type pap added on at the end. Worth checking out, if not writing home about.",7,1,2,21 April 2006
Alien: Resurrection," Weaver wows here
","Let me say first that I haven't seen the second or third installments of this series, although I am vaguely aware of the plot elements I have missed. I am really impressed with Sigourney Weaver's performance here. Of course she is usually very good. I am a fan of Winona Ryder, but she seems a bit out of place here. This film hits the buttons it reaches for most of the time. It is a really good Sci-fi/horror flick. Lots of good production value, futuristic sets, good underwater sequence, and of course good, evil, revolting alien effects.",8,0,0,6 November 2000
World War Z," Brad Pitt saves the world
","Not a terrible movie, fairly average. Some of the computer-generated effects were somewhat impressive, like the armies of zombies climbing over one another like ants. Brad Pitt has his certain charisma and 'star power' but they seemed to be minimizing that throughout. They gave almost nothing for Mireille Enos to do. (She's from my home town!) Daniella Kertesz seemed to play the most interesting character, the Israeli soldier who travels with Pitt's character. All of the big-budget stuff is here, the cinematography, the effects, the re-written ending after being shown to test audiences. I am fairly glad that I didn't waste theater-type money to see it. But it's okay.",6,0,0,30 May 2014
Passengers," Pretty good space opera
","OK, full disclosure first. I love science fiction stuff. I grew up reading Heinlein and Asimov, among others. And now that CGI means that filmmakers don't have to put up with super-cheesy special effects, I love the spectacle that sci-fi movies can offer. The effects in 'Passengers' were magnificent. Yes, there will always be quibbles about accuracy when it comes gravity, micro- and otherwise. There were some other plot holes, but what movie doesn't have those? Chris Pratt has come a long way from playing the doofus on 'Parks and Recreation'. He is adequate, but his story is a cautionary tale to any actor who considers giving up. Apparently anyone can get lucky and end up with a career as an action-film hero. Jennifer Lawrence was fine (and VERY fetching) and I do not understand all of the criticism of her acting on this film. I think she got the most out the material. The crux of the middle third of the movie is the ethical dilemma faced (and failed) by one of the characters, and this was proper for such an enormous decision.Overall, this film was enjoyable, but not destined to be a classic. Well worth a look, especially if you are a sci-fi movie fan.",7,2,2,3 July 2017
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," A reasonably amusing romantic comedy
","I found this to be a reasonably amusing romantic comedy. Jason Segel's comedic oeuvre seems to be finding himself in utterly humiliating situations, and proceeding through with that hangdog expression, and that's what he does here. Some of the stuff works better than others, like his self-abnegating song, and the Dracula puppet musical. Others, not so much. Russel Brand as the totally self-absorbed rock star was pretty funny, too. Kristen Bell looked good, and did her not-terribly-likable role pretty well. The show-stealing was done by Mila Kunis, with whom I am not familiar. Her fresh prettiness was perfect for her role, which she nailed. Overall it was an OK film, not great, but pretty decent.",7,0,3,8 June 2009
The Hunger Games," Liked the movie, even though it was far from perfect
","I liked the movie, even though it was far from perfect. I found it original, although as it went on there were some similarities to The Running Man, and The Long Walk, both, incidentally by Stephen King. I found the political situation interesting. Likely fleshed out a lot more in the novel, but from what I gathered, there had been a civil war about seventy years in the past, and they seem stuck in eternal Reconstruction. Instead of binding the nation back together over time, as we did, the losing side's territory has become occupied and exploited colonies, even four generations later. I also noted that many of the characters from the 'Capitol', the winning territory, had Roman names, e.g. Cinna, Octavia, Flavius, Cato, Seneca. Hmmm. Well, I don't quite care enough to read the book, and likely not enough to see the inevitable sequels.",8,0,4,23 January 2013
Argo," A pretty entertaining movie
","OK, this apparently only loosely based on the 'Canadian Caper' of 1980 to smuggle out of Teheran the six American Foreign Service officers who get away from the embassy before the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, disguised as students, overrun the embassy. While there are a lot of historical quibbles with the plot, there was a need to generate tension in places where it wasn't quite so tense. Not that it wasn't tense, and dangerous, but it seems that the ending at the airport was not so close, that the diplomats were long out of the country without the Iranians being any the wiser. The narration about Mossadegh at the beginning seemed a bit one-sided, not mentioning that he was likely to turn the country into a Soviet colony, and stealing billions of dollars in Western property. Yes, the shah was a tyrant too, but the nation is still tyrannized all these years later. Anyway, despite the historical stuff it ended up being a pretty entertaining movie.",8,3,6,29 June 2013
Batman Returns," Not bad, not great
","Not bad, not great. It helps if one comes into this film remembering that this is a COMIC BOOK STORY!!! (By the way, when did comic books get euphemized to 'graphic novels'?) Actually, though, I never read the 'Batman' comics. (I did like the '60's TV show, but hey, I was seven. Surely that show's target demographic.) I liked it that Batman is dark and brooding, and not a happy superhero. The cast all did well, playing the material properly, as a comic book, and not doing realism. And anything with Michelle Pfeiffer in it is worth seeing. Worth a look. Grade: B-",6,1,2,15 December 2003
Superbad," Pretty darn dull
","This was pretty darn dull. I never laughed or even really smiled throughout. Okay, I am not the target demographic for this film, left that behind a few decades ago, but even so, this film leaves much to be desired. I got the jokes and gags, they just didn't do anything for me. I can recall talking (to a point) like these kids do, and I did think it was cool at the time. Now I realize that it was boorish and idiotic. I do have to compliment a couple of the young actresses, Martha MacIsaac, who looked awfully nice, and Emma Stone, who pulled off that 'teenage girl who is sophisticated beyond her years' role. The two cops were painful, and none of it clicked at all, and so was totally unfunny. There is really no reason to watch this movie.",5,6,10,1 June 2009
Alexander," Stone over-directs, as usual
","I really should have known better than to watch an Oliver Stone movie on a historical subject. He is, or was, capable of making entertaining movies, such as Wall Street or U-Turn. But these days he seems more interested in making 'art'. Some of the acting was OK, given the script, such as Anthony Hopkins and Rosario Dawson. But the script was terrible. Stone apparently wanted to make some kind of point about homosexuality. Okay, we all know about Greeks, past and present. It's kind of revolting, though, having this pushed into our faces about a historical figure. I'm no scholar about Alexandar, but from what I have read, war and conquest were all he ever really cared about. I didn't think Colin Farrell was very good, but he may have been handicapped by the script, and by Stone. He seemed like such a talent in Tigerland. Which brings us to the worst thing about this film, the usual Oliver Stone over-directing. Overall, the cuts back and forth in time were done poorly, making the whole film seem disjointed. And the washout colors during and after the Indian battle scene were awful. The cutting camera action was pretty bad, too, but I suppose this was done to cover up the computer-generated war elephants. I could write more, but I'll just say that you should skip this one.",4,1,2,4 April 2006
Just Go with It," It's okay...
","Adam Sandler is really not so funny any more. I think that he keeps going to the same well over and over and eventually this palls for the audience. Having said that, this movie is okay. Not great, not hilarious, not 'real good'. Just okay. It was largely saved by Jennifer Aniston. Her obvious good looks never hurt anything, and her comedic talent and timing is first-rate. Nicole Kidman, in a small part still looks like a Botox junkie. She was once so gorgeous. Now, I suppose that she has met her goal, inasmuch as she definitely looks young, just not very pretty. The movie plot and situations are preposterous, and the story arc is formulaic Romantic Comedy 101. It's okay...",6,0,0,5 September 2014
The Hustler," Deserves to be in 'top 250'!!!
","A total classic. I understand that Paul Newman wasn't really respected for his acting ability until this film. He, of course, absolutely nailed the role. Jackie Gleason was perfect as Minnesota Fats, and I can't rave enough about Piper Laurie and her performance as Sarah. I think Laurie made this film what it is almost as much as Gleason and Newman. And of course George C. Scott bellowing 'You owe me money!' is one his most unforgettable lines. Scott also put in a tremendous performance. I don't know so much about themes, character and redemption, as some other commentators, I just know that this is one of my favorite films of all time. Grade: A+",9,4,6,29 October 2001
Juno," Hits mostly true notes
","A sort of small movie that made it big. The film hit mostly true notes. Ellen Page showed much talent, carrying this movie on her shoulders. Her way of speaking, while a bit annoying to me (at my age) did bring back remembrances of teenage years, mine and others, where young people are trying out a lot of things, trying to establish their individual identity. I would have thought that cell phones would have been ubiquitous among teenagers in 2007, even in Minnesota. I didn't really notice if there were any (other) cues (car models, etc.) that the setting may have been some time prior to that. Anyway, I liked the film, but do not find it as big of a deal as some others have. Oh yeah, and interesting how the Hollywood Left crowd is militant on abortion, but I never heard any criticism of how the clinic was portrayed, and how it influences Juno' decision.",6,1,1,13 December 2015
The Terminator," 'That's what it does! That's ALL it does!'
","A genuinely iconic film that made the careers of James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger. It let Schwarzenegger slip the bounds of his very limited niche as a bodybuilder and made him an action star. Cameron didn't seem to see it as a science fiction film, but it is now a classic in that genre. Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn were fantastic as well. There are a lot of comments about plot holes, but there are always going to be possible paradoxes when it comes to time travel movies/books. The effects were pretty awesome for 1984. The terminator itself, with its relentless focus on its mission, has also become an iconic character/idea. You really have to give Cameron his props for imagination. Note to Cameron: There is probably an entire movie waiting to be made in the 2029 world of John Conner/humans vs. Skynet/HK's/terminators.",9,1,1,13 August 2017
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," 'I'm sorry, too, Dmitri'
","This film must have really stuck in a lot of craws when it came out. Kubrick's black comedy of the Cold War (right in the middle of it) is notable for a number of reasons. In many ways the film seems to make light of the menace posed by Communism, when later events proved that that menace was utterly real and extremely dangerous. There were tremendous acting performances by George C. Scott and Slim Pickens. It was interesting to see Sterling Hayden working with Kubrick again, some years after 'The Killing'. Some parts of the film dragged a little bit, and some were, of course, way over the top. A complete classic, though. And isn't it interesting how Seller's Strangelove was eerily evocative of Kissinger, years before he was widely known. Grade: A+",9,2,3,12 March 2002
The Bodyguard," Whitney Houston shines in this role
","For a non-actress, Whitney Houston shines in this role. I just don't see the reason for all the criticism found in the comment section. Maybe I'm just blinded by her beauty. I haven't seen her other films. Her voice is, of course, pure gold. Costner, like many leading men, plays much the same character in many of his films, and does it well. The supporting cast was excellent, the direction non-imposing, and the photography good. The only real criticism I have is with the script, Rachel falling for Farmer so fast. I gave it an 8.",8,1,5,10 December 1999
The Beach," Not as bad as all that
","Not as bad as all that. Deliberately evocative of 'Apocalypse Now'. I am presuming that that is an homage. Beautifully photographed scenery, including Virginie Ledoyen. She is major eye candy. Leonardo DiCaprio, as irritating as I find him, is actually quite a good actor. Anyone who doesn't believe that should rent 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape'. He did a creditable job here, and you have to give him credit for taking this role, a rather unlikeable character, right after 'Titanic'. I would have found the lifestyle on the island awfully appealing in my 20's, a life of leisure, unlimited dope to smoke, etc. That wasn't enough for Richard (DiCaprio) however, and he falls into the category of adrenaline junkie. One thing, though, with all of those twentysomethings living on that island, it's hard to believe there were no children. I thought the direction was quite good throughout with the exception of the video game sequence. Dumb. I suppose it was meant to appeal to a demographic group which doesn't include me. Overall, I enjoyed watching the film, but will not be buying the DVD. Grade: C+",6,1,2,1 June 2001
The Doors," Kilmer's best work
","Val Kilmer shines in this performance as Jim Morrison. I don't know how much of the film is really true (knowing Oliver Stone, not much). Kathleen Quinlan also turns in an outstanding performance.

Closer," A small film about love and betrayal. Mostly betrayal.
","A small film about love and betrayal. Mostly betrayal. It is obviously made from a play, with four main characters, any two of which are on-screen at all times. The plot is pretty good, albeit with its fair share of contrivances and coincidences. But, if not for these things, what would there be to make movies about? The four main actors were all excellent, though none are very likable. Jude Law pays his role as weaselly and pathetic. Clive Owens' character is macho, controlling, and conniving. Julia Roberts is, as always, oddly beautiful, although she looks a bit older now. This may have been a deliberate decision, to better contrast her with Natalie Portman's character. Miss Portman, when it is called for, is achingly beautiful. When she bestows on us a wide smile, I thought my TV would melt. I don't believe I've seen her in anything before. (Not being a Star Wars geek) (OK, I've just looked at her page, and it seems she played the little girl in 'The Professional'. She was quite good, but I did not recognize her twelve years later.) The real star, however, was the script. They all have such wonderfully clever dialog. I would say check it out.",8,1,1,9 April 2006
Taxi Driver," Classic exposition of psychopathy
","This sort of violence in film is what causes kids to shoot up their schools. Oh, wait a minute...well, maybe it has a 20+ year incubation period. But seriously, wow...what can you say about DeNiro as the anti-hero in Taxi Driver? As close to genius as acting gets. Cybill Sheppard was the perfect avatar of sweetness to contrast with Travis Bickle's view of the filth (human and otherwise) of pre-Giuliani New York. At the very end when Bickle looks into the taxi mirror with sudden intensity, you know the story of Travis Bickle is not really over. I get a kick out of seeing (semi) old movies and seeing things that have now faded into the past as a part of everyday life, in this case, typewriters.
Check out the DVD with the hour-long 'Making of' documentary added.",9,0,0,25 January 2000
Interstellar," Completely ignored tidal gravity
","I have always liked science fiction movies, and this one is pretty good. Nice acting, as would be expected from accomplished actors like Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, John Lithgow, and many others. Great visuals, great score, and a partially good use of the science involved, especially general relativity. We can pass on the wormhole, a totally theoretical gravitational phenomenon. But they completely ignored tidal gravity, meaning in an intensely strong gravitational field, such as near a black hole's event horizon, or crossing it, the force is so strong that it will pull the nearer side of an object much more than the far side, thus tearing it apart down to the atomic level well before reaching the event horizon. I'm sure that this was glossed over because it would be fatal to the plot. But it is still a pretty good movie.",7,1,4,14 May 2015
Full Metal Jacket," A quite powerful film
","A quite powerful film. Kubrick films always hold one's interest, and he usually has something to say beyond mere entertainment. R. Lee Ermey was fantastic as the drill instructor. I've never seen him in any other dramatic role, so this performance sort of defines him. Matthew Modine and Vincent D'Onofrio put in their best career performances by far, as did Adam Baldwin. The rest of the cast is fairly obscure, but there was never a false note throughout.",9,0,1,15 December 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Lack of resolution
","There is some fine acting here, from Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson, (who I don't usually like) and some of the minor characters. There is a distinct lack of resolution in this movie, which is sometimes OK, but felt misplaced here.",6,0,2,15 November 2019
American Sniper," Pretty good war movie
","Pretty good to very good acting, nice unobtrusive direction, good photography of whatever Moroccan city doubled for Baghdad and Fallujah. The combat sequences are well-drafted and well-performed. Aside from the life of Chris Kyle, this is a pretty good, if not great war movie. Not being a super movie buff, I was unaware that this film was made by Clint Eastwood until the closing credits.Some interesting criticism here and elsewhere. Eastwood is known for making movies with a patriotic edge. But it seems that many folks feel that this beyond the pale. Why is it that no American filmmaker should EVER make a movie that is pro-America, or pro-American military? Can not a single movie ever depict white people acting heroically, and non-white people behaving basely? Do these leftists think that this reflects reality? And even if they do, is no one allowed to have a differing opinion? That is one of the problems with the American Left; their extreme intolerance toward diversity of opinion.",7,0,3,5 July 2015
Forrest Gump," Hanks' tour de force
","I recently watched FG again. It had been several years since I saw it the first time. My memory of the film, and specifically Tom Hanks' performance, was that how hard can it be to play a retarded person? After viewing the movie again, I remember what a real tour de force this role was for Hanks. He was fantastic here, and the whole film remains extremely entertaining. When you've seen it before, you don't concentrate so much on the special effects putting Hanks into historical footage. Some of those effects were better than others, but it was a really cute trick. The best effects, however were the computer removal of Gary Sinise's legs. I watched closely and this was absolutely seamless, looked perfect on the screen. Robin Wright also deserves mention for a great performance, as does Sinise and Sally Fields.",9,1,2,26 June 2000
21 Jump Street," Could have been a lot worse
","A better film than I thought it would be. I had never seen the television show upon which it is (loosely) based, so I had no biases or expectations springing from that. Jonah Hill has some real talent hiding behind the foul language and gross-out gags. I had never seen anything with Channing Tatum, so I do not know if his super low-key approach is the part or the actor. The pair have reasonably good chemistry together. The main hook appears to be how the two have reversed roles from their actual high school days, to their undercover assignment, and both seem to realize the emptiness and limitations of the other. And kudos to Brie Larson who looked great and nailed her role.",7,1,1,4 October 2014
American Hustle," some unrecognizable stars
","I have let my movie-viewing slide a bit in the last few years, so I was not familiar with some of the actors in this film. Amy Adams, for instance. She does a great deal with this role, which is a woman who is unlovely and unlikeable. And Jeremy Renner, who is apparently a star in a lot of those comic book movies. I would have never recognized Christian Bale, or Elisabeth Rohm. Jennifer Lawrence had to dig deep for her inner white trash sleaze, and she was remarkable. I remember the scandal quite well, where the FBI bribed and arrested a number of prominent New Jersey Democrat office-holders. it was all kind of fun, as I recall.",6,1,2,24 August 2014
Léon: The Professional," Natalie Portman, wow.
","Natalie Portman turns in probably the best performance I have ever seen from a child actor/actress. Wow! Jean Reno and the recently passed Danny Aiello were also top-notch. Gary Oldman was a bit over-the-top for my tastes. But a really good film. A few plot holes, but still very good writing. Some of the material was a bit disturbing, but I'm sure that's what Besson intended.",8,0,0,25 December 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," OK
","There are things to like and dislike in this film. Some fine acting performances, and good photography. Unobtrusive direction. The gay stuff was distasteful to see, but, hey, I knew it would be in there, and watched it anyway. I liked Queen, and though I never saw them perform, some friends who did told me it was the best concert ever. The movie is OK, but it never grabbed me the way it seems to have done to many others.",6,0,3,8 July 2019
The Caine Mutiny," Great acting, little action. (Not a bad thing)
","The Caine Mutiny is clearly a product of its time, and criticism of this is misplaced, as it could not be otherwise. In the movie, the scenes of the romance between Ensign Kieth and the nightclub singer add little to the plot, and not much to the character development, in the book, he was the main character, and most of the events were seen through his eyes. In fact, the book ended with him becoming the captain of the Caine on her last voyage home after the war. As noted, there were masterful performances by Humphrey Bogart and Jose Ferrer. Almost stealing the show was Fred MacMurray.This was a different kind of war movie for the time, with very little battle action. More of a cerebral sort of thing, I think.",8,1,2,18 December 2012
28 Weeks Later," A lot better than average, as sequels go
","A lot better than average, as sequels go. While, yes, there are some plot holes (as with most movies) this one does what horror films are supposed to do. If you let yourself, you will go with the flow and experience the building dread. I understand that there is supposed to be some political subtext involving the soullessness of the U. S. military, but really, in the face of such a demonstrated, truly existential threat, what exactly else would a military command do? Militaries are there to do things in the performance of their duties that would otherwise be immoral, such as depriving others of life and/or liberty when it is necessary to do so. Anyway the film is well-acted, well-photographed (although I think that jerky camera shooting has run its course) and well-paced. Special kudos to Rose Byrne and Imogene Poots (what a name!) for nailing grueling roles. If you liked the first movie at all, I think you'll like this one.",8,0,2,12 May 2008
The Village," Different, anyway
","OK, I suppose it is well known that there are significant plot twists in this film. I will not reveal them here, because I would have liked the film a lot less if I had known what they were. In fact, I am astounded that I was ignorant of them. If this had been a more highly regarded or higher-grossing film, than I am sure I would have heard. I will say that there were a few small things that made me wonder. The acting was almost all very low-key, with the exceptions of Adrien Brody, playing the village idiot, and Bryce Dallas Howard, as the blind vixen. Miss Howard was pretty good in some parts, but was (to me) totally unbelievable as a blind woman. Needs some work, but hey, she's young. The movie was at least different, and that's saying a lot in today's Hollywood.",7,0,0,23 March 2005
Pitch Black," Darn good sci-fi flick
","I really like a good sci-fi yarn, and this one scratched that itch. Yes, there are some serious plot coincidences (like most movies) and you could say that this material 'has been done before.' (again like most movies) But the pacing was good, the tension level high, the creature effects decent. Good acting by a number of actors I had never heard of before. Vin Diesel was suitably menacing. And I have to give a rave about Radha Mitchell's performance. I hope she gets some more good roles, so I can see more of her. Grade: A",8,0,0,3 December 2001
North by Northwest," A wonderful suspense-filled spy caper
","Among Hitchcock's best, which is saying a lot. I was long under the belief that this was a black-and-white movie, but I realize now that I thought that because I first saw it on television in the Sixties, before my family had a color TV. Cary Grant largely plays Cary Grant, which was fine for this film. Eva Marie Saint and James Mason were highly sophisticated in their evil...or not. A wonderful suspense-filled spy caper.",9,1,1,12 April 2019
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," The machines rise anyway
","Where to start? I tend to agree with other reviewers (and James Cameron) that there was no really compelling reason to make this film. This one, thematically, mirrors the previous one. And also, like, for instance, the third 'Lethal Weapon' movie, this third 'Terminator' film becomes partly a self-parody. But to give credit where credit is due, the action sequences were very impressive, and the crane chase will be a classic scene. (However, chases in inappropriate vehicles are sort of a trademark sinking into the self-parody mentioned earlier.) Schwarzenegger has found a character that certainly matches his acting ability. It's sort of too bad that he will be too old to ever make another 'Terminator' film, although that probably wouldn't stop the studio if they thought the money was there. Claire Danes was pretty good here, as was Kristianna Loken. There is plenty of room to quibble about the various time travel paradoxes, and some other plot holes. I have to give the filmmakers some credit for the lack of a typical Hollywood feel-good ending. If you liked the other 'Terminator films, you have to see this one, although it isn't quite the classic that those others are. Grade: B+",8,0,1,12 March 2004
American Beauty," Pretty good film
","I don't understand what all the fuss is about. This was a pretty good movie. Spacey was good, as were the teen-age actors. (or roles) First-time director Sam Mendes couldn't resist a lot of film-school type stuff, much of which worked. Annette Bening played it rather over the top, which detracted from the film. I suppose this was to draw a contrast between her character and Spacey's. I haven't seen many of the other films from that year, so cannot comment on whether AB really earned its Best Picture Oscar.
One previous comment expressed disappointment in the moral tone (or lack of same) of this film. A valid observation, but, hey, get real. This is Hollywood we are talking about. Pretty good film. Grade: 7 of 10",7,0,0,13 November 2000
BASEketball," Peurile but amusing
","I avoided seeing this film for years, because I assumed that it would be juvenile and stupid. Well, it is all that of course, but I admit that it got more chuckles from me than the average comedy. I have never seen the cartoon that Parker and Stone are famous for, but was at least aware of it. I presume that the humor is similar. There were a lot of star cameos throughout. Many are quite silly, but that is clearly what Zucker, the director, was going for. And for all of the comments about bad acting by Yasmine Bleeth and Jenny McCarthy, the nature of the material dictated that it look that way. The best part was in the beginning with the message about sports commercialism and monstrous egos leading to the end of big league sports. Not nearly as bad as I thought it would be.",6,2,4,6 June 2015
Apocalypse Now," Oh, yeah!
","I saw AN in the theater on its original release. It wasn't until some years later that I read 'Heart of Darkness,' and I had had no idea that AN was in some ways based on this book. In fact, some years earlier than AN I had read a science fiction book by Robert Silverburg called 'Downward to the Earth' and it, too, was based on 'Heart of Darkness.' In both cases the 'Kurtz' character was named Kurtz. So you can imagine to forehead-slapping, and 'oh, yeah's when I finally read Conrad's masterpiece. An interesting take on the moral confusion bred by warfare. Most everything else that needs to be said about AN has already been said.",10,0,0,23 July 2003
The Patriot," Largely a revenge tale
","This film takes the romanticism out of eighteenth-century/Napoleonic-era warfare and lays bare the brutality of musket and cannon fire into packed ranks. And then, of course, the bayonet charges and ensuing hand to hand combat is not really much different than the battles of Caesar's legions. The film is beautifully photographed and well-directed. However, the title 'The Patriot' is quite unfortunate, given that it is largely a revenge tale (Mel Gibson's forte) that happens to have the Revolutionary War as a backdrop. Gibson is, by turns, charming and ultra-violent. Joely Richardson was lovely here, although I may not have recognized her in the period costumes. It is a well-made, obviously high-budget, if somewhat gory film, and overall, pretty good, if not a masterpiece.",7,1,2,4 August 2015
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," The quintessential action film
","Full disclosure: I have never seen any of the previous Mission Impossible films. Not sure how I have avoided it, but it's true. I do vaguely recall the original TV series.This is the quintessential action film. It has chases, explosions, danger, tension, extreme stunts, an evil conspiratorial cabal led by an implacable foe, everything. It is unsullied by much in the way of romance, no shoehorned-in sex scenes with the obligatory female character, which was excellently portrayed by Rebecca Ferguson, a Swedish actress with whom I was unfamiliar. Cruise was Cruise, a successful, if unlikely action hero. Good work by also by Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames. I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would.",8,0,1,24 January 2016
Collateral," Enjoyable thriller, in spite of plot holes
","I found this one to be a pretty good flick, in spite of plot holes large enough to drive the proverbial truck through. Tom Cruise was, surprisingly, utterly believable as the cold-hearted killer. It was probably fun for him to play against type. Jamie Foxx showed his dramatic chops as well. But you have to suspend a lot of disbelief to enjoy this film. Why would Vincent (Cruise) take a taxi to all these appointments, when he could rent a car more cheaply? Unless he planned to kill Max (Foxx) he gives up all anonymity, even if all went well. Why carry around the corpse of the first victim, while leaving all the others? Shouldn't he just have dragged it off into the darkness, or alternatively, dumped it later? And how about the gigantic coincidence of two consecutive passengers of a random taxicab being later linked by the plot so intimately? If you can get past these things, then as I say, it's definitely worth a rental. Grade: B",7,7,12,31 January 2005
American History X," Left-wing racial propaganda
","This film definitely has some things going for it. Good actors turning in good performances. High production values in general. Nice gritty locations. The writer or director should have found a better way to delineate the past and present scenes than the black and white photography. It was annoying.But none of these things can mask the fact that this is left-wing racial propaganda. I'm sure these skinhead and white-supremacist persons and groups exist, but in my not-small number of years in America, I have never encountered any. I doubt that it is a problem of significant social magnitude. But, hey, what do I know? I'm just a drooling, evil, redneck white guy in flyover country.Unless you are interested in the message being force-fed here, you should skip this one.",4,4,10,7 June 2015
Pearl Harbor," With this budget, an astonishing lack of star power
","Well, Industrial Light & Magic certainly earned their fees on this one. The battle sequences are truly something to behold. But that still leaves almost 2 hours of movie to sit through. The framing story is OK, but simply doesn't match the rest of the film. There is, for the most part, no one on screen that demands attention. That has that special something, that charm, that charisma, that makes you unable to tear your eyes away from the screen. That thing I call star power. This lack is amazing in a film with this kind of budget. Affleck doesn't have it. Josh Hartnett has it even less so. Kate Beckinsale, while very pretty, and a good actress, doesn't have it either. Jon Voight was kind of an odd special case in this film, with his heavy make-up, he didn't look at all like Jon Voight. But he didn't look at all like Roosevelt, either. Now, Alec Baldwin, as much as it pains me to say it, does have it. But he wasn't in the film long enough to make up for the rest of the cast. The definitive Pearl Harbor movie is still 'Tora, Tora, Tora.' (And for the last part, 'Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo') I gave this one a 6 just due to the amazing visuals in the battle scenes, but if not for that, it would have been a 5.",6,2,3,21 February 2005
No Strings Attached," Very cute if ultimately formulaic
","I thought this was pretty good. Sure, the ending was formulaic. What did you expect? The direction was unobtrusive, the photography good. Ashton Kutcher, who I had never seen in anything but a camera commercial, was okay. Not a de Niro, but doesn't claim to be, and didn't need to be. Some good good work from supporting cast members Ludicrous, Greta Gerwig, and Mindy Kaling. Lake Bell and Kevin Kline chewed just a bit too much scenery. I'm sure the director called for it, so it isn't a criticism of the acting. Natalie Portman was achingly pretty, and has decent comedic timing, something not all primarily dramatic actors have. A nice change for her after the swan thing.",7,2,5,29 June 2011
The Commitments," Charming
","A movie that does not come out with huge aspirations. Which is fine. It just wants to tell its little story. Set in and filmed in the working class (or lower) neighborhoods of Dublin, it tells the story of a young entrepreneur who starts a band. Instead of heavy metal or poisonous rap, he/they want to do Sixties soul music, despite their Irishness and whiteness. There is a fair amount of subtle humor. I had neither seen nor heard of any of the actors, but then again, I rarely saw much Irish cinema. I was especially impressed by Angeline Ball, one of the back-up singers. The movie was, well, charming is the word that most comes to mind. You probably have to like that sort of music to like the movie, but if you do, check it out.",9,1,2,25 December 2016
Legends of the Fall," A wonderful, emotional melodrama
","A really good film. Basically a melodrama. Repeat, MELOdrama. Hollywood used to churn out this sort of film all the time with no apologies. OK, many of them seem corny now, but why do people think that every movie made has to be stark realism? I was tremendously impressed with Brad Pitt's performance. (I'm a guy, so I mean that, and am not swooning over his looks). I had never seen him in anything before, and had barely heard of him.  Anthony Hopkins was, as always, fantastic. In fact every single actor hit every single note with the possible exception of Henry Thomas. One of Aidan Quinn's best films, also. The photography of Alberta is magnificent, and I think no one can begrudge LOTF its cinematography Oscar.The film makers have an excuse for the occasional credibility lapse, in that there is a story frame, the recollections of One Stab, the old Cree. This covers things like Susannah falling for Samuel, who seemed to be an empty suit, Tristan keeping his long hair while in the British Army, etc. Excellent performance by Gordon Tootoosis, by the way, although his manner of speaking is very reminiscent of Chief Dan George.I highly recommend this film, if you can watch it without trying to dislike it.",9,77,111,21 April 2000
No Country for Old Men," Memorable dialog
","Well, a lot of very strong opinions in the comments section. I'm guessing that the Coens would consider that a success. I thought that the film had some very strong points. Excellent acting from Jones, Bardem, Harrelson, Brolin, and Kelly Macdonald. Nice photography and sets. (I'm pretty sure that I have stayed at one of the hotels in Las Vegas, New Mexico that served as one of them) Some memorable dialog, that may have been lifted from the McCarthy novel. Some of the extreme nihilism was a bit off-putting, but that was obviously the point. A big problem was the ending. I hate to criticize a film for being unconventional, because formulaic endings can be bad, too. There is definitely a place for films with ambiguous or undeveloped endings, although that place is usually in French art-house cinema. I did find it in need of more of a point. Perhaps I missed it.",6,1,2,9 January 2016
Days of Thunder," As a sports film, you pretty much know the story arc
","A pretty good racing movie. As a sports film, you pretty much know the story arc, and the ending, but hey, that's what genre movies do. This film, unknown to anyone at the time, depicts NASCAR's Winston Cup top series, at basically the end of an era. Thirty years on, stock car racing bears little resemblance to what is portrayed here, save for action on the track.Cruise was Cruise. It was nice seeing Nicole Kidman back before she ruined her face. Robert Duvall absolutely stole the show. NASCAR is very colorful, and makes for excellent big-screen visuals. I liked the movie.",7,0,0,2 July 2020
Liar Liar," Overwhelmed by Carrey's brand of physical comedy
","Well, if I had the same sort of birthday wish magic that the kid in this movie did, I would have had sex with a lot more supermodels! OK, about the film: it was just too much Jim Carrey. I think the film could have been better with someone else cast in that role playing it straighter. A pretty cute premise that just got overwhelmed by Carrey's brand of physical comedy. Not that that is always bad, but I just thought that there was a really good movie in there somewhere, and it got lost. A really good acting job by Maura Tierney. I wonder why she's not a bigger star. Maybe her work on ER will help.",6,0,4,3 July 2000
Blue Crush," Formulaic, but well done
","This was a very formulaic athletic/sports movie which hews closely to all of the genre's conventions. That said, however, it is all done pretty well. There were no real false notes on the acting, which means that the script had to be pretty decent, as even great actors can rarely overcome bad dialog. Kate Bosworth, Michelle Rodriguez, and Sanoe Lake also all looked very nice in swimwear. The cinematography had to be very challenging and looked great, even though surfing footage can be a bit monotonous, going all the way back to 'Endless Summer'. Interesting portrayal of the surf spots where a hundred or more surfers are competing for waves. There were some annoying rap 'songs' on the soundtrack which detracted from the movie a bit.",6,0,1,14 April 2015
Bridesmaids," Much more sad than funny
","After all that I had heard about this movie, I expected it to be hilarious. It is not. While it has some comedic scenes, I wouldn't really call this a comedy. Its dramatic parts are okay, just unexpected from the hype. I was not familiar with Kristen Wiig, who I thought did a good job with a tough character to play. Sad, with many of her problems of her own making, Ms. Wiig still came off with a certain level of charisma. Kudos to Wendi McLendon-Covey and Ellie Kemper for keeping some of the smiles going. It is overall not a bad movie, but if you are expecting to howl with laughter, you will likely be disappointed",6,0,1,7 May 2012
Meet the Fockers," Streisand is the best part of this yawner
","Not that funny. (Full disclosure: I have not seen 'Meet the Parents' Perhaps I am missing something because of this.) There were some mildly amusing bits. Ben Stiller seemed to be playing Ben Stiller. The rest of the high-powered cast was a bit wasted. Dustin Hoffman wasn't very funny, but that may have been due to the writing. Robert DeNiro seemed to have discovered comedy in the last ten years, and probably enjoys it. He was good, as always, but again the writing seems to have let him down. Barbra Streisand looks fantastic for her age, and she had the best part. I actually enjoyed her scenes a bit, in spite of knowing what a left-wing loon she is. But it really didn't click overall. I recommend taking a pass on this one.",5,0,0,21 March 2006
The Pianist," Painful to watch
","A very good piece of cinematic art, yet a very un-enjoyable way to spend 2+ hours. Yes, the nature of the subject matter. And I'm not (for a moment) suggesting that it should have been toned down. You have to hand it to Polanski, as much as I hate to compliment that reprobate. Excellent work by Brody, though I'm not sure it was the best of the year. An interesting, yet underplayed theme, that in the face of such evil, it was almost random in whether a given person would live or die. Szpilman survived through little effort on his own part. But the really heroic ones all died. What do you do? Well worth catching this film. But be ready for it. Grade: A-",8,0,1,11 August 2003
The Favourite," Good film, great acting, but often ahistorical
","I thought this was a good movie, in spite of its flaws. It was only loosely historical, with some anachronisms and modern-sounding language. Plus the director indulged in some annoying camera tricks, especially the fish-eye lens. But when the director played it straight, the photography was beautiful. Awesome performances by Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz, and Emma Stone. Definitely worth checking out.",8,3,6,5 July 2019
28 Days Later...," Not your usual film. Check it out.
","Wasn't expecting such a powerful film from people I was not at all familiar with. OK, the quibbles and plot holes first: True enough for those who say 'where are all the cars?' I would add 'Where are all the corpses?' When Jim (Cillian Murphy) awakens at the hospital, there should probably have been enough corpses there to clue him in that really bad stuff was going on. And all that death in a city the size of London would likely stink fifty miles away, from masses of rotting food, etc., as well as the dead. Clearly the reason for these omissions was to prolong the character's state of confusion. (And to pay a bit of homage to 'The Omega Man') And it is never explained why the infected do not attack one another. And there was something weird about the photography that was quite irritating. But, having said all that, not many movies leave me thinking about them three days later, like this one did. Anyone who likes sci-fi, horror, or disaster flicks has to see 28DL. Grade: A-",8,4,8,26 April 2004
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," I found it thoroughly engaging
","Wonderful re-creation of 1969 Los Angeles. While there were a few small anachronisms, Tanantino's obsessive attention to detail served him very well. I found the movie thoroughly engaging. I see a lot of criticism on this site about the movie's slow pace, or what they consider pointless scenes. I guess if you watch all of the 'superhero' movies that Hollywood mostly puts out these days, you can't sit through forty minutes without an explosion, or a car chase, or otherworldly CGI. There is actually great cinematic value in getting to know the characters. I can't say much about the plot without spoiling. I was very happy that I knew nothing of the big twists in this film, and enjoyed them immensely. Great acting by everyone, good direction, fantastic photography. Definitely worth seeing. (If you don't know much history, then this film is probably not for you.)",8,0,3,16 June 2020
Django Unchained," A white liberal's imagining of a black revenge fantasy
","A little bit bloody, but I guess that's just Quentin Tarantino. The film held my interest throughout. Some fine actors did some fine work in this movie, like Jamie Foxx, Bruce Dern, and Samuel L. Jackson. And Leonardo DiCaprio finally looks grown up. I have seen from her television work that Kerry Washington is a fine actress with a lot of range. Very pretty, too. I wasn't familiar with Cristoph Waltz, but his part was very good. Overall the film seems like a white liberal's imagining of a black revenge fantasy. I suppose that there's nothing wrong with that. I enjoyed the film, but I cannot find it to be the masterpiece that some of the commentators seem to think it is.",7,2,6,28 January 2014
The Lives of Others," A shame that Communism isn't as discredited as the equally evil Nazism
","A wonderful film which gives viewers just a taste of life under a Communist regime. It's a shame that Communism has not been examined and discredited as thoroughly as the equally evil Nazism. It's a little hard to comprehend the tyranny, from a place as free as the United States. The risks these people were taking, to accomplish such a minor thing, publishing an article that was fairly mildly critical of the government, should really strike home for those of us living in free countries. The only problem with the portrayal is that the two main characters, who seem at the start to be committed Communists, both turn away, showing their humanity, when in reality I think that this must have been fairly rare, from fear if not for logic or conscience. But even so the showing of an unapologetic taste of Communist tyranny is unusual, even to this day, and all the more powerful for that.",9,5,9,24 December 2007
Good Will Hunting," Good film, but predictable. Driver shines.
","A pretty good film. Several things at the end were utterly predictable. Robin Williams is so much better when he goes low-key, like here. I was very impressed with Minnie Driver's performance, something I haven't seen much mention of. (Although I haven't read all five gazillion comments) She really nailed it here. Damon and Affleck were OK. The script was good, but I don't think it was any better than 'As Good as it Gets' also nominated that year. (I haven't seen the other two nominees) One thing I liked was that the actors at least attempted the Boston accent. I suppose to a Yankee, it would seem uneven, but at least they tried. I hate films set in Boston, or New York, or Georgia, where everybody sounds like they're from L.A. Grade: B",7,3,8,21 June 2001
The Mist," Basically an okay horror flick
","Well, the last ten comments are all over the map. I come down in the middle. I did read the Stephen King novella, which is the source material for this film, many years ago. It was gripping, like all of his work, whether you are into the horror genre or not. The biggest difference, aside from the ending, is that in the King work, the characters never see whatever is in the mist, only the results. The mist is otherworldly thick and opaque, more than just thick fog. And they never get the slightest clue as to where it came from. As far as this film, there were some excellent acting performances by Andre Braugher and Laurie Holden. Also by Marcia Gay Harden in a role that Ebert called 'unplayable'. The film could have benefited a lot with a better actor than Thomas Jane playing the lead. It is basically an okay horror flick, but, as usual, not nearly as good as the King story it is based on, which I realize is not always a fair criticism comparing separate media. The ending is quite powerful.",6,0,2,24 December 2015
Driven," Estella Warren is by far the best thing in Driven
","Well, well. OK, I am a race fan, so I guess this movie was not targeted at me. Some of the contents of this film are completely ludicrous, as has been pointed out by others, but I have to mention that it takes at least two people to start a Champ car, so that rules out the ridiculous Chicago street scene. Also, the physical properties of methanol were ignored. I'll bet the filmmakers knew, or were told, that methanol mixes with water rather than floating on top, but decided to go ahead, figuring moviegoers are all too stupid to know better. Aside from the factual errors, and the over-the-top action and photography/CGI, I thought the actors did well with the material they had to work with. Kip Pardue was nothing to write home about, but I thought Til Schweiger and CristiÃ¡n de la Fuente did fairly decent work. Even Stallone wasn't as bad as usual. Too bad Gina Gershon's part was so limited. But Estella Warren was a complete breath of fresh air. Wow! What eye candy! I look forward to seeing her in some more films.",6,0,1,27 November 2002
A Quiet Place," Would have liked more exposition, but that's not the point of the film
","A well-crafted film, in spite of a few plot holes. I try to go into a movie with as little knowledge of it as possible, and so, with the lack of opening credits, I didn't even recognize John Krasinski. The acting, with very little dialog, had to be spot-on, and it mostly was. There wasn't much exposition about the post-apocalyptic world this film takes place in. As a sci-fi geek, I would have liked to know more (a lot more) about what had happened previously to lead up to this, but that's not the movie that Krasinski chose to make. Which is OK.",6,0,1,23 July 2018
The Game," Good thriller, semi-Kafkaesque
","A pretty good psychological thriller. Michael Douglas turns in his usual outstanding performance, but then, hey, he's got the genes. The plot is sort of an archetypal one of being manipulated and controlled by unseen forces. Sean Penn is quite good in a small part. Penn is a phenomenal actor, as much as it pains me to say so. Everyone knows his attachment to the political loony left, and this detracts some enjoyment from seeing him ply his craft. He, of course, has freedom of speech, and can say what he pleases, but in the old Hollywood days, the studio moguls kept their biggest stars away from political issues for just this sort of reason. But anyway, check out 'The Game'. It's worth a rental.",8,0,1,23 August 2005
Ghostbusters," Still pretty good
","Many comedies age poorly, but I thought that this one has held up pretty well. Lots of special effects (which have also held up pretty well) but the comedy does not get lost in them. Murray does his absurd deadpan, Ramis his low-key deadpan, and Ackroyd his high-energy weirdness. Sigourney Weaver proves that she has comedic chops. Still pretty good, not great.",7,21,23,20 December 2018
Coyote Ugly," Sappy, but pretty good scenery
","I suppose this film was OK for what it was. (Not exactly an art-house film) To tell the truth I found it a little bit boring. The scenery was nice, though. Piper Perabo, who I had never heard of, has beauty and charm, and I am sure she will turn up again. John Goodman NEVER mails it in, no matter how insipid his role or the film, and he was up to his usual form here. I thought the strongest performance was by Maria Bello, and I was far more impressed by her here than in her stint on 'E.R.', the only other place I had seen her. The plot was predictable and formulaic. The bar was kind of interesting. Why would all those people flock to that sort of place, instead of just going to a strip club? Anyway, there were just enough pretty women in the film to keep me from hitting the stop button. But just barely. Grade: D",6,0,1,10 December 2001
Gran Torino," Loved Ahney Her
","Well. The ads and trailers made it seem that this was going to be a geriatric Dirty Harry. But we should all be accustomed to their bait-and-switch tactics. What we got was rather more nuanced. And that's fine. It was still a good movie. Eastwood is still Eastwood with that menacing sneer intact, even at his age. I understand he used non-actors in most of the Hmong parts, and for the most part it went just fine. A few times Bee Vang's lack of the art came through. A wonderful job was done by Ahney Her. Her charm and beauty lit up the screen, and I was surprised that she wasn't a professional actress. I hope to see her in the future. I must admit that I did not see the ending coming, although there were plenty of clues. If you like Clint Eastwood at all, or even if you don't, this film is worth checking out.",8,0,8,21 August 2009
The Longest Day," Imagine what something like this would cost today.
","Wow, John Wayne, Richard Burton, Eddie Albert, Sal Mineo, Paul Anka, George Segal, Peter Lawford, Rod Steiger, Robert Mitchum, Robert Wagner, Roddy McDowall, Henry Fonda, Sean Connery, et al all in one movie! Imagine what something like that would cost today. What a great scene with Red Buttons stuck on the church tower while his whole squad mistakenly parachutes into a heavily fortified town. The comparisons to 'Saving Private Ryan' don't hold up for two reasons. One is the technical and societal ability to present gore for entertainment. Also, 'SPR' is a leftist anti-war film, so emphasizing the gore and mayhem suited Spielberg's purpose, while in this film, while the death is not minimized, (see the scene mentioned above) the purpose is to celebrate heroism, as well as provide some history in an entertaining fashion.",8,2,4,7 February 2000
Moulin Rouge!," The maharajah? Or the penniless sitar player?
","I spent the first ten or fifteen minutes of this film rolling my eyes, and kicking myself for choosing to see this film. After that, when my eyes caught up with the too-fast camera cuts, I started to enjoy it. I was totally unprepared for the comedic aspects of the movie and found it a pleasant surprise. I particularly enjoyed the sequence where they are making up the plot of 'Spectacular, Spectacular' in a panic and end up producing the show from that. And what a wonderful performance by Nicole Kidman. I thought at first that her songs were being dubbed, but according to the credits, that was really her. She has a fine voice, and sang very well. And her beauty, as Satine, is the absolute tops. Definitely not a movie for everybody, but for all those people who whine that Hollywood never puts out anything different, go see Moulin Rouge! Grade: A",8,0,0,26 June 2001
Slap Shot," Ice hockey cult-classic film
","'Slap Shot' is apparently a cult-classic hockey movie. As a Texan, ice hockey is utterly irrelevant to me, but this is still a flick worth checking out. Paul Newman is, as always, utterly believable in his character. Lindsay Crouse, and Melinda Dillon were notable, as were the Hansons. The language is pretty salty in this film, and in this day and age, I'm surprised that I noticed it, but I did. And some of the clothes! I didn't dress like that in the seventies, but I suppose a lot of people did. That coat with the fur collar Newman wore! Whoa! The officially-allowed fighting was what made hockey a minor/regional sport back then, and the memory of it keeps it in that place to this day, whereas international/Olympic hockey is somewhat watchable even down here.",7,1,4,29 December 2005
Back to the Future Part III," Largely forgettable
","Well, I saw the first two 'Back to the Future' films long ago, and they were cute, a bit fluffy, and mildly entertaining. Really had little desire to see this one. But, I finally did, and found it to be largely forgettable. I only watched it because Mary Steenburgen was added to the cast, and her sad-eyed beauty makes almost anything better. That is the case here. There are a few plot holes/time-travel paradoxes, but you cannot complain too much about that, as this is sort of the nature of time-travel movies. The production values were fine, and I'm sure it was fun to make, but there isn't much to recommend it, aside from the aforementioned Ms. Steenburgen.",5,2,5,21 December 2013
Transformers," Neither as good nor as bad as folks on this site say
","OK, I understand that I am not exactly the target demographic for this film. (Over sixteen) But my take on it is that is it is neither as good as some people say it is, nor as bad as others say it is. I know nothing of the cartoons or toys that are supposed to be the base here, and thus cannot comment on 'being true to source material.' But some of the characters (such as Sam, Mikeala) were decent, some of the others (such as Turturro, Sam's parents, Bernie Mac) were utter caricatures. Megan Fox looked very good. IL & M did what they do with CGI. I'm sure it was visually impressive on the big screen. If you take this film for what it is, it is mildly entertaining even if you aren't a kid. If you expect the movie to be something it's not, you will be sorely disappointed.",6,0,2,20 April 2009
Rules of Engagement," Deeply flawed, but enjoyable nonetheless
","CONTAINS ONLY MILD SPOILERS, NOT THE VERDICT: Surprisingly, I did not really know which way the verdict would go at the end of this film. I suppose that if it had been more popular, then everyone would have known.This film was deeply flawed, yet still enjoyable to watch. There were enormous plot holes, such as the speed of the trial, (nobody has a trial in two weeks from the event, not even in the military), and the fact that no one else was called to testify about the removal of the flag from the embassy, which many of the men saw, which would have completely proved the lies of the ambassador. Although I have no personal knowledge, my understanding of courts-martial was that they usually do not take place in actual courtrooms, but large offices, or wherever there is sufficient space. (See 'The Caine Mutiny') Also, the one-legged little girl, while it wasn't stated explicitly, I sort of assumed that they wanted us to think that she was one of the wounded from the embassy, but she had a bare, un-bandaged, totally healed stump. There are more, but you get the idea.However, in spite of these flaws, the film was carried by the sheer star power of Samuel L. Jackson, Tommy Lee Jones, and, to a lesser extent, Ben Kingsley. (Not that Kingsley wasn't just as good, but he often plays unsympathetic characters, probably due to his looks) So even though it was hard to overlook the bad stuff, this film is still worth a look.",7,0,1,15 February 2005
Pi," Didn't work for me
","A rather avant-garde approach to cinema. It didn't work for me, but I can see some appeal for some due to it being (very) different. The black-and-white photography is an affectation. We simply do not experience the world that way. Old movies were shot that way because color was very expensive. Eventually audiences would no longer tolerate it, and it fell by the wayside. Good Lord, can anyone remember how to set a camera down and film? The current fashion of jumpy erratic camera work is almost enough to cause a seizure. Everyone seems to think that this film is so original, but it breaks down into the hoary clichÃ© about the struggle between genius and insanity. Which eventually breaks down into the legend of Icarus.",2,4,8,12 March 2013
Kelly's Heroes," Pretty good rip-roaring war film
","A pretty good rip-roaring war film with the more recent genre of caper-movie superimposed on top of it. The ensemble cast never seemed to hit a false note, from Clint Eastwood as the eponymous title character, a former lieutenant previously busted down to the enlisted ranks, to Don Rickles as the hustler supply sergeant, to Carroll O'Conner as the crusty (to put it mildly) major general, to Donald Sutherland as the (anachronistically) hippie tank commander. A few plot holes, such as the value and weight of the gold, did not detract from the fun. The war action was played straight, and well-directed. There were a few veiled anti-war sentiments, as a sop to the mid-Vietnam era. On viewing I was a bit amazed that I had never seen this one in the forty-three years since its release. Decent, but not great.",7,1,2,22 June 2013
Empire Records," OK teenage angst film
","Neither as good nor as bad as people seem to think. About halfway through, I didn't think much of it. Teenage angst tends to bore me nowadays. I guess that makes me a geezer. Point taken. However, by the end of the movie, I would have to say that I ended up liking it. Pretty good performances by Anthony LaPaglia, Debi Mazar in a small role, Robin Tunney, and especially Renee Zellweger. The direction was suitably unobjectionable. I rented the movie in the first place to see some of Ms. Zellweger's early work, and was not disappointed. She was sooooo cute. Any fan of hers should see this film. Otherwise it is OK, nice, but nothing to write home about.",6,0,0,22 September 2009
Million Dollar Baby," Good flick, but a bit overrated
","This was a pretty good movie. Clint Eastwood directs in a reasonable, straightforward way that does not detract from the story or the acting. Some directors just have to find a way to say 'LOOK AT ME!!!' Oliver Stone comes to mind. Excellent athletic acting by Hilary Swank. And Eastwood's acting is by now as professional as it gets. Same for Morgan Freeman. I'm sure everyone is aware of the ending by now, but I will follow the rules and avoid writing a spoiler. I wish that I had not known what was coming. I can imagine how powerful all that must have been to people who thought that they were just watching a boxing movie. While I may not agree with the politics involved, it was done powerfully, and relatively tastefully. While I enjoyed the film, I don't believe that it is the 61st best movie of all time. I don't even think it was the best film of 2004. It is good, though, and I recommend viewing it.",7,0,2,15 April 2006
Donnie Brasco," Won't soon 'fuhgetaboutit'
","A really powerful film. Johnny Depp was absolutely excellent in a fairly conventional role. He's made his living doing oddball parts, but here he could be the guy next door (if you live in New York.) To me, as the film went on, as Brasco sank further and further into the Mafia milieu, Depp looked more and more like Ray Liotta in Goodfellas. I mean a real physical resemblance, which he doesn't normally have at all. And what can you say about another masterful performance by Al Pacino. Lefty's pathos oozed right off the screen. His misplaced paternalism toward Brasco was perfect, teaching him the ropes about Mafiosi ways, like the difference between introducing someone as 'a friend of mine' as opposed to 'a friend of ours'. Michael Madsen was reliably menacing, as always. This is really good stuff.",8,2,4,28 February 2000
Casualties of War," Fox adequate, Penn great
","CONTAINS SPOILERS: Well, I suppose this film was meant to provide Michael J. Fox his dramatic acting bona fides. I guess it achieved that, he did pretty well. Sean Penn really chewed the scenery here to good effect. The problem with this film seems to be in the script. The beginning and ending sequences on the train detracted from the movie. Also Fox's character got a little too philosophical and pontificating. Good performance by Thuy Thu Le. The rape scene was painful to watch, as always. Murder is so commonplace in movies that it has become simply a plot device, having no shock value. Brutal rape scenes do carry that shock. I certainly hope that they do not become so common that they lose the power to shock. The theme is found in the title, and every character could be classified as a casualty of war. Most obviously the innocent Vietnamese girl, raped and murdered. Also Eriksson (Fox) will never be the same. And then Meserve (Penn) and the other squad members serving lengthy terms in a military prison, can be thought of as casualties, that their lives may not have been utterly ruined had they stayed civilians, or not been in combat. Particularly Diaz, (John Leguizamo) who didn't really want to be a moral zero, but went along under, I guess, peer pressure. Severe peer pressure, to be sure, but obviously nothing can justify rape and murder. A tough thing, war.",6,2,6,5 December 2000
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Imaginative, visually striking, but boring
","I'm not sure what the target demographic was for this film, but apparently it isn't me. It seems rather too dark for children, though I suppose older children would maybe enjoy it. It is imaginative, and visually striking, but honestly, I was bored by it.",4,1,3,5 April 2019
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Worth skipping, but could be worse
","OK, I realize that I am not the target demographic for this movie. I'm not young, and I'm not a video game geek. I have not seen the first 'Resident Evil' film, nor have I played (or even heard of) the video game. So, I am coming at this film from a sci-fi action flick direction. While the movie largely fails at this, it really could have been a lot worse. Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory were decent enough as the tough-girl video-game-type heroines. Somebody named Mike Epps tried to play the cliché' smart-ass black guy part. The best acting came from Sandrine Holt, as the TV reporter trapped in the nightmare. There were huge plot holes, as you might expect. Seem to me that this one is worth skipping, but isn't terrible.",5,0,1,10 April 2006
Jurassic World," Not terrible (at all) but not Spielberg
","This is a fun enough movie, but as the fourth movie in the series, it has descended into following the formula much too closely. Chris Pratt is just okay as the lead here. I thought he was much better in 'Zero Dark Thirty'. The child characters were annoying and not really necessary, except as part of the formula. I did sort of like Bryce Dallas Howard, though. Also Katie McGrath. I realize that it is not intended to be super-realistic movie. But a couple of the numerous plot holes bugged me immensely. One is kids(!) being able to start and drive a jeep that had been abandoned for 22 years. Wow. Another was Ms. Howards 'ridiculous' shoes. She runs full speed on pavement and through jungle (!) wearing high heeled pumps, and never breaks a heel or loses a shoe. Anyway it is not terrible (at all) but it isn't really Spielberg.",7,15,33,12 January 2016
Annie Hall," Allen's shtick has seriously palled
","Here's the thing about Woody Allen movies in the Seventies. They were so funny back then in large part because they were so different from all other movies. But thirty-five or so years down the road, Allen's shtick, the neurotic, New York, nerdy, Jewish angst has seriously palled. And so have his movies. Including those from back in the day. 'Annie Hall' was fresh and different in 1977. But it is old hat in 2015 and no longer very good, or very funny. Seeing this again now, it is hard to believe how much I liked it back then. There are still some good things about it, some of the framing of some shots, the violation of the fourth wall, and so on, that still stand out. But overall, blah.",4,3,8,16 July 2015
Men in Black," Delightfully droll
","I can understand the disappointment of those who went into this expecting to see a serious sci-fi flick. I knew it was a comedy, though, and enjoyed it. The alien effects were seamless enough, and this technology will enable film makers to get away from the relentless anthropomorphism that science fiction films get stuck in. While there didn't seem to be much chemistry between Jones and Smith, still, the laugh lines were there, and the timing was good. I particularly liked the ending sequence, putting us in our cosmic place.",7,1,1,27 February 2000
There's Something About Mary," Crude and irreverent
","Crude and irreverent, I couldn't believe that this film was fifteen years old, and I hadn't seen it. Well, I have now. The film is a romantic comedy setting up elaborate gag after elaborate gag. I had of course heard of some of them over the years. Maybe they would have been funnier if I had seen the movie fresh. As it is, I found it amusing, but not big-time funny. Matt Dillon's sleazy character really didn't ring true to me. I doubt it was supposed to, but I found it distracting. Like the fake dog in the scenes where it was being 'injured'. Amusing, though. What can you say about Cameron Diaz? So pretty, such ingenuous sincerity. If you haven't seen this film, (anybody?) it's worth checking out, just don't expect it to be the best movie ever.",6,0,1,16 March 2013
La La Land," A notch above 'Just OK'
","I see a lot of 10-star and 1-star reviews here. I cannot see the justification for either. One of the goals of cinema is 'spectacle'. Yes, you have drama, and comedy. But another way to get to spectacle is the musical. I neither love nor hate musicals, but probably lean closer to not liking them, than liking them. So, I am no expert about singing and dancing. As far as I could tell, the dancing, and much of the singing in this movie was adequate. Nothing blew me away, and nothing made me cringe. Emma Stone has a pleasant voice, and she looked very nice in a girl-next-door sort of way. Ryan Gosling, though, seems singularly non-charismatic, and his singing was 'meh'. In times past, producers would dub better singers for the actors in certain musicals. Everyone knows that Marnie Nixon provided the singing for Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady. I saw some of Hepburn's tape from when she was singing those songs. She wasn't bad at all. But she wasn't Marnie Nixon. Maybe they should have done something like that for Gosling. Overall, I found the film a notch above 'Just OK'.",6,1,2,29 January 2018
Total Recall," OK for sci-fi fans
","It's still an OK movie, if you like science-fiction films. Arnold Schwarzenegger, although much too massive to be a normal person, at least plays one here. He's actually a little charming, and actually can act a little. (Which makes me think that acting isn't really that hard) Sharon Stone was at the height of her beauty and looks great. The real kudos go to Rachel Ticotin. It's too bad that I haven't seen more of her over the years.There is an interesting plot, even if full of holes. The special effects are everywhere, and although some seem a little cheesy now, I'm sure that at the time they were first-rate. Many of the effects are excessively disgusting, but this was obviously by design.",6,1,4,2 January 2008
Eyes Wide Shut," Enigmatic
","Okay, it shouldn't come as a great surprise that a Kubrick film might be, shall we say, deliberate in pace. Or that it might end up being, um, enigmatic. Nicole Kidman is awesome in this role, even more so, in that her character is not one that we really like all that much. A lot was left unsaid. Tom Cruise plays the quintessential 'nice guy' and like them, he tends to lose. It is a bit amusing that, as he goes out to seek revenge on his wife for her sexual fantasy, he never quite manages to get laid. Sydney Pollack's character provides some exposition at the end, but one doesn't really know whether to believe him, just as Cruise's character doesn't know. There are some large mysteries, which I would have called plot holes in someone else's movie, such as how the woman recognized Cruise to warn him, through his Venetian mask. That whole sequence had such a dreamlike, nightmarish quality about it that I can see how someone may think that entire part of the film is really a dream. Plus Alice (Kidman) made some comments at the end that might make one think so. I'm not so sure. The return of the mask is completely unexplained, and so it up to the viewer to interpret. The creepy piano music fit the film perfectly, and the photography was always very bright, odd for a film that one might consider as basically dark. I need to see the film another time or two to really see what I think of it. But for now, Grade: A",8,0,1,15 July 2002
Pretty Woman," 'Take care of you!'
","A very entertaining film. It has its flaws, but you really don't care about them. Richard Gere re-animated a somewhat moribund career with this film by playing against type. His character is low-key, modest, quiet, and even a bit shy. And of course Julia Roberts in the title role really hit the big time with this one. She has such charm, such compelling charisma on-screen, that one doesn't notice her limited acting range. (Noticeably expanded by now, I'm speaking of her 1990 range.) For those who disparage Miss Roberts' looks, they seem immune to the spell she casts on me. True, her features are somewhat irregular, and she's a bit too thin, but that megawatt smile of hers covers every possible flaw. Laura San Giacomo did some of her best work here in a part that was regrettably much too small. Ditto for Hector Elizondo. Both came close to stealing the show, and would have definitely done so with a larger part, and a lesser performance by Roberts.",9,0,1,13 August 2002
Jack Reacher," Decent flick
","I thought it was a decent flick, neither all-action nor all-thriller. I acknowledge the brouhaha about the diminutive Tom Cruise playing the tall and brawny Jack Reacher. I have not read any of Lee Childs' books, so I am not very invested in that question. Cruise, for all of his off-set looniness, has that charisma, the star power, that overcomes any deficiencies in his acting. Robert Duvall played his stock character right out of Days of Thunder. But it is still pretty good. And Werner Herzog as 'the zek' is sufficiently menacing and creepy. I was not familiar with Rosamund Pike, but was very impressed with her acting, and her beauty. I will have to look for more of her roles.",7,1,2,20 August 2013
The Shape of Water," Different from the endless parade of superheroes.
","At first, I gave this film high marks for originality. After giving it more thought, I realized that it was formulaic in its own way. Odd for a science fiction-type film to win Best Picture, but that's OK. The acting was quite good, and some of the characters were weird. Better than, and different from most Hollywood offerings. I was unfamiliar with Hawkins, Shannon, and the whole cast, except for Octavia Spencer. But I found the film to be worthwhile.",8,2,5,3 June 2018
Zombieland," Wierdly poignant
","I enjoyed this film a lot, much more than I thought I would. One has to keep in mind what it is, and not try to make it something it is not. It is a parody of 'Night of the Living Dead' and to a lesser extent '28 Days Later'. I have not seen this 'Shaun of the Dead', but it sounds like a parody as well. OK, with that out of the way, this is a film of wry amusement, rather than laughing out loud. I believe that was the intent. I think that the Wichita part may have been a little mis-cast. That was the only false note. Woody Harrelson's redneck obliviousness, and Abigail Breslin's older-than-her-years mien both scored direct hits. And the 'surprise' cast member sequence was great. If you can handle a zombie movie parody, then you have to check this out.",8,0,1,2 May 2010
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," A reasonably entertaining romp
","A reasonably entertaining romp. Sort of a romantic comedy/action film. I did actually laugh out loud a time or two, and that is a bit rare. Everyone knows the premise by now, and the genesis of the romance between the stars, so there's not much point in commenting on that. Some of the plot holes are pretty large, but I suppose that is a) par for the course, and b) part of the charm of the film. It is a bit much to believe that two such accomplished assassins and intelligent people could be so oblivious to their spouses. Anjelina Jolie is, as always, spectacularly beautiful. Overall, it's worth checking out. I can't imagine how anyone would hate it.",7,0,2,23 January 2006
Psycho," Hasn't aged that well
","I do realize how ground-breaking this film was. I was born a year before the premiere, and it was still widely talked about ten to twelve years later. Janet Liegh was yet another of Alfred Hitchcock's cold blondes. And it is hard to do a better tormented crazy than Anthony Perkins. But I am not at all sure that this film has aged well. Some of Hitchcock's iconic visual images, such as the camera looking into the shower head, and the camera following the detectives face in tight as he is falling down the stairs, are still being copied today. But there is so much 'arty' direction today that it badly distracts from the films. And that sort of blows back on Psycho. Still a classic nonetheless.",6,0,5,4 August 2014
Zero Dark Thirty," Pretty good film
","This was a pretty good film. While everyone liked the raid in Abbottabad, I found the buildup, the chase, to be very entertaining. Kudos to Jessica Chastain, with whom I was unfamiliar. There is a lot of comment about the portrayal of 'torture' leading to leads on bin Laden, and terrorist attacks in general. I use the scare quotes to differentiate the techniques that the CIA used from real torture, such as that practiced by, say, Arab despots, or American Indian tribes in the 18th and 19th centuries. People say that torture will not get you real information, but they do not come to it cold. They extract information that can be checked, or that they already know, in order to judge the veracity of the terrorist in question. As it happened, most of the detainees had a mindset that they must resist up to a point, but beyond that, they generally sang. As for the moral aspect, this was strictly done to gain information, and was not punitive in nature. Anyway, the film is worth seeing.",8,3,6,13 June 2013
All Quiet on the Western Front," Amateurish in places, surprisingly sophisticated in others
","Interesting how the 'lost generation' of anti-war Germans ended up empowering the Nazis only a few years later out of the national humiliation of Versailles. This film, for its early date, had some surprisingly effective battle sequences. I did notice that some trench footage was repeated in an attempt to make it look longer and more impressive. Some of the film was amateurish, and some of the acting excessively hammy. I put much of that down to the style of the day. However, some of it was surprisingly sophisticated. This film deserves its status as a classic, but I'm not sure it warrants a spot in the 'Top 250'. Worth seeing for anybody, though.",7,6,14,4 February 2006
Wedding Crashers," Some really good comedy here
","A rare comedy inasmuch as I laughed out loud several times at this one. Of the two lead actors, I would say that Vince Vaughn is by far the better physical comedian. He would have to be, I suppose, because Owen Wilson can probably skate by on his looks. Their comedic chemistry was quite good most of the time. Christopher Walken and Jane Seymour played fun parts and did them very well, just as one would expect. Isla Fisher chewed the scenery, and it looked delicious. Rachel McAdams was cute. The ending was extremely predictable, but even so it didn't quite spoil the movie. This will probably turn out to be one of the better films of 2005. Worth checking out.",8,1,2,6 March 2006
To Kill a Mockingbird," Decent adaptation; Overly dated and preachy
","I remember really enjoying Harper Lee's novel when I read it more than 25 years ago. The film is pretty good, I guess. The child actors all did wonderfully. Gregory Peck did well enough as Atticus Finch, although I'm not sure it was an Oscar-worthy performance. The whole rape trial sequence seems overly preachy to me now. I suppose that in the early '60's there may have been people unaware of the realities of Jim Crow, but nowadays it has been forced down everyone's throat for decades. The heroic liberal fighting injustice is a theme whose time has long passed, and viewing TKAM now hasn't the sort of impact that I imagine it did then. Grade: C",6,11,29,22 October 2001
Edge of Tomorrow," A great deal like a video game
","While you maybe can't quite call this one original, it WAS different. It is clearly evocative of 'Groundhog Day' and 'Star Trek' among others. It is also a great deal like a video game, where you get killed and have to start at the first level again over and over. The movie was very skilled in setting that tone, and then letting it go, just being understood, before that got boring. And, interestingly, it went the other way, too, where it became clear that Cage had been further into it than we have. There is plenty to mock about Tom Cruise, his diminutive stature, his loopy religion, etc., but he clearly has that 'it' factor that makes him a movie star, and he is always easy to watch on-screen. I was quite impressed with Emily Blunt with whom I am unfamiliar.If you like the science-fiction genre, you'll have to check this out.",7,3,6,30 January 2015
The Reader," Sex and Germans
","OK, so a woman in her thirties has sex with a fifteen year old boy. I know that it is politically correct to assume that this causes the exact same trauma to a boy as the reverse would to a girl. But it doesn't. Boys and girls, men and women, are not the same. You can pass laws saying that they are, but that doesn't make it so. You could pass a law that says that cats will henceforth be considered dogs, but that won't change anything's fundamental nature. This film leads you to believe that the Ralph Fiennes character was scarred for life by his teen-age experience. He may be weird, and distant, but so are a lot of people who had differing experiences. And by the way, I guess you can really count on Germans to keep their mouths shut. Don't tell the court about Schmitz's illiteracy, don't tell anyone about the camps and ovens. Jeez.",9,0,1,15 September 2011
The Wrestler," Depressing and hard to watch
","You can tell from the rating that I did not care for this film. I didn't really expect to, not caring much for 'professional' wrestling. (I did watch it when I was a kid, (Wahoo McDaniel, Johnny Valentine, Ivan Putski, etc.) This form of wrestling is a sordid business, which the film makes very clear. Mickey Rourke did put in a very good performance. He was utterly unrecognizable as the promising actor from the Eighties (Body Heat, Angel Heart, Barfly, etc.) I suppose that some years as a bad boxer can re-arrange one's face. Marisa Tomei was also very good putting some heart into the somewhat clichéd stripper role. And she looks fantastic. While I didn't care for the ending, I'm not sure that more exposition would have been any better. In short, the acting was usually first-rate, in a film that is depressing and hard to watch. There is certainly a place for such cinema, but I cannot recommend this film.",4,2,5,25 June 2009
Dark Shadows," Cool premise, but 'reality' seeps in
","I am old enough to remember watching the original 'Dark Shadows' soap opera, but I was a kid, and so do not remember much about it. Best I recall, they played it straight. But it was, of course, a campy concept, putting Gothic horror elements into a daytime soap. Which brings us to this movie. A lot of movies seem to fall into this trap: they come up with a really good and/or novel premise for the film. And so the beginning of the movie, where they are establishing that reality is really good. But, it is a movie, which means it requires a story arc, climax, etc. superimposed upon the premise. And that is where it all goes, if not bad, it at least goes not as good. That seems to me to be what happened to Dark Shadows. It was still an amusing film, with some interesting actors doing interesting roles. Worth a look, but don't buy it.",6,0,0,3 April 2013
Hitch," Better than i thought it would be. Eva Mendes -- wow!
","I have to admit that I liked this film much more than I expected to. Will Smith has that clean-cut charm that you just can't help but like. The plot was a minor twist on basic romantic comedy stuff, somewhat reminiscent of Jane Austen's 'Emma'. This guy Kevin James has a real flair for comic timing and physical comedy. I have never seen his TV show, but he was cast very well in this film. Amber Valletta was good enough. I can't remember why she was a rich celebrity in this film, but if she was supposed to be an actress or model, then the casting might have left something to be desired. I enjoyed Julie Ann Emery, and wish she'd had a larger part. But, saving the best for last, Eva Mendes more or less stole the show. Her beauty, and charm, and just the right amount of standoffishness had me glued to the screen whenever she was there. I hope to see more of her in the future. This film is definitely worth checking out.",8,0,0,20 March 2006
Inception," Good film, not the best
","I found this film to be neither the greatest (sci-fi or not) film ever, nor did it suck the way some recent commentators seem to think. I did think it was quite good. Leonardo DiCaprio has finally grown up and is an outstanding actor. Ellen Page was very good as well. (I had never heard of her until she was recently in some TV commercials in the U.S., which told me that lots of other people know who she is) For a pretty young actress, her role was 99% asexual. In only one very brief scene would it have mattered if the role was played by a man.But the best thing about Inception was its originality. It was not a sequel, remake, re-made TV show, or re-made comic book, which is all that Hollywood seems to churn out these days.As for its complexity, I was able to follow quite well, certainly well enough to enjoy it. The few points I'd missed, I read in the FAQ section here, and frankly, I'm not sure I would have gotten them on a second viewing alone.I understand why many folks are miffed by its high all-time ranking. Y'all just have to understand that so many voters are young people who have not seen, or do not like, classic cinema, so recent films will always be overstated. It will be interesting to see what Inception's rating will be twenty years from now.I recommend checking it out.",8,3,5,30 May 2011
Arrival," A lot left unanswered
","It is a little hard to comment much on this film without making it a spoiler. The three principal actors, Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, and Forest Whittaker all turned in good performances. The film is not invested too heavily in special effects, but they are done well, as is the rest of the cinematography. I feel like they had to work too hard on the central conceit, and the scenes of Adams' character with her daughter dragged down the pace. A lot was left unanswered, even as she became a sort of Billy Pilgrim. I thought it was OK.",6,2,7,6 July 2017
The Shawshank Redemption," Interesting casting choice
","Just a comment about something that I didn't see anyone else mention recently. (I didn't read all nine billion comments on this movie) I thought that the character 'Red' was a white man in King's story. Now, there's nothing wrong with casting Morgan Freeman in that part, and he was great in it. (He was cast as President of the United States in 'Deep Impact' and carried that off very well. I thought it was kind of neat to cast a black actor as President and make absolutely no reference to his race throughout the movie. Would that we could be that way in reality.) But TSR was set in a particular time, (1947-1968) and I find it hard to believe that there was utterly no racism in a Maine prison in those days. Sort of undercuts the realism that seemed to be done so well in every other aspect of the movie. Just a minor quibble. Everything else I have to say about TSR has already been said. Grade: A+",9,0,1,17 June 2002
The Big Short," Entertaining film about a usually dry subject
","I didn't think it would be possible to make an entertaining movie about a financial crisis, but Adam McKay and Charles Randolph have pulled it off. There are some really good performances by the stars, Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling, and Steve Carell. Especially Carell who plays against his usual type of the complete buffoon who is unaware that he is a buffoon. There were no major or meaty roles for women. Some of the gimmicks worked very well, such as breaking the fourth wall, or having non-financial celebrities explain financial matters. The film was more than a bit one-sided, blaming private bankers almost exclusively for the collapse, and letting government off the hook entirely. See Derek Tetlow's comment 8 or 9 down for that. But it kept me engaged throughout.",7,0,0,1 August 2016
Paths of Glory," A powerful portrait of injustice
","A powerful portrait of injustice, and the insanity of military ambition. The poor, scapegoated enlisted men, and General Broulard's assumption that Colonel Dax's motivation is exactly the same as General Mireau's. An interesting technique, wherein the enemy is never seen on-camera. This is a good film, but even though I am a fan of Kubrick, I can't afford this one classic status.",7,0,1,21 February 2000
Carrie," A pretty good film, with a few caveats
","A pretty good film, with a few caveats. Sissy Spacek was fantastic in her role. It seems that the filmmakers purposely made her look as unattractive as possible. Nancy Allen was good as the villain, as were Amy Irving and P. J. Soles. Most of the cast, however, looked too old to be in high school, a flaw found in many, many films set there.I was in high school at this time (1976) and a lot of the scenes don't really ring true. But my school was in a suburb of a large city, rather than a small town, and our proms weren't held at the school, but in hotel ballrooms miles away.Anyway, I had read the book long ago, but never seen the movie until now. Stephen King makes every scene seem perfectly rendered on the page. This adaptation was pretty good, but I did find de Palma's direction a bit annoying at times.",7,0,0,27 June 2020
Fifty Shades of Grey," A feminist masterpiece
","This movie is not nearly as bad (or as good) as the various commenters have made out. It gets mediocre marks from me as an erotic drama. I understand that the subject matter is distasteful to some people, but it should have been no surprise to anyone, considering the kerfuffle over the housewife porn book. I had never heard of Jamie Dornan who played the perv billionaire with all of the emotion of a terminator. I was also unfamiliar with Dakota Johnson who at least put some feeling into her role. I'm sure she is lovely, even though they had her overdo it a bit on the mousiness. What lovely boobies, so much nicer than the mounds of silicone that one sees all too often. I'm a little surprised that this film could be made at all, with the pervasive political correctness in Hollywood, but I guess the dollar signs overtake principles every time there.",7,2,4,7 July 2015
Blade Runner," Don't really get the appeal
","Hard for me to understand how I've never seen this film until now. I've certainly known about it ever since it was released. The most striking thing about it is the extremely detailed sets of the dark, dystopian future. But it just didn't do much for me overall. Not a lot of character development, but I guess some of the characters are machines, and do not develop. I didn't even recognize Daryl Hannah. It's always fun when viewing or reading something from the past which predicts the present, to see what they missed. In this case no one carried personal communication devices, and there was still a major reliance on printed material. Anyway, I can't really recommend this film.",5,1,3,26 December 2017
Bruce Almighty," Amusing film, Aniston shines, Carrey does the usual.
","An amusing film, with a reasonably interesting premise, and the redemption theme telegraphed from miles away. In spite of that, it was actually mildly moving. Carrey bored me for the most part. Not that he wasn't good,  he was just doing his regular shtick. Jennifer Aniston was excellent as the foil/straight 'man' for his stuff. Good work in small parts by Catherine Bell and Lisa Ann Walter. Worth seeing. Grade: B-",7,0,1,23 January 2004
Ben-Hur," Must be judged in the context of its time and subject
","A truly epic film. As is well known, an awful lot of effort and money were spent in making it. Charlton Heston was, well, Charlton Heston. If his acting seems wooden to modern audiences, well, I'm sure that he was giving the director exactly what he asked for. As a previous commentator has mentioned, people in ancient times, at least the aristocrats, spoke, wrote, and behaved much more formally and floridly than people do now. Kudos to the Israeli actress who portrayed Esther. Such raven-haired beauty. There was a great deal of historical inaccuracy, but audiences were not such sticklers for realism in those days. And, oh my God, that chariot race scene! Amazing for its time. It stands up to any modern action scene.I was surprised to realize that I had never actually seen this film until now. I expect that I had seen parts on TV as a child, but never sat through the whole thing. It does drag at times, and the treatment of the religious material is reasonably subject to debate, but it is definitely worth taking the time.",8,2,5,20 July 2008
Bull Durham," A stand-up triple
","This was near the beginning of Costner's meteoric rise to super-stardom. And, he can generally deliver, if the material he's working with is top-notch. I suspect that is probably true of a lot of actors who never get such material. Anyway, this film is hugely enjoyable escapism, just like baseball. Being from a large city, I've never had the opportunity to be around minor-league baseball, so I don't have a real feel for it. There is a lot of criticism of this film in this space, and reading it, I find a lot of it can be justified. But if you'll just try not to think too much, the movie will break right over the plate.",8,0,2,18 July 2007
Signs," Attempt at Hitchcockian suspense
","Decent acting from the child actors, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin. M. Night Shyamalan played a small part himself, and did well. I can see why this film interested Mel Gibson, with the aspects of his character's faith journey. River Phoenix and the minor cast were all adequate. Despite plot holes, which most science-fiction films have, this film is largely Hitchcockian. Rather than concerning itself with explicit exposition, the main point, aside from the faith journey mentioned earlier, was the building of suspense, which requires things to be imagined, rather than shown. Some of this build-up was truly creepy. Overall it was okay.",6,3,5,18 March 2015
Speed," Enough action for three movies
","Enough action sequences for three movies. Sandra Bullock has the cuteness controls set on HIGH, and Keanu Reeves plays it straight, a lot like his part in 'Point Break'. Dennis Hopper is, of course, one of the most believably creepy movie villains in the business today. (See him in 'Blue Velvet') OK, there were some physical impossibilities in the film, but c'mon, most action films have them. (I've driven buses before, and they will not do many of the things in this movie.) This movie kept my eyes glued to the screen throughout. Grade: B+",7,54,70,16 January 2002
Amélie," Quintessential quirky French cinema
","Amelie is the quirky main character, who seems to go on a binge of 'random acts of kindness' except that they aren't so random, and some are kind of mean. It is reasonably enjoyable, and probably worth a rental. I cannot fathom its ranking, though. I think that films should maybe be a few years old before being eligible for the top films of all times lists, like the top 250. I looked through that list and there are some new films which will be utterly forgotten in 20 years. I fear that 'Amelie' will be among them. Grade: C",6,10,19,8 January 2003
RED," Thoroughly enjoyable
","This film was thoroughly enjoyable. The mega-star cast didn't hurt anything. Bruce Willis was as Bruce Willis does. He completely nails his character's initial ennui, and then takes off with the plot. Helen Mirren is always great, and it was such fun to see her gleefully shooting machine guns. John Malkovich plays semi-crazy better than anyone out there, and does so with zest here. Mary-Louise Parker was also fun in her fantasy-come-true adventure role. Honorable mention to Morgan Freeman and Ernest Borgnine (at 93!). To enjoy this sort of film you have to get past a few plot holes, such as government agents firing thousands of rounds in public with no obvious curiosity by the media. (CIA or not, you can't do that!) You won't be wasting the 111 minutes if you want some light entertainment.",8,1,2,29 March 2011
Flight," First part of the film awesome. The rest, not so much
","The first part of the film was awesome. The rest, not so much. The flight and crash sequences were fantastic. But then. The film turned into a standard character arc about addiction. It was all done very well, with good acting by Denzel Washington and Kelly Reilly. Also good were Don Cheadle, and John Goodman, who seemed to have come from a different movie. But people need to get their drugs somewhere. And how lovely was Nadine Velazquez? Wow! But come on, the addiction thing has been done to death. I don't mean to be offensive, but I have seen it so many times that it bores me. I gave it a better score than it really deserved due to the cast and the production values.",7,2,3,4 June 2013
Rear Window," Wow
","Again, Alfred Hitchcock shows all others how it's done. Very few films these days can maintain true suspense. Current-day writers and directors simply spatter the screen with gore to cover these shortcomings. A classic film that will be watched a hundred years from now.",9,1,3,17 July 2000
Pitch Perfect," Competitive collegiate a cappella. Is this really a thing?
","Competitive collegiate a cappella. Is this really a thing now, or is it made up for the movie? There were some solid performances here, from Anna Kendrick, Anna Camp, Brittany Snow, and Rebel Wilson. It seems like the ads for this film were all about Miss Wilson, but she is a medium character here. The singing was first-class, but you probably have to like a cappella to truly appreciate it. The plot was exceedingly formulaic. And I suppose that if you are in your teens, or maybe twenties, then teenage angst can seem important, but it is quite boring for those of us who are older. Overall, it was kind of okay, but found myself looking at my watch several times...",5,0,1,26 August 2014
Thirteen Days," See 'The Missiles of October' instead
","I had assumed that this film was going to be just another Kennedy hagiography. But really, JFK came off as less decisive, and somewhat unsure of himself. In fact, it made it look like Kenny O'Donnell saved the world. Costner and the rest of the no-name cast did OK. About Costner's Boston accent; at least he tried. Not everyone can be Meryl Streep. I'm a Southerner, so if he murdered the accent, I cannot tell. But it would seem silly for a movie about all these Bostonians to have characters that all sound like they're from Nebraska or California. It'd be a little like those films with Arnold Schwarzenegger playing an (native-born) American. The action scenes with the planes and ships were well-done. But overall, I'd say this movie is not as good as 'The Missiles of October'. Grade: C-",6,0,1,11 June 2003
300," Up-close slaughter
","OK, I liked it. Didn't love it. The whole CGI comic book look was a bit annoying. But that was largely the point, so I had to get over it. Also, it isn't a documentary, so some liberties taken with history are, I suppose OK. I don't think that the Spartans fought bare-chested because they weren't, well, suicidal morons. Oddly, some of the cheesiest dialog was straight out of Herodotus and other ancient sources. And while the battle gore is played for style points, it makes one reflect on the nature of warfare prior to gunpowder. It was up-close slaughter, often on a massive scale. The movie is worth checking out, just don't expect it to be something it's not.",7,1,1,3 April 2009
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Tom Cruise IS Lestat
","I, like Anne Rice, was initially dismayed that Tom Cruise had been cast as Lestat. But when I saw the film, I had to admit that he absolutely nailed the role. I had always thought of Cruise as a pretty boy, and not really a serious actor, especially since he failed in his attempt at a Streepian accent in 'Far and Away'. However, he perfectly portrayed Lestat for what he is, a monster with a monstrous ego.  I think that this was the first film I had seen with Brad Pitt, followed shortly by 'Legends of the Fall' so to me his acting credentials were impeccable, in spite of my female friends swooning over him. The rest of the cast was excellent as well, with the only minor quibble that Antonio Banderas was too old for the part of Armand. Kirsten Dunst was adorably evil. The cinematography was beautiful, considering that almost all of the film (of course) takes place at night.  One note on the supposed 'homo-eroticism' in the film. I have the advantage, having read Rice's books, so here is the deal on that. In Rice's world, the vampires are absolutely sexless. Therefore, gender has no meaning to them. When a vampire loves another, or a mortal, it is truly from the heart, as no sexuality of any kind ever enters into it. The only thing to them that is close, is the kill. Killing is highly 'erotic' to vampires. However, this too is really asexual, and so again, gender has no bearing on the eroticism of the kill. I think that some elements of this, which apparently came across as homo-eroticism, were included in the screenplay just to emphasize how different, how non-human, that vampires are.",8,259,303,26 December 1999
Braveheart," Checks all the boxes for a 'historical' epic
","I saw this film in the '90's, and really didn't remember liking it all that much. But viewing it again the other day, I found it quite enjoyable. It checks all the boxes for a 'historical' epic. Yes, the MANY historical inaccuracies are a concern, since so many simple folk consider these sort of movies their education in history. But putting that aside, it is well worth watching for its entertainment value. Special kudos to Sophie Marceau and especially Catherine McCormack on their performances and their beauty.",8,0,3,13 February 2019
True Romance," Check it out
","One can easily see the Tarantino influence in this film, with the stylized violence, the amoral/heroic characters, and the fixation on using the word 'nigger.' It's a pretty good script, but I think taking out of linear time, 'Pulp Fiction'-style would have been a mistake. The cast collected for this film was awesome. Samuel L. Jackson in a very small part, almost a cameo. Dennis Hopper was tremendous in his last scene, as was Christopher Walken. Even James Gandolfini, who would have been relatively unknown then, put in a very good turn. Much of the rest of the supporting cast was also excellent, with the possible exception of Gary Oldman, who went just a little far over the top. Now, Christain Slater is a pretty good actor, and I've enjoyed some of his stuff. For that matter I enjoyed this one. But with these giants in the cast, Slater fairly obviously comes up short. And mention must be made of Patricia Arquette, who more or less stole the show. Her portrayal of Alabama's defiance in the scene with Gandolfini should be a cinematic classic. If you can stand the violence and profanity, I recommend checking this one out.",8,1,2,7 June 2005
Contact," Didn't do much for me
","Well, at least this movie had Jodie Foster. I know, it's supposed to be very deep, the conflict between science and religion. It really didn't do much for me. I read Sagan's novel way back when, and as I recall, it really wasn't much to write home about either. Good effects, good direction, good enough acting, but like Oakland, there's really no there there. Can't recommend this one.",6,5,10,4 February 2001
Goodfellas," One of the best Mob movies ever
","One of the best Mob movies ever. Robert De Niro can always look dangerous. Ray Liotta, as always, looks like a total weasel. Good casting. Lorraine Bracco was great here, as was Paul Sorvino. But the real performance came from Joe Pesci, as the Academy recognized. I first saw him as the buffoon in the 'Lethal Weapon' movies. Here, his unstable dangerousness (it's a word, look it up) oozes menace right off the screen. This film is very different from the Godfather films in that these characters are blue collar hoods, rather than top bosses. To me this brought home even more the evil, law of the jungle, credo of the mob. Very powerful stuff.NOTE: I have the DVD, and the sound on it is not so good. The voiceovers and music are very loud, and the regular dialogue much too soft. It had me adjusting the volume throughout. C'mon, guys, for what DVD's cost, you can do better than that.",9,3,6,7 June 2000
Beetlejuice," A beginning or near beginning of many a career
","This film is a delightfully nutty 'horror' movie. Looking back on it from this distance, it was clearly a beginning or near beginning of many a career. Geena Davis was probably the most established star, save, I guess for Michael Keaton, who chewed the scenery relentlessly. Ms. Davis was so cute. This seems to be Tim Burton's first real movie, which set the dark tone for many of his future projects. I'm thinking that this was likely the last time that Alec Baldwin was in any way charming. And this also seemed to have really started Winona Ryder along her career path. As I recall it also re-ignited some interest in the calypso tunes of the long-forgotten Harry Belafonte. The effects seem quaint these days, but were just fine back in the day. Surely just about everyone has seen this one, but if not, check it out.",7,0,0,6 July 2015
