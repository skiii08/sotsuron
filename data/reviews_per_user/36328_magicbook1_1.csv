The Blair Witch Project," Worst movie ever.
","This 'movie' has the look of home movie.  It has the writing of home movie and when I watched it for the price of home movie, nothing, I STILL felt cheated.  Perhaps it's just me, but a grainy picture and no real plot (I hear the just let the actors make stuff up) doesn't seem like a movie to me.  It seems like a home movie or public access cable. But it made someone some serious money; so what do I know.",1,4,6,27 November 2001
