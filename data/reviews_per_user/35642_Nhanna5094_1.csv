Hereditary," I'll be the one..
","Maybe i went into this tooo excited for a new scary movie. I loveeee horror movies and I'll see them even if everyone thinks it'll be bad. I just like the thrill of it all I guess. 
That being said, there were some great scenes in this. Though slow (my BF fell asleep an hour in) the car accident scene definitely gave me anxiety. I was terrified for Peter, I didn't know what happened either so i was scared for him to go see. Maybe i was holding my breath? I was so nervous for him and my eyes. When he started driving again i was in shock and confusion and terror!!!! 
However, as the slowwww movie progressed it was going all over the damn place. There's the 'miss my dead kid, do a seance and capture a demon who possesses me' story line and then a whole nother bat shit crazy story line that happened too quickly, and just felt rushed and ridiculous. When Annie was explaining the book/fire and all of her sudden theories i was rolling my eyes. Like where tffff is this even coming from. It was too all over the place even though they tried to make it seem like there were enough hints. Why even have the possession?? They should have nixed that story line and just focused on building a background of this devil thing. When it ended i was literally like WTF did i just watch. I still have questions even though i guessss i get what they were trying to do but it was sloppy and too rushed for a two hour movie. Also, Peter stinks at crying.",5,14,32,8 June 2018
