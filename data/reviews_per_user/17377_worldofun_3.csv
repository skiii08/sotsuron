The Mask," Entertaining, Funny, great Special Effects
","I thought this movie was pretty cool.  It had a decent story line with good acting, and lots of humour.  Carrey was great!  He did a real good job of being both a 'nice guy' and a wacko 'greenface'.  This movie isn't the best movie I have ever seen, but it is memorable, and I thought the Special Effects in it were great.  Things looked really cartoony and funny, along with some more realistic special effects.  This movie kept my attention, and will probably keep yours.",8,0,0,9 July 2000
A Bug's Life," Funny, touching movie with a lot of heart!
","I have to say this is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen! (second only to Toy Story 2.)  The animation in it was very smooth, and the backgrounds were gorgeous!  This movie has a lot of atmosphere in it, with bright pretty leaves in contrast with the blue sky in some scenes, and darker looking in others, all the atmospheric conditions really match up with the story in this movie.  If I have to compare this with 'Antz,' I would have to say 'A Bug's Life' wins hands down.  For one thing, a copy is never as good as the original, plus, as far as I know, Pixar worked alot longer on the story ideas, starting way back in 1995! This movie has a lot of funny sequences in it (just like any Pixar film so far!) yet it has a lot of heart, and a strong story.  If you haven't seen this film: Go see it!  It's worth it!",10,0,0,7 July 2000
Toy Story 2," Funny, Wacky, and absolutely Wonderful!!!
","Toy Story 2 is THE funniest animated movie I've ever seen! It has so many gags that both adults and kids can understand, that I couldn't believe it!  Even if your old and aunry, this movie will put a smile on your face.  Like any Pixar film, Toy Story 2 has a great story, that never fades away.  It also has great visuals and awesome sound.  I loved this movie.  In fact, I'd go so far as to saying it is one of the best movies I've ever seen!  I really enjoyed this movie, and I think you will too, no matter what your age.",10,1,2,7 July 2000
