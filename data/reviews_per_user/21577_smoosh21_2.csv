The Ring," A so so movie
","I saw a screening of this last night, and while it wasn't a bad movie, I am not sure if I would spend the $8 to see it at a theater, over waiting for the DVD to come out.Beware of Spoilers: There were too many loose plot points for me.  The most significant was the fact that the son got so upset when his mother (Naomi Watts) released Samara.    She apparently didn't need to 'be released' to kill before, and she still killed afterward.  What was the point of that, especially since they made such a big deal of that scene?  (It occurs at the point of the gotcha ending).Also, she makes the comment of what she did differently and concludes it must have been making a copy, but she also spent time in the well.  it is possible that is what saved her, and the son making copies would not do any good.Finally, since Samara apparently kills by coming out of the TV, how did she kill the 2 friends who were in the car?  I guess it is possible that they had a TV in the car for her to come out of, but that still seems unlikely.",Null,0,0,9 October 2002
Event Horizon," Awful Movie
","I can't believe so many people liked this movie.  This is, without a doubt, the worst movie I have ever seen.   I realize that movie require you to have suspension of disbelief, but the inaccuracies of basic physics and biology was more than I could take.  The dialog was awful, the story weak and unoriginal.   The so called 'horrible visions' that all these positive review mention, were nothing more than Hellraiser and Phantasm rip-offs, and not done as well.I have never walked out of a movie, because I figure that there must be something better coming up.  With this movie, nothing better ever came up, it only got worse.  And  unfortunately it was so bad, there wasn't even a camp value to it.Stay away from this movie unless you want to waste your time and money.",1,10,22,27 June 2002
