Mission: Impossible III," Stupid Film!!
","I can't understand a spy mission carried by a lot of attractive persons. Especially that hot Asian woman, Its stupid to see her taking spies photos of the sooo very male villain, with a red bright dress, revealing her long sexy, beautiful gorgeous legs, and pretending to play - girl concern of her make up...isn't that so catchy!! I don't know i just loose it, because all of this minor stupid things. What about Tom Cruise athletic body transform into a fat villain, all i see in the movie is the face transformation, not the whole thing...again that is stupid! O yeah that terrorist scene happening in the bridge...so much simmilair to the True Lies scene yeah...o man so unoriginal!!",1,10,21,18 May 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Greeeeaaaaat movie!!
","Fanatastic film! I always have lots lots of question regarding the Christian faith. I don't know, until now it seems hard to understand it with my logic. I think that is why people try to make theories by themselves to make it logic. But i never knew this one, especially about the code beneath Leonardo's's work on the last supper. Wow, for me this theory is a new one...that is why this film it is so intriguing for me, it catches my mind in how this film sets up another new theories about the origin of the Christian faith  again to make it logic! I never understand until now why a man could be perceive as a God and put that as the main dogma in the faith. Isn't it simple to believe a man as a mortal rather than an immortal. I cannot imagine a God being born as a human, nursed and taken care by human, educated by human then grew up to be God the Almightywell this film really workshell he grew up to be a real man, wise, handsome and in need of love from a woman.",10,0,1,23 May 2006
