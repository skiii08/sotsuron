The Blair Witch Project," Didn't see what the fuss was about
","Eh. That's my one word review.Guess it was hyped up too much cos I didn't see anything particularly fantastic about this movie. I liked Mike and Heather. When they interviewed people at the beginning of the movie, it was kind of funny. But while they were in the woods, I wasn't scared at all. Not one bit. And the ending was pretty predictable seeing that you know right off that they die.My one line review: Good concept, but I think more could have been done with it.",5,0,1,18 October 1999
Se7en," Wonderful dark psychological thriller
","Disturbing yet compelling, Se7en is the last great dark thriller that I've seen. With tour de force performances by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt (and an gripping uncredited appearance by my favorite actor, Kevin Spacey,) Se7en takes you on a gripping journey through the mean streets of New York City, as a veteran and a rookie detective track down a serial killer who murders to set an example that the seven deadly sins are the causes of society's eminent demise.Cinematography and sound are brilliant and the murders are so horrifying, yet your eyes are glued to the screen for the entire time. If you don't mind graphic, grotesque depictions of murder and you love psychological thrillers with first-rate actors, this is the film for you. Don't be fooled by the Se7en rip-offs that have surfaced in the past few years (Kiss the Girls, The Bone Collector.) This is the genuine article.",10,0,0,1 November 1999
As Good as It Gets," Blech. How could these two win Academy Awards?
","As Good as it Gets was the second most overrated film of 1997. (Guess which one was first, you ship-lovers?) I was not amused in the least with Nicholson's obsessive-compulsive schtick nor with Hunt's neurotic waitress. I wish the Academy would recognize actresses who actually work long and hard to perfect the nuances of their characters' personalities, instead of those who can only play one cracked-up role.I didn't laugh once throughout this entire movie. What was so funny? That this sad man had to wash his hands 100 times? No, not really. That silly little dog? Nope. The only bright spot in this movie was Greg Kinnear's gay artist. That's it!Don't believe the hype. This movie is nothing special and it wastes Jack Nicholson and Greg Kinnear. As for Helen Hunt, she needs to stick to television. No one should have to pay good money to see her whine.",4,5,14,30 October 1999
L.A. Confidential," Gripping and suspenseful return to film noir
","Robbed of the Academy Award by the insipid Titanic, this is the film that people will praise and remember ten years from now.LA Confidential boasts one of the finest casts imaginable. Russell Crowe proves his worth as hard-as-nails cop with a soft spot for battered women. James Cromwell demonstrates that he can play a shady police captain as well as a kind-hearted farmer (Babe). Kevin Spacey shines as Hollywood Jack Vincennes, a schemer who has an attack of conscience and David Straitharn's performance as a pimp who has his girls cut to look like movie actresses testifies to the fact that he is one of the most underrated actors in the business. While Kim Basinger puts on a good show as call girl/Veronica Lake lookalike Lynn Bracken, she is the least convincing of the cast. The actors were so superb that they split the votes come Oscar time and none of them were nominated.What Brian Helgeland does with James Ellroy's novel is masterful. He takes a thick novel full of characters and plot twists and is able to condense it to a mere two and a half hours, still capturing the essence of the work. LA Confidential film afficionados would do well to read Ellroy's novel, as some of the film's more underdeveloped characters (Jack Vincennes, Exley's undead father!) are described in more detail.Please do yourself a favor and BUY, not rent, this masterpiece. It deserves several viewings and it is a great addition to any movie buff's collection.",10,0,0,19 October 1999
American Beauty," Look closer indeed
","This is one of those films that sticks with you for hours after viewing.This is one of those films that requires multiple trips to the theatre.This is one of those films where the directing, cinematography, script, and acting blow you away.American Beauty is a gem in a year that was short on ambition in movie-making. It's curious that the few who hate this movie do it on the basis of moral objection. They want to skirt the issues of lust, violence, and feelings of angst, worthlessness, and frustration. They miss the point of this poignant Hollywood triumph. They miss the themes of hope, love, and faithfulness that also play a part in the film. They refuse to look closer.The Academy has consistently disappointed me in the past, by snubbing such films as LA Confidential, The Shawshank Redemption, and Life is Beautiful, and I suspect they will do so again this year. But American Beauty is truly the best movie of 1999 thus far. Kevin Spacey is the best actor of 1999 and Chris Cooper is the best supporting actor of 1999.Look closer. You won't regret it.",10,0,0,4 October 1999
The Usual Suspects," Crime with a twist
","When the mug drops and Dave Kujan runs out the door, you know that you've been fooled. Who is the elusive Keyser Soze? The film centers around the cripple Verbal Kint, one of two survivors of a drug smuggle gone bad... What happened? Who is responsible?This film won two Oscars. Chris McQuarrie for Original Screenplay and the consummate actor of the 90's, Mr. Kevin Spacey for Supporting Actor. The plot is so juicy and the performances so well done that it keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. And just when you think the action has subsided, it goes into full force once again.Not seeing this modern cinematic classic would being doing yourself a great disservice. Rent it now. Better yet, buy it, cos upon multiple viewings you see details you never would have in the first.",10,0,1,19 October 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," Superb - This film is a modern day classic
","I groaned when there was nothing on TV that day so I decided to do the Pay-Per-View thing and pick a random movie. So I saw Shawshank, never having heard a word about it, merely because I liked Morgan Freeman. I was glued to the screen for those two and a half hours. Stephen King created one of the most poignant tales of hope in a modern era, Frank Darabont made every scene breathtakingly beautiful, and the cast was superb.Shawshank definitely has the most satisfying ending in all of movie history. Although your first watch is the greatest, every viewing reveals a different layer of the story. You begin to see prison through the eyes of Red, Brooks, Haywood, Tommy - even Warden Norton and Byron Hadley.It is my favorite movie and it has some of the most inspirational lines in it. 'Some birds aren't meant to be caged, their feathers are far too bright...'Please see this movie. It is wonderful.",10,0,0,4 October 1999
The Sixth Sense," Enjoyable, but one of the top 20 movies ever?
","I finally saw this movie at a Halloween showing at my college, and I enjoyed it mainly because of the company I was with and because it was a SPOOKY day and a good ghost story is always welcome...Yet I was surprised to find the film more of a psychological thriller, rather than a horror flick. I enjoyed Haley Joel Osment, Olivia Williams, and Toni Collette as well. Bruce Willis was emotionless and deadpan per usual, which is the way I like him.The film did drag in spots given the hype that the movie has received in recent months. (How long do we have to wait for Cole to confess that he 'sees dead people?') Unfortunately, I'm not a big fan of screenwriters who devise the ending of movie before the action, and it is clear that it is done in this work. EVERYTHING leads up to the ending, which is interesting and surprising, but the exposition of the movie needs a little more OOMPH. Also, ten minutes after my viewing I began to think about little things that were wrong with the film and its ending, which really started to irk me.Short review? It's no Usual Suspects, but it's one of 1999's amusing little gems.",Null,0,0,31 October 1999
