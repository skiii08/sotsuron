United 93," The First Victory in the War on Terror
","I have been disappointed in cinema lately until this came out. This movie grabbed me by the throat and ringed me out like a sponge. This film, not only paid tremendous respect to the families of these great warriors, but at the same time touched every subject that film can grab.Of all the branches of Cinema, only the animation branch has made me cry....until this movie. This movie was the only film that made me sit down and think about what it would be like to call my parents for the last time knowing I was about to die. The fight scenes are realistic, there was no Hollywood style stunts or lines, this was real and this was life Hollywood was left out as it should be. Having watched this film four times, I still work my way into a frenzy when the passengers realize what's going on and attack the terrorists! These were the real American heroes going all the way back to the first war America ever fought. Who beat the British? Not military people but Farmers! Who destroyed the terrorists? Not the military, but passengers! This movie also dabbed into the spiritual warfare. Throughout the film the terrorists pray to Allah and at the end the passengers pray to Jesus. It was a war between the nation based on the the teachings of Jesus vs the the nation based on the teachings of Mohammad and we won thanks to the courageous efforts of these passengers! 10/10!! God Bless the warriors of Flight 93 who refused to die without a fight!",10,2,4,13 September 2006
