The Mask," SSSmokin' indeed. Jim Carrey is a comedic tornado.
","This is my favorite Jim Carrey film of all time. I love this film quite a bit. It's fast, it's fun, and it's funny. Stanley Ipkiss(Jim Carrey) is a bank clerk, he's nice guy, that lets everyone stomp all over him, not to mention that he is a hopeless romantic. He stumbles upon an ancient mask that represent the Norse mythology god Loki. Upon wearing the mask he receives superpowers and brings his inner most desires to life. What I love most about this film is that there is a duality between Stanley Ipkiss and the Mask. As Stanley he's shy, timid, mild-mannered, a good guy who gets taken advantage of. But, when he puts on the mask, he's the complete opposite, he's able to become someone he wishes to be: full of wisecracks, jokes, cartoony antics, and full of confidence who chases after Stanley's love interest Tina who is portrayed by Cameron Diaz. I believe this is the film that showcases just how good of an actor Jim Carrey really is. He's able to remain as human as possible, perhaps even a little relatable to some guys as Stanley Ipkiss, but he's able to go off and show off his physical comedy as the Mask. He is literally bringing a cartoon character to life. It's very memorizing. I sincerely believe this is an underrated performance by Jim Carrey. The supporting cast is great. I liked everyone in this film. Peter Riegert is great at Lt. Mitch Kellaway who chases after the Mask, who suspects that the identity of the Mask is Stanley. Peter Greene is great as the villain Dorian, a complete jerk from the beginning. Cameron Diaz is good in her supporting role as the love interest, there is decent chemistry between her and Jim Carrey. Oh and she is also absolutely gorgeous in the film, stunning really. Richard Jeni is also very good as Stanley's best friend at his job. The real supporting character that steals the spotlight is Stanley's dog Milo. A great sidekick and director Chuck Russell puts good use into the dog and actually serves the plot. For 1994, the visuals are impressive and frankly still hold up very well. The disappointing aspect of this film was Amy Yasbeck's character Peggy who is a writer for a newspaper, and a semi-love interest for Stanley. There's a neat twist in the film involving her character, but she abruptly disappears in the film, I already know the behind the scenes story involving her character, but the film doesn't wrap her arc and it's very apparent. The other thing I would have liked to see is the reaction of what the Mask is able to do with his abilities, nobody in the film seems like it's a big deal that he's continuously traveling in a tornado, or able to elongate his body, let alone do everything physically impossible, especially Lt. Kellaway. It doesn't have too much credibility in that department. This film is will always have a special place in my heart, as cheesy as it sounds. The Mask is the first film I watched on VHS. Batman Forever being the first film I ever saw in theaters. Both which stars Jim Carrey. It's really because of Jim and this movie that really got me into films in my youth it opened the doors for me. Green also happens to be my favorite color because he frequently plays characters that are green. What I love about this film is that this film has somewhat of a deeper message. As quoted by Ben Stein who has a role in the film, 'We all wear masks.' Stanley Ipkiss actually wears a mask in the film, he wants to be something else, but he's too afraid and too timid, and the mask provides his desires, eventually he learns to become the man he wants to be and doesn't really need the mask anymore. 9/10",9,1,1,15 November 2014
The Avengers," Flawlessly Assembled
","A lot of comic-book fans including myself have wondered how can having six larger than life superheroes in one film possibly work? Will they be distributed with the right amount of screen time? Can there be a cohesive story to tell? Will there be plenty of action and visuals? The list of questions goes on and on.Fortunately I can tell you that the hardcore fanboys can put their pitchforks down as writer and director Joss Whedon pulls off a magnificent achievement by bringing the right amount of stability in this superhero circus, engineered to please the fanboys and nonfans alike.The film has a simple storyline, but it's very well-paced filled with adrenaline and streams very nicely. However, it's not the story that makes the film so great, but rather the characters instead. The script written by Joss Whedon never forgets its heroes' humanity as the film explores each characters with a lot of depth with reasons for doing why they're doing what they're doing. The story reconnects us with each character but also finds the time to flesh out each characters strengths and weaknesses, with some wonderful moments of insecurity throughout.Loki, the film's villain is brilliantly portrayed by Tom Hiddleston as a cunning, mischievous, and evil mastermind. Chris Evans solidifies his role as Captain America, Chris Hemsworth portrays a more noble, less arrogant Thor. Mark Ruffalo one of the characters I was worried about during the hype train of this film, went beyond my expectations. He delivers a new kind of Bruce Banner and I would argue the Hulk steals this film. There's also a lovely banter between Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye and Scarlet Johansson's Black Widow, Whedon treats them with respect and they do earn their place in the team. As for Robert Downey Jr., well do I really need to tell you he's awesome as always? Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury is finally able to stretch his legs than being just the guy making surprise appearances as he is able to slide into the role quite effortlessly. Clark Gregg's Agent Coulson returns and provides sharp dialog in the film. Cobie Smulders also makes her Marvel film debut as Agent Maria Hill who is Nick Fury's second in command. The visuals are great, as expected, the overall look of the Hulk is very impressive. I loved how ILM modeled it to look like a mixture of Mark Ruffalo, and Jack Kirby's interpretation in the comics.We get a lot of action beats, and a good amount of time is spent on having the heroes talk trash and square off against each other to prove who's the toughest. There's Iron Man vs. Thor, Hawkeye vs. Black Widow, Thor vs. Hulk, and so on. These showdowns allow each character to have their time in the spotlight, and they do build genuine tension. The last 20- 30 minutes of this film is worth the ticket itself. Whedon provides plenty of jaw-dropping action sequences. Though this is a comic-book film, there is a great sense of subtlety and the film explores that. Let's be honest, in many different ways, this movie should not have worked at all. There are too many larger than life characters to juggle and quite frankly it's ridiculous. Joss Whedon's brilliant script has a strong and unique theme of family dynamics. Ultimately these people don't belong together and the whole movie is about finding themselves from community. While doing so they not only realize that they belong together but they need each other. Obviously this is expressed through punching, but that essence is the heart of the film.As a comic-book fan I went into The Avengers with unfairly high expectations, due to all the people who were involved in the project as well as the films that came before. Give massive credit to Joss Whedon and Kevin Feige. The Avengers is a visual spectacle, but it's also a film with brains and heart. At a running-time of two and a half hours, the film is well paced and time flies by. So in every regard, the movie fulfills its hype and raises the bar even higher for Marvel and other superhero films to come and my childhood is avenged.10/10",10,4,7,1 August 2014
Star Trek," A Thrill Ride.
","When I first heard of this project, I initially disliked the idea because, I naively thought the old cast and crew of the original series or the Next Generation cast will return to the screen. Also another reason why I was turned off by it was because I had seen a couple of Star Trek films(did not watch the show) both original and Next Generation and I really didn't enjoy most of them, they just didn't do it for me. However after seeing the trailers, it peaked my interest, and then I saw the film, and man was I dead wrong. This movie is awesome. Director J.J. Abrams revives this franchise with much needed flare. I understand there are some die-hard Star Trek fans out there that weren't okay with the fact that they used the time- traveling story device to throw aways almost 50 years of canon, but honestly I was totally fine with it. I absolutely ate up everyone's performances. Chris Pine is sharp, full of wit and charisma with his Kirk. He evokes the iconic captain without a Shatner impression. Zachary Quinto is great as Spock, displaying his conflict as he is also half human, concealing his emotions. Pine and Quinto both emulate the Kirk and Spock relationship very well and brings more depth and complexity starting off as rivals.Zoe Saldana brings the emotional support and is a strong female character, however I did find the romance between her and Spock a tad bit awkward at times. Simon Pegg and Karl Urban bring out the best humor among the crew with their dialog and delivery in their respective roles as Scotty and 'Bones' McCoy. John Cho and Anton Yelchin provide good supporting roles as Sulu and Chekov, they both play an integral part within the crew of the Enterprise. Bruce Greenwood is great as Captain Pike and provides a mentor-like relationship with Pine's Kirk. Eric Bana as Nero is the weakest part in the film. Bana's performance is fine for the most part, although his delivery here and there was a bit dry, however the major flaw is that his character is a bit underdeveloped. I also questioned his tactics and logic within the film, I don't understand why he had to wait almost twenty-five years for Spock Prime(a role reprised by Leonard Nimoy) to take his revenge, or drill a hole to actually launch the red matter that creates a black hole. The visuals are incredible, the USS Enterprise looked great, all the action set pieces are gorgeously shot. Abrams also uses a lot of lens flares but it only enhances the visual appeal, although he could have toned it down a little. The films is about a little over two hours but it does not feel like it, the pacing is incredibly fast and flows very elegantly. Give credit to J.J. Abrams for reigniting this franchise and to his crew, especially his writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. Do yourself a favor and watch it. It's very entertaining, full of fun, and a visual spectacle. 8.8/10",8,1,1,17 September 2014
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Puts actual war into Star Wars.
","This is Star WARS. This is the story of Jyn Erso(Felicity Jones) and a squad of rebellions led by Cassian Andor(Diego Luna) to steal the Death Star plans setting up the events of A New Hope(or rather the original Star Wars). Right from the get-go there are plenty of Star Wars fan service and references in the film. It's very hard to miss them if you're invested in this universe as any other Star Wars fan. However, if you're a newbie, it may confuse you and some of the new/younger viewers. At this point, it's no secret that Darth Vader is in the film. He's not in it a lot, but he scenes are quite memorable. He absolutely wrecks the rebels when he invades the Tantive V ship and it's quite frightening as he tears through a squadron of rebels with absolute ease, blocking every shot with his lightsaber and using his force powers to take them out. The late Peter Cushing's iconic role of Grand Moff Tarkin returns to the big screen, as director Gareth Edwards and ILM digitally recreated the actor. One could say this is disrespectful, but is it truly? Tupac was a hologram at a coachella concert, and there are plenty of celebrity impersonators, impersonating other dead celebrities. Paul Walker who recently passed in a car accident three years ago was also digitally recreated to send off his character in Furious 7. Marlon Brando's Jor-El was brought back for Superman Returns. The actor's estate more than likely provided the green light so they certainly wouldn't have a problem with it. The point is, controversial or not, Cushing himself and his character has been immortalized on film. I don't have a problem with this as long as it's not overused and only used to serve the film. Princess Leia returns to the screen as she is completely CGI in the film. I will admit the digitally rendered faces were distracting in certain scenes, especially Tarkin's but I will say that the de-aging technology is just one step away from being perfect. The pacing is slow. It did take a lot of time setting things up and getting things in place for the final act to unfold, but when it unfolds, that's where it all pays off. While the references are neat, it's all the film relies on to keep the slow set up entertaining. I also did find Forest Whitaker's Saw Gerrera to be a bit over the top. He doesn't have much screen time at all to be honest so his exit didn't mean much to the film. For those who watch the Star Wars Clone Wars and Rebels animated series might get a kick out of his character, but for those who don't might not even care. The main spotlights in the film are Felicity Jones and Diego Luna. With these particular Star Wars characters, they have a lot of emotional baggage. The weight on their shoulders are felt through and through as they've made choices that they're not proud of, particularly Cassian who's been in the fight since he was young and every hard decision he's made, he made for the rebellion. The absence of Jedi in the film also gave Star Wars a new outlook. It proves that a Star Wars movie without the Jedi can be made and be made well. Other supporting cast members Donnie Yen, Wen Jiang, Riz Ahmed, and Mads Mikkelsen do their job competently. Ben Mendelsohn does an excellent job portraying Orson Krennic, an ruthless and ambitious Imperial Director, responsible for apprehending Mikkelsen's character Galen Erso the father of Jyn, forcing him to create the Death Star. Alan Tudyk's blunt and unnecessarily honest droid, K-2SO brings a lot of humor into the mix, providing the right amount of levity in a bleak film. Not all of these characters have a lot of screen time, but Gareth Edwards uses them effectively to serve the plot, making you care about them as the story unfolds. With that being said, if you're a Star Wars fan, you saw their deaths coming, but because the script treats them as real characters for the most part, instead of fodder it is upsetting to see them die. You truly feel what's at stake. I applaud Kathleen Kennedy, Gareth Edwards, and Disney, they were not afraid to pull any punches. This is a war film, and in war, not everyone lives. Sacrifices have to be made.Rogue One is a more 'grown up' Star Wars feature. It's darker, more dry on humor, more violent, and morally ambiguous. But most importantly, it a breath of fresh air because of it. It isn't without it's issues, but its a new outlook and a new feel to the Star Wars franchise. I look forward to more spin-offs. 8.3/10",8,3,8,24 December 2016
Captain Marvel," Great characters, muddled pacing.
","Just right off the bat, I can tell that with more appearances in the future, Captain Marvel will truly come into her own. I would argue a lot of MCU heroes struggled to have a perfect 'batting average' in their first outing. Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Doctor Strange, some of the Guardians all more or less had an okay to average beginning. Not every character can hit immediately like Downey Jr.'s Iron Man or Evans' Captain America, but with more appearances they became more and more better. I think the same applies to Carol Danvers.The characters are great, but there are some problems within the film. It's very muddled and disjointed in the first and middle act, and to be honest the story is pretty basic and by the books. But it picks up steam near the end and flows a lot better. Characters and the character moments are really what salvage the film overall.Brie Larson is very good as Carol Danvers. I like this everywoman quality about her, the film doesn't make a point about her being an attractive woman, she's just a weird and kinda quirky superhero, with a bit of sass, which was nice to see. Her dynamic with Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury is dynamite. Jackson also has a lot of fun with a cat named Goose, which I believe will be everyone's favorite aspect of the film. Lashana Lynch is also great. She has a nice tender moment with Carol in the film.The main surprise, but it shouldn't have been is Ben Mendelsohn. Pretty much hijacked the film for his performance as Talos the Skrull leader. The Skurlls themselves looked great as well. Jude Law has meaty role and also shares nice banter between himself and Carol. I can't say the same for the Starforce Team. I would have liked to explore Hala and the world of the Kree a little more than what the film offers.I was also disappointed in Clark Gregg's and Lee Pace's roles. I obviously knew they weren't going to be large, but I expected more from them. Especially Lee Pace. Being that I am a fan of his performance as Ronan in Guardians Vol. 1, I really thought we'd get just a little more on his backstory. I believe a lot was cut from the film as there were set photos of Pace, Law and Larson together at one point.Also there are some cool and neat twists and turns within the film. Being that I am a fan of comics, I was able to piece it all together quite quickly, but I liked how they handled it. Not exactly comic-accurate but it was a nice reveal.For the record I have no problem with CAPTAIN MARVEL, none of which involved the ridiculous hate the fans expressed. Brie Larson is her own person with her own beliefs, and if you carefully exam her quotes, she doesn't mean any malicious intent. She probably could have handled or worded it better. The media and the toxic fans can easily take her quotes of context. Haters will hate.However I had only one concern and that concern is that she can't be the reason why Thanos is defeated. I trust the Russo Brothers to not make her the savior of AVENGERS ENDGAME. It would cheapen the ORIGINAL SIX - Cap, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, & Hawkeye who started the MCU together. Certainly she can absolutely have her moment and she absolutely should kick major ass, but...INFINITY WAR strongly sets up Tony Stark as the key figure that Doctor Strange gives up the time stone to save. Stark is more important than an infinity stone. ENDGAME sets up an intense and emotional arc for Steve Rogers a man who gave everything up, his own life, his own time, and his own love for the world. It has to be the original six, especially Stark and Rogers, as the MCU revolves around Iron Man and Captain America. It is closure to two of the greatest characters to ever grace the Marvel screen whom we invested with for 10 years as it is quite possibly their last hoorah. They deserve this more than Captain Marvel, Ant-Man, Doctor Strange, etc.I only say this because, when she eventually masters her abilities it came across too easily. She is quite powerful a little too fast, and dare I say it, it is almost within the same territory as Rey from STAR WARS. Directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck do a commendable job, but like Ryan Coogler and others, the character dynamic and the character moments shine, but the action is severely lacking. Yes there are some cool moments, but we've seen it all before. There is nothing truly memorable compared to what the Russo Brothers are able to do in their films, and even Whedon and Gunn to an extent.To sum it up, it's a Phase 1 film in a Phase 3 slate. Like I said before, the MCU struggled to their characters going with the exception of Iron Man and Captain America, but I think with more appearances from her will definitely help. If we're comparing, DC's Wonder Woman did it better, but it's a good start for Carol. I don't have to tell you to stick around till the end. You really don't want to miss it.6/10",6,7,19,8 March 2019
Star Trek Into Darkness," Did anyone actually think Cumberbatch wasn't the villain we all guessed it'd be?
","Even better a second time around. Let me begin by saying this film is worth seeing Benedict Cumberbatch's performance alone. As Khan, Cumberbatch is a force to be reckon with. His portrayal is just as, and might I say, in my opinion even more sinister and than Ricardo Montalban's portrayal. Cumberbatch totally holds his own, going head to toe with Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto. Unlike the first film, the villain here does not suffer from any lack of character development. In just a few dialogs delivered by Cumberbatch, we know who he is, what he wants, who he hates, and why he's doing what he's doing. All played out and executed in a short amount of time with no tedious origin story. Every time Cumberbatch is on screen he brings such a presence and a commanding force with his deep voice and his villainous aura. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto are terrific again and their friendship are taken to the next, more complex level, rather than re-hashing their bickering in the first film. We see a natural progression of their relationship as Spock is always calculating and using logic over anything else, while Kirk does what he feels is right. It's very well displayed when Kirk saves Spock from an erupting volcano, disobeying protocol and allowing an un-advanced alien species to see a star-ship rise above the ocean. They both have a very emotional scene as Kirk sacrifices himself to revitalize the warp core of the ship. Both actors display their fine acting chops in this particular scene, that you can't help but choke up a little. The rest of cast is great as always, Saldana has an awesome moment with the Klingons speaking their language. Cho as Sulu also has a great moment on the captain's chair, Yelchin as Chekov is promoted to engineer as Scotty, portrayed by Pegg is relieved. Speaking of Simon Pegg, he does a lot more here than he did in the first film. Karl Urban again channels DeForest Kelly very well and brings out the best witty one-liners with a lot of metaphors. Peter Weller who plays Admiral Marcus, ends up being the main villain, which to me was a great surprise. It only makes Khan, in some way justifiable for his actions. Alice Eve is a welcome addition as Carol Marcus, Kirk's future love interest. This time around, there is much more tension and more escalation. Every action beat makes you tense up and anticipate the overall result. Again the visuals look great, and the warp scenes were fantastic this time around. Watching this film in IMAX 3D was visually stimulating. Gorgeously shot, and felt very grand and immersive. Star Trek Into Darkness works very well as a sequel, give credit to J.J. Abrams and the writers Kurtzman, Orci, and Lindelof, as references to Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is present, but they are aware of the line between re-imagined homage and direct ripoff.The only problem I had with this film is that when it ends it tries to wrap everything up so quickly that the ending feels very abrupt. Nevertheless, Benedict Cumberbatch kills it as Khan, I think everyone who's seen this film can agree to that. 9.2/10",9,2,3,17 September 2014
Spider-Man 2," The best one out of the trilogy.
","Sequels are very tricky. They're very hard to crack open, but every so often we do get a sequel that is better than the original like Empire Strikes Back, The Godfather Part II, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Aliens, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, The Dark Knight, and others. Spider-Man 2 is one of them. The common thing among mostly all sequels is that bigger is better, that's not always the case, and that's where director Sam Raimi comes in, he does the opposite. He makes it smaller, more personal, but with big impactful moments. Here we see a damaged Peter Parker, still full of guilt with the death of Uncle Ben, he's getting fired all the time and late to school because he's busy protecting New York as Spider-Man. His relationship between Harry and Mary Jane are deteriorating as he keeps disappointing them. In the end, he gives up his duties as Spider-Man, only to return to action when Doctor Octopus is threatening the city. This movie in many ways is a coming of age story for Peter Parker. With a moving romantic subplot, Peter learns to accept his responsibilities as Spider-Man in the long run, and puts that first above all his desires including Mary Jane, and he also finds closure by telling Aunt May the truth about what happened on the night of Uncle Ben's murder. Tobey Maguire brings much depth and complexity to Peter Parker. A very fine performance by him showcasing the right amount of emotion in every single scene. Alfred Molina is excellent here as Dr. Otto Octavius, also known as Doctor Octopus, whom Peter deems as his idol in the beginning of the film. What makes him such as awesome and likable villain, is that film allows you to like him from the beginning, and to see his downfall to villainy, then to a redeemable hero at the end makes an engaging story. Give credit to Raimi and his writing team, as they provide Doc Ock much needed flare. Kirsten Dunst here is pretty good as Mary Jane. Peter and Mary Jane also get a lot time bickering at each other here. It's a very complicated and complex romance as she wants Peter and Peter wants her, but he can't cause of his duties as a crime-fighter. James Franco is great playing the a-hole friend. As an audience member it's very sad to see their friendship deteriorate as Harry questions Peter's loyalty to him or to Spider-Man. The action serves the story here, it seamlessly transitions to action set pieces while still serving the narrative. Not to mention they are awesome. All the fights between Spidey and Doc Ock are an adrenaline rush, particularly the subway train fight. But with that being said, if you took out all the action sequences in this movie, you still have a very intriguing and moving story to watch. That's how good this film is. Raimi and his crew of filmmakers did a tremendous job with Spider-Man 2. There are real human moments in this film, one of them involves Spidey and a group of civilians in the train. A real nice, tender, and human scene. Rosemary Harris as Aunt May even has a substantial role in the film as Peter's moral compass and she also has an action sequence in the middle of the film. J.K. Simmons is even better as J. Jonah Jameson this time around and has the film's funniest moments. Everything in this film clicks on all cylinders. The music by Danny Elfman is better than ever, and also provides the film with lots of tender scores. The visual effects are better, Spidey's web-swinging abilities are better, the romance is better, the action is better, the sound mixing and editing is better, the story, the acting, just everything. It's pretty much a perfect film. I for one thought it deserved just a little bit more from the Academy Awards other than winning the well deserved special effects award. 10/10",10,13,19,28 September 2014
Spider-Man 3," A disappointing third entry.
","Massively disappointing. It's so disappointing that it hurts. Spider-Man 3 to me, I like to compare it to an ex-girlfriend of sorts, there are some things that I liked about it, but a lot more things hate about it. This film tries too hard and tries too much. As some of you may know Raimi envisioned a different film for Spider-Man 3. I can't help but ponder how that would have turned out. The plot here isn't the real the problem, I was able to follow the story without any confusion. I understood where the story was going, so the basic plot points is not the film's biggest problem. It's the characters and their actions. The first two films have logic and plausibility to every character's actions, in this one there isn't. There's a lot of miscommunications in this film. For instance why doesn't Mary Jane tell Peter she got fried from the play? Why doesn't she just talk to him about it? Why doesn't Harry's butler tell Harry from the first place that his father died by his own hands? Why does Flint Marko(Sandman) willingly join Eddie Brock(Venom) to kill Spider-Man, after he claimed he's not a bad person? All this was just very hard to follow, and you question why they would make these choices? It was very frustrating to watch. If it weren't for some of the story elements and the cool action sequences, there wouldn't be anything pleasing to watch at all. Firstly I did somewhat enjoy Maguire's performance this time around. The very first time he puts on the black suit, he was pretty intimidating, taking out Sandman with no mercy, whom he thought he killed. I liked the contrast of personalities within him here and there, beating up Harry and having no problem throwing the pumpkin bomb right at his face, or the scene where he humiliates Eddie Brock for exposing his flaws in front of the whole Daily Bugle staff. But it all went down hill when he had his, not one, but two moments where he can show off his extremely lame dancing moves. Kirsten Dunst is so hate-able in this film, you'll wonder why anyone bothers to save her, let alone imagine what Peter sees in her in the first place. I guess in a way I have to give credit to Dunst performance because she did a great job at portraying a bitchy and whiny Mary Jane. Rosemary Harris is alright this time around, and J.K. Simmons is always great as J. Jonah Jameson. As for Gwen Stacy, portrayed by Bryce Dallas Howard, well she was just a throw away character, didn't care for her at all and that's not Howard's fault. Now lets talk about the villains, I for one enjoyed James Franco as Harry. I liked the completed Osborn arc we got in this film. I liked the fact he got amnesia and we got to see the Harry prior to his father's death. Granted it's not exactly the way it was in the comics, but I thought it brought something new to the table and was an acceptable change. I firmly enjoyed Thomas Haden Church as Sandman, but I feel as though Raimi tried to rehash what he did with Alfred Molina's Doctor Octopus. It has a been there and done that feel. As for Topher Grace who plays Eddie Brock/Venom, well it's a massive disservice to one of Spider-Man's most popular foe. I didn't mind Grace in the role of Brock, I like the contrast between him and Peter, but it was the way they handled Venom. Just not enough screen time to really do him justice, shouldn't have been in the film at all. Although I must complement his overall physical appearance, he looked great. Spider-Man 2 was too good, and Spider-Man 3 tries too hard to be as good as Spider-Man 2. All Spider-Man 3 had to be was just good, a decent follow-up to the second film. And from the early stages it looked that way. I also stated that the the first film in the series has a bit of a cheesy factor, well in this one it's over the top. There are too many civilians applauding, cheering, and mourning for Spider-Man, out of place cut-scenes of the kids commenting on the final battle at the end, and too many musical numbers. I have the concept art book for this film, and there were so many scenes left on the cutting room floor. Very similar to the Spider-Man 3 video game, it involves Sandman's daughter Penny, Venom kidnapped her, blackmailing Sandman to help him defeat Spider-Man. I personally thought this was a better way to execute the film cause again, Sandman in the beginning claimed he's not a bad person, and in the theatrical cut of this film he just agrees to help Venom. There were also extended scenes of Eddie Brock heading over to the church and a scene where he sees Gwen after he gets fired, but finds out that she's going out with Peter. A tender scene with Sandman and his daughter where he transforms as a sandcastle with his wife present. I feel as though Raimi made a mistake cutting these scenes and changing up the climax. What he could have done was cut out all those dancing sequences and put those scenes in. I don't personally blame all of it on Raimi, but also the studio and the producers who forced Venom and Gwen Stacy down his throat. He does the best he can do and tries to please everyone, but in the end it's a disjointed entry compared to the two superior installments. 5.7/10",5,1,5,28 September 2014
Thor: Ragnarok," 'Hela' fun, despite some inconsistencies.
","I always felt that Thor himself is a character who for the most part was handled decently, but his movies were a mess and not exactly the MCU's best outings. Branagh and Taylor brought their own spin on it, but out of them, I felt that Joss Whedon got him the best. He's not supposed to be taken too seriously as he is an Asgardian God of Thunder after all. I felt Whedon balanced that along with some gravitas more coherently. With being said Captain America and Iron Man have had their limelight, and Thor for the most part has not. His movies are mediocre compared to Cap's trilogy or the first Iron Man film. I think Kevin Feige and Taika Waititi were aware of this problem. What Captain America: The Winter Soldier and the first Iron Man did to those characters, Thor Ragnarok does the exact same to Thor. Feige, Waititi, and Hemsworth reinvents the character and it feels very refreshing. It is definitely the best entry to Thor's trilogy. As a movie going experience, it's entertaining as hell. It's fun, funny, and hip, but as a comic-book fan, the film does take liberties with source materials from great Marvel stories and crams it in all together. While I do think that any movie that is based off of source materials should take liberties in order to fit better for the big screen, I happened to not agree with some of the things they changed in the film. It wasn't exactly what wanted, but for the most part it's handled with care. The cast is great and they look like they're having a blast. Hemsworth and Hiddleston can play these roles in their sleep at this point. They both own the roles and embody them better than ever. The brotherly relationship is still effective. Thor even points out that Loki is still being himself, and will probably never change. Ruffalo also could play his role in his sleep. Hulk can talk now and he's developed his own personality. He has the vocabulary of a three year old and certainly acts like one. The Hulk vs Thor fight recaptured the novelty of when I first saw those two fight each other in the first Avengers film. It's definitely of one the highlight action set pieces of the movie. It's staged well in a gladiator like arena and this time they don't hold back. Their banter is also fun to watch. Jeff Goldblum is a delight as the Grandmaster. He's kinda acting like his real life self and hopefully we'll see him and his brother in a scene one day. The female characters were always lacking the Thor films aside from Lady Sif. Tessa Thompson is a welcome addition. What I also admired is that Waititi and his team, despite her being a badass, don't let her become some redundant romantic interest. They just have a mutual respect for each other. Some of the side characters are also fun, including Waititi himself who portrays Korg, a rock like being with very humorous quips. Speaking of female characters, Cate Blanchett commands the screen as Hela. She does make one heck of an entrance (even though it was shown in the trailers). She brings Asgard to it's demise and she puts up a really good fight against Thor. Unfortunately it still does not solve Marvel's villain problem. Her story seemed like it was at the end of the spectrum. Her role seemed a little lost compared to the other moving parts of the film. Piggy backing off that, while this movie is relentlessly entertaining, I felt that it was missing some weight. Even though the action is amplified and the stakes are there, I never felt a sense of danger or tension. Some of the comedy also was a bit of a miss, although Goldblum's Grandmaster and Waititi's Korg never missed the mark. It doesn't exactly go to the level of the annoying humor Guardians Vol. 2 had, but it was pretty close. Blanchett helped eased some of the jokiness but a little more weight would have been more engaging for me. Despite all that, third time really is the charm for Thor. Despite some changes I don't particularly like and the crammed in story lines from other amazing comics, it's still a fun ride. But what really got my jitters going was the mid credit scene. Avengers: Infinity War cannot get here sooner. It's going to be a long wait. 8/10",8,2,5,3 November 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Welcome back Spider-Man, welcome back.
","I loved Spidey's introduction in Captain America: Civil War, but maybe ten minutes into Spider-Man: Homecoming there is a montage where Peter Parker is doing his Spidey stuff around NY after school with Blitzkrieg Bop playing in the background, and it was at that moment, I finally felt like Spider-Man is truly home.Sitting through origin stories can be a chore, and here Kevin Feige, Amy Pascal, writers Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley, and director Jon Watts don't let the audience relive that familiar tale. They drop us right in the middle of it and it's relentless in proceeding the story from start to finish in a good way. It's a long movie, but it's fast paced and a joy to sit through. They do a great job juggling multiple story lines and it never felt jumbled or hard to follow. The world ending trope is not evident in the film, its a more scaled down adventure, similar to Ant-Man. There are as many high-school/John Hughes scenes as there are with the action sequences. Easter eggs in the film are subtle and great fun, they're not as distracting as one would expect them to be. Also, for the record I can watch Captain America PSA's all day. I said back in my Captain America: Civil War review that within ten minutes of screen time, Marvel Studios does exactly what Sony failed to do with their last three Spider-Man films. Tom Holland is terrific. He flourishes in this role and I can see that he gave it his all. His charisma oozes off screen and in the scenes where things get serious he's able to show off his acting chops. He's impatient, energetic, a bit naive and super young. I yearned for high school Spidey in films and finally we have continuing stories that take place in high school and an actor who looks the part, and doesn't look old. Holland combines the best of both Maguire and Garfield, with a bit of Michael J. Fox's Marty McFly, resulting in what I think is the best film iteration of Peter Parker/Spider-Man to date. So far in Phase 3, every Marvel villain felt like a step forward. While they didn't solve their villain issues, they made small steps to fixing it with each Phase 3 film. Here they finally deliver. Of all villains The Vulture is easily one of the MCU's best villains on film since maybe Loki and Winter Soldier. Michael Keaton delivers, and what makes his performance so great is that he plays it subtly. It's not over the top, it's muted, and more low-key. As someone who owned a business trying to clean up after the mess the Avengers leave all over the world, Damage Control and Tony Stark took over, leaving him nothing. He turns to the life of crime, picking up leftovers from any superhero battles, turning them into weapons to sell on the black market with his crew so he can get by living life and providing for his family. That is a motivation I can get by and understand.He has great exchanges with Holland throughout. One of my favorite moments in the film is when and he tells him that he's young and he just doesn't understand how the world works. This got me thinking, if this were an older Peter Parker, he'd probably understand where he's coming from and they would maybe be having a different conversation. The supporting cast are terrific. I don't really need to elaborate Downey Jr. at this point. He always brings it every time. Stark is used effectively and for those worried that he might overshadow Spidey, he really doesn't. As shown in the trailers, Stark ridicules him for being ignorant during the ferry incident and it's nice to see Tony Stark in a mentor role giving him only new things to do. Great to see Favreau back as Happy Hogan and he gets some good moments throughout. Marisa Tomei is not the typical Aunt May we see in the comics or in the other Spider-Man films. She's more involved and kind of a cooler, hip aunt. The film also has fun with the fact that she is a very attractive woman. Keaton's crew in the film are also good, they don't have huge roles, but they have something to do in the film. The film treats them as characters as opposed to disposable henchmen for the most part. The kids in the film are also fun. Jacob Batalon is Ned, Peter's best friend and they're a hoot. The budding romance between Peter and Liz is also well done and not overplayed. Laura Harrier does a good job projecting a personality of a popular, but friendly and humble girl. Zendaya also scores some decent laughs as a rebel student similar of Ally Sheedy's Allison Reynolds from The Breakfast Club. Tony Revolori is a different incarnation of Flash Thompson. Being a comic-book conservative, in truth I was let down by the fact that we wouldn't get something similar of Chris Zylka's Flash from the Andrew Garfield series, but after digesting everything Revolori was quite good and the new approach they took won me over. Occasionally the film stumbles a tad, for instance Ned can get a little too annoying at times. Some of the cgi effects didn't look as polished as I had hope, but it's not distracting where I'd be taken out of the film. Tonally, having Peter Parker actually enjoy being Spider-Man brought a breath of fresh air. That in it of itself is the best thing about Spider-Man: Homecoming. It's a colorful adventure that fits with the rest of the MCU without getting bogged down with franchising. He's home and it's good to have him home. 9.5/10",9,50,93,7 July 2017
Suicide Squad," So far, one of this year's worst.
","Ugh. What a waste. It's baffling how the marketing of this film, especially the trailers sold me on how fun and exciting this movie looked. Whoever cut those trailers absolutely deserves an Academy Award. To make this garbage of a film look any good must have been quite a feat. Lets get straight to it, the whole film is about a team that unwillingly comes together by the shady side of the government in a really long and drawn out series of flashbacks and origin hoopla that has you so bored that you end up wondering what the movie is about. Oh yeah and there's this lame witch villain, Enchantress that is handled so very poorly.On top of it, there's an unnecessary Joker & Harley Quinn romance stuff going on, which weirdly doesn't end up involving anyone else. It's like a strange side story that happens while the main story is going on. It's giant narrative mess. It's very choppy, very muddled, and doesn't do a good job explaining anything within the middle of the action. There's no sense of danger and the film shoehorns in forced humor, therefore making tonal inconsistencies that took me out of the film every so often. It's very clear that WB banked on Will Smith's star power, and the popularity of Harley Quinn. Aside from those two and maybe El Diablo, Rick Flagg and Amanda Waller, no one else has anything to do. More time could have been developed for other members of the squad, but they're just in the background. I got to sympathize with Deadshot the most, but I wasn't really captivated because it was exactly the role I expected him to play. Jared Leto, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis and the others do the best with what they're given, but ultimately decent acting from some of the cast members won't change the fact that it's a terrible disjointed film. Clara Delevingne's Enchantress was a monumental waste of a villain. The script just uses her as that tried trope of a world ending threat that we've seen so many times. The film does nothing new with it, nor does it try to do it well, even if it is a familiar trope. Her acting was just so atrocious and laughable. As stated above, Jared Leto's Joker doesn't have much to do. His arc of the film with Harley has nothing to do with the main story so it's just a distraction. I had no problem with his portrayal, but the film really did not need him at all. For me David Ayer is a hit or miss. While I have enjoyed a few of his previous works, especially End of Watch, he failed to deliver with this film. It's lazily written, with terrible dialog, the story is incredibly choppy, and even the action sequences disappoint. Don't even get me started on the finale. It's half-assed and so anti-climactic. There was no sense of danger or any tension. Ayer once mentioned how we will see the squad bond with their hatred of Batman, and that we will get the villain's perspective on Batman, but aside from Deadshot, that wasn't really explored at all. Also those eyeball creatures, they were lame. I mean visually was that really the best the filmmakers could come up with? I don't want to make comparisons, but this film made me realize and appreciate what Guardians of the Galaxy accomplished. Taking a bunch of C/D-list characters that aren't the best people in the world, and making something out of them. I don't want to start a fanboy war, but it amazes me that Marvel Studios who have been at such disadvantage since the start, pull off what they did. Making films that are at the very least entertaining is quite impressive, compared to WB/DC that have had the film rights to these properties for such a long time. I don't mind that they're playing catch up but there's a way to do them well. It is very discouraging as a comic-book fan in general, but I'm still hoping that DC's future will take into shape. I've made it clear that I am not a DC hater. I've stated numerous times I loved Man of Steel. I saw it five times in theaters and could not anticipate DC's future, but so far I was disappointed by Batman v Superman, now today, I am massively letdown by Suicide Squad. I'm hoping Patty Jenkins Wonder Woman will change my tune and that Snyder will deliver with Justice League. At the end of the day it's all subjective. If you enjoyed this movie, more power to you, my review doesn't make me the end all be all. But, aside from some okay performances, a very tiny Batman role, and a cool surprise appearance from another DC hero, you should save your money. Just go see a decent summer film like Star Trek Beyond or Lights Out. Or just go watch Captain America: Civil War and Deadpool, comic-book films done extremely right. 4/10",4,12,26,5 August 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Best of Phase 2, a real smart superhero film.
","Lets get this out of the way, this is by far, the best Marvel Phase 2 film, and the best solo film all around since the first Iron Man(2008). I had my slight skepticism from Joe and Anthony Russo, but these guys totally nailed it as did the writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. The cast is all around great. The heart and soul of this movie is on the shoulders of Chris Evans and he carries it so strongly, as Captain America would. He owns this role and captures his struggles to adjust in the modern world very well. Scarlett Johansson is great as ever as Black Widow. Anthony Mackie is so charismatic as Sam Wilson aka the Falcon adding subtle comedy in the film, but not overdoing it. He and Cap show a nice banter as they are both soldiers and have things in common to a certain degree. Sam Jackson and Robert Redford provide excellent supporting roles. Cobie Smulders has a little more to do in this film than she did in The Avengers. Sebastian Stan is actually pretty terrifying as the Winter Soldier, though he does not have a big amount of screen time and is least developed, but his presence is strong and he makes his mark every time he's on screen. The story is compelling and hooks you in from the start. Compared to other Phase 2 films, this film doesn't feel like 'another' movie. It's interconnected and serves and actual plot for the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Again give credit to the writers. There are also neat twists and turns for those who haven't read the comics, but for those who did, it'll just leave you with anticipation to see where the story progresses. The action here is amazing. It's so well coordinated and intense. There's lots of gritty hand to hand fighting. I'd say I liked the action sequences in this film more than The Avengers. If anyone doubts the Russo brothers shooting action, well go see this film. It's action packed. The car chase sequences are top notch and the climax of this film is filled with adrenaline. A highpoint is the use of the Falcon wings. They worked so well on screen and it didn't feel ridiculous. The Winter Soldier has an awesome look and his arm is so cool. Looked amazing and sounded amazing. I compare this film to Alien and Aliens. There is a tonal tone difference between the first film and this film and it works so well. Better action and engaging story. A lot of groundwork is laid for the Avengers sequel and possibly the third Cap film, especially for characters portrayed by Frank Grillo(Rumlow) and Emily Van Camp(Sharon Carter). As always with any Marvel movie, stay after the credits, there are two scenes, you'll definitely want too. The 'Age of Miracles.' Oh man..super pumped. 9.2/10",9,3,6,1 August 2014
Doctor Strange," Familiar origin story, but with a lot of awesome magic.
","Marvel finally embraces its magic and mysticism and it delivers. I had a blast with this film, but however it felt way too familiar. Beat for beat it's as if it used the first Iron Man as a blueprint, with minor subtle differences, the obvious being the usage of sorcery and magic. Strange in a way goes through the same journey Tony Stark does in the first Iron Man film. He's an arrogant fellow learning to grow and become a better person.The cast carries this film. Benedict Cumberbatch was born to play this role and very much looks the part as he does in the comics. I'm glad director Scott Derrickson and Kevin Feige postponed the film so Benedict can take on the role. The character of Stephen Strange and Tony Stark share some familiar traits, and even sport a similar mustache style. Compared to Downey's Stark, Cumberbatch downplays the swagger, and elevates the egotistical side. His ex-girlfriend Christine Palmer played by Rachel McAdams is the one who grounds him, almost like Pepper Potts. She has nice tender moments, despite the short screen time she had. Speaking of short screen time, I wished Mads Mikkelson's Kaecilius had more. The problem is just screen time, because like Zemo in Captain America: Civil War, I did not feel like he was underdeveloped. I got his point and why he was doing what he was doing. It made sense in my mind, but I just wished there were more scenes of him. Tilda Swinton effortlessly delivers her lines of wisdom and knowledge as the Ancient One, she and Doctor Strange have a that nice teacher and student banter. Chiwetel Ejiofor's Mordo has a nice arc set up for him to become the next villain, and I'm happy it wasn't rushed. He is a by the books kind of person and the situations he goes through will change the way he looks at things around him forever. I'm also happy that Benedict Wong's Wong wasn't a typical Asian manservant. Aside from the cast, the action sequences, and the visual effects downplay the familiar story beats. Watching Strange go through dimension after dimension, it was as if the Steve Ditko pages were brought to life and that made me geek out pretty hard. The usage of the Eye of Agamotto was effective and cool. It turned out to be the item I thought it'd be and the idea of bending time to your own will is one of the coolest aspects of the film. Also a villain I sort of, but also didn't expect to see was a nice touch and a nice surprise as well. The MCU is now fourteen movies in and Doctor Strange is a fine addition. Marvel Studios batting average is second to none and I absolutely look forward to more stories now that the origin is over with. But aside from it feeling a little too familiar, it's Benedict Cumberbatch who carries this film strongly. Not to mention Marvel embraces the magic and mysticism very well. The visuals and action are a thrill to watch. It's a mind trip. Make sure you do not leave your seat, there's more to come during the credits. Just don't leave, you can wait to go to the restroom in another ten minutes. Also try to see this film in a real 70mm IMAX screen, it's worth it.The doctor is in, and he's here to stay.8/10",8,3,7,4 November 2016
Interstellar," It's okay at best.
","Interstellar was one of my most anticipated films of 2014, and it is for a lack of a better word, underwhelming. I do like Christopher Nolan as a director, he's a great story teller and he knows how to make a movie. But this is two films in a row which I've been let down from him. Interstellar is not the massive dud that was The Dark Knight Rises. It's more of a mixed bag. What I loved in this film is the father and daughter relationship between Cooper and Murph. Matthew McConaughey and Mackenzie Foy provide the film's emotional impact. Their relationship is very tender and have a sweetness to them. It's great to watch and is arguably the film's strongest element. I liked everyone's performances all around, Interstellar contains more than a few strong performances. McConaughey is great, as he displays his fine acting and you feel sorry for this character leaving his children behind. The film provides another emotional punch when he watches video messages of his children Tom(Casey Affleck) and Murphy(Jessica Chastain) grow up over time. Hathaway is decent too, she's conflicted, and trying to keep her emotions at bay. Ellen Burstyn has a small role, but it's a good one too. Oh the two robot assistants TARS and CASE were very amusing to watch and provides some levity and humor to the film. The one that really stood out to me is Jessica Chastain. She is the one who shines bright. Her performance as the older Murph is very subtle and provides the right amount of emotion with each scene. I always thought Nolan's main weakness was his characterization on women, but that's starting to change. I strongly think she deserves an Oscar nomination at best.The visuals are spectacular. Each planet they visit to see if it's inhabitable for the human race is bafflingly stunning. The planet that was covered in water is my favorite out of the bunch. If you have the chance to see it, definitely check it out on IMAX. It's gorgeous to look at. Like the film Gravity, it's stunningly beautiful. The film is technically very well made and well shot, as expected in a Christopher Nolan film. The science isn't what bother's me in the film, it wasn't too hard to follow, in the end I got the gist of it. What bothered me was the mid to last half of the film. Although all the space scenes were great to look it, it provides some of the film's dullest moments with very dull dialog. Exposition is required in a film like this, but it was handled very clumsily, compared to Nolan's Inception and The Prestige. Without going too much in the spoiler zone, when Matt Damon's character shows up, immediately after his character is introduced I knew where the plot was headed. This is where I was really irritated in the film. The chunk of that film is very unnecessary and only slowed the film down for me. I thought it provided some very unnecessary conflict, and very much has a been there and done that feel to it. Towards the end I thought the conclusion of this film was pretty intriguing, and kind of wowed me in a way. I know some people out there are probably calling out it's scientific inaccuracy but I took it for what it was and it's quite cool how Nolan, his brother, and his crew were able to conclude the film with its overriding message about the powerful forces of the one thing we all know but can't measure in scientific terms. Love. It saved the film for me.6.8/10",6,2,4,9 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The damage done from the previous film couldn't be fixed.
","J.J. walked into a mess and all he could do is attempt to deliver an entertaining film. I can tell he tried to please everyone with a lot of fan service, and it can be somewhat pleasing. Although, there are A LOT of missed opportunities yet again. A bit unfulfilling as well (ahem Emperor Palpatine - it was so weird). Some really cool moments and some good scenes but overall it's like ten movies in one go and will be hard to follow if you're not immersed into the Star Wars universe.Whether or not you'll think this is better than THE LAST JEDI or not will be up to you. The film does somewhat disrespect THE LAST JEDI in different ways, like for example where Force Ghost Luke straight up tells Rey that he was wrong and that she needs to preserve the Jedi, or Kylo wearing his mask again, which I didn't mind. I guess I did find it more enjoyable mainly due to the action and lightsaber fights, but ultimately in my opinion there was no fixing what was already done and what I feared we'd end up with, we got - a jumbled plot crammed in with multiple subplots, plus heavy exposition that is masked with fan service and pretty decent action. They absolutely went with nostalgia as it tries to mask the franchise's misdirection to get brownie points for the disgruntled fans. It kinda worked, kinda.I commend J.J. for trying, because he was in a no-win scenario for this damage control. It's odd because, Kathleen Kennedy and Disney first disregarded George Lucas's original treatments for episodes 7, 8, and 9. Then they absolutely had some mandates to meet for J.J. back when they were about to film THE FORCE AWAKENS with an outlined trilogy, and as THE LAST JEDI began pre-production Rian Johnson completely ignored everything...and somehow Kathleen Kennedy let him do whatever he wanted. It does not compute in my head considering most of the behind the scenes drama involved directors and their creative choices, but Rian Johnson somehow managed to make the movie he wanted.It's as if everyone at Disney/Lucasfilm had no vision or idea of what to do right from the start, and bringing in Emperor Palpatine shows that it was a last minute concept to throw in to please everyone who disliked the last movie. It didn't make much sense for him to be in the film and the way he goes out is a missed opportunity like I mentioned. In the finale, the film absolutely had a chance to have an intense two against one lightsaber duel now that Kylo Ren is redeemed. Instead we got a disappointing scene where Kylo is temporarily thrown into a pit, as Rey just blocks the Emperor's lightning with her lightsaber and redirects it back towards him. Again lots of potential wasted, and some of that also has to do with the creative choices made in the previous film.I did particularly like Kylo Ren overall as a whole throughout these films, I liked his overall arc and that even though he fell to the dark side, he really truly wasn't there, it felt more consistent compared to our main protagonists as I felt a good sense of closure. I had no problem with his redemption, I actually quite enjoyed it. Also I liked how when he was redeemed, he didn't have any dialog as everything he was doing was shown through his actions. When THE FORCE AWAKENS first came out I didn't mind Finn and Poe, and I quite liked the that movie at the time, but now I just find them to be a nuisance. Daisy Ridley is fine as Rey though. She's a capable action hero and she seems like she's trying her best with what she was given.We got nice cameos from Harrison, Carrie and Mark. Still a travesty that they never got together at least once. This film makes an effort to show Carrie's Leia as a Jedi, but honestly, it would have been way cooler if she was already a Jedi form the beginning of this new trilogy. All these new films could have at the very least taken some inspiration from the cancelled EU. Again, I'm not some fanboy who is totally bitter, because I understand the business side of film and I get you cannot always copy the source material, because not everything on page will work on the big screen, but I would argue for the fans of the EU (not all stories were good, but the ones that were are gems), Disney and Lucasfilm could have taken inspiration from them as the blueprint was right there.I just wonder how we got here with STAR WARS...and what's next for the future...I'll get over it somehow...but I don't think I'll be anytime soon, similar to my sadness over Affleck and Cavill back over at DC/WB (yes I know the movies suck, with the exception of some, but I like them as Batman and Superman).Also John Williams scored the crap out of this film. I particular liked the musical score when all the rebels showed up at the very end in their ships. Very well done.I have the impression that critics will dislike this and fans will like it (especially if you disliked the pervious film), the opposite of THE LAST JEDI, where the critics loved and fans hated. For me I enjoyed the action and some of the nostalgia moments, but still very letdown by the opportunities that weren't taken and the muddled plot, but it is to me a better film than the pervious installment.5.5/10",5,18,31,22 December 2019
American Sniper," Cooper's best performance.
","It's solid. Bradley Cooper's performance is what makes this film work. In his performance here, you don't see him as an actor, but rather as a person. He embodies US Navy Seal Sniper Chris Kyle(rest in peace). His work is very solid, but being completely honest, I would have agreed with the Academy's choice of nominating his performance if Selma hadn't been released in the same year. This film tends to ask the right questions including, what is the price for military glory? What is it like to be a modern day soldier? Can you come back as yourself after war? All these questions are explored. Cooper is able to show this as he struggles to deal with everything he does. Yet, he always goes back, because for two reasons, it's what he knows, and because nobody else will. The film goes to great lengths to show his compassion for his comrades. He wants to go on the ground and give the marines some pointers and he even argues to his superiors about going down than laying back. This is Eastwood's solid effort, I didn't particularly enjoy his last couple of films, but he won me over with this one. To date his best work is Letters From Iwo Jima, but American Sniper is a solid entry into his glorious career. Eastwood brilliantly captures all the tense and suspenseful moments quite well. There are lots of nail biting scenes in the film, even in the trailers where Kyle is about to snipe the mother and son with the grenade was one of the most intense trailers I've ever seen, and seeing it all play out was even more gripping. Aside from Bradley Cooper, who's mark is made in the entire film, Sienna Miller is quite effective as his wife Taya Kyle even though it's somewhat of a cliché role. She shares lots of intimate moments with Bradley Cooper. The supporting cast surrounding Bradley Cooper are excellent, it's not overdone but there's enough to actually care about his comrades and they all bounce off each other extremely well, especially Jake McDorman as Biggles and Luke Grimes as Marc. The only criticism I have in this film is that it kind of glosses over some of the more problematic elements of him as a character. There are scenes shows on his PTSD problems and adjusting to a normal life, but it's sporadically sprinkled in the film rather than really diving into it. Though it was great to watch and has some good moments, I thought a lot more could have been explored. Also as I read more into Chris Kyle, the film somewhat changes his true self and its almost as if they're trying to make him more heroic, or more one-noted. I understand it's a film and some changes had to be made to appeal to some people and the studio head, but it's the only nitpick I have within the film. Nevertheless it's a solid film by Clint Eastwood. There's a lot more action than you'd expect in a Clint Eastwood film and they are very well shot. Being asked to kill 160 people(officially confirmed) in the name of your country is a huge undertaking and shows the internal conflict that comes along with it. Cooper is brilliant and it's a poignant reminder that we need to do more than say 'Thank you,' to all the troops and veterans in the US.8.5/10",8,8,24,19 January 2015
Ant-Man," A decent twelfth entry for the MCU.
","Ant-Man, another gamble for Marvel Studios and in a long time coming. The film doesn't hit an immediate home run, but thankfully makes it to home base and it's not afraid to poke fun at itself. Ant-Man is quite different compared to the other MCU films, it obviously has some similar origin story beats, but it works due to the fact that we haven't seen super powers or ants like this before. But lets get into some of the problems I had with the film. The tone was consistent, but at times I don't think the film really knew what it wanted to be. The starts off very rocky in the beginning. It tires to set things up too eagerly, you don't have time to embrace it, there wasn't much subtlety to it and a lot of the times it feels forced. It eventually picks up steam, but it can be a drag to sit through and is arguably the film's dullest spot. When Ant-Man tries to hit on the heavier notes, there are some moments where it works, but also at times it feels forced when it's trying to be sincere, it's sort of a mix bag, there are plenty good, but it comes with some slightly above average qualities. Like all Marvel villains, with the exception of Loki, Winter Soldier, and Ultron, the villain is so weak and treated almost like fodder. Poor Corey Stoll. I like him, he's a good character actor. I would have loved more backstory on Darren Cross, I can get by his issues with Hank Pym, played by the great Michael Douglas, but it's not really all fleshed out. It's very two- dimensional so to speak. Marvel really needs to improve this aspect of their movies. It's becoming more and more annoying the deeper we go into this cinematic universe, we are twelve movies in and only three villains of those twelve movies are decent at best. I really hope Thanos is done right after all this build up. Anyways, Stoll's action sequences and his Yellowjacket suit is killer though. It's more materialistic and more advance than the Ant-Man suit and provides eye candy. Speaking of Michael Douglas, his role as Hank Pym is very smooth. He does provide a lot of exposition, but his presence in the film just elevates every scene he's in, also being apart of SHIELD for sometime was quite interesting(with a surprise cameo from two MCU veterans). I felt a good chemistry between his character and his daughter Hope Van Dyne played by Evangeline Lilly more so than I did with Rudd and his daughter. Lilly holds her own on screen and isn't a typical damsel in distress, in fact she is the opposite and kicks butt with an attitude. I liked the parallel of the relationship between fathers and daughters within the film, which is what the film operates under. Speaking of that, lets get to Paul Rudd as Scott Lang, he carries this film quite well. He isn't just an everyman per say, but a burglar who tries to do right for his daughter, and we kinda haven't seen that at all. He's likable and fun to watch, and the foundation of this film's success is his spot on performance. Credit for the out of the box casting choice. Normally I dislike child actors, no disrespect, but here his relationship with his daughter Cassie played by Abby Ryder Fortson was tolerable. Rudd has some quippy lines and fun moments, but his sidekicks, mainly Michael Pena's Luis has the funniest moments on the film. T.I. and David Dastmalchian also provide nice supporting roles. I will point out that at times, for me there was just too much comedy, and it made me a little less invested from time to time when things mattered. Bobby Cannavale has a small role, who sort of in a way does not end up being the character I thought he'd end up being which was a nice surprise. The shrinking and expanding element brings a whole different dimension within the action films. It brings something new to see on the big screen and it's quite a joy to watch. Just the use of microphotography and first rate special effects are stellar. Very innovative action, clever, and adventurous. You'll have to see it for yourself to comprehend what I mean, the trailers only give you a taste. With all the drama that took place, Payton Reed does a good job taking over the director's chair over Edgar Wright. Obviously there will be people who would wonder what Wright could have done, one can't help it but think that, but the film shouldn't be judged under those merits. In the end Reed does a commendable job at selling a far-fetched superhero, and making it work overall. Not to mention this film doesn't go into the Iron Man 2 territory, it's a nice blend of references without denting the main narrative. We do get a nice cameo from Anthony Mackie's Falcon which is great(not a spoiler, shown in the TV spots). I'd like the mention that you'd be surprise that the ants in the film are not just drones or used for set pieces, they actually have some cool moments and kinda have characteristics. I've never been more intrigued by ants after seeing this film. You'll leave the theater thinking just how cool the ants are. As for the end credits scene, they are very solid. It ties in very well into the future of the MCU perfectly. Bring on Civil War. 7/10",7,2,9,17 July 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," A near perfect soldier.
","This, in my opinion is my personal favorite Marvel Phase 1 solo film. I'm aware the first Iron Man(2008) is considered to be the best, but this one did it for me. Joe Johnston is no stranger to period pieces, like The Rocketeer and October Sky, and in the case of Captain America, Johnston delivers everything promised in the trailers. Johnston is able to capture that patriotic spirit that permeated the US during WWII. The film has an authentic feel to it and combines elements from films like Indiana Jones mixed in with Saving Private Ryan and a touch of 007. The set pieces are fantastic, due to the fact that this film was shot entirely at London. The film crew did a very good job disguising it as the 1940's New York City. Aside from October Sky this is Johnston's second best effort. The film starts out very strong. The beginning to the middle is solid. Here we get a story of an underdog, very skinny, small, and sickly Steve Rogers trying to do whats right. From then on Steve is chosen from the super soldier program to become the world's first super soldier, aiding the United States war effort in WWII. Eventually the film looses steam in the second act, and goes a little crazy with montages. The musical montage in particular is great and clever, but then the other two montages just try to shoehorn most of the story and the conflict and it gets very generic. The supporting cast overall was excellent as Tommy Lee Jones (Colonel Chester Phillips) and Stanley Tucci (Dr. Erksine) steal every scene they're in. Tucci in particular has a very enlightening speech on why he chose Steve Rogers and give him a pep talk to remain humble. Hugo Weaving has a natural talent playing villains, and he knocks one out of the park as the Red Skull. However, the heart and soul in this movie rests on Chris Evans playing the titular hero. Evans during the hype train got a lot of hate, but I was actually one of the few who supported this casting, and man he does not disappoint. He gives the story right amount of everything it needs in every scene, and he only gets better, especially in the sequel Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Haley Atwell plays a believable and lovable ally/love interest. She's not a damsel in distress which is great and the chemistry between Atwell and Evans gives Marvel's most solid and satisfying romance on screen to date, I would say even better than Tony Stark and Pepper Potts. I found the ending of this film to be quite moving. A lot more moving than I thought it would be. The weak spots in this film were, as I stated above the rushed montage, Johnston's very calculated and sometimes soulless action sequences that just feel bland, and the Red Skull's lack of development. Hugo Weaving gives a good performance, but his character spends most of his time building his plane and reminding us that he's evil, rather than emerging as a worthwhile threat. This film does have a lot of characters, so it also comes within the territory that Cap's team The Howling Commandos don't have too much to do. One could argue that Sebastian Stan's role as Bucky, Cap's friend and sidekick was trivialized, but he got his due in the sequel. I admire this film, I like how it does send a decent message without being too preachy about it in the beginning. I liked the set pieces, I liked the cast. It's very old fashioned, as it should be and it will pleasantly kill off two hours of your time. Good music in it too by Alan Silvestri. Evans is great in the role and has a lot of charisma. 8/10",8,2,3,5 January 2015
Justice League," Decently made despite some sloppy execution.
","After all this time, the Justice League finally assembles in the big screen. For what it's worth, it's an entertaining time and worth the admission. Despite that, the film does have a good amount of issues. But the cast for the most part is great. Their banter and their performance is what really puts the whole film a float. I've been a fan of the Ben Affleck casting since he was announced. I think he's the best cinematic version of Batman we've got on screen, certainly more comic accurate and more of a brute. Bruce Wayne here goes through a big change in his character and I liked seeing this whole new side of him. He's learning to work together with the other members and his dynamic with Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman is nicely handled. Gadot, is great and her performance carries through since her solo film debut, but I still found some her line deliveries kinda weak. The reports are true though, she is used for some downgrading comedy regarding her attractive appearance and the Amazons do wear more revealing armor as opposed to the practical look Patty Jenkins and her design team helped shape. I'm not gonna go too deep in this, but I can definitely see why this would turn off a lot of fans and some general going audience members, especially since Wonder Woman was big step forward. The new players are good for the most part. Ezra Miller's Flash for me was a tad too quippy. I found it kind of annoying and most of his jokes did not land. That's not to say I didn't chuckle here and there, but I know certain liberties should be taken when it comes to adapting source material, but I couldn't get on board with this Barry Allen. Maybe he'll grow into the Barry Allen I want to see someday. However his display of powers are quite cool to look at. Jason Momoa's Aquaman worried me in the trailers. I was hoping he wouldn't be another quippy, tough guy/surfer dude character, but he turned out not to be. Well not entirely. Ray Fisher's Cyborg is a bit dry, but he's integral to the plot of the film. I think there's a lot of potential with him.Now on to Superman. I think people who weren't happy about Cavill's Superman in the past will be happy now. For me, I was already a fan of Cavill's Superman, but it took them three tries and now he is the Superman I think everyone wanted to see. His return elevates the film just a bit more. He is the highlight for me and I'm really intrigued what they do with him next.Now their villain Steppenwolf, it's not just a weak villain, it's a bad one. A really bad one. Super one-noted, and incredibly forgettable. I'd compare him to Malekieth from Thor: The Dark World. To be fair he wasn't complex in the comics either but, Snyder and his team had the opportunity to really bring something cool to the table. It is very much similar to Marvel's villain problem, and to be honest, DC villains have been extremely weak aside from General Zod. Also the Parademons are fodder. Since Avengers and Age of Ultron, it can get pretty redundant at this point to see a team take out mindless creatures. The movie is brisk. It's just about two hours, and the banter between the heroes are fun. However you can probably tell that a good chunk of the film is missing in the cutting room floor. There are a lot of scenes where the scene is abrupt and the editing is very choppy. Sometimes whenever something interesting happens it just keeps cutting away instead of letting the scene play out. Corporate meddling definitely took place, which is a shame cause I would have loved to soak up the scenes a bit more. I will admit the tone shift from BvS made this film feel a little Marvel-ish, not in a bad way. For me I never had a problem of the darker tone. BvS had a lot of good ideas, but it was all just sloppy execution(The Ultimate Cut is a little better). I would rank this third on the list of all the DC films that have been release. Man of Steel and Wonder Woman are better, but Justice League is a step up from BvS, and leaps and bounds better than Suicide Squad. Despite some problems I'm happy Snyder pulled it off, and I wish him well especially since the family tragedy we went through. At times the film looks and feels like a Snyder film, but there are moments where you can absolutely tell Joss Whedon had his fingerprints here and there. For better or worse I thought it worked at times, and at times it didn't, most of it came from Flash, so take that for what it is. I'm not one who's really picky about CGI but there are times in the film where it's so obvious that everything is CGI. To cap it off, Justice League is a flawed, but solid entry to the franchise. I'm excited now and more hopeful. Whether or not this film gets praise or negative reception, the excuse of 'it's made for the fans,' cannot be a way to dismiss bad reviews, that goes for ANY movie. So to end this review, I hope all the fanboys are just at peace with each other, whether you're Marvel or DC. In the end all we need, at the very least is a decent and entertaining film. Just cause someone else has one opinion doesn't mean it's the end all be all. 6.7/10",6,21,41,16 November 2017
Man of Steel," Super.
","I really enjoyed this film, and I strongly believe it does not deserve a 56% on rottentomatoes. Everyone knows the story about Superman, otherwise known as Kal-El, and Clark Kent so there's really no explanation needed. Now being a giant comic-book buff, and a massive Superman fan, I know pretty much everything there is to know about this character, so before I went in to see it I was expecting a boring and tedious beginning. However that was not the case. The film shows Kal-El's origin through flashbacks. It brought something new to the table and for the most part very intriguing. The scenes of Clark's childhood have a very tender feel to them and are probably the most interesting parts in the film. His fathers Jor-El and Jonathan Kent portrayed by Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner steal all the scenes they're in. Each father plays a key role into Superman's life. Michael Shannon is great as General Zod, and is not a typical two-dimensional villain, and actually has a reason and motive, by rebuilding Krypton on Earth. The best villains are the villains who think they're doing the right thing. Zod's right hand woman Faora played by Antje Traue also is a standout as an cruel cold-hearted minion. Diane Lane plays her part well as Ma Kent, and Amy Adams to my surprise is a great Lois Lane. I loved how she was a real journalist and reporter. She actually dived into all her evidence and traced Clark's whereabouts. Let's not forget about Henry Cavill. He embodies Clark Kent/Superman very well. He knows he is an outsider/alien, who is essentially a god and has inner conflict within himself because he doesn't feel like he belongs. This has been done before in Bryan Singer's snooze-fest adaptation, but not in a melodramatic way, where as Cavill portrayed this very well and very subtly. Props to him. Big props. I only had two major problems with this film, one of them is the romance. It's completely rushed and I felt very little hints of chemistry. The kiss also felt very forced. I liked Lois and Clark's relationship and their banter prior to the that very awkward kiss. It was very out of place and took me out of the film for a bit. As for the other, I thought that battle with the World Engine near the Indian Ocean was a bit of a drag. It made sense for Clark to fight off that machine, but it was the only part of the film where I was bored. But with that being said, I absolutely loved the action. Director Zack Snyder definitely showed me what I wanted to see Superman do in a fight, unlike Bryan Singer. I would say this is the right step forward for Superman and possibly the expansion of the DC Cinematic Universe. They have a lot of catching up to do with Marvel, but I'm hopeful that Batman vs Superman will be just fine. Again this film does not deserve a 56% at all. By all means it's not a perfect movie, but is one fun ride with all around great performances. 9/10",9,9,14,27 August 2014
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," The ageless Tom Cruise does it again.
","Tom Cruise continues to prove he is a capable action star for his age. Plus he doesn't even look 53 years old. The role of Ethan Hunt is belongs to Tom Cruise. Ethan Hunt is America's 007, and there will come a time when the Mission: Impossible franchise will reboot and recast, but not any time soon. Cruise effortlessly slides back into the role and his performance is again spot on. This franchise keeps getting better and better. I wasn't totally huge on the first two, which aren't terrible, but since J.J. Abrams took over in Mission: Impossible III, all the films since then have lived up to my expectations. This time around Ethan Hunt has to stop and prove that the rouge nation of spies and killers known as the Syndicate who kill to order. Their leader Solomon Lane is played by Sean Harris, and he does a good job oozing creepiness through his calm and intimidating demeanor. However he wasn't as memorable as I had hoped. The small nitpick about the Mission: Impossible films are that the villains don't feel as memorable, not since Philip Seymour Hoffman. Even in Ghost Protocol, Michael Nyqvist wasn't quite as memorable. The supporting cast is good, Simon Pegg keeps getting more work since his appearance in the third entry. He obviously provides comic relief and has nice banter with Cruise and the others. Jeremy Renner also has a decent returning role, but it's a lot more reduced compared to Ghost Protocol. This time around he does more talking than fighting. He does have one car chase sequence, but he really doesn't have an action sequence which was a tad disappointing to me. It was also nice to see Ving Rhames return after being reduced to a cameo in Ghost Protocol. Rebecca Ferguson an actor I haven't even heard of came out of nowhere and kicked a lot of butt. However, I wasn't completely sold on her role, compared to Paula Patton, she seemed a little one noted for my taste, but her action scenes are top notch. I was pleasantly surprised with Alec Baldwin's character. He didn't end up being the character I thought he'd be. He almost in a way plays the same role Laurence Fishburne plays in the third film. Aside from some of the minor nitpicks it's a very solid summer film. To see Tom Cruise hold on to an airplane taking off, ride motorcycles, escape from being captured, fighting bad guys, shooting a gun and looking good running, you can't help but to cheer for him and hope that he saves the day. The action sequences dazzle, you'll be on the edge of your seat. I also normally don't like chase sequences but I haven't been this entertained by a chase sequence in a long while. It's very pulse pounding. There's plenty to enjoy in this film. 8.5/10",8,0,2,12 August 2015
Spider-Man," Cheesy good fun.
","Sam Raimi's Spider-Man still holds a near and dear to my heart. This was the first film I watched in theaters in multiple viewings. Being eight years old and being a big comic-book fan, Spider-Man was a film that I could not wait to see. It's been almost twelve years since May 2002, and yet, the film still holds up in certain levels.I like the casting of Tobey Maguire. He brings out the best of Peter Parker and fits the title role very well. He holds the film on his shoulders but with also a good supporting cast. Willem Dafoe is great as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. I love how Dafoe is able to turn his Goblin persona on and off so effortlessly. He's very frightening and very cold, while at the same time can be a very nice man. James Franco is great as Harry Osborn, he doesn't overplay the wanting attention and support from his father, as well as displaying some jealousy towards his friend Peter, it's all very subtle and it works well. Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson are excellent in their respective roles as Aunt May and Uncle Ben. J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson is spot on. Probably the best casting of a supporting comic-book character ever. Kirsten Dunst is, in a lack of a better word, just okay. Her delivery is solid in some moments, but it's near the end where she throws herself at Peter, admitting her love for him seemed very forced. It is the only uncomfortable scene to watch out of the whole film. The Visuals are decent in some shots, but overall, there are moments in the film where one could easily tell it was all CGI, and it's not that impressive. Costume of Spidey is very faithful and looks great on screen, I can't say the same for Goblin. It's very Power Rangers like. Spider-Man isn't an your typical summer action blockbuster. It is a blockbuster in every regard, but it has something more. The characters are relevant and I liked the whole dynamic between Norman favoring Peter over his own son Harry, whom he's disappointed in. It adds layers to the film and shows these character their reasons for doing what they're doing. The romance is cheesy, but it isn't too terrible, though Dunst isn't as strong as the other actors, she and Maguire have enough chemistry to buy into. Spider-Man is still very much an enjoyable film and swings high. 8.6/10",8,0,1,28 September 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," A return to form for the X-Men franchise.
","Solid.Right when the movie started, and the beginning credits contained that original X2: X-Men United score, I got a huge feeling of nostalgia and I knew I was in for a ride. Bryan Singer pretty much fixes up most of the wrongs of the horrid X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine. This film uses time travel quite well, it's consistent and flows along very well. We spend a lot of time with Wolverine, Beast, Mystique, young Xavier and young Magneto. They all play an integral part into the story, and we get into the meat of things when Mystique is responsible for the creation of a new type of Sentinels that adapt to each mutant's power, effective killing them faster. The Sentinels created by Bolivar Trask also have the ability to target anyone that has the capability of passing on the mutant gene. It's why in the future, the Sentinels pretty much took over the planet, killing off everyone. I loved seeing the future scenes with the Sentinels destroying the whole X-Men team. I loved all the action set pieces, and the visuals. Quicksilver in particular had a very memorable sequence in the film, despite his lame looking outfit. It was brilliantly executed and edited. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender display their fine acting as Xavier and Magneto. Here we see the friction between the two and it's displayed very well. Jennifer Lawrence has a lot more to do as Mystique this time around and her character is fleshed out more. Do I need to tell you Hugh Jackman is great as Wolverine? There was a point in the film where there are some slow moments, but most of them are decent character moments, especially between Xavier and Magneto. Even though she is fleshed out a lot more than the pervious installments, all the Mystique subplots and elements to me slowed the film down, and didn't find at all interesting. The movie also keeps reminding you that Mystique is the key to the new Sentinels over and over again. Peter Dinklage is good with what he's given with, but with so many characters within the film, it comes within the territory that his role is nothing more than a two-dimensional villain. The time travel element worked really well, near the end, the climax of the film, thats where it becomes a bit choppy in the editing. Normally that worked for me most of the time, but there is a portion in the film where is so abrupt that it took out of the film here and there.You can tell this movie has Bryan Singer's touch. It revitalizes the whole franchise. It re-writes all the wrong of X-Men: The Last Stand and some of X-Men Origins: Wolverine. I LOVED seeing Cyclops and Jean Gray back alive. FINALLY the whole X-Men team is back. So great. I do hope they make an appearance in the sequel. With that being said, stay after the credits. APOCALYPSE!!! 7/10",7,3,5,2 August 2014
Captain America: Civil War," A rare third chapter that's solid.
","Kevin Feige, the Russos' and the MCU crew really get Cap. The Captain America trilogy is the best trilogy the MCU has provided so far. I don't think the last two Iron Man films are any good, and Thor is quite mediocre. I'd go so far as to say it's the best superhero trilogy out there as of now(Yes I did not like The Dark Knight Rises, calm down people, just my opinion). There was no bias or favoritism involved despite it being a Captain America film. The entire time everyone's reasoning to joining a certain side is completely justified and as an audience member you absolutely see their points, making it very difficult to see who is wrong and who is right. Tony Stark has a point. This is what the world wants, some form of accountability. Superheroes should not get a free pass. Are you gonna let a superhero get a free pass if someone close to you died during some random battle? It's tough to deal with, and it's so easy to root for Cap, but realistically, if this were the real world, you would want accountability, lets not kid ourselves. Would it actually work, maybe, maybe not, but the idea of it puts everyone into a more safer and secure mindset. He knows for a fact he needs to be put in check after the events of Ultron. However, in Cap's point of view, given what happened in Cap 2, how HYDRA took over and the how untrusting the government can be, I think we can all agree the safest is in his own hands. The government may say that they care about the safety of the people, and even if that were true, they're also as interested in fighting in wars and guaranteeing their interests. If superheroes were to fall into their full control, the government would just use them for that purpose. All these ideologies and view points are present and the film does a beautiful job presenting that, it's not just superheroes fighting for the sake of fighting. Give credit to writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. The Russos' also deliver fantastic action sequences throughout. I'm not given to hyperbole, but the second act may be the best action sequence in a comic-book film ever. You'll have to see it for yourself to understand what I mean. This film is also wonderfully acted, it's the best acted MCU film to date. Scarlett Johnasson, Anthony Mackie, Paul Bettany, Jeremy Renner, Emily VanCamp, Don Cheadle, and William Hurt deliver the goods. Standouts to me were Sebastian Stan. He brings more to Bucky than ever. The bromance element between Bucky and Steve never felt overdone, but enough to give you the feels and make you care. He is quite a tragic character and it's very fleshed out. Chadwick Boesman delivers an effective T'challa/Black Panther. You understand his place within all this chaos. Elizabeth Olsen has a much more impactful role as Wanda Maximoff this time. I'd like to mention the bug heroes absolutely steal the show in that airport sequence. Paul Rudd's Scott Lang is basically the audience as he displays his inner fanboy. He has a big moment in the film that will surely be memorable. In a short amount of time, Tom Holland, the Russos', Kevin Feige, and the creative team at Marvel do what Sony failed to do in the past ten years or so. I'm now more excited than ever to see the next Spider-Man feature. Holland combines the best of Maguire and Garfield in his performance. Spider-Man is not just shoe- horned in, he's got a substantial role and it's just fabulous.For film's two leads, the heart and soul of this movie is Chris Evans as Captain America. One would think this is like an Avengers film, and Cap would get the short end of the stick, but to be honest, it really isn't just an Avengers film. Captain America is very much the lead character. He really is the heart of the MCU at this point. His morality is his greatest strength and there's an inspirational quality to his character. Downey Jr. this time around portrays a more disturbed and depressed Tony Stark. He's a bit more bleak and it's fascinating to see Tony at this state. Without any spoilers, Evans and Downey Jr. display their finest performances as these characters with an very intense and gut wrenching third act.The only nitpick I have is Zemo played by Daniel Bruhl. Although I loved his portrayal and found to understand what his motivations were, it seemed as if his execution heavily relied on coincidences a little too much. It seemed very far fetched for all the things to unravel at point of the film, but it didn't take away from the impact it had. Honestly they didn't need Zemo at all, if you took him out of the equation then I would contend that this is a near perfect superhero epic. With all that being said, it's still a wonderfully crafted film that did not disappoint. Where Batman v Superman tossed out ideas without ever thinking them through, Civil War is constantly aware of the consequences of its characters' actions, both to themselves and to the people around them. In my opinion Captain America: Civil War breaks the curse of every superhero threequel being either bad or disappointing. Civil War is another knock out and entertains relentlessly. It's an impressive opening to Phase 3 and nudges out The Winter Soldier for me by a hair. The Russo Brothers have a very good hold of this franchise now. They knew when to be serious and when to be humorous, balancing out the tone of the film extremely well. Not to mention juggling every character as much as they can. I think Infinity War is in very good hands.9.5/10",9,3,7,7 May 2016
Inside Out," A return to form for Pixar.
","This movie was a hard sell. I liked the first sneak peek of the preview of this film, but I wasn't really feeling the other trailers and the marketing campaign overall. But to it's credit this movie is a hard movie to sell without spoiling anything. I really enjoyed this film. I think Pixar found their groove back with Inside Out after misfires like Brave and the Cars franchise. But with that being said, what Pixar is great at is making movies, not just for kids, but for adults as well. The exterior of the films seem like for kids, but the interior has many layers and depth. This film allows you to feel the emotions you see on screen, who are the emotions of a girl named Riley(Kaitlyn Dias). The whole cast is stellar, Joy voiced by Amy Poehler carries this film, I was very concerned if I can get on board with a character who is happy all the time throughout the whole film, but Poehler and her character manages to do so. Phyllis Smith is Sadness and she is terrific, I found her to be a tad annoying in the beginning, but she won me over. I liked the other supporting emotions, Mindy Kaling provides sassiness as Disgust and Lewis Black as Anger provides some humorous moments as well, but my favorite out of all is Bill Hader's Fear. He was great. The parents portrayed by Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan provide decent supporting roles. How the creative minds of Pixar came up with this conceptually complicated film is beyond me. Give director/writer Pete Docter, who also wrote Wall-E and Up, credit where credit is due. The story is almost perfectly constructed. I say almost, because the beginning starts off so well and it's thrilling, just to see the concept become realized in just a few minutes kicked the film off in high gear. What bogged the story down a little is when Joy and Sadness end up getting lost within the large maze of Riley's brain/memory trying to get back into the control room. That is where the film looses some momentum. I didn't particularly love Richard Kind's Bing Bong, but he was my least favorite character of the bunch, but he is used very effectively, and to those who saw it, you know what I'm talking about. It's just a tiny nitpick but I just wish they allowed the idea to carry the film itself rather than have this middle act, again it wasn't a huge detriment, just a nitpick as it eventually picks up steam again. This is Pixar's most ambitious and most subtly intelligent film yet. Not since Toy Story 3 have I enjoyed a film this much by them. Again, I'm going to sound like a broken record, but Pixar really knows how to tell a story. Yes they do have some misfires, but their track record is solid. I'm not the target demographic for these films, but they continue to turn up solid, dependable, and consistent entertainment. This film hits the right notes on another level. The conceptual level this film operates on is a pleasure to watch on screen. This movie is very thought-provoking and is filled with awesome and clever metaphors that never gets complicated at all. It explains emotional states very well disguised as a kid's film and sends a great message that not just that everyone has emotions, but it cannot be one emotion all the time and every time, and each emotion has it's place. It's an easy film to relate to, and to be honest I sincerely believe that adults might enjoy this film a little more than kids. Inside Out is easily in Pixar's top five or ten list. 9/10",9,18,51,29 June 2015
Avengers: Endgame," It's great entertainment, but unsatisfying.
","I'm coming at this as someone who read the comics and who also invested in this franchise since 2008 as a 15 year old kid, when I was the only one in my entire high school or inner circle who could comprehend what was about to unfold and told everyone about who The Avengers were and what they're all about.To be frank, time traveling is a lazy way to rewrite or undo everything that came before. But, there are films that do it well and I was going in with that optimism that they might try something clever. Ultimately it is the same time traveling mumbo-jumbo. It does try to cover the tried trope with moments of nostalgia, and to it's credit it even made me feel that way.But with that being said, that wasn't the biggest issue, it was some of the character decisions that the Russos, Feige and writers Markus & McFeely chose. I cannot review this without spoilers, so here it goes.I really disliked Thor's arc. I didn't appreciate the joke they made him into. It just didn't work for me. I've elaborated many times, more often than not the MCU's child-like and formulaic humor can really get on my nerves. I was expecting a tone just a little more dower, similar to Infinity War. I like it when things are taken a little more seriously which is why I put Infinity War, Civil War, The Winter Soldier, and the first Iron Man on such high pedestal. Seeing him out of shape and acting like a frat-boy was unpleasant. Odin's lesson of being there for his people has been lost with Thor's ending, it's as if all the growth in Ragnarok was gone in this film.As for Captain America, well, I did find it kinda fitting, but I would have preferred to have seen Rogers make the ultimate sacrifice himself alongside Tony Stark. The universe revolves around both of them and I personally would have found it more poetic if the two heartbeats of the MCU go out in heroic fashion. Ultron once called him out on 'pretending to live without war.' As much as I found Ultron to be a tad underwhelming, I found that quote from him to have poignancy and also one of the reasons why Captain America is so interesting. Tony Stark, can't help himself but to always fix things, with Steve Rogers, he cannot turn away from any situation that goes south. Even if time traveling in this film apparently splits off to another parallel timeline, I still don't find it in Steve Rogers who gave up his own love, his own time to the greater good, to only check out and retire like the way he did.I had no problem with Tony's death, as a matter of fact I love the fact that Endgame wasn't afraid to kill Black Widow and Iron Man. The MCU started with Downey's Iron Man, so I found it reasonable that it should end with him. Nat's death only develops Hawkeye, who has way more to do in this film than he ever did in the previous installments. It was time for the MCU to not have any 'fake-outs' and really show that heroes can die. I remember what Whedon said during his tenure with Marvel. It's war, and in war people die, and when the war is won, there is always a cost in a victory.Thanos this time around got the short end of the stick. Brolin again delivers on his performance, and I understand, this movie is more about the Avengers than it is about Thanos, but I just did not like the fact that they killed him in the first twenty minutes and we got a pre-Infinity War Thanos.But, the Big Three, Downey Jr, Evans and Hemsworth deliver. The rest of the cast is good. Jeremy Renner is at his best here like I previously mentioned. Johansson is also very good, and it was nice to see her and Renner's characters bounce off each other like they used to, making her death only more tragic. Karen Gillan who salvaged a small portion of the redundant Guardians 2, also brings her A-game and Nebula's arc here is handled very well. It was also very cool to see Professor Hulk and Ruffalo does a great job being at peace with himself. The rest of the cast, Larson, Cheadle, Rudd, and Cooper are great.Now, we all knew the dusted would return, and that scene really gave me goosebumps momentarily. The action in this film is not on the level of Infinity War. It's solid action, and some very cool moments, but it pales in comparison to the Titan fight, the Wakanda battle, and the opening NY fight in Infinity War. Thanos does however go against the Big Three and that was a treat, especially his fight against Cap, but the rest of the action lacked the extra flare that made the fight sequences in Infinity War so awesome. At the very least, the characters are used well. VFX is also top notch.Ultimately, I enjoyed good amount of moments within the film, and technically speaking it's very well made, but I walked out of this unfulfilled and unsatisfied. I'm not comfortable with the direction they took, especially on the characters I mentioned and I know putting people up to my standards is ridiculous, but I can have high expectations for this because again, I've invested in the MCU for 10+ years. I'll need time to let it sink in and maybe if I watch it again I'll think differently, but its as if the Russos and Markus & McFeely exhausted all options and ran out of gas after delivering film after film.7/10",7,16,38,25 April 2019
Batman Begins," A definitive Batman film.
","This to me is THE definitive Batman film. Brooding and dark, Nolan gave Batman a revitalization it needed after WB/Schumacher's god- awful Batman & Robin. We get a darker and more serious toned Batman along with a fine performance from Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman. He's more fleshed out in this film more so than the previous incarnations of Batman on screen. Bale embodies everything I wanted in a Bruce Wayne. He's not wearing a mask when he's Batman, but he is when he's Bruce Wayne. Something that hasn't been really dived into, with the exception of Tim Burton's 1989 Batman, as it sort of was. Here we understand why Bruce Wayne is doing what he's doing and why he's out there putting himself on the line to beat criminals to a pulp with everything he knows. Batman Begins is also told in a nonlinear narrative. We get a series of flashbacks that develop Bruce's persona. We also get a Batman that fully utilizes his detective skills and his gadgets are very impressive. Almost real world like. Very little cgi in this film, almost everything is practical. Speaking of real world like, Nolan completely nails the tone of the film. It's grounded and works perfectly for a character like Batman. The supporting cast is excellent. Gary Oldman, Michael Cain, and Morgan Freeman are all spot on as Bruce Wayne/Batman's allies. Finally we have a Commissioner Gordon that is faithfully represented unlike the previous installments. Gordon does a lot more than just calling Batman for help, he actually dives into the action working Batman. Oldman is the perfect Gordon and it's very hard to imagine another actor in that role. Alfred is a lot more fleshed out as well, Michael Cain and Nolan bring more of a father figure role and is more than just a butler. Morgan Freeman provides the humor and levity of the film as Lucius Fox, who supplies Wayne's toys. I think out of all the villains in Nolan's almost perfect trilogy, the one who is overlooked is Liam Neeson's Ra's al Ghul. Nesson's portrayal is very underrated. He plays that mentor role to Bruce very well and he's not a typical evil villain, rather a villain who really believes that he's doing the right thing by destroying Gotham City as it's infested with crime. Something he and Bruce do not see eye to eye: killing. Cillian Murphy is awesome as Dr. Crane otherwise known as Scarecrow. Every moment with the Scarecrow is gold and it's a shame he's nothing more than just as 'pawn,' as Batman puts it. Tom Wilkinson also has a sharp supporting role as Carmine Falcone a powerful mob boss and I even enjoyed Mark Boone Junior as Gordon's corrupt partner Detective Flass. The action scenes involving the Batman's vehicle the tumbler is exciting, but I cannot say the same for the hand to hand fight sequences. Batman's extraordinary martial arts are exploited as well as they could be. There's too much shaky cam and you can't tell who or what is happening. I felt only small amounts of chemistry between Katie Holmes and Christian Bale. I liked some of Holmes's performance, but like Kirsten Dunst in Sam Raimi's original Spider-Man film, where Holmes's character Rachel declares her love for Bruce, it's very awkward and kinda bland. Almost uncomfortable to watch. With a strong lead, and a supporting cast, solid script by David S. Goyer, and under the direction of Christopher Nolan, this is the Batman film I've been waiting for.9.6/10",9,2,3,30 January 2015
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," More action, more scares, and more dinosaurs.
","This was the first Jurassic Park film I saw in theaters, I was barely an infant when the first one was released, but I was old enough, and accompanied by my teenage aunt to see this film in theaters in the summer of 1997. As a child watching it, I remember being scared a terrified, clenching my butt-hole the whole time, and holding on to my aunts arm tightly. Because of that experience The Lost World: Jurassic Park holds a special place in my heart, as cheesy as that sounds. I know many might see this film as an inferior sequel, but for me personally, I get a kick out of it and still do, despite it being slightly mediocre. This time around there are more dinosaurs, more action, and even more scares. I thought that in this film, Spielberg does a more effective job at creating tension and suspense. Once again Spielberg effectively uses the dinosaurs in every scene they're in, not to mention they look even better. The scenes involving the Compsognathus left me scarred in my youth and it still sends shivers down my spine every time I re-watch this film. The Stegosaurus scene involving Julianne Moore's character Dr. Sarah Harding, doesn't quite capture the magic of the Brachiosaurus scene, but still tender. The Velociraptors are again effectively used for scares and are even more vicious. There are three T-Rexes this time in the film, two being parents of an infant and they are the stars in this film. There's an awesome sequence involving a T-Rex rampaging across San Diego. The film's weak point, as it was in the first film are the characters. This time around Dr. Ian Malcolm is a different man. Jeff Goldblum, although his performance is dry, but it works for his character. He isn't the same man he used to be since the first film so it was neat to see Malcolm become a different person. Aside from Malcolm getting most of the spotlight, the rest of the characters are flat, aside from showing off hints of their personalities. I enjoyed Vince Vaughn's Nick Van Owen, he was full of wisecracks. I also very much enjoyed Pete Postlethwaite as Roland Temdo the hunter and tracker, who was in a way similar to Bob Peck's role in the first film. Aside from them I didn't really care much for the other characters. I was annoyed with Julianne Moore's character, as with the main villain of the film Peter Ludlow, portrayed by Arliss Howard, who now took over Ingen from his uncle John Hammond. He now wants to capture some of the dinosaurs and bring them to a park built in San Diego, something John Hammond does not want. Vanessa Lee Chester also fills in the void for Lex and Tim. It felt like a rehash of the first film, despite her pretty cool moment with a Velociraptor in the film. It feels as though, while watching this film, the characters are a lot smarter than they appear to be. I mean why would they do what they're doing when they clearly know that everything they're doing is a bad idea. You can't help but wonder these thoughts while in viewing. Despite all this, every moment with the dinosaurs are golden. Even though we don't really care about some of the characters in the film, the stakes are higher and it's fun seeing them in peril, and it makes for an entertaining film. The action sequences are twice as exhilarating, one involving a trailer over the cliff will surely have you grip on to something. Not to mention John Williams's score this time around is more energetic and just as good as the first one. To sum it up this sequel is everything that you'd expect, more action, more dinosaurs, more thrills, and a higher body count. It's a fun ride throughout and provides more than the first film in terms of scale and stakes, but it's not completely refreshing as it's predecessor. 6/10",6,4,6,4 December 2014
Avengers: Infinity War," 10 years, 18 movies...it delivered.
","I've been waiting for this film since 2008 when Nick Fury showed up in Tony Stark's house telling him he's apart of a bigger universe and he just doesn't know it. The pacing is relentless. Not a boring moment. It was basically three third acts all together. I was surprised to see it even escalate further than I expected. Being a huge comic-book geek, I was pleased to see the film go to places where I thought it wouldn't. I definitely thought Marvel would play it just a little safe before Avengers 4, but they didn't. So with that being said, lets start with Thanos. Josh Brolin's Thanos is the MCU's best villain by far, beating out Loki, Winter Soldier, Vulture, Killmonger, and Zemo. Also for a CGI creature, he looked legit. Unlike Steppenwolf, the way the light hits his face, the subtle movements on his face when he expresses himself, his movement, it was just perfection. There are some moments where it's not too polished, but it's not completely distracting. Compared to the comics, the Russo Brothers, Kevin Feige and writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely take some liberties to make Thanos more than just a big villain who wants to destroy the world. In his own sick and twisted point of view, he kinda had a point, and the best villains are the ones who think that they're doing the right thing. At this point if any of you have been following the MCU or at least watched a good portion, you won't be totally lost. The entire cast brought their A-game and came to play. Some characters take a back seat, but they do get their moment to shine and are used very well in service of the plot. Downey Jr. and Cumberbatch have great snarky, prick-like, know-it-all vs. know-it-all back and forth. Holland, Pratt, Bautista, Mackie, Cooper, Diesel, and Ruffalo bring some levity. Evans and Hemsworth bring it in the action department and at this point they can play Cap and Thor in their sleep. We also get a nice cameo from a character we haven't seen in a while. You'll know who I'm talking about once you see the film. Kudos for Markus and McFeely for juggling this behemoth. One can make the argument that it can get confusing, but if you're invested as much as I am, then it's a total breeze. With 18 movies in, Infinity War can't afford to bring you up to speed. I normally find romance in superhero films a drag, but here Infinity War juggles two of them and they work really well. I found that the Vision and Scarlet Witch romance was quite effective. Star-Lord and Gamora worked well also. Action sequences and special effects are top notch. I know a lot of VFX artists worked day and night and they really did not miss a beat. Like Thanos, some weren't as polished, but it's not to the point where it's so obvious. The battle sequences in Titan and Wakanda are back to back edge of your seat thrill rides. I particularly geeked out in the Titan sequence where Thanos does have a one on one with Doctor Strange and Iron Man. Kudos for the creative team to allow Thanos to go nuts with his Infinity Gauntlet. That was such a treat. Thanos solves Marvel's villain problem. He got a lot of screen time to be developed and being a fan I wasn't disappointed. I love that I felt a sense of danger. As much as I love the MCU, the criticism of no stakes and weak villains for some of their films are valid. For the first time in a while, we actually feel fear for these characters and it's awesome. If I had one negative, and that's really all I have, is that perhaps the Black Order, or the Children of Thanos are nothing more than just henchmen. They are primarily new characters introduced in the Infinity storyline back in 2013. I did not expect to get what writer Jonathan Hickman gave us in the source material they're based off of, so I kept my expectations in check, but I really did think we'd get a little more to who they are all about. Out of the four, only Ebony Maw truly impressed me and had the most to do. Avengers: Infinity War is everything I could have hoped for. It's definitely in my Top 3 list of MCU films, and in my Top 10 comic-book films of all time. Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige and directors Joe & Anthony Russo did not pull any punches with this one. It pulled my heart out, making some bold choices along the way. I love their tone as they bring intensity, knowing when to be serious and knowing when to sprinkle in a little humor here and there. It's a grim and bleak time for the Avengers and the Guardians. The sense of danger makes all the difference in this film. If any of you haven't seen it, you're all not ready for what's to come. Consequences are real and the stakes are high. I will definitely be seeing this again in theaters and I'm so thankful that Avengers 4 is only a year wait as opposed to two or three. Remember to also stay after the credits. 9.5/10",9,4,13,27 April 2018
Get Out," GET OUT and see the film!
","Seriously, if you've pondered on whether seeing the film or not, please do yourself a favor and go see it. It's worth the admission. Jordan Peele, known for Key & Peele makes an excellent first impression in his directorial debut. He brings a fresh take on typical horror movies, implementing the obvious, but subtle racial tension and sharp satirical wit. A young African-American man named Chris visits his girlfriend Rose's mysterious Caucasian family estate, and from there on a series of increasingly disturbing discoveries lead him to a truth that he never could have imagined. In most horror films guys like Chris, exceptionally played by Daniel Kaluuya, end up dead really quick. It's an overused cliché, but it is reversed in this film, and to see an African-American male protagonist front and center is a nice change of pace within the horror genre. What's also great is that the film showcases his paranoia, he knows something is up, he's not blind to it. He makes the smart decisions and plays it cool, he isn't some dumb protagonist ready to be next on the chopping block. Kaluuya is great at playing a doomed man who thinks he's in control of the entire situation. On the surface he looks confident and at ease, as he has sharp eyes taking notes on everyone's behavior and it doesn't take a genius to figure out something is odd. You're never quite sure what's going on at the girlfriend's home, whether everyone's involved in some sinister plot or if its just some awkward misunderstanding. But it's clear that something is happening, and Chris is the most normal person here, and as the audience member we're not given any reason to doubt him.Kaluuya also has great chemistry with Allison Williams who portrays his girlfriend Rose. They both get to showcase their moments as a couple together very well, and I'm quite positive they'll get more recognition into furthering their careers. The characters are fleshed out immaculately, with Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener in their best performances to date. Caleb Landry Jones also has an appropriately, intensely edgy role, a tad bit over the top I might add. Whenever the film needs a short moment of humor, a lot of the film's levity comes from Lil Rel Howery as Rod, Chris' best friend. In some areas, the film does take its time to get things going, but Peele strategically knows where to add elements into the film to build up the tension. For example he knows where to showcase creepy sound effects and music cues. He successfully increases the level of anxiety, relying upon the fear of something not visible to the naked eye. It is reminiscent in the ways of a Hitchcock or Kubrick film.Get Out embraces the stereotypes and embraces them very well. Social commentary is very relevant and poignant in the film. Peele allows the viewer to see prejudice head on. When all is said and done, you now have a bird's eye view of what is really wrong with society. The film definitely shines light on the aspect of ourselves that a lot of us would rather not acknowledge or be in denial of. As much as we try to convince ourselves that we're above forming preconceptions and stereotyping, we aren't. Peele uses this as a tool to bleed out anxiety and tension which very much fuels the entire film. All the slow build up leads to one of the most satisfying climaxes I've seen in a while in a horror film. Peele is the true star of this film. He brings a distinctive visual style, carving out the film's creative path with some dark reveals, addresses the variable levels of racism with subtly, pays homage to some great horror films, and at times very humorous as well.There have been some quality horror films of this era, Sinister, Paranormal Activity(not the cash grab sequels), The Conjuring, Lights Out, but Get Out is one of those horror films that is intellectually engaging and self-aware. For me it ranks up there with Scream and Cabin in the Woods. 9/10",9,7,17,4 March 2017
Dumb and Dumber," It's pretty innovated if you think about it.
","Dumb & Dumber is a movie I pop in and see about two or three times a year. It never gets old and it still holds up to this day. Dumber & Dumber also happens to be in my top five comedies. Ever. It's well titled film and for the film's purpose, it succeeds. It's a stupid movie and it knows it is, and that's why it's so great. First of all the two leads are charming, despite their child-like nature and lack of common sense. Jim Carrey, as Jeff Daniels once put it, is a tornado of comedic wit and timing. Speaking of Jeff Daniels, his character Harry is very good contrast to Jim Carrey's character Lloyd. Carrey is energetic and it's a performance full of power, while Daniels is a bit more mellow and a teeny tiny bit smarter than Lloyd, just a little bit and plays off Carrey, which works well because he's not competing with his performance against Jim, he's just following along. They play off each other very well, and it's just damn funny. The plot is pretty basic and simple, but it's the situations they get into that are real gold. Granted I haven't seen every movie out there or every comedy movie ever made, but with that being said, there are only a couple of films that have made me laugh with tears coming out of my eyes, and there are, not just one, or two but three moments that do exactly that, one of them is the infamous scene toilet scene. The film slightly drags near the ending and gets a bit dull, but the supporting cast is good, including Lauren Holly who plays Mary Sawnson, the love interest of both Lloyd and Harry, mainly Lloyd who considered her the love of his life after he drives her to the airport as his job as a limo driver. She is the reason why the dimwits decide to take a road trip to see her after she purposefully leaves her briefcase at the airport. Mike Starr is also a bright spot and has humorous moments with Carrey and Daniels. I firmly believe this film is a comedic gem and absolutely deserves to in the Hall of Fame of all time great comedies or at least be mentioned or in the conversation. For film to be this stupid, but to also be so funny with all the gags clicking and everything firing in right cylinders, it is impossible to resist. It's one of Jim Carrey's best film's as well as Jeff Daniels. 8.5/10",8,1,2,14 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Disappointing if you're a hardcore fan, not if you're a general fan.
","Meh.I genuinely enjoyed The Force Awakens. I know it had some problems, but it gets a pass due to nostalgia, and J.J. Abrams capitalizing on making it a 'throwback' film(even though it was a bit of a rehash). But those nostalgia glasses are off now.You know, I'm not the biggest Star Wars junkie, that would be my brother, he's a walking encyclopedia when it comes to Star Wars, but I have read the expanded universe comics/stories and played the games, Knights of the Old Republic, Jedi Academy, etc. and they captivated me with their rich story-telling, complex characters, and I do miss it.As a minor Star Wars fan who has some knowledge of the cancelled EU, I'm not sure if I'm completely satisfied with what Kathleen Kennedy and Disney are doing to this franchise. If anything it shows what Kennedy a successful business woman and the corporate heads at Disney are capable of doing to their directors (with the exception of J. J. Abrams), a process that chewed up other directors like Phil Lord and Chris Miller in the upcoming Han Solo film, Colin Trevorrow for Star Wars 9, and to an extent Gareth Edwards of Rogue One.I got to start with Luke Skywalker. After seeing this movie twice to let it all sink in, I finally understood what Mark Hamill meant when he said in an interview that he fundamentally disagreed with what everything Rian Johnson was doing. I have to agree with him. This is not the Luke Skywalker I grew up with. Having said that, looking at it from another perspective it's a very unique take on his character, but I just cannot get on board with a Luke Skywalker who gave up so easily, hid like a coward, and had the thought of striking down his own nephew in fear of what he might become. Luke of all people, saved a mass murdering, genocidal Sith lord from the dark side, convert him back to the light against all odds, who just happened to be his father, and all of a sudden because he felt the darkness within his nephew he thought about killing him to prevent it from happening? Again with that being said, Hamill does a great job. My attention was toward him the entire film and it was all I really cared about.Also a fan-boy nitpick here, but the absence of Luke's green lightsaber bothered me a lot. We only see it in flashbacks when he considers killing Kylo Ren, but in the 'final showdown' near the end with him and Kylo, I disliked that fact that it was his father's blue lightsaber. Not only because the saber was shown to be damaged by the end of it, but it should have been a dead giveaway to Kylo Ren being that he and Rey fought for it. That green lightsaber to me signifies Luke's growth as a character in the original trilogy. Also that showdown with him and Kylo Ren, the fact that it was just a projection of himself instead of a real duel was such a wasted opportunity. The lack of decent lightsaber fights are quite annoying as well. Don't get me started on his 'death' where he just fades away at the end. Luke's look, his appearance, and his change in personality by the end of it, during his showdown with Kylo is what we could have had in Star Wars 9. I guess their plan was to kill each and every single original cast member a film at a time? I know they can't do this forever I get all that, but there could have been better ways for their exit.The other cast members are fine. Carrie Fisher saves her best for last, rest in peace and may the force be with her, I only wish she shared more screen time with her brother. I did enjoy Rey and Kylo Ren's relationship in the film. Driver and Ridley bring their A-game and their performances are spot on. I'm intrigued with what they do next with Rey and Kylo. Driver in particular was able to make his character despicable, but yet at the same time I found to be rooting for him every now and then. Ridley carries this franchise now and she's more than capable of doing so.I found this time Finn's arc of the film to be weak. Nor did I really enjoy his relationship with Kelly Marie Tran's Rose. I felt that they were really unnecessary in the overall story. Oscar Isaac does a little more here in this film, but he barely files at all. He spends his time being a hot head more than he does on his X-Wing. At times I also felt that the resistance was a bit incompetent. Wasn't particularly fond of Benicio del Toro's DJ as well, and Captain Phasma is officially the Boba Fett of this new trilogy, another wasted potential. For those who were anticipating Snoke, well prepared to be shocked, but also kinda letdown.The special effects are great, cinematography and production design was a treat to look at. I don't really need to elaborate on that. Johnson also captures the aesthetic look and feel of the original Star Wars trilogy. I get what Johnson was trying to do, but for me I'm just not on board, not entirely.There are plenty of decent moments throughout, and it's competently made, but at the same time there were a lot of great opportunities to take inspiration from the cancelled EU, but they just don't seize it, I don't understand why.I think if you're someone who likes the Star Wars films, and knows only about the films you'll probably enjoy this film, but if you're that hardcore fan who knows the ins and outs of this universe even before this new trilogy started I think you'll be disappointed with what they're doing.4.5/10",4,0,0,16 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," A roller coaster ride from start to finish.
","This movie is pure popcorn entertainment. I loved this film, it's probably my second favorite film, behind Captain America: The Winter Soldier in the Phase 2 of the MCU. Chris Pratt leads the film with great comedic timing and snappy one-liners in the role of Peter Quill/Star-Lord. He's a very likable jerk/noble/con-man. He is the leader of these unusual bunch, and does a commendable job of bringing this group together and united to fight for whats right. Zoe Saldana is great portraying Gamora, showcasing she's somewhat conflicted, also she's not as cold and heartless like her sister Nebula, greatly portrayed by Karen Gillian. Dave Bautista brings out the best of Drax, full of honor and also full of ego. Now the two stars in this film are Rocket Raccoon and Groot, respectively voiced by Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. I guarantee that everyone(mostly everyone) will fall in love with these characters. They are basically Han Solo and Chewbacca. They're very lovable and have the most memorable moments. Both actors bring such life within their vocal talents. Action sequences dazzle and are pure eye candy, as well as the visual effects. The film is paced very well and very fast, but at times it can get overwhelming, and a couple of action sequences can be dragged out a little. I absolutely ate up Lee Pace's performance as Ronan. It was over the top, corny, and deliciously evil. He held nothing back, he was aggressive and he knew what he wanted. The only problem is that I wish he was just a little more fleshed out. I wanted more of Ronan, he is by far one of my favorite villains so far in the MCU. I was disappointed to see him 'die,' but I have hope that someday he'll make his return. Djimon Hounsou has a relatively small role as Korath. I would have also liked to see more of him as well. He was kind of a throw away character. Glenn Close, John C. Reilly, and Benicio Del Toro both have a small supporting role, but their roles do serve a purpose for the plot, where as Hounsou does not, especially if he plays a supporting character along the lead villain Ronan and Nebula's side. What James Gunn does very well is managing humor and providing real moments for all the characters. The core five are fleshed out more than I expected and are not two dimensional, therefore as an audience member you're able to go on a personal journey with them. It's not overdone, but there is just enough for you to care about all these characters. Again, I just wish there could have been more Ronan. This is Marvel's Star Wars. That may be an overstatement, but it truly is. It's filled with fun humor, fun action, and dazzling visuals. Also with some nice tender character moments. Can I also mention the awesome appearance of Thanos voiced by Josh Brolin. It was worth the wait and I can't wait to see more of him in the future. What Kevin Feige and the rest of the amazing crew at Marvel are doing are so impressive. They took a property like Guardians of the Galaxy, cream of the crop C or D-Listers, and speared them into an A or B-List territory. Props to them, these guys care for the source material(except Iron Man 3 lol) and really know what they're doing. I attended San Diego Comic-Con for the seventh straight year and their presentation at Comic-Con as always is great, Avengers: Age of Ultron and Ant-Man footage both looked incredible. I truly believe, for anyone who is a Marvel fan, we have been spoiled by them. Anyways go see this film. IMAX 3D is also very good, if it's not the fake IMAX like in some AMC theaters. As always stay after the credits, there's a humorous scene involving a certain duck. 8/10",8,1,4,1 August 2014
Jurassic World," The novelty is gone, it's flawed, but enjoyable.
","Now right off the bat, this is the best Jurassic Park sequel. But that really isn't saying too much. It's been almost 22 years since the original film and the franchise is showing it's age. How many times are we going to see scientists make the same mistake over and over again? You can only recycle familiar plot points so many times, the only thing that was intriguing and refreshing to watch was the realization of John Hammond's dream coming true, and the fact that because of all this technology and the fact that dinosaurs exist, people just don't seem that amazed by it and the Jurassic World park has to have a new attraction in order to spike up attendance. It's implied that the novelty has worn off for the people in that universe, I think the same can be said about for us as the audience. With paper-thin characters and very clichéd I might add, you don't particularly care about anyone, except maybe Chris Pratt's Owen Grady. I disliked almost everyone in the cast simply because they were just fodder like most Jurassic Park characters are, also I'd like to add that the comedy felt slightly forced. But Pratt's Owen is different. He doesn't have the cool, hip, and eccentric persona as Ian Malcolm or the appeal of Alan Grant, but he's the only character that I found myself to get on board with despite him coming off as a little stiff. He also does add a bit of Star-Lord charm within his performance. Bryce Dallas Howard, Vincent D'Onofrio, and the rest are just plain unbearable. Also, how many times is a Jurassic Park film going to involve children, I'm very sick of it, we're four films into the franchise and they keep involving children. It's obvious I wasn't very fond of Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson.What saves this film are the dinosaurs, as always. At times it becomes more of a monster film, but it's still fun to watch all the carnage and the chaos that ensues when everything goes to hell. The last maybe 20-30 minutes of this film really kicks it into high gear. The dinosaurs look as great as ever and the special effects are first rate. The new Indominus Rex is terrifying and brutal. Allowing it to camouflage was a smart move on the developers of the film. The velociraptors are always fun, but I must say I think I liked them a lot more in Jurassic World. I totally bought into relationship the raptors had with Owen. It didn't seem as unbelievable as I thought it would. Never have we seen raptors react this way with a human so it was quite a refreshing take. The usage of the Pteranodons, Dimorphodons and Mosasaur were all used well, but there is an awesome T-Rex scene that will just bring goosebumps and nostalgia joy to many Jurassic Park fans. This is a fun summer popcorn flick. Although the flaws are apparent and it's very formulaic, it's still hard not to have fun and director Colin Trevorrow does the best job he can. I'm open to more chapters as long as it doesn't involve more children in peril, dumb scientists and corporate officials, lack of common sense, and thinly written protagonists. I will admit that can be hard to achieve, but I don't think it's impossible and an idea of a possible fifth film was played upon in the film so perhaps it has the potential to be solid? 6.3/10",6,10,25,11 June 2015
Logan," Third time is the charm.
","By far this is the best Wolverine stand alone film. I guess third time really is the charm as X- Men Origins: Wolverine is an abysmal mess, and The Wolverine is just mediocre at best. What always held Wolverine back was the PG-13 rating. Now with this R rating, everything makes a ginormous difference. The smart and bold script written by James Mangold, Scott Frank and Michael Green affords Hugh Jackman the opportunity to totally reinvent his portrayal of Logan/Wolverine, and the result is one of the best performances of Jackman's career, and ranks up there with one of the most impressive superhero movies of this decade.It's very layered, and although at times there are a couple moments where it can drag, a lot of it is devoted to characterization of our leads. Patrick Stewart turns in one of the most thoughtful performances as Professor Xavier. Every scene with his banter and relationship with Logan is golden. Stephen Merchant also has a nice supporting role as Caliban. Boyd Holbrook has a very good asshole role as the ruthless Donald Pierce. A little underdeveloped, but he comes off as someone you love to hate and he does a good job selling that. Dafne Keen is Laura/X-23, and she is a superstar in the film. Granted she doesn't have much dialog, but she rules every action scene she's in and in the moments that she does talk, she doesn't come off as if she's reading the dialog in the script, but actually evoking the emotion that it needs. James Mangold brings the tone, the pacing and the feel of a Western, particularly the movie Shane. Mangold is no stranger to westerns as he directed the great 3:10 to Yuma remake. Even in the set pieces, most of the film does not take place in a large cityscape, but rather in a desert like scenery, the road, the woods, a lonely convenient store, etc., making the film feel more isolated. This is an extremely violent film I might add, in which guts and blood are spilled and splatted everywhere. This time there's a visceral punch every time Logan brings out his claws to slice and dice. Logan is a deep and somber character study of Logan himself. He and Xavier are old, withered and been though a lot. Even when Logan reluctantly honors Xavier's wishes to protecting Laura, it's clear after years of being bruised and battered, all he really wants to do is to drink and forget, to the point where he is numb to everything and anything resembling human feelings is irrelevant to him. The R rating is organic and doesn't feel out of place. Violence happens for a reason as it serves the story very well and Logan does not hold back in this one.After seventeen years, and nine appearances as Wolverine(including this one), Hugh Jackman goes out with a bang. His dedication and commitment to playing this character for so long is a remarkable feat, so thank you Hugh Jackman for bringing out the best in you, even if some of the other movies weren't exactly great. However, after seeing this film, I'm not ready for him to leave just yet. This and Deadpool are so far the best entries Fox has provided since X2: X-Men United. If only Fox can just come to Jackman's house with a dump truck full of cash. I hope Ryan Reynolds does everything he can to have him return for a Wolverine/Deadpool crossover, or perhaps Kevin Feige works his magic? Unlikely, but one can hope. This is the Wolverine film I wanted to see. Better late than never. Hugh Jackman gives it his all, and I think it's very Oscar worthy. Yup I said it.9/10",9,2,6,4 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Whedon had an impossible task, but he pulls through and exceeds expectations.
","Soon after the first Avengers film was released, I could not wait for a sequel, and finally it's here, and it's all I could have hoped for. They're back with a few new additions, and finally a worthy(my favorite villain in the comics) foe, Ultron an AI bent on destroying humanity, at the same time putting the team in despair. I'll start with some of the nitpicks. This is very rare, but I think Age of Ultron could have used an extra 10-15 minutes. Whedon in an interview stated he cut out some back story for the twins, which I think was a mistake, I wasn't particularly fond of them in the beginning, but as the film progressed they grew on me a lot. This time around Whedon brings a butt-load of action, and better action I might add, but while in the first film there were moments that lasted too long to take a breather from the action, in Age of Ultron he doesn't allow us a moment to catch our breath too often, very sporadically. But, he finds away to keep things interesting. Barely shorter than the first film, it's still a long film regardless and it does not feel like it. This time around Whedon allows The Avengers to be The Avengers. They're together a lot more and their dynamic and relationship is a joy to watch. The original six, Downey Jr., Evans, Hemsworth, Ruffalo, Johansson, and Renner are all fantastic. Johansson's Black Widow and Renner's Hawkeye in particular have quite an impressive arc in this film and an argument can be made that Hawkeye is the main character, there's also a brilliant, fun tongue in cheek moment he has with Scarlet Witch. Also he got the best lines in the film aside from James Spader who by the way is an excellent villain. Ultron in this film has a personality. He is a scene stealer and commands the screen every time he's in it. He's got some humor, but I would have liked more menace within him. There are two moments where he became very threatening, and the film could have used a bit more. Although his plan for destruction is quite impactful and quite intimidating, he sorta feels lost, as do some of the characters because the film is so saturated and overstuffed to a degree. I'd also like to mention that Samuel L. Jackson and Cobie Smulders serve their roles well, but in a populated film like this they're roles are obviously reduced a bit, and to my surprise Don Cheadle's War Machine finally gets some action, despite it being small. The new additions Elizabeth Olsen, Aaron Johnson, and Paul Bettany are solid and only bring extra flare into the film's ingredients. Scarlet Witch is quite well realized, a little more than Quicksilver I might I add, and she is fun to watch and causes some inner damage to the team. Speaking of Quicksilver, Whedon wisely tries not to match or outdo the X-Men Quicksilver, and in doing so he's more grounded and a little more developed than Singer's, who just used him for an impressive sequence. Paul Bettany's Vision is also another scene stealer. He was incredible in the film, and as a last minute surprise he does not disappoint. Vision is arguably one of my favorite characters growing up and Whedon works him into the film the way I'd hope it be. Kudos to Whedon. I mentioned the action before in my nitpicks, but the action here is top notch and Whedon finds a way to keep you focused. A lot of teamwork is involved in almost every action set piece and you feel what's at stake as the team also takes cue to actually save civilians. It's just a fireworks of action displayed on screen and the scale of it is so very impressive. Hulkbuster vs Hulk in particular is a standout sequence, as does everything that has to do with Vision. But aside from the action, Whedon manages to juggle every single character and somehow make them as relevant as they can be, some obviously more than others, but it's just amazing to see it all unfold. He understands these characters as the heavy moments work well and he never forgets the heroes' humanity. There are also hints to films in the future, but they don't saturate the main plot, but enough to keep you aware. Joss Whedon had an incredible challenge to make a sequel to the first film. I think one can argue that the novelty wore off a bit because in the first film, it was something that was never been seen before and as it was released it was, and I use the term 'done already,' and going into this sequel, it won't be able to recapture that magic of the first because 'it's been done already.' I know I sound like I'm fanboying, and that's because I am(no apologizes), but if you overlook all that, the film is as good as it gets. It's almost impossible to make a movie like this and not have it feel repetitive. Not to mention, it's impossible to have so many characters and have a completely satisfying characterization for all of them, and I think in the hands of another filmmaker who not only writes, but also directs would more or less likely fail. Joss got the job done, but one can notice corporate meddling was taken place, as it is a big crowd drawing film for everyone. I think the Russo's and the writing team of Markus and McFeely are the prefect candidates to take over the glorious Avenger films. I believe they nail the darker tone a lot better than anyone else. The film has no end-credits stinger, but stick around for the mid-credit scene. It's so good. 7.5/10",7,32,68,22 April 2015
The Dark Knight," Powered by Ledger's performance.
","Christopher Nolan's followup on Batman Begins delivers.This time around, Nolan raises the stakes and provides more energy more tension and a lot more flare. Aside from The Avengers, The Dark Knight is a film that I had eagerly anticipated and also had unfairly high expectations, all thanks to the easter egg scene at the end of Batman Begins. Christian Bale returns as Bruce Wayne and he does a commendable job. He again masks his real persona to the public and he longs to be with Rachel Dawes and sees Harvey Dent as a suitable replacement when Gotham no longer needs a hero who wears a mask. This time around Bruce Wayne is under more pressure and he faces his toughest challenge yet as Batman as he is put into impossible situations by his foes. The supporting cast brings the best of their abilities. Maggie Gyllenhaal delivers her lines a little more effectively than Katie Holmes did. It's a shame for Holmes, a bad career move to not star in this, as I didn't completely dislike her in the first film. Michael Cain also provides an excellent supporting role as Alfred, again supporting Bruce in his crusade on crime. Morgan Freeman again provides the film's humor and brings in some levity to this dark film. Gary Oldman again is sharp as Commissioner Gordon, helping Batman on his war against crime. Eric Roberts also has a meaty role as mob boss Sal Maroni. Things always get worse before they get better in Gotham. So with that in mind, lets talk about the villains. I mentioned before that Liam Neeson's Ra's al Ghul is overlooked, I think Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Dent is the second most overlooked villain. Eckhart's arc in the film is beautifully handled and Nolan does a nice job showcasing his corruption and downfall. Harvey Dent is Gotham's 'White Knight,' their savior. Working with the Batman and Gordon, they cleaned up the streets quite well, but to see all that mean nothing as soon as he becomes Two-Face is just depressing, and when he is Two-Face, he is truly menacing. A tragedy indeed.Speaking of tragedy, it's a shame that Ledger died before the film's release. This is Heath's movie. His Academy Award win for Best Supporting Actor is rightfully given. His win is also not just a pity win out of his death, but because he really outshine all the other nominees that year. Right off the bat Ledger steals the film in the opening scene. I did not see Heath Ledger in this film, but only the Joker. He completely disappears in the role and it's just a thrill to watch on screen. Nolan and Ledger's take on Batman's arch-nemisis is full of complex layers. The Joker's stance on chaos, anarchy, order, and mortality of an ordinary human being makes it psychologically interesting. He has no order, he is all about chaos, he doesn't care about money, as a matter of fact he has no typical criminal motive, all he wants is to watch the world burn. Ultimately, in this film the Joker has a point and that is scary, something uncommon from a villain in most comic-book films. Nolan does a great job of balancing Joker and Two-Face very well. One would think Two-Face would not get enough lime light, but he does, so credit to him and his team of writers. This time around Nolan and his cinematographer Wally Pfister do a better job showcasing the fight choreography. Now one can finally see Batman show off his martial arts expertise. Nolan again shows that Batman is more than a fighter, but also a detective and he's got more arsenal in his hands. The action sequences are a lot more action-packed and paced extremely well. Each action set piece will have you tensed up. I remember I was literally gripping onto my seat as I watched it the first time in theaters. I only had two gripes about the film. One of them is Bale's Batman voice, which is common among many. To be honest, I really liked his Batman voice in Batman Begins. It was intimidating and I would imagine that it'd actually scare someone. But here, I mean, did Bale not watch his own performance in Batman Begins? I've gotten used to it now, but I recall it bothered me the first couple times. Speaking of Batman, even though Ledger's performance is brilliant, this film is essentially very Joker focused. I feel as though Batman gets the short end of the stick. Even the Harvey Dent/Two-Face subplot feels more coherent and apparent than Bruce Wayne's arc. I think I was definitely spoiled by Batman Begins, for my taste I think the film could use a little more Batman in the film. Nevertheless The Dark Knight is an extraordinary piece of filmmaking. It's very Empire Strikes Back and Godfather Pt. II like. This movie is seemed like an impossible task, but a group of extremely talented people managed to make this film work. The pacing is brisk and it doesn't even feel like two and a half hours. There are tons of suspense as Nolan keeps you on the edge, just when you think the story will end up in one particular way, it does a 360 and completely throws you off on multiple occasions. You'll wonder how it'll all play out by the end of the film. The Dark Knight is a landmark achievement. It is a film where it showed many general movie going audience that the superhero genre is capable of being much more. Deep, complex, exciting and a rich viewing experience, The Dark Knight is definitely a film that deserves it's merits and rightfully deserves to be in the top five discussions of the best comic-book adapted superhero epic. 9.5/10",9,3,5,30 January 2015
Selma," Fueled by a gripping performance from Oyelowo.
","Film critic Richard Roeper said it best. Selma is a film that provides a history lesson, but doesn't feel like a history lecture. Not one bit. I foresee a bright future for the director Ava DuVernay and actor David Oyelowo. For DuVernay's second or third effort, it's quite an achievement what she manages to do with this film. For nearly fifteen years she's been working in studio marketing and publicity and her film speaks for itself. She directs the film with flare and keeps the film emotionally grounded. Even though at times you think you know whats coming, DuVernay keeps us at bay and also provides us with some neat surprises. Also give Paul Webb some credit with his sharp screenplay. David Oyelowo truly embodies MLK. More often than not Selma tends to focus on something not many people tend to expect in a movie about MLK. The script showcases his doubts and insecurities. Oyelowo comes through with a deeply felt and compelling performance. He also nails Dr. King's speech patterns, voice, even his posture and shows that Dr. King has his flaws, but is a compassionate person. I find it hard that anyone will be able to take their eyes off him. What a performance. Shame that it was overlooked by the Academy. Everyone in the cast brings their 'A-game.' I liked Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King, but I wanted just a little more of her character, but she makes up the most of what she has. Oprah Winfrey is solid as Annie Lee Cooper. She has a very substantial role and has a nice subplot. Other particular standouts are Tom Wilkinson as President Lyndon B. Johnson, Tim Roth as George Wallace. Selma takes itself very seriously, there isn't much humor to be found, and any break from documenting its events are often downbeat character moments. However DuVernay's talent is in full blaze. This film is very heavy, but it always grabs your attention, often in the hands of Oyelowo's performance. The March 7th, 'Bloody Sunday' sequence is brutal to watch, but DuVernay and cinematographer Bradford Young achieve and deliver quite an intense and impactful set piece. Literally, it hits you in the gut as we watch history forged in flesh and blood.I am still shocked that this film received so little recognition by the Academy. Oyelowo and DuVernay should have been nominated at the very least. I believe you can blame that to Paramount Pictures as I heard that they did not deliver the screeners on time for the Academy voters. It's a pity. By the time we arrive at the film's postscript, revealing the fates of several people chronicled by Selma, it's almost impossible not to be moved by their courage and sacrifice. Selma to me, is not just a biopic, but rather a film that celebrates a community action through the eyes of Martin Luther King Jr. This movie sadly, could not be more relevant right now. 9.3/10",9,52,87,20 January 2015
Beauty and the Beast," It's serviceable.
","I'm not a huge fan or musicals to be honest, but every now and then I find myself to be entertained by some of them. That being said when I was a child I enjoyed a few Disney animation classics and Beauty & the Beast is definitely one of them. During the hype train I found myself anticipating the film the more I heard about it. Emma Watson's casting as Belle definitely brought my attention to the film. As did the casting Ewan McGergor, Sir Ian McKellen, Stanley Tucci, and Emma Thompson. The set photos and promotional images also grabbed my attention too.I'm happy to report that it's a serviceable adaptation of the animated movie. Most of the cast delivers with the exception of Luke Evans. He definitely looks like he's having fun in the role as Gaston, but he is so cartoonishly two-dimensional and so over the top. I just could not take him seriously every time he showed up on screen. Aside from him everyone does a great job. Emma Watson brings it, and her singing isn't too bad either. Stand out for me was Ewan McGergor as Lumiere. He brought a lot of swagger and personality to the role. His banter and exchange with Ian McKellen's Cogsworth brings a lot of humor in their relationship. I also really enjoyed Dan Steven's performance as the Beast. Singing in the beginning of the film is a little bit of a turn-off. Not because the actors couldn't sing, but it's one number after another, and some of the verses were kind of pointless as well. But once the plot gets going it becomes more tolerable. In the middle near to the end, the film know when to pick it's moments to showcase a number. Like I said I'm not the biggest fan of musicals, but the annoyance is only temporary. Some of the actors are kinda there without much to do, despite some amusing moments, like Kevin Kline, Stanley Tucci, Audra McDonald, and Gugu Mbatha-Raw. The romance is solid. It never felt too over the top, and the chemistry for the most part was there. I believe making people laugh and showcasing romance is something hard to convey for any movie. Beauty & the Beast does a commendable job at it, however while I never felt like Belle and Beast's relationship felt force, I wish that a little more was given to them. The film does showcase their bonding, but most of it are montages. Everything set up for their romance was just almost, almost executed with perfection. I also wish I got to see more out of Dan Steven's Beast as well. The film hits in high gears once the film introduces him. Special effects and production design are first rate. Yes there are moments where you can tell it's CGI, but it's not that noticeable that it's going to distract you. Costumes are fabulous too look at and the actors are well lit. Director Bill Condon does an excellent job showcasing the fantasy land, it's visually pleasing and enriching. The ball-room dance sequence with Beast and Belle is done with justice too.At times Beauty & the Beast can feel cluttered and overproduced eye-candy, but the film is a very faithful adaptation of the animated film. Aside from a little backstory from Belle and the gay character LeFou played by Josh Gad(which is handled well to be honest), it really doesn't bring a lot new to the table. Which is fine for some, cause why fix what isn't broken, but that works for and against the film. Among other live adaptations, I'd rank this below or evenly with Cinderella, but definitely much more entertaining than Maleficent or the Alice in Wonderland films. Odd that both Cinderella and Beauty & the Beast are basic retellings that work for the most part, but Maleficent and Alice in Wonderland try to be new re-imaginings that just crumble. Perhaps Little Mermaid or Mulan might find the striking balance of both. 6.6/10",6,0,2,23 March 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Serviceable fun.
","Vol. 2 is not as good as the first. Lets get that out of the way, but there are moments in the film that work better than the first, despite an uneven and overstuffed plot. The crew are at it, and they're just as good as they were in the first film. Chris Pratt leads the team with his charm and charisma, which just oozes on screen. Zoe Saldana is great as well. She's got a lot more to do with her sister Nebula played by Karen Gillian. I didn't think their relationship was established well in the first film, but here in the sequel it's explored more which is a plus. Dave Bautista's acting is a lot better too. I felt the delivery of certain lines within the first film were kinda dry, but here he delivers them with more natural ease. The comedy involving Drax also felt more natural too, but this time around he isn't involved in a lot of action sequences besides the opening of the film, which is a huge disappointment. Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel do excellent jobs projecting their voices to Rocket and Groot. Aside from Pom Klementieff, the supporting characters however, they are the one's who shine. This to me was Yondu's film, as much as it was Hawkeye's in Age of Ultron. Michael Rooker totally brings his acting chops into full flare. James Gunn gave him a nice solid arc to his character and it's quite touching. We see a lot more of Yondu and who he is. He shares most of his screen time with Rocket, and the two come to a realization that they are a lot more similar than they think. More backstory is also fleshed out with his character involving Sylvester Stallone's Starhawk. Yondu's right hand man Kraglin played by Sean Gunn, James Gunn's brother also has way more to do in this one. Gunn also gives Karen Gillian's Nebula a full story with something to contribute. While I thought she was kind of disregarded in Vol.1, here I finally got to know her better. Her backstory and her motives are fleshed out and we finally get to see her interact with Gamora a lot more. Their complicated love/hate relationship doesn't ever bring the movie down. It's handled eloquently and doesn't get too over the top. The same can't be said with Mantis played by Pom Klementieff. It's not her performance really, it's just how the character was handled. I thought the naive attitude and characteristics she presented felt forced and overplayed. The film already tries to showcase how cute and naive Baby Groot is so I didn't feel like the film needed another character who does that. She does contribute to the plot however so kudos to Gunn for figuring all that out, but I would have preferred an iteration of Mantis more closer to the comics, who is slightly more mature with martial arts background, who could have easily been a body guard to Ego in the film, rather than some servant. Speaking of Ego, I enjoyed Kurt Russell's Ego. He brought a sense of warmth as Peter's father. I bought into his character within a few scenes, simply because Russell knows how to deliver his lines effectively. Chris Pratt also effectively delivers on his performance anytime he has a scene with Ego. Without any spoilers Ego and Star-Lord's arcs in the climax are what salvages the film from what is a draggy and choppy middle act. As for the villains, Taserface and Ayesha played by Chris Sullivan and Elizabeth Debicki, they don't bring too much into the table, but they also bring enough. They don't have much to do, but in a film that's got so many moving parts, Gunn again finds a way to have them be apart of the story. The visual effects dazzle and the color palette is bright and vivid. I commend the hardworking visual effects artists who probably didn't get much sleep working on this film. Action set pieces are awesome and fun to watch, just wish Drax had more to do in that department. Aside from the occasional 'been there, done that,' feel to the film and a draggy second half, there is still enough to enjoy, with a few new elements sprinkled in. Gunn still manages to make a cohesive and entertaining film despite it being really uneven. I would hope that Vol. 3 would have a new tone and feel to it. It isn't Marvel's finest, but it's serviceable, not as terrible as the first two Thor films and the last two Iron Man films, but falls somewhere along the rankings with Ant-Man or Age of Ultron. Stick around for the credits, there are five and they're not setting the seeds for the future really, but they're fun little segments. One of which perplexes me in a good way, and if you know the rights issues between Sony, Fox, and Marvel/Disney, you know exactly what I'm talking about. It was quite surreal and makes me wonder what other surprises are in store for the future of Phase 4, or whatever our Marvel king Kevin Feige decides to call it. 7/10",7,2,5,2 May 2017
Whiplash," Solid performances from the two leads.
","This films takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotions. This film is carried by the two leads. Miles Teller is stellar and J.K. Simmons delivers the best performance of his career as of now. I haven't seen director Damien Chazelle's previous works, but I'll be keeping an eye out for anything he makes in the future. This is story that a lot of people can relate to. Andrew Neyman(Teller) is a talented drummer, and is committed to excellence and pursues to be the best of the best. His teacher Terence Fletcher(Simmons) is equally known for his teaching talents as for his terrifying methods. He leads the top jazz ensemble in the school. Fletcher discovers Andrew and transfers the aspiring drummer into his band, pushing him to his limits with mental and physical abuse.What grabbed me in the film is the similar experience Andrew goes through, with my experience with my family and at school. I'm an art student, and as corny as it sounds, my parents and teachers would push me to the limit to see if I can achieve greatness. So with that being said, the film asks many questions, just how far are you willing to go to achieve what you aspire to be? How bad do you want it? And is it worth it? The film also asks what is great art? Objectively and subjectively. All this pondered around my head and the story isn't even convoluted. It asks the right questions relating to the film. Miles Teller's performance is nothing short of amazing. His performance alone matches J.K. Simmons. He works hard to please himself and to please his instructor Fletcher. You see him go through so much and he pours his blood, sweat, and tears to become the best he can be, so much so that he puts off his relationship with his girlfriend Nicole(Melissa Benoist) to focus on his career. There are tender moments with Andrew and Fletcher, but even more tender moments with his father played by Paul Reiser who has an excellent supporting role. In Andrew's eyes, he loves his father, but ultimately sees him as a failure for not achieving his dreams to become a writer. Something he does not want to become. I loved his performance in this film, almost makes me somewhat optimistic about the new awful sounding Fantastic 4 reboot. J.K. Simmons is great as the intimidating instructor, a great all around drill-instructor/asshole performance. He is a bit over the top, which was kind of distracting. He's so unlikeable in the film and you can't help but wish he gets what he deserves, but also at the same time, he's endearing in a way when he gets his point across to Andrew on why he's so harsh and so brutal. Some pretty far-fetched events happen along the way, and that to me were the parts of the film that were apparent, out of place and almost too good to be true. But with that being said, the editing is fantastic as is the flow and pacing of the film. The performances are stellar, as are the drumming sequences.Whiplash is tense experience, watching a student with a talent go through all this torment is exhilarating and also a bit depressing. The film asks the right questions and although it gets a little preachy towards the end, it's not in your face. The performances alone is worth the admission. 8.8/10",8,1,3,4 December 2014
Scream 2," A horror sequel that defies all horror sequel expectations.
","Watching horror movies is one thing, but surviving them is another and Scream 2 sets the bar higher, and to be honest it should have ended here. Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson take it to high gear this time around. It's a lot less subtle and more in your face, which is a nice change of pace compared to the first film, cause you cannot do what you did in the first movie. Like the first film, it's hilarious with the self-aware characters and the jokes that come with it, but it still takes the kills very seriously. Craven and Williamson keeps the guessing game going and it still makes us wonder who the damn killer is. The main players, Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courteney Cox, and Jamie Kennedy are back. What makes this Scream special is that the cast is likable, perhaps in my own opinion a little more likable than the original. The last two don't have any characters that are as likable as first Scream and this sequel. All the cast are great. Jerry O'Connell, Timothy Olyphant, Elise Neal, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Liev Schreiber, etc. They all come to play and bring their A-game. You also feel for most of the cast. The script has fun making Derek, played by Jerry O'Connell a potential suspect. The film show's Sidney's rightful paranoia, like the little moments where Derek offers her a seat and she sits next to Timothy Olyphant's character Mickey. You can't help but maybe feel a little sorry for him, but yet ponder if he is behind all the killings. Williamson does a great job juggling all these characters. What I respect about Scream 2 is that it doesn't play it safe at all. It takes risks and makes no apologies. They kill off, who is arguably the most popular character in the series Randy Meeks. It takes balls to do that, but I'm glad they did. I love Randy, but his death just made Scream 2 that much more unpredictable and immediately the stakes are much higher. They didn't play it safe. Props to Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven. Some may ponder that Sidney and Randy were destined to be together, and probably should have died in the third film while they end up as a couple, but even if that may have been cool, killing him off in this sequel makes everything unpredictable and makes a bigger shocking impact. Speaking of impact, the killer reveals are quite a surprise. Mickey(Olyphant) was expected, but Craven and Williamson do a nice homage to Laurie Metcalf's Mrs. Loomis, Billy's mother. Breaking a rule of a serial killer typically being a male, as well as tributing other female killers in cinema, particularly Mrs. Voorhees from the Friday the 13th franchise.The first Scream is game changer, but in the second film, it solidified Sidney Prescott being poison. If you're friends with Sidney you die, like poor Randy Meeks. You would think all the main players are safe, but they're not, at one point you even think Dewey is toast. You just don't feel safe for anyone else, and what I love is that it spoofs itself, cause Randy's argument is that sequels, especially sequels to horror films are garbage, ironically making Scream 2 being one of the few horror sequels that is considered to be worthy compared many atrocious horror sequels that killed the genre. It's meta, even before people knew what meta was.9/10",9,4,5,3 September 2015
Jaws," A cinematic achievement.
","I know what some of you may think, the shark looks fake, sure it does, but put yourself into the shoes of a movie-goer in the summer of 1975.Jaws is one of the greatest films ever made, not because of it's technical achievement at the time being, but because how Steven Spielberg, frankly took a far-fetched idea and made it scary. Jaws has a simple story of a twenty-five foot great white shark terrorizing civilians of Amity Island. Eventually, the town's chief of police(Roy Scheider), a marine biologist(Richard Dreyfuss), and a fisherman(Robert Shaw) are tasked to taking down the shark. The film was known for have technical difficulties with the animatronic shark, but that was a blessing in disguise. Because of this, Spielberg manages to create tension and fear among the audience because you don't see the shark at all. Leaving your imagination to do all the work. The opening scene is downright terrifying hearing the woman screaming in agony, being dragged around by a shark we cannot see. Also the use of barrels was a stroke of genus by Spielberg and his team as it implied that the shark was near or present. What really makes this film work are the three leads. They share an impeccable chemistry between each other. Brody is a paranoid police chief, effectively portrayed by the great Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss is hilarious as the wisecracking marine biologist Matt Hooper, who frequently butt heads with the rough and tough fisherman Quint, brilliantly portrayed by Robert Shaw. The three leads make these character believable and so the audience can go on a real journey with them. I cannot see this film without Steven Spielberg. In the end he put all this together, with no script, no crew, technical malfunctions, and scrutiny. How Spielberg managed to pull this movie off under massive pressure is beyond me. It's a testament on how great he is. Give credit to the writers Peter Benchley, Carl Gottlieb, and uncredited writer Howard Sackler for providing the film's story and sharp dialog. Who can also forget the incredible score by John Williams. Outstanding. Along with Star Wars, Jaws was pivotal in establishing the modern Hollywood business model, and the start of the blockbuster trend. 10/10",10,13,17,3 August 2014
Kong: Skull Island," A serviceable, fun spring blockbuster.
","I'll start off by saying I enjoyed this more than Godzilla. That's not to say I disliked Godzilla, but every time something interesting or a really cool monster moment surfaces, it kept cutting away. Godzilla delivers in the finale, but what Kong does differently is that it isn't afraid to embrace those monster moments. Right off the bat, Kong is showcased front and center and it is pleasing eye-candy. Kong: Skull Island is action-packed, and director Jordan Vogt-Roberts has a keen eye for action. Cinematographer Larry Fong and the hard working special-effects artists produce some remarkable visuals. Kong combats a squad of helicopters who are swooping in formation. Vogt-Roberts doesn't overuse the slow-motion sequences, but he uses them at the right moment in the middle of the action. It never really cheapened all of the action set- pieces, it actually enhanced the experience. Lots of great creatures too, some deadly looking lizards things, a giant octopus, a giant spider, and some pre-historic looking birds. Kong himself looked fabulous. He's obviously the misunderstood monster as he is only protecting his turf and territory. He is ginormous, bigger than ever and it makes a difference. Kudos to the VFX team, there is a sense of scale and weight to Kong and all the other creatures in the film. The actors do their job commendably. Not much is fleshed out with any of these characters to be honest, but they do bring some gravitas to the film. Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, and John Goodman do their best to make their characters believable. Jackson in particular can be compared to Col. Kurtz in Apocalypse Now. Against all logic and odds, he's obsessed with his mission. John C. Reilly provides a lot of humor into the film as he is a WWII pilot, stranded on Skull Island for almost thirty years. Some characters are really there for exposition, particularly the short, not much to do roles played by Corey Hawkins and Tian Jing. I do want to point out that I appreciated Hiddleston and Larson's relationship in the film. While not fleshed out at all, it wasn't some typical Hollywood, forced down your throat romance, rather just a mutual respect for one another. Larson's character is also involved in the action, useful at times, and not just some damsel in distress. Some of the supporting roles of the soldiers played by Jason Mitchell, Shea Whigham, and Thomas Mann aren't as expendable as one would typically expect them to be so that was a nice surprise as well. It's no secret that Legendary and WB are creating a MonsterVerse with Kong, Godzilla, and all the other Toho creatures. They've got some franchise building to do, and for corporate film making, this movie goes through the checkmarks very well. Vogt-Roberts does a good job not making it feel like a 'filler' film to fill in the gaps, as a matter of fact it does feel like it stands on its own for the most part. He moves the story along from A to Z with a lot of eye candy action. The choice of music and the color palette he choose feels like a Vietnam/70's film. It does what it needs to do and it's a fun way to kill off two hours. Obviously stay through the credits. It's a nice tease. 7/10",7,7,13,13 March 2017
Scream," A first of it's kind.
","Back in the 90's horror movies were dead. Scream revitalized that genre for it's meta and self-aware take. Since Scream most movie have tried that meta, self-aware angle, some have been successful, but a lot haven't. We can all thank Scream for that. Give a lot of credit to Wes Craven's sense of direction, building scares and tension per each scene, and Kevin Williamson's original sharp script. He obviously had a brain child. It's also almost hard to even imagine Wes Craven almost passed on this movie. Killing off Drew Barrymore right from the beginning was a huge deal back then. Killing a big star like her meant no one was safe and that unpredictability was at massive play, keeping you guessing. The cast is wonderful. Neve Campbell was my childhood crush. I watched this film when I was about twelve years old and since then I fell in love with her. Neve portrays her character Sidney Prescott very well, she's strong and she plays the victim role effortlessly. Couteney Cox is great at playing the bitchy reporter Gale Weathers, David Arquette gives the film some levity as a clumsy deputy Dewey Riley. Rose McGowan plays Sidney's spunk best friend Tatum with attitude. Skeet Ulrich plays it straight as Sidney's boyfriend Billy Loomis, almost all the time you can't help but wonder if he's a suspect or not. Matthew Lillard also provides some humor as Stu, as well as Jamie Kennedy who is the breakout character Randy Meeks, the film's go-to for anything comedic. The Ghostface killer is so iconic now that it just doesn't seem scary at all, but the very first time we see that costume, and he's chasing Drew Barrymore, it is quite effective. Craven does such a good job with building up suspense. He makes Billy Loomis look guilty, but then innocent. You almost kind expect him to be the killer, but in the finale what don't you expect is Matthew Lillard end up being the second killer. It's a double whammy and you'd never expect someone like his character to end up being a killer. Williamson's writing allows you to take a breather from all the suspense and laugh once in while with solid dialog and jokes. The only gripe in this near perfect film is when Ghostface is stalking both Sidney and Tatum in broad daylight. That is one moment where it just looses some credibility. Also some of the special effects are just a tad bit outdated. Not so much so that it takes you out of the film, but you can tell, especially Tatum's death by the garage door. I grew up in the 90's, I'm only in my early twenties and Scream was definitely a part of my childhood. Thank you Wes Craven for not only giving me nightmares and making me afraid to go to sleep(another obvious iconic Wes Craven horror villain) and answering phone calls. You will be missed by many. 8.7/10",8,1,1,3 September 2015
Wonder Woman," Wonderous and wonderful.
","Wow. Let me just get this out of the way. I love both Marvel and DC. I want them all to be good, but if I'm being honest, Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad are complete misfires. They're both messy, mishandled, with a lot of corporate meddling. However, Wonder Woman is the complete opposite. This marks a second great DC film for WB in my books(I know there are people who love/hate Man of Steel, but I happened to really like it). Princess Diana, otherwise known as Wonder Woman here is fully realized and completely three-dimensional. She finally gets her due in cinema and I cannot be more pleased. She's idealistic yet naive, compassionate, yet stubborn, and brave. I typically dislike origin stories, but every now and then they can be very fun, and Wonder Woman is that exception. Patty Jenkins who led Charlize Theron to an Oscar, brings a story that is packed with heart without ever getting too over the top or too heavy handed. During the hype train I disliked the idea of Gal Gadot, mainly due to her inexperience as an actor. She slightly won me over for the short amount of time she was in Batman v Superman, but now she really won me over. I will admit, there are moments where she didn't exactly deliver her lines effectively, but I think the more she plays this character the more better she'll be. Chris Pine is great in the role of Steve Trevor. Again, while I thought some of Gadot's delivery felt dry or cheesy, she and Pine do have a great chemistry. I always preach about this, and even if it sounds like overkill at this point, but chemistry is so important with anything that has to do with romance. The romance here is solid and believable. In a very good way it was very reminiscent of Steve Rogers and Peggy Carter. The supporting cast are solid, highlights include Connie Nielsen and Robin Wright portray Queen Hippolyta and General Antiope, and they're not characters who get the short end of the stick, they actually contribute to Diana's upbringing. The supporting cast is good too. Pine's Trevor recruits a ragtag team, again reminiscent of The Howling Commandos in Captain America: The First Avenger. Taking a page off Marvel though, the villains are the ones who do end up getting the short end of the stick. There is a twist I didn't see coming, but even then it was a bit excessive and kind of out of place. I will say though, I happened to enjoy only Elena Anaya's creepy Doctor Poison out of the film's villains. The third act is slightly underwhelming, but the action scenes are fantastic. I was quite surprised as I was concerned about Patty Jenkins' ability to shoot action. Also they're lit in daylight and being able to see everything unfold is just pure eye-candy. Something I appreciated is that Jenkins also shows the casualty of what war brings and she doesn't compromise on the gruesome reality of it. Visual effects are good, but there are few moments where its so obvious that it's cgi. I'm not very picky in that department, but when it's too too noticeable, then it automatically takes me out of the film.I did mention Captain America: The First Avenger multiple times, and the film takes some influences and operates like it, but it's not a carbon copy at all. On the surface Wonder Woman might appear to be of similar adventures and superhero films that we've seen on screen, but it's moving parts and the little things it does that makes the film shine. With good character moments, humorous banter, and a resonating romance, it is the female superhero film that we needed. 8.5/10",8,26,53,30 May 2017
Straight Outta Compton," An antidote for summer blockbusters.
","Raw. Very raw. I'm not the biggest rap fan, but I do enjoy it from time to time. These guys were something else back in the day. I think people don't really realize that, but this movie will show otherwise. The story of the rise and fall of the rap group N.W.A. is wonderfully told through the solid direction from F. Gary Gary, and the excellent performances from the talented young cast. It really grabs the honest portrayal of their days as a group and as individuals. What makes Straight Outta Compton different from other biopics is that, most biopics rely on the nostalgia, but this film reels us in with the raw reflection of that particular era. Right from the beginning we're hooked in with the trio of leads, Eazy-E, Dr. Dre, and Ice Cube, and as Ice Cube nicely puts it, their art is a reflection of their reality and it's immediately shown when the movie kicks in. The three leads equally share the load of this film and to see the three of them take separate directions in life, one would think that's a lot to juggle, but here, it's paced so eloquently. I liked the natural progression and evolution of the these characters, showing that people do change. When you have three guys coming from the same neighborhood with the same career goals, give them fame, stardom, and money, they're gonna end up in different places, forging their own destiny. The film showcases that inevitable outcome and the usage of logos, ethos and pathos are also at play, as the trio represents one of the modes. Dr. Dre is the logos of the film. Portrayed by Corey Hawkens, Dre showed the most maturing and growth of his character, dissolving into his own man. Jason Mitchell who is Eazy-E oozes charisma and charm, if anyone is familiar with Eazy-E, Mitchell's performance certainly brings the pathos into the film. The one who stole the show for me was O'Shea Jackson Jr. as Ice Cube showcasing ethos. During the hype of this film I wasn't too sure about Ice Cube's own son portraying him who really had no acting experience. I had no doubt that he would be the weakest link, but I was certainly wrong. I did not see O'Shea Jackson Jr. in this film, I saw Ice Cube. I heard he took two years to prepare for this role, and it really shows. He brings the most attitude and energy to the screen, by standing up to authority, and writing powerful lyrics. Plus his uncanny resemblance to his father helps as well. Aldis Hodge as MC Ren and Neil Brown Jr. as DJ Yella are obviously aren't in the limelight as the trio, but to my surprise they weren't underdeveloped as I thought they'd be. They have some moments to shine within the group and provide decent supporting roles. Paul Giamatti as their manager Jerry Heller brings the almost fatherly, and caring figure to the group, especially to Eazy-E, but also evokes the dirtiness of a cheating business man. R. Marcus Taylor brings out a chilling, cruel performance as Suge Knight. Is this movie completely accurate, I would assume probably not. When it comes to bringing a famous person's life on screen, there is some revisionist history going on, but it does a good job showcasing the brutality of living in a neighborhood like Compton, and how music was an escape for these guys. Ice Cube and Dr. Dre are also producers on the film and I appreciate that they portrayed themselves and the group without as much filter, despite the fact that some of it was probably omitted(Dre's history of violence against women). It only makes their development much more engaging. This is a film that has a real feel for the creative process in the studio. Their tour performance scenes rock, particularly the depiction of a tense show in Detroit where the group is warned in advance not to perform 'F*ck Tha Police.'F. Gary Gary had a difficult task of making a biopic about N.W.A. He pulled it off. Biopics more often than not tend to elaborate on the rise-fall-rise-again structure, the sex and the drugs, disputes within a group about money, ego, it's all there and to be fair we've seen it many times, but with the solid, all around performances, and F. Gary Gary's execution, you probably won't mind. Straight Outta Compton is one of the better musical biopics out there, and easily in the top ten of 2015. Sure, the last hour loses just a tiny, tiny bit of steam showcasing some side melodrama, but it's packed with performances you can't take your eyes off, stellar concert scenes, nice cameos from future rappers, a strong narrative, just an electrifying film all around, Straight Outta Compton is a hell of a ride and the lyrics of Ice Cube's 'F*ck Tha Police,' which was written almost thirty years ago, is still sadly relevant today. 9/10",9,9,45,21 August 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," Meh.
","Where to begin? Where to start? Well, this is Nolan's final chapter and conclusion to his Batman trilogy, and compared to the first two, well it falls short despite a few amusing moments. The film has a very bad pacing issue and has way too many subplots, unnecessary ones I might add, more than it can handle. The biggest issue I have is how little Batman is in this film. For a movie that is almost three hours long, there is barely any Batman in it. At the most probably twenty minutes max. Speaking of Batman, he is totally out of character here. I know that this is a film, and there is a difference between a film and a comic-book. It's a different medium and it has to be adapted. But even with that being said, everything Bruce Wayne does in the film feels very unlike him based on his development over the course of two films. He's retired for eight years which is a long gap between the events of second film. He's crippled now, walking with a cane and he manages to bang Miranda Tate played by Marion Cotillard, while in the beginning of the film its made clear he's still not over Rachel. Batman's arc is also very uninteresting. We see Bruce learn to become Batman again with a magical knee brace that somehow give him the ability to kick bricks off a wall and then when he encounters Bane, he gets crippled again, now being held hostage and learned to become Batman again. It's very tedious and very boring to be exact. This time around Nolan manages to savor the quiet moments in the film. It's not as brisk as it was in The Dark Knight, but he goes back into Batman Begins territory. I commend that he's trying to make it different compared to The Dark Knight, but it ultimately does not work and it only provides to be disheartening, rather than thought provoking. Another issue I had is how much emphasis is made around Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character John Blake and other supporting characters like Matthew Modine's Deputy Commissioner Foley. I don't think the film needed those characters, and all that time could have been focused on Batman, despite their service to the plot. Despite the plot being very convoluted, it does manage to keep itself together for the most part. The absence of Heath Ledger is sorely felt. What also bothers me is the absence of his influence, while Harvey Dent's influence is clearly felt. The film makes no mention of the Joker, now it may be due to some issue or being respectful to the Heath Ledger's estate, but this renders The Dark Knight as a hypothetical film in between Begins and Rises. What save the film for me were the two villains. I particularly enjoyed Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle/Catwoman. Throughout the hype I wasn't buying her in the trailers, and thought she'd be the weakest link, but thats not the case. She has attitude and kicks butt. Tom Hardy does a commendable job as Bane. He shows ruthlessness and has a thing for choking or snapping people's neck. He physically torments Batman something other villains in the series never did. One of two aspects that bothered me about Bane was his reasoning to inspire hope, to torment the city of Gotham with a nuclear bomb for months, allowing Batman to recover. Why couldn't he just blow it up and the mission would be complete? Which leads me to how disappointed I was to know that his role was nothing more of a henchmen or a second in command when Marion Cotillard's character's true identity is revealed. To be honest I also saw it coming, seeing the set photos her in costume, and being a comic-book fan I already knew who she was. As always the bright spots are Michael Cain who has a heartbreaking scene with Bale, Gary Oldman as Gordon, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox. Lots of loose ends and logical plot holes as well. One for example is how in the world did Bruce Wayne get back to Gotham without any money, any identification, and any help whatsoever. The usage of The Bat, Batman's flying vehicle is very impressive, the football game sequence is also very thrilling and there is a decent chase and action sequence with the Batpod in the beginning. However its almost as if every other chase sequence mirrors all the other chase sequences in Nolan's previous installments. Don't get me started on the first fight Batman and Bane have. It's very slow and very loose, and kinda humorous might I add. I get that this Batman is very grounded, but I wanted more energy within the hand to hand combat scenes, more flare, but we don't really get that in this film. I don't know whether to dislike or like the film's final conclusion, but I must say it's quite a refreshing take on how to end a superhero trilogy. It's not like I wanted to dislike this movie, it was one of my most anticipated films of 2012 and judging by the marketing it looked great. Compared to the first two terrific installments this one does not measure up. It's frustrating, but that is a testament to how great of a director Christopher Nolan can be with his two previous efforts. 6/10",6,0,1,31 January 2015
Black Panther," Better late than never right?
","Black Panther is like a checklist. A checklist that fulfills every aspect and almost goes above and beyond. The film is unapologetically African and it subtly deals with real political issues. I'd argue the film is almost on par with the first Iron Man, the first Avengers, and the Captain America trilogy.Ryan Coogler has proven himself as a capable director in his own right, with Creed and Fruitvale Station, and now he's three for three with Black Panther. Coogler puts the characters and the narrative(albeit kinda predictable) first before the action and spectacle. I'd like to mention though some of the cinematography is gorgeous so kudos to Rachel Morrison. Costume designs are fabulous so another kudos to Ruth E. Carter. Last but not least to the visual development team, Ryan Meinerding, Andy Park, Carla Ortiz, and the others. I don't know if any of you ever picked up the concept art-books of the MCU films, but these guys and girls put a lot of effort into coming up with the creative look of each film. Coogler and Joe Robert Cole explore some thought-provoking ideas such as isolationism, revolution, and the cultures of oppression. They tackle real world problems without being too preachy or over the top, but enough to get the point across in an effective manner. If you have the strongest and not to mention the most versatile metal on Earth, I would doubt you'd want to share that kind of info to the world, but then again you can also do so much to help others in need. With that being said, this is where Michael B. Jordan's Erik Killmonger is effective. The performance is kind of over the top, but it registers and you can sorta feel his rage and anger. He's definitely not the wasted villain that the MCU is notorious for. As I've mentioned before, the Phase 3 villains, while not perfect, are a step up to every other villain the MCU has given us aside from Loki, Red Skull, and Winter Soldier. Jordan's portrayal while again, slightly over the top, makes you see his point of view like The Vulture or Zemo. The women also are a stand out. Angela Bassett's role doesn't have too much to do but her acting chops alone make you believe in her relationship with T'Challa. Letitia Wright provides a lot humor as the sharp witted Wakandan genius and sister to T'Challa, Shuri. Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira are also highlights as Nakia and General Okoye. Nyong'o and Boesman don't overplay their complicated/romantic relationship and Gurira's character butts heads with T'Challa frequently, but is also fiercely loyal to her king. Other cast members are solid. I certainly didn't expect Forest Whitaker, Daniel Kaluuya, and Martin Freeman to have the roles that they did, so kudos to Coogler and Robert Cole for figuring out all those moving parts. Especially Kaluuya's role as W'Kabi. Winston Duke and Andy Serkis just chew up the scenery with their roles as well. Particularly Serkis, as it was nice seeing Ulysses Klaue make his return. Now on to Chadwick Boseman. He is so good in this role I forget the accent he speaks with in this film is just him acting. When I watched interviews with him I totally forgot he has the American accent. He's equally believable as a superhero, but as a man grieving for his father and questioning his ability to be a fitting king. Yes the film is by the numbers, kinda predictable, and by the books, yes some of the special effects don't look as polished to be quite honest, the action set pieces are competent but not mind-blowing, and the shaky camera was a bit of an annoyance. With that being said, being a comic-book geek I am pleased with the final result and I cannot wait to see what Marvel Studios has in store for T'Challa next. Black Panther has been quite the talk lately as there have been many opinions about the significance of a black superhero. Let us not forget about Wesley Snipes's Blade, but up until Black Panther's release, much of Hollywood considered a film with an all black cast as niche for certain demographics, but never as a blockbuster or a franchise like this. Like Wonder Woman, Black Panther will open even more doors for movies similar to them, and everyone associated with this movie on another level. 8.8/10",8,2,19,16 February 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Coming from someone who loved Man of Steel.
","I unapologetically love Man of Steel. I saw it five times, and dragged my poor girlfriend all those times. I'm also a giant Marvel and DC fan, read the comics since I was a child and grew to love superhero storytelling, and to be completely honest, this film underwhelmed me. Like many I was anticipating Batman v Superman, and while there are some cool spectacle moments, the structure of the entire film is very disjointed. Compared to Man of Steel, I felt the story flowed naturally for the most part, here it's very jumbled. Obviously because you're dealing with DC's Trinity: Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and villain Lex Luthor, it's a very hard task to juggle them all out. I commend Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer, but it just felt messy. Every time something interesting happens, it just cuts away, and keeps cutting scene after scene. It never felt cohesive, it kept jumping from places to places and I simply didn't feel invested enough to care as the movie progressed. While that being said, the screenplay tries to juggle it's characters as well as they can, so I never felt like it tried to be rushed, while ultimately it was. Some of the stuff I did like though was the events of Man of Steel can still be felt, and it still carries over the whole movie. I just wished it could have been explored a little bit more. Also there were certain moments where it seemed like some of the characters knew what was going to happen next without even knowing what happened in the first place which was kinda odd. It picks up steam as soon as Batman and Superman have their ultimate showdown at an abandoned part of Gotham City. That was a very cool moment for me and it was quite exciting these two titans go at each other. Of course the action sequences and the visuals are thrilling. That is to be expected.Then after all that, it begins to lose steam. This isn't a spoiler as it was shown in the trailer, but the whole Doomsday fight is very shoved down your throat and it does not feel deserved. Especially for those who have seen the film, you know exactly what I'm talking about. The action that happens in that showdown is also extremely short. Doomsday was taken care of so quickly. I know comics and movies are completely different mediums, I always try to set that apart from each other when I go into these superhero epics, but this whole part of the film never felt earned, ESPECIALLY the aftermath. It just sort of happens and it ends. Never felt like I was on the edge of my seat. Which was a disappointment for me because when they spoiled this in the trailer, I thought the filmmakers and WB might have something else up their sleeve but they didn't. Again for anyone who's read the comics or has seen the film, you know exactly what I'm talking about. Doomsday did not feel like a real threat at all and it just didn't pay off.Again Snyder does a good job with the action, it's all very cool, but unlike Man of Steel, this time around it lacked substance, as I didn't feel as invested as I should have been. However, the display of Superman and Wonder Woman's powers were awesome, and Gal Gadot for the short amount of screen time she had, she was quite good, so I was impressed. I didn't like her casting choice in the beginning, not because of how she looked, it was more so her acting chops, but she delivered. I'm now really looking forward to Wonder Woman. Keep an eye out for some other cameos from future Justice League members, those were very cool. Cavill is as great as ever in that role and he can play it in his sleep at this point. A perfect embodiment of Superman. Affleck kills it. If you still doubt his ability to play Batman after all the footage we've seen, then I don't know what to tell you. With all due respect to Chris Nolan, finally I get to see Batman actually fight clearly on screen. Jesse Eisenberg is the only cast member I could not get on board with. Why is Lex Luthor so hard to portray on the big screen? I respect the idea of making him a creep, but his motives aren't exactly crystal clear, and him being a creep is more awkward then it is captivating. Jeremy Irons and Amy Adams don't have too much to do, but they serve their purpose in the film. The only actors that I thought were wasted were Tao Okamoto and Holly Hunter. Okamoto only had one line or two and for an actor of her caliber Holly Hunter was just a phenomenal waste of time. Her role could have been played by anyone else. I know a lot of you fanboys will get upset over my opinion, but that should not get in the way of your opinion of the film. I'm not completely bagging this film down, there are solid moments throughout and it's not like I didn't want to like this movie, I really did, I loved Man of Steel, but the problems in the film were just too noticeable. I'm still very much looking forward to the next wave of DC movies. One way or another, it's barely a passable film, but with all the hype that surrounded it, it just barely managed to live up to any of it if I'm being quite honest. It was clear that a lot substantial scenes were also cut from the film, and it was announced the director's cut was coming so maybe I'll change my tune after that viewing. 5.3/10",5,13,24,22 March 2016
Thor: The Dark World," A little better.
","First off, I wasn't crazy about the first Thor film. It could have been a lot worse. The film peaked after the Frost Giant fight. I'd rate it a 5/10That being said, Thor: The Dark World, is super flawed, but it is leaps and beyond better than the first Thor film. I say that because there are less scenes of Earth, and a lot more Asgard and the nine-realms. I loved the impressive visuals of the Asgardian world that Marvel created and it was pure eye-candy. Hemsworth and Hiddleston truly shine in this film. I loved watching their brotherly banter and how Frigga's death cause them, mostly Loki to undergo some character transformations. I also liked Loki's little 'redemption' path, and there is a touching scene with him and Thor when Loki is supposedly 'dead.' Surprisingly there was a lot of humor, some of which where the jokes landed, but most of the time it was very annoying. Natalie Portman is wonderful as Jane, Stellan Skarsgard is mostly used for gags, and Kat Dennings as Darcy is used for comic relief, very overused might I add. I disliked her character a lot in the first film, and that hasn't changed since. The Captain America cameo though, that was so awesome. There's much more action in this film than the first Thor film. As I previously stated, the action in the first film peaked when they fought the Frost Giants, but here there's plenty. I loved every action set piece, especially the climax. Director Alan Taylor does a good job blending in fantasy and sci-fi all together, also adding a touch of Game of Thrones in there. As a matter of fact I think he did a better job than Kenneth Branagh in introducing the world of Asgard. My biggest complain in this film is the villain. I wanted more of Malekith in this film. Christopher Eccleston portrays an awesome Malekith, but however there really isn't much character development over him. He's just shown as an evil dude who wants to bring the world to darkness. Nothing more. Aside from a brief introduction told by Odin at the beginning about who he is and what his plan is, there isn't any other character development for Malekith and he really suffers because of this. He doesn't interact with enough characters only Thor and he never goes into any detail about why he's doing what he's doing without a clear motive or reason. Even though they had their own action moments, certain characters like Lady Sif and the Warriors Three that were promised larger roles instead were minor which was sort of a bummer. This film has some re-watch ability factor, where as the first Thor didn't. Thor: The Dark World is just pure popcorn entertainment. 6/10",6,0,0,3 November 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A return to form.
","A very familiar, but solid film, and a solid return for Star Wars.Director J.J. Abrams hits all the right notes in this film, and if you're a Star Wars fan, it will bring out the 'feels' in you.While at first I was nervous of how the new faces will be portrayed, without revealing too much I'm happy to report that they are all interesting and juggled very well. Daisy Ridley as Rey carries the whole film on her shoulders as does John Boyega as Finn. I really liked the diverse leads J.J. had in this film, and those two have a potential career ahead of them. A strong female character who isn't a damsel in distress and an African male lead who also kicks some ass but is able to show vulnerability. Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron, the galaxy's best pilot brings some cool swagger, a bit Han Solo in him I might add. Adam Driver is superb as Kylo Ren, he's not a Vader ripoff, he's quite effective in the role and his overall appearance is very cool. The foursome will definitely have more significant exposure to them in the next chapters and I can't wait to see them on screen again.The new cast also gels well with the older cast. It's great to see Harrison Ford as Han Solo once again. He plays it effortlessly and he seems to be having fun doing so. Ford gets the most screen time of all the original cast and he's got a lot of great moments through and through. He has a great father-figure chemistry between the two leads and his banter with Chewbacca is just as good. Carrie Fisher, this time is General Leia and she's in charge of the Rebellion, and she's under a lot of pressure and a little more broken-hearted. As for Luke, well you'd have to see the movie to find out, but that is the part where I was just a tad bit letdown on, but it'll only make you more excited and anticipate to see what's to come in the future. Not to mention BB-8, what an adorable little droid. BB-8 will definitely be a favorite among children.The qualms and issues I had in the film was the absolute lack of Captain Phasma, she hardly does anything at all. I'm sure she will be explored a little more in the future, but here she was a complete waste. I really wasn't feeling Domhnall Gleeson at all. Not particularly his acting per say, but his character. He just seemed to be there as General Hux. In fact he's pretty much every other evil General in the original trilogy. He doesn't bring too much to the table either. Andy Serkis is Kylo Ren's master, Supreme Leader Snoke. There's a shroud of mystery in his character and he is a powerful Dark Side figure, I hope to see more of him in the future as well. Lupita Nyong'o's character Maz Kanata also provides some decent moments. She disguised her voice quite well, to be honest I was kinda shocked it was her performance.J.J. Abrams also captures the aesthetic look and feel of the original Star Wars trilogy. It's not like the prequels where the technology looks way better than the technology of the original trilogy. Everything is put with attention to detail, the way Jakku looks, the way the Millennium Falcon moves, the sounds the TIE Fighters make, the sounds of the lightsabers clashing, just about everything, it feels like the original Star Wars. Also give credit to sound designer Ben Burt. He never fails to create iconic sounds in each film, and do I have to tell you John Williams, the living legend, arguably the greatest film composer in history does a magnificent job in the film?Abrams also shoots action with a lot of flare. They're thrilling and exciting. He's always able to make you feel tension within the fight as the stakes do matter. With that being said, the lightsaber fights are incredible. Any positive in a Star Wars film is a lightsaber battle, even the prequels(except for Attack of the Clones) have some decent lightsaber duels, but in The Force Awakens, it feels authentic, because it's not heavily choreographed. Making the scenes much more grasping and more engaging. The X-Wing and TIE Fighter scenes rock as well, although I did feel the finale involving those two space ships to be a tad bit rushed and a little too easy.It absolutely does parallel A New Hope and it can feel a bit like a Star Wars: Greatest Hits every now and then, but it offers new elements into the narrative without it feeling completely like a carbon copy, kinda.J.J. Abrams resurrects Star Wars in great fashion and sets up the future very well for directors Rian Johnson and Colin Trevorrow(he's the one I'm nervous about). I think it's safe to say Mr. Abrams matches most of the expectations and solidifies the film's own hype.7/10",7,3,15,18 December 2015
Unbroken," Jolie tries, but it feels rehashed.
","I haven't seen Angelina Jolie's previous efforts in her directorial career. But for the most part I didn't hate this film, but it feels very familiar in a lot of ways. Jack O'Connell portrays Louis 'Louie' Zamperini, a US Olympian and a US Army bombardier. His plane eventually crashes into the ocean and is stranded for 47 days, with only two crewman Mac and Phil, respectively portrayed by Finn Wittrock and Domhnall Gleeson. He is then captured by the Japanese empire and is tortured and abused by Mutsuhiro 'The Bird' Watanabe, played by Takamasa Ishihara.The opening act, provides us with sincere and engaging flashbacks, then we get a series of been there and done that clichés. When they are stranded it provides a Cast Away vibe, but it does provide some amusing moments where they capture a bird, a shark, and a fish for food. We move to the second act where they are captured by the Japanese, Louis is separated to a different concentration camp and there he gets tortured by the Imperial Japanese Army sergeant Mutsuhiro 'The Bird' Watanabe. This is where Angelina Jolie looses the focus of the film and gets very one noted. Though the scenes where Louis is tortured and physically abused by his rival 'The Bird,' is quite impactful, there are one too many and at a certain point it begins to feel old and also feels very overkill. I did some research before on his life and the book, and the script does not measure up. The transition of spiritual awakening and strength in God Louis discovers does not translate well on the big screen, and to be quite frank I don't recall even a mention or a nod to that. Upon viewing this film I couldn't help but notice that this film has a very Clint Eastwood vibe. This film is something I think Clint Eastwood probably could have directed and its as if Angelina Jolie was taking notes while she was working with him on Changeling(which is a movie I'd recommend). The acting is fine. Everyone is good here, particularly Jack O'Connell. He does a great job with what he's given with. I haven't seen much of his other works, but he carries the film quite well. Domhnall Gleeson as Phil provides a decent supporting role, as is Garrett Hedlund as John Fitzgerald has decent moments here and there. Takamasa Ishihara who portrays 'The Bird,' does a good job with the role he's given with, but he's just a typical, ruthless Japanese sergeant. With that being said, the acting can only cover up the characterization these characters so far, in way they're kinda flat. We don't really see the struggle that they're dealing with besides a few lines and dialog about it. I didn't at all feel totally connected with anyone in the film. As a matter of fact, Louis's flashbacks are the only thing that actually comes close to humanizing anyone in the whole film. Jolie tries, I commend her for that, but it's too familiar and too one noted. I didn't even get any theme of forgiveness, which I believe Jolie stated in an interview somewhere that this film is about forgiveness. It rather explains all this at the end in the form of title cards. To sum it up, Unbroken is mediocre film at best, sprinkled with some decent moments. Picture a terrible, undercooked cake batter, but with a thin layer of tasty frosting that sort of makes up for the batter.6.6/10",6,3,7,5 January 2015
Godzilla," He's back, and it's pretty good, but it could have been better.
","What this film tries to do, is combining both a human element and Godzilla action all together. There are some, actually rather a lot of slow moments here and there, but I commend director Gareth Edwards for trying to be something more, and at least trying to bring human elements into the film. This easily could have been a just a monster movie you go for just violence and action, but I give credit to Gareth Edwards for still maintaining that element, but trying to put together a coherent story. Aaron Johnson is good at portraying Ford Brody, a military man who deeply cares for his child and wife Elle Brody played by Elizabeth Olsen and his father Joe Brody played by Bryan Cranston, but understands his duty as a soldier. Again, there are slow moments, but it kept me intrigued for the most part, despite Johnson playing it straight-forward. I felt that the character development of this film is as good as it gets when it comes to disaster, giant monster films, with the exception of Bryan Cranston who in particular stole mostly every scene he was in despite him getting killed off so quickly. However, a major character I was disappointed in was Ken Watanabe's Dr. Serizawa, who only serves in the film as exposition and explanation for the story to progress.Now I loved every monster moments. I loved every single Godzilla shots and every single fight. Now our favorite green giant lizard does appear sporadically, which can cause some irritation. I get what Edwards was trying to do, build up anticipation and excitement, but it's over done and can get annoying, but the last 20 minutes is what makes everything worthwhile. This is where the whole film pays out and worth the price of admission, Godzilla is unleashed in his full potential and glory. I could have used just a bit more Godzilla here and there, but again I applaud Gareth Edwards holding off showing Godzilla to develop tension and anticipation, I just wish he didn't do it almost three or four times in a row. As for Godzilla, well he looks great, sure he's a tad bit fat, but he looks so much better than a man in a rubber suit. Very fun in the last 20-30 minutes or so. 6.2/10",6,0,2,4 September 2014
Deadpool," Ryan Reynolds was born to play this role.
","Where do I start...Well, this is complete redemption for Fox. After the awful introduction in X-Men Origins: Wolverine(less said the better), this movie was an apology to the fans. Now, I'll be honest, the plot is a pretty straight-forward revenge story. It's very simple and easy to follow. It doesn't do anything new in that department as it is an origin story, but it's told with more flare. You would think jumping from place to place, flashback to flashback would confuse you and many other people, but it doesn't. So kudos to director Tim Miller, Ryan Reynolds, and writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick for a sharp clear vision of the movie. They knew what they were going for and executed it very well. The origin told through flashbacks was a breath of fresh air. Something I admired about Man of Steel. I feel superhero origin stories are best told through flashbacks. The visuals are solid, and the action sequences are pretty stellar. Small in scale(cause of their budget) but nevertheless, very fun. There's no PG-13 compromise here, the filmmakers absolutely do not hold back. This is hard R, with nudity, including Ryan Reynolds's bare ass, hyper-stylized violence, blood, gore, foul language, and dirty jokes. So if you're someone who gets easily offended by this, I would advise you to stay away. But even with that being said, one must admit, this brings something new to the superhero genre, and it's a film made for comic fans such as myself. The cast is great. In typical fashion the villains are not too fleshed out, they do present a threat, but it's nothing special. Ed Skrein as Ajax and Gina Carano as Angel Dust do their job at being evil. T.J. Miller as Deadpool's sidekick is hysterical with quippy and crude lines. Leslie Uggams is Blind Al. She and Deadpool share some nice and funny banter with each other. Colossus is voiced by Stefan Kapicic, played by Andre Tricoteux, and his young trainee Negasonic Teenage Warhead is played by Brianna Hildebrand and they have their fun moments with Deadpool as well. Colossus certainly does a lot more than he ever did in the previous X-Men films, although I am a bit annoyed Daniel Cudmore did not return for the role for continuity's sake, this Colossus is a more faithful interpretation to the comics. I'd also like to mention I'm not big on superhero romance. On occasion they do work, like Captain America and Peggy Carter, Spider-Man and Gwen or Mary Jane, and I guess Tony Stark and Pepper Potts, but outside of that I never really buy into them, they just seem like an afterthought, but here in this film the chemistry works. Ryan Reynolds and Morena Baccarin have fabulous chemistry between each other. I know it sounds like a broken record, but chemistry really counts in all type of films, so it was pleasantly shocking to see it work on screen, especially from a movie like Deadpool. Now lets talk about Ryan. Man, from now on, every time I read a Deadpool comic, I'm going to hear his voice. Like the title of my review, he was born to play this role. Even in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, prior to the abysmal transformation, when he was just Wade Wilson, Reynolds killed it. He carries the film very well and he does a great job making him almost sympathetic. You know for a fact Wade Wilson is not a great person, but what he goes through in the somewhat difficult torture sequences, you come to care and personally want to see him get his revenge on Ajax. Again, Deadpool's jokes are hilarious and Ryan definitely knows how to deliver it effectively. Deadpool isn't a perfect film, it does have some minor problems, but it's a hell of a fun ride. It's face paced, never boring, consistently funny, and filled with clever fourth wall breaking moments. Deadpool himself even pokes fun at Ryan's career, other superheroes and even Fox, the studio itself. Deadpool subverts the superhero formula resulting in a hilarious and violent thrill ride all in it's non-family friendly glory, and if you weren't sold on the marketing of this film already, then I don't know what to tell you. I have no doubt that this will be successful and I'm only anticipating the sequel even more. I hope this film will un-retire Hugh Jackman so I can see a proper Wolverine and Deadpool fight in a future installment or even X-Force.9/10",9,10,23,12 February 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Sporadically entertaining.
","I like Mark Millar's body of work. I loved The Ultimates 1 & 2, Civil War, Wanted, Kick-Ass, and Nemesis. I never really read of Kingsman, nor did I hear about it until I saw the first trailer.With that being said this film was okay, decent fun. I didn't particularly find the beginning interesting, despite some stylish opening credits. I found that the film really took its time to get started and it took too long to get everything set up. But there are a lot of moments that really kept me involved. In particular Samuel L. Jackson as Richmond Valentine and Colin Firth as Harry Hart/Galahad. Firth kept me emotionally involved in the film as his character bonds with Taron Egerton's Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin. Not to mention he is a complete badass. As for Jackson, he surprised me the most. When I first heard about the casting of Samuel L. Jackson, I thought putting him within this cast felt a little force, and I thought this was going to be another 'typical Samuel L. Jackson performance.' But to my surprise he was very intriguing to watch. He was a clam, sensitive, and for a lack of a better word, a soft villain, but with an ultimate goal. His character also had a lisp and a swagger to him that was a charm to watch on screen. Taron Egerton is pretty good here too. He's got chops to hold his own against Firth, Jackson, Strong, and even Michael Cain, who has a small role. His comedic timing is very spot on and has some humorous dialog. He was very good in the role, but he doesn't shine until the last act of the film. Here is where he shows that he's a very capable action star, something director Matthew Vaughn is very capable of showcasing, i.e. Chloe Moretz(Kick-Ass). He also shares a nice, but kinda useless friendship/romance banter with Roxy portrayed by Sophie Cookson. Mark Strong as Merlin is also great here too. This film also shows off that Matthew Vaughn flare. The action sequences are fantastic and well shot. There is one particular scene in the church that may turn some people off, but one can't deny that it was pulled off with style. At times the film can be hard to follow. I finally understood Valentine's motive and plan in-between the middle and final act, and some bland and boring spots here in there. But Kingsman is very self-aware of other spy movie clichés, filled with stylish action, solid performances and a decent amount of laughs that will pleasantly kill off two hours of your time. 7.5/10",7,4,10,17 February 2015
Fantastic Four," No one can say that this is worse than the first attempt back in the 90's.
","Is this movie great, no, but it is fun, well sporadically at least.I had the privilege of watching the extended cut, and I prefer that over the original theatrical release. I do in particular like the cast, most of them. I do like Ioan Gruffudd as Mr. Fantastic. I thought he did a suitable job showing Reed that he is indeed a very intelligent smart man, but doesn't have a clue on how to maintain a stable relationship with his girlfriend Sue Storm, as he always over-analyzes everything. Speaking of Sue Storm, she's kinda mediocre. Jessica Alba is often bland in her performance overall, but there are few moment where she can deliver quite effectively, but she cannot deliver one the cheesiest lines in the film in the confrontation between Dr. Doom that was horribly delivered and just took me out of the movie. Ah yes, our villain, Dr. Doom, the Marvel Universe's biggest and most baddest baddie(on Earth at least). What a waste of opportunity here. A big letdown on this horrible inaccurate portrayal of Dr. Victor Von Doom. What's really upsetting is that Julian McMahon could have been a great villain, but a paper-thin script and poor characterization here completely ruins that opportunity. I will compliment the overall physical look and his costume in the film. It was quite impressive. The two highlights of this film and what makes it entertaining are Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis as Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm. They outshine the other cast member and are faithfully portrayed just like their comic-book counterparts. Compared to the theatrical cut, they are very under-utilized and the film rather focuses more on the boring romance between Reed and Sue. The extended cut goes just a little deeper on their characterization. In a way they both have the best overall emotional arc within the film, Ben learning to accept himself and Johnny learning to mature and not take advantage of his powers. The problem with this movie is the choppy storytelling and poor execution. The film spends most of it's time on these five people discovering their abilities and figuring out what to do with them, which is great and interesting, but that only works so well in short amount of time and in little douses. But here it's pretty much the whole movie and in doing so we're stuck with a forced climax that feels very rushed and very half-assed. Being a big Fantastic 4 fan, this movie is disappointing, but it isn't without some redeeming qualities. I do hope the next reboot will do some justice even though I'm very skeptical about it. Overall though this movie is harmless, yes it is with it's problems, but there are decent character moments in the film and scenes with some cool use of each one's abilities. Some of the action set pieces are fun to watch, and at least this film knows it's not taking itself too seriously for the most part. Pure eye-candy. Nothing more. 6.2/10",6,3,5,27 August 2014
Spectre," Good, but not amazing.
","Spectre opens strong with the Day of the Dead sequence in Mexico. A great action set piece to start off the film, but then it sort of fizzles out. I'll say this though, if we weren't spoiled by Casino Royale and Skyfall, I think this would have been a solid Bond film. Craig's 007, specifically Casino Royale and Skyfall always had just an extra layer of flare and depth. Of all the most I've seen, most 007 films don't really go out to flesh their hero like Craig's Bond, and in Spectre it relies on a redundant formula, bringing it closer to the glorious, action-driven spectacle of earlier entries. Not to say that is a bad film, but it's not on the level of the previous entries. Definitely better than Quantum of Solace though. I felt that the biggest issue is the overall narrative focusing more on the romance rather than involving the villains. They are shrouded in mystery, which is interesting at first, but it glosses over that immediately and focuses on Bond and his new love interest, Lea Seydoux's Dr. Madeleine Swan, the daughter of one of Bond's former adversaries Mr. White. She is a brainy and feisty woman who can hold her own and about three days after she tells Bond she's not about to fall into his arms seeking solace, she's telling him, 'I love you.' It has a been there and done that feel, and it doesn't help when there are about twenty-three Bond films prior to Spectre. What made Skyfall great was how little to none romancing there was, as for Casino Royale, it brought a new dynamic since it was a reboot he was just promoted to 007 status, and he fell in love. I would argue to a certain extent Quantum of Solace doesn't bring too much emphasis over romance either. The film once again focuses on the question if spies are still relevant and necessary. After a while it gets tiresome. It's kinda clear that the 00 program is needed. Without spoiling anything, the twist is cartoonishly convoluted and sort of cheats out the other adversaries Bond faced in his previous films. Yet with that being said, what kinda Spectre does better than Quantum, just barely, are the villains. As previously stated above, I liked the idea of shadowy atmosphere that the Spectre organization produced, but the film barely offers just enough, not to mention the tried twist I mentioned above. To be honest the whole middle act could have been trimmed to make more time for Spectre. While Quantum had forgettable and unmemorable villains, Spectre does not, and when you can hire Christoph Waltz in the role of Ernst Stavro Blofeld you really cannot go wrong. Despite the lack of screen time, Waltz kills it and you attention is towards him whenever he's on screen. He's wonderfully insane, and constructs elaborate puzzles for Bond. I'd love to see more of him in the future. The performances are fine, although I would have liked to see Dave Bautista's role have a little more to do than speak one line. I can dig Naomi Harris as Moneypenny and it's nice to see Ben Whishaw's Q out in the field. Ralph Fiennes does a commendable job as M and also gets to do more out on the field aiding Bond on his take down of Spectre. Sam Mendes doesn't hit a home run like he did with Skyfall, but he gets to home base. It's shot well and the action sequences never disappoint. Daniel Craig at this point can play this role in his sleep. He's as good as ever and he's surrounded by an great cast. It might be a broken record or an overkill to say this, but he is my favorite James Bond and I hope to see him a couple more Bond movies. Ever since his casting in Casino Royale, all the doubters have shut their mouth and I do believe he has at least two more movies in him. 7.5/10",7,0,3,22 November 2015
Jurassic Park," Still holds up today, a landmark film in the 90's.
","Jurassic Park. It's nearing 21 years now, since the release of this film. My goodness it still holds up. Now this film was released in June of 1993, I was born in March of 1993, never saw it it theaters, but I saw it in VHS and man I loved it even as a child. I will point out however, I saw The Lost World: Jurassic Park first with my aunt as a youngster in theaters, then I saw this film. In my youth, when I compare this one to the second film, I recall being terrified and being on the edge in The Lost World, but with Jurassic Park, I felt a sense of wonderment and excitement. Having seen the second one first, I felt this one, even with some suspenseful moments, is a little lighter in tone, and has a more subtle approach.All the actors do the best they can in this film and they all do a commendable job. They're not very fleshed out, aside from John Hammond portrayed by Richard Attenborough, founder and owner of Ingen and Jurassic Park. More often than not we get good moments where the trio of leads get to show off their personality. Sam Neill is great as the calm, collective, and stern Dr. Alan Grant, who has a fascination with dinosaurs and dislikes kids, much to his annoyance Hammond's grandkids Lex(Ariana Richards) and Tim(Joseph Mazzello) who are great by the way, one of the few films where I actually enjoyed child actors and their performances, are also at the park and is stuck with Grant after narrowly escaping an incident with the fierce T-Rex. Laura Dern's character Dr. Ellie Sattler has a nice banter with Dr. Grant and the romance is very subtle which I admired. Sattler also holds her own against the Velociraptors in the film. Jeff Goldblum is awesome as Dr. Ian Malcolm a mathematician who specializes in chaos theory. He provides some of the most funniest moments within the film. Wayne Knight, Samuel L. Jackson, and Bob Peck also have decent supporting roles that are served for the plot. Knight and Jackson also provide humor in the film, and Peck provides and fills in the typical tough guy, as well as being a Velociraptor specialist. Now lets be honest here, as great as the cast is, it provides some of the film's slowest moments. Its the dinosaurs that make this film work. Director Steven Spielberg, Stan Winston(RIP) and his crew wisely uses practical dinosaur mechanics and visual cgi to bring these creatures to life. Think about this it's been nearly 21 years since its release and the visuals still look great. Some would argue maybe even up to par or better than most cgi-fest blockbusters released today. Spielberg also uses the dinosaurs very effectively for every scene they're in. The Velociraptors are smart and deadly and provides the film's scariest moments. The T-Rex scene is also effective sending chills by your spine. The Brachiosaurus scene in the beginning, combined with John Williams's powerful score, brings the scene to life, quite literally. It is so powerful that it can bring goosebumps to your skin and make you feel as if you're there with Dr. Grant and Sattler actually witnessing a real dinosaur right in front of you. Jurassic Park is not a typical brainless blockbuster. Not to say that a brainless blockbuster can't be fun or enjoyable, but Jurassic Park is more than that. It has science in it that is plausible to a certain degree that you can easily follow. It's not convoluted at all by any means and every dinosaur sequence rocks, and it'll make you want more. Yes some of the technological aspects in the film involving computers, cell phones, and whatnot are very outdated, but even so the film has not aged a bit. 8.6/10",8,0,1,4 December 2014
Alien: Covenant," Flawed, but nostalgic.
","I really disliked Prometheus. While I appreciated the ideas it tried to convey, the execution was poor. It tried to be an exploratory adventure, but also tried to be a horror film, not knowing exactly what it wanted to be. It posed way too many questions and fell flat in doing so. Very disjointed and all over the place. Plus the characters were a total bore and one-noted. In Alien: Covenant, it's as if Fox and Ridley Scott knew of the outcry and decided to make the Prometheus sequel more like Alien, and to be honest, that washed away most of the sour taste I had. Look this movie is not perfect by any means, but the addition of that Alien flavor really put this film into higher gear. I was thoroughly entertained throughout the film. Of course there's trouble lurking around as the movie progresses. People get messed up in this film and it's gruesomely entertaining.Yes, the cast is absolutely expendable, but this time around I felt as though they were handled better. I think what really helped was the YouTube clip released prior, with the cast talking before they went into hyper sleep. The crew members in this movie are more likable than the crew members of Prometheus. Key crew members aboard on the Covenant ship include Katherine Waterston as Daniels, who is resourceful and probably the only one who makes the smartest decisions of the bunch. Yes she is a character that is inspired by Ripley, but Scott doesn't make that too obvious. I enjoyed Billy Crudup as Oram and Carmen Ejogo as Karine, who are both a couple in this film, and are calm and collected. Danny McBride is Tennessee, a wise cracking, cowboy hat wearing pilot. Something I expected was to see was the typical character McBride is known for playing on screen, but it turned out to be the opposite so it was refreshing to see him in this light. The highlight is Michael Fassbender as David and Walter. David is the synthetic android that returns from Prometheus and Walter is the new, advanced and sophisticated android helping out the Covenant crew. Fassbender's work in these duel roles are fascinating to watch. He brings different traits of personalities to them both as they interact. A lot of questions are still unanswered, some of which were teased at the end of Prometheus, but perhaps they'll be answered eventually. Yes the scientists make the same stupid mistakes, and yes there are some plot-holes, but Ridley Scott has rejuvenated my interest. At best Alien: Covenant plays out like a 'greatest hits' or a cover to Alien and Aliens. While that might turn off some people, I found it to be nostalgic. 8/10",8,50,95,19 May 2017
