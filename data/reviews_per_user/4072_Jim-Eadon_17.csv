Lucky Number Slevin," Cheating
","This movie is of a genre I guiltily enjoy, hence my generous 6/10. This movie is something of a Usual Suspects wannabe, and serves as a reminder of how brilliant Suspects is! In this case the 'surprise' twist (the main one) is unsatisfying because it doesn't really make us analyse what happened in a different light. The boy was brought in to kill, and that's what he did. The 'twist' simply changed his motive from fear to revenge. Furthermore there was nothing clever about the twist. The movie did entertain me in a shallow fashion with it's protagonists comings, slaughterings and goings, their shenanigans were amusing, and Kingsley's dialogue was fun, in fact he was the only interesting character. However the culmination was deeply disappointing as mentioned above. The movie cheated too. The splatter of blood on a child's drawing (if I remember correctly) implied that the little brat had bought the farm. Major spoiler - he had not, of course. But that scene was a lie, so the twist was a fraud. The 'mugging' scene was also fictional, and showing that fraud visually was also cheating! This is because if you show something visually, you are stating it really did happen. Otherwise you end up with a movie where every scene may or may not have happened, which is, bluntly putting it, an easy cop out at best, cynically cheating the audience at worst. Finally every scene with the prattling Lucy lulu drove me nuts, I was at one point I exasperatedly pleaded to the screen, 'stop ruining this movie!' And her fake death plot twist was the most annoying 'twist' I have ever scene. For when she was shot, I cheered, but the hag was cruelly resurrected. Bad bad writing. Admittedly, I do find the actress grating too. And that plinkety comedy music that accompianied her ridiculously unrealistic dialogue-laden comedy relief (lord help me) added to the woe. Yet somehow the movie was just entertaining enough to be fun, I took the thing at face value, a drivelly Hollywood movie, even if the outcome was hideous.",6,3,6,18 February 2007
Underworld," Bad doggie!
","Underworld pitches dim Vampires against dopey Werewolves in a modern day Blade-like, urban (yawn) nighttime setting. I know a movie about light-shunning beasts shouldn't be particularly sunshiny, but the relentless darkness of Underworld, punctuated by cold, feeble illumination, becomes depressing, like an entire winter's blues crushed into an hour and a half.Generally speaking, vampire movies, by their very nature, are sexy: the penetration of the neck is nothing if not symbolic. Shame Underworld has had every last vestige of red eroticism drained out from its twitching corpse. We enter into a sexless place, damp and sans pleasure.The scenery, though limited, is gothic and elaborate: sets lit by long shadows of curved menace. Yet the script was blandly modern and functional. A vampire is told, ?you were awoken one hundred years before schedule?, or some such, as if he were being told he was early for some rainy Monday morning meeting. This vanquished any kind of spell Underworld held over me: it was as if the scri were drawn up by undead bean counters, which generally seems to be the case these days.Kate Beckinsale is a beautiful lass, beyond the compare of most mortals. Yet here, clad in tight black leather, she seemed frigid and almost androgynous. She reminded me in many ways of Trinity ?out of? the Matrix. Trinity is a remarkably sexy woman, as one realises from watching Memento. But, in that modern way, Trinity has the sex appeal of a rat in a bin bag. Perhaps it is just me, not finding these women wrapped in black leather curiously sexless, but more likely, the fault lies with the director. Why is the audience considered by movie makers as a vacuum to be filled with violence, but not a mote of eroticism? Many modern movies, especially the specimen of a sexless vampire movie, is the modern day equivalent of the Victorians covering table legs to avoid offence. Political correctness is probably at least partially behind this malaise. Yawwwwwwwn!So, there's no decent dialogue, sex, nudity or sexiness to be found here, what about action then? Again, we are given precious little gratification here. There are a few fights but they are not particularly sensational or invigorating. The fights felt false. Worse, because I didn't care about ANY of the characters, I didn't care who won. The characters of Underworld seem like hibernating cold blooded creatures; deathless amphibians. The werewolves were too poorly lit to be admired, but too blatant to be mysterious.Underworld is terrifically tedious. This move is another debacle that causes one to question the recent fad with casting a female in the lead role in an action movie. The blazing Lara Croft pistols in delicate hands bullshit is really wearing thin.Oh, and did I mention that at one point the gal says, 'I've gottagettyouOuddahere!' Groan? I was reaching for the razor blades!",3,1,3,1 February 2004
Ready Player One," Great opening, then downhill
","I was greatly entertained by this movie at first. Up to the point where the lad won the first key, it was fine, absolutely fine, and I enjoyed the manic rendering of the VR game and the race.
That exhilaration, was going to be hard to beat, and, sure enough, the movie fails to beat it. The lad was likeable, but the rest of the cast were so-so. There was no tension, and how are we supposed to respect a villain, when a women who works for him insults him so disdainfully.
This is an example of political correctness in movies destroying the movie. Yes, it panders to feminists, but it destroys the villain, who should be respected and feared, not put down and mocked.
We also get a tick-box set of nationalities as the cast, but there's no chemistry between the characters. All movies now are becoming the same.
Finally, there are a bunch of plot-holes, but I can forgive a movie like this for plot holes IF the movie is good, and sadly, after the first third, this was ho-hum.
The IOI corporation is mocked, but then again, but is corporate Hollywood any better?",4,3,5,20 November 2019
Ocean's Twelve," Most excruciating scene in a movie I've ever beheld
","This movie is a miserably conceived sequel to Oceans 11. Avoid at all costs, for many reasons, only one of which: Oceans 12 contains a truly pathetic scene centred around Julia Roberts so appalling in both acting and conception I would have smartly chosen the dentists drill as a welcome diversion. This movie seems to be intended as a charming ensemble piece, the resultant concoction is a putrefied soup of revolting celeb egos salted with dismal dialogue and plotting. Zero suspense, zero talent, a zero movie. Oceans zero. Oh by the way, the uninspired scenes in the trailer fall utterly flat when you see them repeated in the movie, thus the viewing experience, already rendered dull and embarrassingly inept, was further degenerated.",3,0,0,12 February 2005
Interstellar," Detached drivel, just about watchable
","This awkward movie felt like Sci Fi produced by a technical, corporate entity. The idea was fairly cute. Much depended on the mourning by the daughter, but the actress didn't make me care about her. The protagonist didn't make me care about him either, for that matter. I thought the female astronaut was quite engaging but the movie was the most interesting, her choices, angst and suffering were the only interesting thing about the movie. The Black Hole stuff was horrible, but even the black hole in this movie is not volume enough for the plot holes and miraculous coincidences that drive the story. He was only able to communicate via a malfunctioning watch, What the...? Nothing in this movie made sense. Every major scene was blatantly impossible. Worst of all, there was no warmth, no compassion, no style, no love.",4,12,22,10 September 2015
Justice League," No heart, no soul, bad characters, terrible dialogue
","This is a plastic movie, artificial, brain-dead and irritating (Flash, Wonderwoman etc. are irritating).
There is no heart, so everything that happens feels inconsquential. Why is Hollywood so bad? Because it's a corporate system, souless and dead.",3,1,6,21 July 2018
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Midly entertaining but also irritating.
","The best thing about the movie were the European locations. The movie is almost non-stop action and yet there was very little suspense. No doubt the direction was poor, but also the characters are invulnerable, there is never any doubt they will prevail.
Pegg was the comic relief but he always seems a bit forced to me. Like the bloke who played the Hobbit.
I never could buy the scientologist weirdo Cruise as an action guy, he's a pint pot mid-life crisis pretty boy. I was wondering how much this movie would be improved without him, he just seems to be on an ego trip.
Then there is the typical hollywood mythological woman who can kill assassins at will just by wrapping her legs around their necks. Yeah right. You might knock a gun out their hands, but they will have another gun, and you would be dead. And even if a knife fight - no chance.
Plus the plot holes and discontinuities are everywhere. The plans these guys have rely on million-to-one coincidences to work! The things these guys do really are impossible.
And of course, you're dealing with a world where there is zero security, the heroes can access and wonder around anywhere with impunity.
All this means that you're just watching set-pieces that you've seen before, only done better.
I was not expecting better, I just watch daft movies from time to time to see what modern block-buster making looks like.
And the fake positive reviews on this site - oh my!",5,1,2,28 July 2018
Ex Machina," Intelligent Movie
","This movie is obviously allegorical, a fascinating tale about AI, but it is mainly about manipulation and power. It isn't for those wanting action or spectacular CGI, the movie is aimed at people who like to think, rather than passively wait to be entertained. There are themes here not only about AI, but also about surveillance, with excellent points about how data about us is collected by phone companies, search engine companies, commercial operating systems makers and so on. The plot seems simple but isn't, it's extremely clever, with the protagonist playing games, trying to stay one step ahead of one another. This is a movie with perfectly consistent internal logic that plays out perfectly. Don't go in expecting too much, however, as I can see most people will not be satisfied by this movie, but for me, it does what it sets out to do brilliantly. Therefore I give at least 9/10. And most recent movies have been getting 5/10 from me. This movie succeeds where another recent movie about AI, Transcendence, I think it is called, failed (but it was an interesting failure). A third movie about AI, a Spanish movie called Eva, was also brilliant. Eva was more moving and this movie more philosophical. But both movies were perfect in their different ways. The AI's name in this movie, Ava, seems to be a nod to the title of the Spanish movie. As an aside, it's nice that no 'stars' appeared in 'Ex Machina' and 'Eva', the casting was great. Of course there are several aspects of this movie that are unrealistic and often absurd. But because this is an allegorical movie, these are acceptable, because the movie is making points, rather than striving for realism. It's more of a fairytale than accurate portrayal.",9,189,235,11 September 2015
The Illusionist," Gorgeous looking, criminally dreadful plot
","This movie was sadly a disappointment. Spoilers ahoy! This movie set itself up as mystery, so much so, that I set out to solve it. Unfortunately I solved the 'surprise' the moment it purportedly appeared.Never in a movie has the solution been so signposted, signalled, foreshadowed, and hinted at. I could have forgiven this obvious defect had it comprised some wit. Yet it was a weak twist. Worse, the happy ending of the movie depended on incurring the death of a villain who was more of an intellectual than a loathsome evil-doer. We are told he beats up women, yet we are never shown him as anything except a rather interesting chap with a bit of a temper. The villains demise was nothing short of a cold and calculating murder of an innocent man by proxy by the 'hero' in effect. And the hero himself was devoid of much character. He gives some coins to some kids, so that we cheer him on as a fine fellow in a mindless ploy to get us to like him.Through the movie, I consistently liked the villain, and grew to despise the magician. Such a waste! And the impossible tricks he performed were unexplained. Projection was patently impossible. Those images were holograms, how did he do that, I am still baffled! How did that sword trick operate? If it were supernatural, then the plot fails, for he could just magic his way out of trouble.The Prestige, an infinitely better written and executed movie, SPOILER ahead - did cheat, but this cheating was carefully sandboxed and was used to great effect, they pulled it off. But here the cheating is not acknowledged nor explained.Shame, I really was expecting to like this movie.",4,1,2,22 March 2007
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," This is Disney trash, not Star Wars
","This movie was, like the Abrams movie, horrible. We need a rebellion against Disney nonsense: these are movies presumably made by a politically correct HR committee. Bland. Man-shaming, whites-hating propaganda.
Luke Skywalker was reduced to a coward. And they also have the bad guy be a coward, all this man-shaming means that there is no tension. Even the guy who saves everyone is shamed by snotty female characters. Where's the Star Wars magic. I actually enjoyed the prequals. But here, none of the 'hero' characters were engaging, in fact they were just anoying. And the script was dire. Terrible plot. Terrible lines. 'You can do this', 'We've got to finish this'... Avoid this movie unless you like some SFX eye candy, but, casino scene aside, even that wasn't great.",3,8,12,13 May 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy," Excellent daft escapade
","This movie made me laugh. Most modern Hollywood comedies leave me cold, Adam Sandler, Brat Pack drivel, for example. The reason I enjoyed this was that I liked the characters. The chemistry between the male and female leads was best when they were antagonistic, when he disgusted her. I didn't buy into the romantic aspect of their relationship. The last half hour of the movie was by far the weakest, but I guess that they had to provide some climactic fireworks. The movie worked best when the characters were plotting, bitching and scheming. Also the last half hour would have worked better if the villain was less so-so. I didn't yearn for the downfall of the big villain very much and his female side-kick was sweet rather than menacing. This deflated what should have been a suspenseful climax. The visual and spoken gags were the movie's strong point, which worked best when Rocket was around. Rocket was one of those characters I love. Just his facial expressions alone had me laughing. Without Rocket, the movie would have lost a couple of points. Quill was charismatic and seemingly effortlessly pulled off a tricky blend of foolish clown and heroic leader and straight man to Rocket.",9,1,5,15 September 2015
Saw," Warning: movie contains intelligence
","Spoilers. I noticed a few comments about the 'over-acting' of the Doctor guy. I wonder how it is that people that write those comments actually know how a human being who is under extreme stress, and whose wife and kid are in the hands of a sadist would actually behave? Are you critics of such acting speaking from some kind of experience here? Or are you just looking, as one insightful poster pointed out, for an understated performance. To have enough adrenaline to saw off your leg in the hope of saving your loved ones does not call for a bullshit Keanu Reeves style grace under pressure turn. Understated performances are actually rather cowardly, easier to do and are certainly dull. That's why 'stars' underact. Sadly people now think that under-acting is good. If you have ever seen anyone stressed to the point that they crack up and panic, then you will not describe their behavior as stoic and understated. I'm no expert in psychology but I know enough to say that it is difficult to say whether such acting is realistic or not. But it was good enough for me. Saw steals from various movies, yet it manages to have its own personality and has more creativity than a million mainstream flicks. It is often suggestive, occasionally genuinely gory. And, SERIOUS SPOILERS, the twist ending is a corker! I enjoyed this movie, it set up an amazing initial scene and then kept up the suspense aside from the woefully unsatisfying detective scenes, which felt tagged on and pointless, badly acted ('you need a girl friend') and cliché (noticing a detail on a video tape, why they didn't spot that earlier leaves the mind boggled). The movie, at it's core, is influenced by computer adventure games, I suspect. Here's a situation, solve it or die. The most suspenseful scene for me was the one where a poor woman's had to solve a particularly unpleasant puzzle or lose her jaw. Awesome!",9,0,0,10 November 2004
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Fun, but the magic of the first movie has gone
","The first Guardians movie was fantastic, it made me laugh more than just about any other and I simply love that movie. This movie felt completely different, the movie makers were trying too hard and the magic slipped through their fingers. The first movie had an easy charm, it worked because it was fresh, original and they nailed the characters. Here they laid on the family-relationships stuff way too thick. It was not so much a comedy as a soap opera with corny lines. The chemistry between the lead couple was gone. And who cared about the sisters' squabbles? All of this felt laboured. Family this, family that, it felt as if we were being emotionally manipulated rather than entertained. Even Rocket was dragged into this over-egged family theme. The villain (SPOILER) didn't seem evil, rather, just a lonely, sad old God. The movie made us really like him and then tried to get us to hate him. It didn't work. Stallone made an unwelcome appearance, he snapped me out of the movie. The first movie worked precisely because it didn't feel like a Hollywood movie, as opposed to 'Expendables' nonsense of trying-to-be-cool-with-the-youth comedy stuff. This movie, Guardians 2, started great but ended horribly, with criminals making a firework display, complete with bangs in space. And some flaky skits in the credits. The first movie was so funny, for me at least, largely because of Rocket, a genius comic creation. But here Rocket was sidelined, in favour of all the soppy soap stuff. And his comedy in this movie seemed a bit forced. The 'Taserface' joke wasn't funny. The villain may have been called Ego, but Ego could have been the name of this entire movie. On the other hand, the opening credits and fight with the octopus fish monster were hilarious, (though I wanted to see more of the out-of-focus monster, and not the dancing plant, but that was part of the clever joke) but after that, the laughs were few and far apart, and as for the cheese: 'He was your father but not your daddy' Eh? With the resources spend on this movie, they could have tightened it up, ditched the pointless sisters side plot - and coming to think of it - the lame metrosexual gold-people plot - and added in comedy in the style of the first movie, and stopped trying to press all the emotional buttons all the time, hell, one of the characters actually did that literally, in a manner of speaking, with her antenna.",6,6,13,29 April 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Ugly, souless formula
","Where to start? Terrible casting, especially the foppish English villain. Boring night-time effects. Gotham is ugly. One yearns for the beauty of the Burton Batman movies. Zero suspense, the formula has been done to death. Whose stupid idea was it to have Wonder Woman come to the rescue the boys? I thought I mind find something fun in this movie, but nothing was fun, everything about it makes me loathe it.",3,1,8,2 July 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Mediocre Hollywood block-buster garbage
","Saw the new Star Wars Movie OMFG it was bad bad BAD, much worse than the prequels. Where to start? The two main protagonists were morons (talking in idiotic Hollywood cliché's like, 'I can do this') with no charisma and I didn't care about them one way or another. The movie picked up (slightly) when Han Solo magically pitched up. On that topic, I really missed Ewan MgGreggor, who, along with Palpatine and the wacky aliens, made the prequels fun, I must confess I enjoyed the prequels, for all their faults. But this movie: AVOID AVOID AVOID. --- SPOILERS AHEAD!!! The villain was the son of Solo, a foppish fellow in a black suit, a Darth Vader Lite. He was about as menacing as a pooch. So, the Star Wars stars were rubbish, lets take a look at the plot. This was the original recycled (rebooted?), basically, only without the charm. And then we're supposed to believe that a lowly scrap scavenger lass can supernaturally pilot a massive spaceship evading zippy tie fighters. WTF? And then she can rip some electronics from the cockpit and thereby magically fix the craft when it breaks down? No wonder Solo scoffed. Then she turned into a full blown Jedi, able to fend off Darth Vader Lite with a light sabre and use Jedi Mind tricks on a conveniently lonesome guard. The plot also relentlessly relied on coincidences, with characters turning up exactly on cue in specific locations on specific planets across a galaxy. Most of all, The Force Awakens did not feel like a Star Wars movie, the prequels were much closer in this regard. this movie felt exactly like a generic Hollywood director making a 'reboot' of the first star-wars movie. There was only one single point in the movie where I felt any sense of surprise or emotion or suspense. There is seldom art in Hollywood movies any more. Don't bother going to see this drivel.",4,52,71,31 December 2015
The Great Gatsby," Mixed feelings
","For me the most enjoyable element of the movie were the nostalgia-like reconstructions of the historical city. Sure some scenes seemed slightly fake in places but the CGI was generally remarkably good and I loved the feeling of going back in time. Of course watching Black and White movies really do take you back, but, and I hate to admit this, colour does add that extra dimension. The rest of the movie fails somewhat. Modern Hollywood movies are generally acted pretty well except for one vital element - chemistry. Chemistry is missing so often in modern movies I'm wandering what the matter is. The leads seem somehow miscast. Toby M. seems too wimpy, the lady was not charismatic and Gatsby lacked presence. Tom was the only actor who did seem genuine. As for music, that was horribly judged. They put all the effort into the visuals to make us feel part of an historical world, then yank us out of it by playing modern crap like Rap. Note to filmmakers, Rap is cliché now, pretentiously besmirching a movie with it does not make your film hip with the kids. It just makes you look desperate. After the build up the movie didn't really seem to have much to say and was not at all moving. But the loving reconstruction of the old City was incredible.",6,1,1,26 November 2017
The Wizard of Oz," Enchanting, almost nostalgic art!
","With trepidation I decided to watch The Wizard Of Oz, for I have memories of it from when I was five, 32 years ago. My memory was of a flying house, and of a laughing witch, who didn't quite look like the witch I saw yesterday, but that is false memory for you! Of course yesterday I saw the movie as a hardened adult, as opposed to a pure innocent, so philosophically I am a different person. Even if there were no nostalgia in memory, there would have been, I feel sure, a sense that the morals of this movie would never be repeated today. We live in a world where even infants' dolls have been sexualised with makeup. Of course no time in history was innocent, but here we had a media that put warmth above 'cool', charm above cynicism. There is something of a relatively European feel about Oz, a sensation I rarely see with Hollywood, with the magical The Lord Of The Rings trilogy being another example. The movie was an absolute joy to watch, such pleasure from movies is rare to be had, and I cannot recommend this enough, not just as an antidote to MTV-generation philistinism, but as a genuine work of art. No doubt much has been written on the skill and joyousness of the acting , the amazing sets, the imagination, the witty songs, the metaphors and the songs, all of which are perfect. I recommend showing this to all kids, it has so much more depth than the tacky, merchandising-driven modern stuff they ingest! And equally I recommend it to grown-ups, for we need this therapy more than the kids :)",10,12,15,19 December 2005
