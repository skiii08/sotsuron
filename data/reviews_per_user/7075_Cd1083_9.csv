Casablanca," Meh. It was alright.
","I'll open up with my unpopular opinion. I wasn't a fan of Casablanca. It's was over the top, it was pompous and most importantly I just didn't enjoy it. Most of this has to due with context. I had some trouble on the first go around grasping everything that was going on, but I'm not holding any of that against the film.The credit I will give to Casablanca is the dialog is engaging and the cinematography is excellent. The music is perfect and the acting is amazing. It's at this point I even have to ask myself, why didn't I like it? I don't know, I just didn't. It didn't speak to me in the way that lesser films have. It's quite possible that in repeat viewings I'll pick up a detail I missed the first time around and have a renewed appreciation for the film, but as it stands now I respect Casablanca for everything that it is, but I didn't enjoy it and in my eyes that's the most important part of a film, no matter how important it may be historically.",6,3,5,12 May 2015
Chinatown," To tell you the truth, I lied a little.
","Film Noir is my favorite genre and I'm ashamed to admit that until now I have never seen Chinatown. The fact that it's not technically a Film-Noir and more accurately defined a Neo-Noir is irrelevant because had this exact film been released in 1954 instead of 1974 nobody would have argued its classifications. I really enjoyed Chinatown. Jack Nicholson did an excellent job playing Jake Gittes and got me vested in a story that could have bored me to tears if not executed just right. Too many melodramas rely so much on their characters being over the top that they neglect to give them depth and make them interesting and make the audience care about the same things they care about. This is where Chinatown really succeeds. The dialog was overdone and outside of the remembered film closure, unforgettable, however the characters throughout make this film legendary.Visually, Chinatown looks amazing. It doesn't physically look like your prototypical noir film because there are so many bright scenes, but the mood is there even when the contrast is not. The lighting does not prevent this film from feeling dark throughout.Upon the film's conclusion, my first thought was that I needed to watch it again. I know I missed subtleties and that my first viewing was only a primer to prepare myself for the second go around. It's easy to see why Chinatown is always on best films of all-time lists. It doesn't disappoint.",10,2,3,12 May 2015
Citizen Kane," Underwhelmed
","I know that this is supposed to be the greatest film of all-time, but I just don't see it. Was it an enjoyable film, mostly, but if I were to make a list of my favorite films I can't say that this one would even be a consideration. Therein lies much of the debate regarding what is considered the 'best' films. On a technical level Citizen Kane sure does impress. The camera work progresses the story, the music is engaging and the editing is top notch. They all do an amazing job of elevating the story. The problem is that it felt like work watching the movie. Good movies should never have me looking at my watch wondering how much longer it has to go. I can appreciate the innovate nature that this film provided, but I don't sit in awe of a wooden wheel just because it was the first of its kind. That might be simplifying it a tad, but on my first viewing of Kane, it just didn't speak to me in the way other modern technical marvels do.Context is crucial when reviewing films of this nature and I just don't have enough of it to fully appreciate the necessary details. Most of the dialog was engaging, but overall I just wasn't that interested in the of Kane. The flashbacks were creative and engaged me enough that I felt invested, but most of the time I was just waiting for it to all end.I can't say that I disliked Kane, but like most films, my expectations were set so much higher than they really should have been for a film of this nature. Good film, not great. I liked it enough to not regret watching it, but it will be sometime before I choose to watch it again.",6,0,6,13 May 2015
Annie Hall," So Neurotic; So Glorious.
","I never would have expected to like Woody Allen. There is just something about his nasally voice that sets the expectation of boredom. When watching Annie Hall for the first time I wasn't really sure what to expect. I knew this was a film about a man and a woman and I knew it was set in New York City, though beyond that I assumed I was either about to watch an hour and a half of neurosis or an existential art film. It turns out I was right. What I was wrong about is how much I enjoyed it. There are so many unconventional storytelling methods used here. Despite many of them now considered being trite, breaking the fourth wall, they all feel original in this 1977 classic.The general plot of Annie Hall wasn't particularly interesting, but the characters created and the conversations are strong enough to make the story feel fresh and clever. There are plenty of gags here that turn this romantic comedy into a film that will make you forget you're watching a romantic comedy. In a traditional sense of course since modern romantic comedies have soured the term.Annie Hall has opened the door to Woody Allen for me. I'm not sure if I'll like anything I find inside, but what I do know is that I'm interested to see what else I can find from a director that I've ignored for far too long.",9,0,0,12 May 2015
2001: A Space Odyssey," No Words
","Is there anything that can be said about this amazing film that hasn't already been said? How about, I have no idea what this film is about? That's been said before? It honestly doesn't matter that this film is a confusing one to follow, mainly because it's one you'll want to watch over and over again regardless. The obvious themes here of human evolution and Ai are incredible topics to experience from a late sixties point of view, but it's the dialog and lack thereof that make this film one of the best ever. The music, the special effects and the cinematography are all great. In fact there really isn't anything negative anybody can say about 2001 except for the fact that it's weird. It's not your standard plot with progressive nature of storytelling. It jumps around spatially and temporally. It's a treat to experience because even though it's complicated, it's not convoluted. 2001 is a perfect movie to start off with if you were to start a film club. Have a group of friends together some Sunday afternoon and watch the film Â…check that, make it a Saturday afternoon because you're going to end up spending the entire evening debating about what it all means; especially the final scene. 2001 is my favorite Kubrick film and it's always a must see, no matter how many times I've seen it.",10,2,4,13 May 2015
The Graduate," Third Time's the Charm.
","I had seen The Graduate two other times prior to this most recent viewing and I wasn't much of a fan. There was such a high expectation established prior to my first viewing that I was inevitably let down when the film was over and nothing that special happened. I used to consider myself a film buff because I had seen a lot of movies. After disliking a revered film like this I began to question my taste in films. Why did I dislike it? After some time to let my initial impressions digest I decided to give it another watch and much like the first time I just didn't 'get' it. What was I missing?The third viewing was different from the first two because I had what I was previously missing, context. On this occasion instead of expecting the film to entertain me, I broke the film apart to see what made it special. It's when taking the time to observe the clever editing and overall flow of this film that I was able to see what everybody was talking about. The key difference I didn't even think to look for the first couple times was the generational gap theme throughout. I had misinterpreted it as simple teenage angst or apathy, but in reality it was a much more complex emotion. Recognizing this along with being able to recognize the unique cuts used gave me a new appreciation of what I was watching.One thing that I still was unable to shake is the fact that the music becomes incredibly repetitive throughout. I believe there were about three songs throughout that were repeated. Sound of Silence/Scarborough Fair and Mrs. Robinson. The quality of these tunes is inarguable, but the lack of variety is hard to ignore.Overall I can now say I'm a fan of this film, though it isn't quite strong enough for me to consider it one of my all-time favorites.",8,0,0,12 May 2015
Singin' in the Rain," I laughed all right.
","I don't like musicals. I should like musicals. I like music; I like movies. Why don't I like musicals? If I had a quick guess it would be because most musicals are made for people who don't like movies. They're made for the same type of people who enjoy high-octane action films. They're all sizzle without the steak. Singin' In the Rain is sizzle, it's steak, and it's a fully dressed baked potato as well. I don't like musicals, but I loved Singin' In the Rain.Sure, the music was great, but the story was better. The cinematography was amazing and overall it just felt like an event while watching it. The only moment I even took the time to blink was during the ballet scene. It was at this moment I recognized why I don't like musicals.This movie was funny, it was gorgeous to look at, and it was cleverly edited. I'm not sure Hollywood could make another film like this without turning it into a giant cast blockbuster of an event and as a result end up bombing at the box office.I never thought that my favorite film of all-time would be a musical, and I'm still not 100% sold that it is, but it's certainly in the discussion.",10,0,1,12 May 2015
Pulp Fiction," I Love You, Honey Bunny.
","There is zero debate that this film is the greatest film ever created. If there were a debate, I'd pay full admission to hear Vincent Vega and Jules Winfield have it. Pulp Fiction is what any film lover should consider to be a contemporary classic. Quentin Tarantino does everything right in this 1994 Classic. Sure Pulp Fiction is violent; sure it's full of swearing, and a mild case of Bruce Willis genitals yet that mean it shouldn't be shown in every school across America, this film is an American treasure!In all seriousness, this is a great film. It's not often a film can end with the beginning and have you walking out completely unsure of what temporal space any of the scenes witnessed came from, yet still able to follow along the entire time. Tarantino does the imaginable by creating taking 3.5 short stories and editing them together so perfectly while putting the focus entirely on the dialog. It really didn't matter what happened in this movie so long as the characters were talking. Visually the film stands up as well today as it did twenty years ago, which is simply the cherry on top of this ice cream Sunday. Not enough good things can be said about this pop culture icon. The piece of the film that might be the most unsung hero is the music. Most film buffs will be quick to point out 'Miserlou' as being one of the best film theme songs ever, yet I've yet to here a casual viewer speak in awe of the great musical accompaniment.Pulp Fiction. Go Watch It.",10,0,2,11 May 2015
The Wrestler," Randy 'The Ram' fights his toughest foe yet...time.
","It's truly a shame that a film as captivating as 'The Wrestler' can go ignored by so many viewers based purely on its subject matter. The professional wrestling industry has been a joke from its incarnation, yet only one watch of this film will give you a whole new respect for the men and women that step inside the squared circle. 'The Wrestler' isn't a documentary, but its cinematography allows you to get lost in the story and believe everything happening to Randy 'The Ram' Robinson is true. Mickey Rourke puts on a performance of a lifetime and transforms himself into a broken down former wrestling great that is now living in his past; milking every ounce of glory that he has left in his body.From beginning to end we as the viewer can't help but like Randy no matter how many flaws he reveals. It doesn't matter he can't pay his rent or takes illegal drugs; his charm pushes those faults to the back and it becomes very believable that he was a main even icon twenty years earlier. The interplay between Rourke and Marisa Tomei is captivating. Tomei's Cassidy is a stripper paralleling Randy's conflict with age. Her best years behind her, Cassidy doesn't have the same passion for her career that 'The Ram' does. Cassidy does it for the money, Ram does it for the fame. It's in Randy's attempt to transition into something more that we see ourselves. Coming to grips that his body can't handle anymore physical abuse he does everything he can do rebuild broken relationships and build new ones.Mickey Rourke must be applauded for his commitment to the role. This performance required 100% investment in order to truly capture the essence of the film; he did that and more. A role that catapulted back into mainstream discussion of leading men, Rourke must have seen a little of himself in this character. The result of his work was an Academy Award nomination for Best Leading Man. Physically, Mickey looked the part so much that we start to believe that he's the man he's portraying. In an industry like professional wrestling where so much importance is invested into name value, very little suspension of disbelief is necessary in creating a realistic wrestling world for us to attach to. Mickey instantly gives the fictional environment credibility.With the limited budget, Director, Aronofsky ends up with a film that benefits from the lack of gloss and glamor. Another director with more money might have been inclined to bring in more wrestlers with name value and larger venues thus losing the intimate charm we find here. The behind the back filming style along with the incredibly strong score rounds out an 'independent' gem that must be experienced. Don't let the plot, revolving around a professional wrestler, sour your impression into missing one of the best films of this century.Read this and my other film reviews at CD1083.com",10,1,1,5 February 2015
