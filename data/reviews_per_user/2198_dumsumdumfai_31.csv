Blade Runner 2049," Subtleties of Emotions
","There is a scene near the end, when K goes on his way after being informed that he is not who he think he is, to find Dekkard again. He stops in the middle and a gigantic hologram of Joi seemingly talking to him. He paused for a moment then went on his way. In that brief pause, to me, was a brief expression of realisation and sadness.
The realisation is that he was living a dream. Not a lie. But a dream that the world sold to him. But I am not sure I have that fully correct.This is a very thoughtful movie. It showed us what emotions everyone of us takes for granted, but ironically, place it onto the of makeup of a replicant. Dread, fear, loath, hope, anger, melancholy, grief, lost, happiness, frustration, confusion, elation, betrayal, loneliness ... you name it it's mostly there. Or at least the situation encountered presented these possible emotions. But how K is capable (or tried to) process these and express these is another question. More, what's more important , K the replicant is able to display that he is able to think on his own terms, make his own decisions, and ultimately find his own way. Which is more than I can say for some of us.And then, at the end, K makes a sacrifice - giving up the present for the future. The future of others. And this is significant - a magnanimous gesture to a degree. - and with his own existence no less. What a great movie.",9,1,12,14 February 2018
3:10 to Yuma," what was it all about ?
","Good novels, movies are not about logic, plot holes and storyline but emotions, motivations and connections.Same here. This could be a remake into a non Western movie but the impact would not be the same - not the same connection. The emotions and motivations would be there but not the connection. The connection of father to child, dignity to integrity, responsibility to honor, in a somewhat more simple time - when traveling wasn't easy; legend grows out of rumors, communities are small, but courage - like it has always been - hard to define.And we as the audience won't feel the same if this story wasn't set in a Western environment - the best of which are about hardship, dignity, and psyche of the New harsh World.the Scot, Christine Bale is amazing as always - understated and sure, disappearing into the role. Crowe is more himself I thought.",10,1,2,11 September 2008
Se7en," nothing new... but it's a surprise...
","**spoilers ahead* nothing new... really... but the movie just have 2 surprise endings.. and one of which - kind of fake surprise -is in the middle of the movie. this is the citizen kane of serial killer genre - and how they can have that ending get pass the studios must be a great story - maybe it's in the DVD commentarie(S)On 2nd or 3rd viewing though, you see that the production value is fairly basic. John Doe's room is kind of sparse, you really don't see the diary books in closeup except for the opening. I wished the camera angles, perspectives, and close-up are much more personal; and have a POV, but the story seems to be have multiple POV, and you're an observer. So the '10' given here is for 3 things : the 2 surprises and the ending to be official. Sort of like the book :'There are two errors in the the title of this book'<ul><li>subtitled : so what are the 2 errors?</li></ul>",10,1,2,10 September 2008
Star Trek," Revamped for the 12 years old.. wait .. 8 year old... wait
","Background: I'm not a Trekkie, or Trekie or what have you. That means do not own any costumes, toys, DVDs or go to any conventions. But have watch many (not all) of the original series, plus some the moderns ones (not deep space nine) and maybe 6 of the movies.This one - the new Star Trek - is exciting but on the surface only. It is just so that you are spared to think about the non-science, and My God, the tell-you-as-is-it plot, and eye gouging emotions. These points are the more objective ones, there are subjective ones like the character of the crew ..which are, to me, much less ..controversial let say.The plot is of the type of .. 'maybe the audience is dumb'. It tells/ reassures like that of the DiVinci's Code - they make sure they explain all the sequences. While the science is the other way around - they make sure they do not use meaningful ones and just throw some terms out to impress girls and solve the plot. (Spoiler: Think of what would happened to Earth with that size of the black hole. And I am sure there's plenty of discussion on the time travel aspect already. Oh..how about that gigantic red matter when all you need is probably a fist full..?????)Emotionally, everything is going for broke with so much on screen extremes - loudness instead of subtlety; hot blooded boldness instead measured cunning. It is fast and furious in space instead of the origins of the flying dark knights....if you know what I mean. And I quote Bones ..'Jim.. what the hell is this mess!!!!' What a travesty!!! Theoretically this 2 is probably the lowest I've given on this site. It should have been a 4 but the more I think about it...never mind, 2 it is.",2,22,32,15 June 2009
Fight Club," Cooler than it needs to be..
","With a twist ending, this seems a touch much on the cute side than it needs to be. So not dark enough.It's kind of like Usual Suspect in a sense. It is clever enough but lacks the security and confidence so it shows off a bit more than it needs to be.And the voice over is kind of disorienting, it didn't really keep me in the film. Maybe that was the distraction needed.But no detracting that it is good movie. That it is focus, the violence not excessive but has a point. True to the nature of the characters. Gets it right on the tone, settings, intensity ..etc.Brad is brad like he was in Thelma and Louise; and Norton is norton like he was in Illusionist (not Amerian history X). Really. But yet different. I think Helena is miscast in some way.But other than that, I can't get more specific.So is it really a 9 for me? I might have to reconsider.",7,1,4,31 August 2011
Citizen Kane," technicality
","It is almost frightening to write a review about this film. Mainly because of reputation. So long, on top of a top lists of lists. What hasn't been said already.OK, I am giving in and writing, but don't expect I can live up to the movie. Or some other reviews to analyze it. I'm like the Pauline Kael style, blunt, to the point, show your emotions.I'm doing this to say I've seen this while in my 30s and can well understand the hands down voting. (And because it's so much better than Gone with the Wind also - some say you can't compare genres .. SURE you can!!!) Kane is a as technically perfect as it gets, but the story has no heart. The plot does - but not the composite culminating end product. It is a product - a perfectly chiseled statue of David. But it has no meaning with the story of David. The B&W is superb, the complexity of the shots and edit are saying 'look at me!' So I'm changing my vote - from 10 to 8. I even like Joe vs. the Volcano better than this. Sure in a different way - the way that the movie connects to me as an audience - not as a critic.",8,0,1,3 March 2011
Troy," What's not to like ?
","This is kind of a throwback - to the grand productions - like 10 commandments; Moses; Cleopatra..etc. But of course using CGI.And you have the big stars, the impossibly grand dialogue, the not happening female roles, the war stand-offs, the one-on-one battles. Provided you have to see the extended version with the wandering dog beginning. I like this and Kingdom of Heaven. So dusty, so macho that it is foolish. But it takes its time - that's the key. Not an impossible Sands of Time or Clash of Titans singly pacing tragedy like those. This has pace. Sure I laughed at some spots. But it is entertaining!!!!And I like the background music, the detail cinematography. The audacity in attempting to convert a epic poem into some sort of reality.The ending is kind of Ho-Hummmmmmmm with the Trojan Horse no less. Probably needed more time/version/resource to think it through. No doubt scheduling didn't worked or something like that.",8,1,2,3 March 2011
My Neighbor Totoro," I have a cat name Totoro
","I like this so much that years later I name a cat I got as Totoro.But this movie is very very different from Western style in terms of tone and concept. And this is not for young child, teenager maybe.The climax and high points are not plot based. Some sequences are not plot linked. There are dream sequences and reality mixing together. And which is which may not be explained. It is to be breath in.You won't be overwhelm with a detail intricate story but rather detail intricate, thoughtfully translated emotions. You have to think a little to understand what was said, or how it was said, or shown or can be interpreted.It is a wonderful film.",10,1,4,8 June 2012
The Prestige," was the intend to let the viewer to figure out the 'prestige' of the movie?
","it is curious to me after watching the film that why some of the scenes that gave way Borden's version of 'the transported man', or more obviously, Angier's version, was left in the film.It seems that if those scenes were cut, outcome would have had more ... 'wow' factor, with more of a The Sixth Sense type of ending. But that way, IMHO, would be less friendly in terms of increasing audience participation level, and more in-line with the introduction by Michael Caine on the 3 'acts' of magic.Or was that the trick? Since the film is so plot based, the element that would 'interest' a goer would be how the twist of the plot can be presented, in a refreshing way, instead of cheating out the audience, or adapt more character insight - which the story do not allow in the film slot time of around 120 minutes, and the 2 major characters.would I rate this higher then The illusionist? Or can it be compared? I'll leave that up to you!!!",8,0,1,21 February 2007
Fargo," warmth in the coldness
","for me, there's always a shot in every Cohen brother movies that you're not quite sure what you are looking at or what's going on. In Millers' Crossing it's the moment the guy was about to lift up a chair and beat up G. Byrne in the warehouse. In Lebowski, it was the human painting thing. In Fargo, it's one scene shot square from the top of the parking lot looking down.It seems these are almost intentional ? But only the Coehns can answer that.Each movie try to evokes and entice certain feelings. for me, Fargo, seems to try to contrast the warmth of some characters against the coldness of others, namely the murderers. How the cold ones can range from resisting to truly unfeeling (such a word?) by nature; and the warm ones live and find warmth, not in themselves but mostly in others, or relating to another that can relate to.did you get that?",8,0,0,11 September 2008
Oblivion," Moon .. anyone ?
","Although technically well done and I highly, very highly applaud this movie for strongly letting the action take the back seat (But Tom Cruise is still Tom Cruise in the movie (e.g. Jack Harper is and ID) ), the plot have that eerie you've-seen-it-somewhere-before feeling.Especially if you have seen the better performance but lower budget Moon staring Sam Rockwell.Albeit not hard to guess and I don't think the similarity was intentional ,(it just maybe my confirmation bias), the story takes its time and this alone might throw someone off. Taking its time like Wall-e's 1st act. And for once, a dystopian sci-fi that shows a lot of sun time instead of dark lit scenes, or rainy, or night time actions only.But there are action sequences .. a somewhat extended sequence near the end in a cave complex. But that is more of a time killer then a plot device. And not too well executed in that it brought nothing new to the technical table.Yet in another way, this movies has not a lot of surprises. Maybe I was hoping for yet another Matrix 1.",8,1,4,22 April 2013
Watchmen," Feels like Sci-Fi version of L.A. Confidentials
","Yes, it does have a noir x superheros x sci-fi feel. That is obvious. What is not obvious it could have been better served (audience, novel, story) with more on the editing floor.Have not seen the graphic novel but heard other then a boat/ocean subplot opted out, much is same. For how it is already, it has an other worldly, philosophical feel arleady. The movie pauses at some point, moves at others - the action bits. And maybe explains just too much at the end.Would have prefer more pauses, more symbolic and meta-physical 'feel' or retelling of the story. And leave out some of the 'plot'-point, explanation bits. Technically well done, but not emotional satisfying for me.",8,1,6,11 May 2009
American Psycho," surprisingly .. funny!?
",Tuned into this middle of the night and I'm not sure was is Bale got my attention or the look of the film - The cool tones and the 'steelish' suits. I skip about here and there to other channels but still came back.*spoilers*.. the internal dialogue on the business card bit is exceedingly funny; and the gotta return my VHS tape line is just priceless.Never read the book but book and film are 2 very different media.. one is fairly time limited and imagines the visuals (and story choices) for you while the other basically runs on each readers' own imagination. And each author (writer vs director/actor..etc) has their own focus with the 'material'... so your'e not comparing apples to apples.,9,2,3,11 September 2008
Van Helsing," It does take me awayyyyyyyyyyy
","So far away, i wasn't sure it was time travel or concussion.Yeah, this is completely over the top even for a fantasy genre. And the tone is uneven from the crazy professor to the fighting scenes.Its got hooky references to James bond, the alien like eggs, the obvious story line. The lead female - so dashing yet strong, and Val Helsing so ... Wolverine ?!?!?!? And the running time soooo long.But it does take me away with overkill CGI, stupendous musical score. I mean .. cost/benefit ratio or ROI ? Smashingly over valued!!! More entertaining than F.F Coppola's Dracular (not necessarily better tho).When you need dumb entertainment this is it. Better than video cutting of Armegedden.albeit I saw this at home. Probably too loud in a theatre. 6/10 then",7,1,3,3 March 2011
Lawrence of Arabia," why is this my favourite film
","Roger Ebert wrote an excellent article on this topic 'whats_your_favorite_movie' And his choice is La Dolce Vita, this is my choice.I first saw this as a young teenager, in the middle of the night, some movie channel re-run, when infomercials hadn't come to fruition yet. But don't think I finished it, but I remember the matchstick scene.mind you, there are 2 kinds of boys - one turn on by mystery, the other by excitement. i'm the first kind if you have not already guested.Sometimes later, still as a teenager, I saw the complete film, again late nite movie channel. from the opening the music, the motorcycle scene it got my attention. Then it as the desert scenes. I admired the external beauty of the shots. The film stayed in my mind, mythical almost, but not fully understandable - certain aspect bothered me to a degree, but I didn't pursuit it further. Looking back, it is the finding of oneself, true self and live it - however improbable it is was probably the underlying attraction. And i didn't understand the torture scene part - too subtle for my attention at the time.Yet again, years later I saw it re-release 70mm, wide screen. It didn't feel great, but why did I go?When I started traveling, by chance I visited Egypt, Jordan and the 7 pillars location, the wells, and the dunes in the edge of Sahara. then I understood the beauty and the illusion of the desert - that it 'seems' infinite, without bearings, within a measure of how far, how near, how to measure/gauge things - almost anything - even your emotions to some level. That is the aura and that is how one can feel in life some times. The movie is a more or less a search for self - a self that may or may not know the enormity of the situation that is in and what comes may. But through character, the situation changes the character and the character changes the situation. But isn't it also based on true events ? Yes, but these are then re-interpreted by David Lean. Is Lawrence a great man? For me, this movie shows not really. He is just true to his character and convictions, act when called upon, suggests what he knows but may not understand, fighting his fears and dignity when he needs to. Given others, maybe they will fade away - be aware of the situation and sell-out. Or be part of the story but not the forefront - like the 2 servants.Later on, when friends would ask me what is your favourite movie, I would say 'Lawrence' without really knowing why. Now after reading Ebert's article I know.",10,1,3,9 September 2008
Hellboy," Not a fan but entertaining enough
","The quick ending is kind of anti-climatic to all that setup and 'character' development.I've read none of the comics and like all graphic novel converted movies, you have to buy the fantastical premise. But also too much like all the others, it is just a story, I wish they could have done it first person - seeing the CG is so good in this one (the museum reconstruction sequence comes to mind). Or give the story more ... realistic meaning. I'm asking too much? But I'm asking.Too many stories have done this.. introduce .. do the background and it's all good, but kind of slow. I think the audience can be held more responsive. Mind you .. maybe not as much as Mulhulland Drive (but that would be an interesting graphic novel twist). And I guess if you go that far, the backing might not be there. However, if you do it right, it'll have a good chance to risk a cult following. Like Bukeroo, or Big Trouble, or even a Blade Runner.",7,0,0,22 June 2009
Moulin Rouge!," Only exception .. so far
","Mostly, I don't like musicals. The reasons being, it's not really a movie. However else fantastical the premise gets - I'm usually OK with that. Scifi, art-house, animation (dah!?), fantasy(up to a point), serial killer, comedy, and romantic comedies even.For me, musicals belongs to the stage. Cause people just don't break out in a song and dance. But this somehow works for me. Mostly because of the set, costume design and the swirling CGI.It works in that is it acceptable. The 8 is in relation to other movies - musical unbiased removed. Contrivices aside - the ridiculous love story, the insidious plot, the terminal illness...etc.Why? since all these are NORMAL within melodramas. So the argument is I'd rather watch these factors in a short 2.5hr musical with relatively young starts (Ewan and Nicole) ...with good choreography, lighting and cutting... than in 20 years of still camera shots in 'Days of our Lives'.",8,0,2,3 March 2011
Casualties of War," Tough cookie
","This is heart breaking to watch. Because it is so brutal and Sean Penn is so evil here, while MJ Fox so .. MJ Fox.And if you read about the details, the original story in the paper, the real sentences, the journalist and what he stood for all his career, all the more heart breaking.I think DePalma got a lot of slack for this. His 2 movies that opens the 80s --> Blow out and closing it --> this one are similarly in ending, however so that one is based on a true story the other not.This is what you get when a great technician with great material with great actors. It just clicks like clockworks. Every scene is a show stopper, every expression is intensified, every action perilous and full of scruples.",9,4,5,4 November 2011
The Dark Knight," Before the dawn
","Not that Burton's 1989 version wasn't as enthralling and Jack's Joker as top notch. At the time, for the period, with the competition, it worked and stood above. Times change, morals change, subjectivity and objective change. But to each it's own. Back then, however, I couldn't help but wonder about the pacing, the setups, dragged-along-for the-ride 'feeling'; the very 'set' looking production values, and the by-the-books progression of plot while watching at the first and second Batmans. And don't get me started about Reeve's Superman movies. Even the 1979 Alien was more effective. Partly, no doubt is the problem of transitioning the fantastic universe of comic heroes through an already suspended disbelief into another medium - the moving frames. Then The Matrix arrived giving us hope to see just maybe, maybe how far the rabbit hole goes. But Reloaded and Revolutions confirms that it has chosen the wrong color pill to swallow. With the movie machines of the world turning 5-10 movies out every week for North American viewers; and every one aspires to be a directors, actors, critic, writers, where is the QC? Or who is QCing the QCers? The studios? Until Spiderman II finds the proper mix of heart, character, plot and villain to give the superhero genre some burgeoning sprinkle of life, however idealistic and resilient still was the need for the big ending sequence. And came Batman 'Begins' in 2005, still idealistic, still adventure laced, and character arching. But it strayed back towards reality, mortality, and most of all, meaningful and careful writing. And here I was ever thrilled to find the rethought, reinvented. re'vision'ed Dark Knight. With the pulsating, pressurizing sound effects and sound track; well thought out storyline, agonizingly morality plays, and realistic horror and threats. As if the stars aligned to created a culmination of the best of the lot of predecessors (from a viewer's perspective): the languid, realistic and single-minded 'Unbreakable'; the romantic, and philosophic 'Blade Runner'; together with the brooding materials of the recent comics sources. Have it collide with Nolan, Bale and Ledger alike. Wam! Bang! Powwwwwww later, to become what it is - a worthy awards contender.The casts alone resembles a modern Oscar lists. Cane underplayed even more then before; Freeman a bit underused; Roberts under control; Oldman undeniable skilled, Bale is as uncompromising as Ledger, but scripts limits the character nevertheless. While Eckhart more solid than expected, Gyllenhaal made Dawes more realized, it was the story, the sequences, that solidifies the horrific, chaotic, symmetric yet asymmetric tone of this epic. I dare not give anything away nor should you read reviews to spoil the true adventure.Yes this is still a male-centric, megalomaniac piece. Certain emotions are missing or under developed in certain scenes, probably to keep pace, more certainly to save the clock; while others are simplified, gestured, or symbolized. Nonetheless and better for its genre, for it is no 'On Golden Pond', and apples should be compared to apples. While some critics critiques for the sake, some audience are in awe and overwhelmed. Do we know how insurmountable this movie make for all others that are still to come?",10,3,7,25 July 2008
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," eternal questions from a spotless movie
","without knowing sadness how can we know what is happiness? without the baggage or lessons of the past how can we be ready to face the future? without all the different perspectives, emotions or the people in the memories to share with how can any of our memories be true? I think the movie is asking these questions. And to come to this point, I had to dissociate with the movie for a while, leave it alone, let it stir in my mind. Because when I first and again saw this film, the emotional tone set by the cinematography, color palette, performance, dialogue, time line, and of course imaginary scenes, was overwhelming.The whole presentation and structure evokes a kind of freedom and that reflects on it's characters and their imagination, and sadly this will somewhat limit the film to appeal to a similar kind of audience too.The film is an articulate reflection of the mind, possibly comments on our instincts and behavioral hiccups of the human nature, and the utter, indescribable, unpredictable, unrelenting, mess of a chaos of that is the love from the 2 opposite central characters.Jim Carey is flabbergastingly real world and Kate Winslet can finally erase Titanic from our memory.",10,0,1,14 September 2005
Groundhog Day," What a premise
","The only thing that will make this movie seem dated is the costume and hair styling. Wish they could have made this in a Gataca-like set so it can last forever. (Come to think of it, it might work to the Gataca plot too) Bet no one really sees how good this movie can be/work except the crew and producer. Why it doesn't get more attention I have no idea (only thing I could think of is that the original idea came from another film - I'm fairly pessimistic about Hollywood) Murray is fabulous. Some of the scenes are very funny. A tad on the mushy, romantic side but acceptableOnce you accept the premise all you can think about is how do they get out of it ???",9,1,3,17 June 2009
Inception," concept vs execution
","Here's the rub. Although I am astounded by the layering, scene and editing logistics and other details of the movie, the experience left me underwhelmed. The are so much information to take in, more than usual for your average that while there are down times (I'll come back to this) they are not enough - and felt rush for a 2.5 hr movie. I wouldn't mind 3hr (maybe better yet as a series???! or a book even). And yet the focusing character is Cobb, a veteran of the trade, rather than the new comer - Ellen Page's character. So you must pick-up concepts like extraction, inception, dream times, totem, kicker, limbo in a hurry without laying any significant weight to these concepts. Especially in the scene on limbo? Mind you the movie repeats these to you - in earnest plot line no less.This is one information overloaded action movie, but then there's action loaded on top in the 3rd act! Which I found unnecessary or set at the wrong location as one of the character explained it. This is a concept movie, and should have stayed that way - use words, use dramatic pauses, use ideas ? Such that the sequence in discussing and finalizing the wording of the inception concept felt dry, washed over, had no sense of - achievement. -- added And I'll be darn that a friend mention this kind of plot hole : Knowing how ambiguous the ending is, but yet clearly stately throughout the first 1/2 of the film that the 'wife' character is so much of a risk. It was a wash over in the end how DiCaprio's character brushes off and not struggle a bit more ??????Thinking back, memento, prestige and dark knight in their own right were better in terms of pacing, tempo change, and focus. Although even Dark Knight had a issue of who's the lead - Batman or Joker? (But I understand the juxtapose of the 2 - starts off Bat, changed to Joker mid way, then change back?)And the back story for Cobb - kind of cliché????? You see it coming ??",7,5,10,1 August 2010
WALL·E," Vista
","Nice wide shots. About time for proper US sci-fi animation with some good selection of wides.Other then the humans 1/2 way through and some intentional gags with the laser beam... it's fairly well made. Especially the first 15min of silence. It's a risk.. but when combined with the rest it is not.\ And Wall-e looks too much like Short Circuit thingy with a bit of a homage to ET. And I guess they can't afford not to pick a musical, and not some old movie with another angle... like tricolor trilogy, or Wings of Desire, or the raining scene of In Cold Blood.It's better than Kung-Fu Panda .. on par with Rattatoulle(sp)..but have you seen the animation of Desperaux? that's different (not the logic of the story though)",8,0,3,12 May 2009
Rango," Not for kids under 10 ?,,,
","This is a very adult oriented animation movie. More so then say, Despicable Me (has a somewhat family theme) or Shrek, Ratatouille, Toy Story franchise or the likes.The opening alone is surreal and priceless (and might be confusing to kids). It is a standard Western, the plot is predictable, the villain obvious, that gives 10-2 = 8 score here. But otherwise, very nicely done.I thought that was Clint doing the voice over but no!!! And the returning questions : Who am I? and a hero can't walk out of his own story is a bit over the top but.. nice to have.Animiation is top notch, clear, crisp, detailed, unique with fantastic lighting. Voice by Johnny is just right, different than his PotC series. I know I don't have much reviews here on animations, maybe I should start a series.",9,3,5,24 March 2011
Prometheus," Feels ...in draft mode
","OKay, I get it. All the where we come from.. who created us .. God and Titan mythology reference. But that's it.Really like the first 1/2 of the movie and not really like most of the action sequences except the medipod and what happened to the 2 left behinds. And nice the entire story is not a direct link to original Alien and can span else where. (like the announced Prometheus 2) Plot, tech, and protocol holes aside (this is a given for all sci-fi), the writing even some of the action sequences feels like the whole thing is still in 3/4 'draft mode'. For example, the ending action sequence with the Engineer feels better paced in the extended scene.The storyline is again too point to point to my taste, and 'everyone' has an agenda OR has a body-counter slasher dying scene to take up time and character space. It didn't dwell like Alien of Blade Runner where it meandered and took long breaths. Would have like to linger more on processes of discovery, taking time on the planet, slowly finding out more intricacies, like the genetics, some secret meaning behind the technology...etc But I guess that would be no action, and have to eliminate the Guy Pierce character.Albeit the last sequence when the jokey machine gets going it was pretty good. On the other hand when the large C shape ship crashed ..it was really lucking it didn't kill both of the tiny humans on the ground ????Is it that they fear if pace is too slow it will drive away younger audience and lessen the pie to divide ? Counter example of pace would be Drive, which to me played much to the pace of Alien.This is a generous 7.",7,1,2,6 November 2012
The Silence of the Lambs," are you kidding me ? oh..... is that good
","what hasn't been said about this .. this surprise of a hit? Except maybe my personal experience.Looking back, gotta tell you when I was in the theatre for this, I wasn't ready for the depth of the dialogue. And that's a hit against it's original power. Like in one of the main exchanges, when Jodie utter Scream of the lambs - did I hear it right? While at this scene, a current day film(even possibility back then) might have choose to flashback --> and ruin the tension.Ther are many counterintuitive choices : the music that is ominous classical; the quiet interpretation by Hopkins; Foster plays the vulernabitity up as central character; the 2 villains. And don't think there was any real chase scenes.So when I saw it again later, awake and aware, it was like watching another movie almost.And how is that a remaster blu ray is not out for this???",9,1,2,30 August 2011
Blade Runner," Perfect melancholy
","A viewer's emotion must match that of the film. Or vice versa. And a review should be true to the viewing moments - not an afterthought. These are my premise.Saw this in the theatres when it came out. I still remember the shocking ending chase sequence - it told me to watch it again. The whole thing started off slow, with the interview, the sushi eating voice over.First shot, You can tell the more serious undertone with the opening sequence and fiery reflection in the eyes. The snake dancer chase sequence being wrapped around a damming score and slow motion. And the swirling car landing sequences...The interesting photo dissection sequence, the scene in front of the piano, and all the quiet moments is trying to lead you somewhere. Telling you this vision of the future of mankind.You are numbed after seeing all this. Numbed and unprepared for the final sequences or shooting, brick breaking, wall climbing, rooftop climax. Which awakes you - telling you just as Ford's character is in shock and disbelief.What a standard this is.",10,2,5,18 June 2009
Amélie," hopeless
","hopelessly sweet.. and good.How on earth did Jeunet have the guts turn out this mushy old tale? From the frantic opening to the gleeful ending you are never in doubt this is a feel good movie. there is only mean facial expressions and name calling, but it is buttered and honey dipped from head to toes.Story lagged a bit in the middle but each frame has so much going on it is almost distracting to the excuse of a story. It is a showcase of imagery; a cornucopia of colors; and sanctuary of eccentricity.if one wants to argue love is not everything.. one should not see this movie.",10,1,5,10 September 2008
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," so easy to watch .. but so little to think about
","Might as well get it out there. Sci-fi 'almost' never age well, and this is no exception. Consider episode 1,2,3 vs 4,5,6. (ok ..I,II,III vs IV,V,VI). Look at the original Alien, all the lights inside the ship looks so lo-tech. A2 is kind of like Nam. A3 bit better with Fincher - but story a bit awkward. Now look at Blade Runner - it is superb on blu ray - but maybe not in 2054. The more recent Matrix will probably look like cheese comes 10 yrs time.Well, back to the topic. When this came out and I only watch it once in theatre. Well... errrrh.. hohum, like the title said -> all exterior and not much interior. Just slightly above Michael Bay's best effort and that's The Island. (Now the look of that movie 'looks' good) And if you see THX 1138 by Lucas -> wow, you wonder with many many unpleasant questions.No, I'm not trashing this completely, with a value 6. There are good things - but none too memorable or can be identified with, for me. Roger Ebert said it --> it's a space opera. With large brushes of generality and campy dialogue to back it up.But that is just me, with sentiments toward the other end of the spectrum when it comes to Sci-fi. So STar Trek, Star War, all the same to me. Really.",6,2,8,31 August 2011
Contact," whom am I kidding - I saw this one maybe 4-6 times
","So if I don't give this a 10 -> I'm kidding myself (for wasting my time on the repeats) But I can't put my finger on it WHY this movie has this attraction for me. Albeit it's dying down now (no, i'm can't keep a fanatical state for more then 1 year).The movie is not as cerebral as Silence of the Lambs but the ambiguity of the 2 points of view - religious and scientific are clear enough. It is not as exciting (but much more scientifically sound) as other sci-fi action thrillers - like Total Recall (yeah ,really). It doesn't really have exceptional acting outside of Foster (McCoughing who?).Well and FX compare to what's available today is kind of boring. And the ending under the stars is absolute cheese.Maybe it was the direction then. The completeness of it, the unwavering sticking with the same tone.Now it is slowly dating a bit, so 9 it is.",9,1,4,30 August 2011
V for Vendetta," Over and under
","7 for the the idea 5 for execution, 6 for actingthe story is strong on ideas. but the film seems not to trust the story. where there are moments that ,IMHO, could be slow down a bit more, be more gentle, be more still, it didn't happened. instead there are always quick edits, constant flash backs ... is the movie trying to make up for the anticipation of action sequence that would attract the Matrix fans?and the acting seems out of balanced - that of Hurt, Portman and Weaving. And the action sequence near is kind of doing it's own sequel to the Matrix?*new* I watched this again and found what this truly lacks is the cinematic. The shot framing are not very inspiring, the story just moves along. The jail sequence is touching but done in a very simple way. Too simple when in fact that is the turning point.So I stand by my rating of 6. A good idea wasted on execution. Sort of the opposite of Watchmen.. good idea on good (but not excellent) execution.*end of new*",6,4,7,6 April 2006
