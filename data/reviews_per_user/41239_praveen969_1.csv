Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," One of the best movies ever.
","I watched this movie a week after it was released and what could I say? I absolutely loved it, it is THE funniest movie ever made. All the actors did an awesome job (especially Sacha Baron Cohen). The movie also managed to make fun of a lot of people/things.I think all the people who did not like this movie simply have NO (none at all) sense of humour whatsoever. Brinduc has also shown his utter lack of a sense of humour. I mean, this movie had everything a comedy movie should have and is a big difference from those stupid 'wannabe; comedy movies.Those with a REAL sense of humour would love this, worth every cent! 10/10.",10,10,21,24 June 2007
