Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Funny, but incorrect and not worth the money
","First of all I'd like to say I'm Romanian.This movie claims to be have a moral impact on Americans but all it does is be as POLITICALLY Incorrect as it can.First of all, what did the people of Khazakstan deserve to receive such a bad wrap? And what did the people from the Romanian village of Glod do to deserve being portrayed like savage inbreds? If anything they are a disadvantaged class of villagers, most of whom are gypsies. It's their way of life and they don't deserve being lied to in order for the all-hailed Brit to get a sack of money. Did you know they got 3 pounds (5 dollars) for their appearance in the film and were told that Cohen was making a documentary about their village? He never hired a translator to inform them about what he was saying so they all thought it was just casual humor. So much for consent.As for the other skits, funny, but at the expense of others.Frankly I would have enjoyed this film at the cost of watching the adverts at the beginning of the movie or buying a bottle of soda, not a full movie ticket. Cohen deserves no remuneration for this.",8,10,19,22 November 2006
