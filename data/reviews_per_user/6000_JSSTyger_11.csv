The Ring," Great Horror Film
","First i would like to say those of you who saw Ringu first should not even comment on this film. Why? because once you see one of them you begin having expectations for the other. Once one scares the crap out of you do you really believe the other one is going to scare you as much?? For those of us that did not see Ringu first, this was the horror movie we have all been waiting for. No pyschos with knives. No blood/gore. I found in some of the comments that this movie was unoriginal and in some of the other comments the movie did not follow the horror guidelines...well those two statements are pretty much contradictory which means those people are just blabbing for attention. If you are looking for an original horror movie i guess you can count out scream 1, 2, and 3, all the Friday the 13th and Jason movies, all the psycho movies ie. Silence of the Lambs, etc. Is it possible for a horror movie to be original?? The Ring is about as close as you can get to original.And now to blast away the people who gave negative reviews even further. Most of us know that what we fear the most is the unknown. The origin of Samara and her powers are not revealed to us. But honestly do we have to know? Many things do not need explained but will still scare the crap out of people. If you ever thought you saw a ghost you would neither care or think about how it got there and you would be scared out of your wits. Why are you scared? Because most supernatural phenomena cannot be explained and you cannot possibly understand it. Samara is pure evil...that is all we need to know to be scared of her...the most dreadful sadistic girl you can imagine. She has the frightening ability to burn horrific images into your mind and drive you crazy, all the while you feel your death approaching. This is how scary Samara is...and how scary the movie is. And you don't even need to know a thing about Samara to be scared.The story of this movie is actually well thought of. Contrary to what you may read in some of the negative reviews, this movie does have a great story and is not exactly difficult to follow. I saw one review where one person said that the movie never explained the chronology of events about the horses and how the child, Samara, affected the horses. Are you kidding?? This was fully explained. Anna Morgan was driven insane by the images Samara was revealing to her in her mind. Anna and Richard Morgan decided to banish Samara to their barn, hoping the separation would help stop all of it. While Samara was in the barn, she grew annoyed of the horses and decided to drive them insane. This was an act of revenge for being put in the barn.Now lets talk about the two things that make up a great movie...story and acting. The story is pretty much original, especially the scare tactics. Some of you say they are cheap. Cheap????? They scared the crap out of me. Quick flashes of distorted faces and horrific images do not allow the brain to settle/desensitize. Seconds or Minutes after each 'scare' that one quick moment is etched into your mind...the summation of all these moments is the main reason why many of us are still scared of this movie even 10 days after we first watched it. The split-second shots of katie's face and Samara's eye did it for me. The storyline is understandable. Some of these people comment about how the story just doesn't make sense. Well I'm sure if they popped in the movie one more time and stopped whining about how this isn't a Friday the 13th or Scream Stabber movie, they would be able to follow the story pretty easily. As for the acting...well Naomi Watts was perfect and the others, while not being excellent, did an good enough job to where their bad acting did not take away from the film.Because this film has the originality that most horror films do not, and because this movie scared the crap out of me, i have no choice but to give this movie a 10 out of 10 rating",10,1,3,19 February 2006
Captain Marvel," Another Review that will be considered Unhelpful
","Reviewing this movie shortly after watching the first available showing in the USA. It is now about 9:45pm EST on 3/7/19.My vote will most likely result in a massive number of downvotes and be considered an unhelpful review.The current rating on this site is 6.3/10. There are 23,463 votes total. The breakdown is 5,286 ten votes, 1,756 nine votes, 3361 eight votes, 3442 seven votes, 1621 six votes, 795 five votes, 444 four votes, 470 three votes, 709 two votes, and a whopping 5,579 one votes. The one votes outnumber the ten votes...come on.On to the review. I had my doubts about Brie Larson after watching Kong: Skull Island. In Captain Marvel, there was great chemistry between her, Samuel L. Jackson, and her Air Force pilot friend. Brie turned it around for me in this movie. I believe she was aided by a great script and great training as well as the chemistry with her co-actors. Brie was good enough in this movie for me. Jude Law was great. I also really like Nick Fury in this. Good job, Marvel.",10,2,12,8 March 2019
Cloverfield," No Story No PLot No NOTHING
","OK ladies and gentlemen lets recall what we learned in 10th grade English. Plot=exposition then rising action then climax then falling action then resolution and/or denouement We have our exposition in the party scene. good. great. excellent... We have rising action. OK good so far We have rising action. Wait didn't I just say that?? We have rising action. OK what is the climax? The End. WHATTTTT!!!!! No resolution? Are you kidding me??? You mean this movie ends prematurely and leaves the audiences thinking 'wtf'? Yes...all the movie is is one big WTFNothing is explained at all...not anything...not in the whole entirety of this debacle of a film.----------------------------------------------I have another comment now so im editing this.---------------------------------------------I think every Cloverfield fanatic i have heard thus far has said something on the order of 'there's not info about the monster because of the viewpoint the film is shot from' or 'its a personal video...what do you expect'. People these are limitations the movie IMPOSES ON ITSELF. The material quoted above is more or less excuses as to why the movie couldn't possibly suck (which it does in my opinion). Don't get me wrong i enjoyed my time at the theater but shortly after i realized there really wasn't anything special about this movie at all. I gave it four stars for being a great action film but nothing more. I guess it can't be anything more. And the character development....man o man. It couldn't happen. There was the party scene at the beginning where everyone is first shown (exposition) but there's no actual character development going on then. The rest of the movie, of course, is hogged by the monster. Any appreciable character development could not happen. The whole movie long we are wholely concentrated on finding out just what the heck that monster is and how it became...making it impossible to care about the characters...so the monster is a mega hindrance to the film. Stop accepting this film as greatness just because its as good as it was allowed to be",4,24,57,28 January 2008
Ready Player One," Random and hurts the brain
","So much is being thrown at us. King Kong. Mecha-Godzilla. Goro. Batman. The '66 Batmobile. Harley Quinn, Lex Luthor, etc. The list goes on and on. The marketing for other Warner Bros properties is stamped all over this movie.This movie definitely has imagination but is so insanely random and, IMO, really hard to follow. The CGI is great but there is a lot of destruction porn. As imaginative as it is--and I do like imagination and creativity--I cannot give it a good grade.6/10",6,1,3,1 April 2018
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Best Comic Book Film
","I think we have finally found the balance with seriousness and comic book style in this film. To compare it to Batman, I would call it a cross between Tim Burton and Christopher Nolan. I never really supported Nolan's films but fans always said his were better because they were more serious. I always argued that they didn't have the style and aesthetics of a comic book film. I was not sure it was possible to appease both sides. Winter Soldier did that.All of the actors do a fantastic job. Robert Redford is a surprisingly evil **** and Anthony Mackie does a great job as the Falcon. Samuel L Jackson turns on boss mode. Sebastian Stan is the terminator. Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansen whoop ass all day long. And we have at least three more (geez, that's 8) to mention--Frank Grillo, Emily Van Camp, and Georges St. Pierre. Heck, even the Russos themselves are in the film and do OK with their roles! Great film. No question. 10/10!",10,1,3,25 April 2015
Avengers: Endgame," Thank you, Marvel
","I just want to say thank to Marvel for an epic 11 years and for an epic conclusion. Thank you Stan Lee, Kevin Feige, Anthony Russo, Joe Russo, Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely, RDJ, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, and all the other superheroes for this epic adventure! A job well done!",8,1,2,26 April 2019
Joker," 8.5/10 for these reasons
","Cons first
1) The musical score left a lot to be desired. Sometimes it was too heavy for the scene. Sometimes it was non-existent where the scene needed it.
2) The mob support seemed a bit far fetched. I know Gotham is crime central but I can't imagine all those people praising a murderer and actively helping him out.
3) The first portion of the movie was a bit long.Pros
1) I love this version of Joker. I like his descent into insanity.
2) I like how this Joker ties in with the Waynes.
3) They explain why nobody knows his real name (his name is a mystery in the comics).
4) They have Joe Chill do the deed to Thomas a Martha Wayne (also comic accurate). I like how Chill was just a random Joker fanatic. Bruce Wayne is going to really come after Joker and that is exciting.",8,1,2,7 October 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," The Greatest Film of All Time.
","I wrote my first review of this movie back in 2006. I feel I did not do it the justice it deserved.I grew up in Mansfield, OH, not very far at all from the Ohio State Reformatory. The old 'castle Dracula' Administration building is all that is left now. A new prison (Mansfield Correctional Institution) was built on the site where the other buildings existed along OH-13. I remember the impending demolition just waiting for this movie to finish filming......Thank God it waited! The story begins in 1946 when Portland banker Andy Dufresne is tried for and wrongfully convicted of the double murder of his wife and her 'lover'.Andy arrives at Shawshank state prison in early 1947 and is greeted harshly by ruthless authority and by thugs who seem to enjoy beating him up. Andy keeps strong and keeps very much to himself for the first two years.Andy finally decides he needs a hobby to keep his mind occupied. He approaches the well known prison entrepenour, 'Red', and asks if Red might smuggle something into the prison for him... This kick starts the relationship between Red and Andy that the movie centers its attention on.There is a gentle tug of war between the two regarding ideals. Red, guilty of murder and sentenced to life with parole, sees no hope in existence outside of the prison walls. He tries, throughout the film, to convey to Andy that 'hope can drive a man insane' and its best to just accept your fate. Opposites must attract because Andy was Red's polar opposite and it began to catch Red's attention. Andy would confront the police guard to ask for beers for his friends. He'd play music over the Shawshank PA system from the Warden's office. He'd write the state once or twice a week for years and years to get funds for a new library. Andy Dufresne dared to dream and he turned the negativity of Shawshank on its head...and just may have changed Red's view on things.The villain in the movie is Warden Norton. The Warden notices Andy's skills and intelligence early on and took full advantage. He entices Andy to be sort of an 'administrative assistant'. He started out in doing tax returns for the guards, which he was very good at. In time, the Warden enticed him to use his banking skills to mastermind a money laundering scheme that would make the Warden 'a millionaire when he retires'. Andy had to 'go to prison to be a crook'. This kept his mind occupied.About 2/3 the way through the film, a young kid is admitted to Shawshank who knows who killed Andy's wife 19 years before. Andy is ecstatic and he takes the news to the Warden. At risk of the money laundering scandel being brought to light, the Warden ensures Andy he's not leaving Shawshank. Andy gets two months in the hole. The young kid gets shot.Andy, the beacon of hope for this movie, decides HE WILL get out. And HE WILL get his freedom.We go back to Andy's first meeting with Red 19 years before the escape...the little chess piece chiseling 6' rock hammer that he asked for... He'd been chipping away at the concrete wall in his room for 19 years and NOBODY SAW IT COMING.Andy busts out of that stinkin place, crawls through a 500 yard sanitary line and 'comes out clean on the other side'. Andy is gone and is free like a bird.Red, with his inspirational friend gone, does begin to lose that hope that Andy almost convinced him of. Life at the prison begins to suck. Red, after 40 years, gets paroled. He has no idea how to adapt on the outside. He might just commit suicide.Only one thing stops him...a promise he made to Andy... Determined, Red puts on his hat and suit, clamps his travel case shut. Give busy livin, or get busy dyin...thats god damn right. He bolts town and meets up with Andy on the beach in Mexico. Red, once a young crook, now redeemed old man.",10,0,0,5 July 2006
Black Panther," GREAT MARVEL MOVIE
","I loved this movie and there is nothing the 'dislike' people can do about it. For some reason, comments of praise get 'dislikes' and negative comments get 'likes'. Come at me. I LOVE this movie.Black folk have finally got their Marvel movie...and it just may be the BEST Marvel movie!",10,4,20,18 February 2018
300," Great Potential but PoorlyWritten
","OK i went into this movie and expected just an average movie. and that is what i got...just an average movie if not below averageThe Pros1 intense action scenes and gore2 battle of sheer will and strength. 300 Spartans take on 2,000,000 Persians. The Cons1 I left the movie not caring about any of the 300 Spartans except maybe King Leonidas. Why? Because character development was sorely missing from this film.2 We come out of this movie not having learned a thing about Spartan lifestyle...except that some of the men are raised to be warriors. If I know nothing about Sparta or its people why should i care if it falls?? In other words...what are the 300 defending so faithfully???3 Here comes the biggest pitfall of them all. The armies that Xerxes deploys (in order from weakest to strongest) are MANHANDLED and destroyed instantly. In the scenes preceding it, the audience is led to believe that the 'immortal' army will present a great challenge for the 300. Please...they get wiped out easily. And the huge, massive, scary creatures? lol as soon as they are introduced they are killed.It just seems to me that every potential great moment in this film was cut short...extremely short.",4,9,19,29 March 2007
The Simpsons Movie," doh!!
",I am going to be brutally honest here. The jokes were not as funny as in the TV series. There were scenes you could tell were added just to fit the joke that you knew was coming. There was also too many lull moments. At the scene where Homer watches the video tape of Marge i told myself OK enough is enough. I wanted to rate this movie high because the TV series never let me down and i figured it would get better...but it didn't.The movie however was good and just funny enough to hold my attention till the end. 6 out of 10Long live the Simpsons,6,1,5,27 July 2007
