The Blair Witch Project," Literally vacuous movie
","I have often wondered whether I would have been more frightened if I had seen Silence of the Lambs on a full screen rather than on TV, but in any event I was somewhat scared by it (actually, more like shocked, not really frightened).  And I was frightened by The Exorcist the first time I saw it, but sort of laughed later at some of the scenes, altho I think it was good. But I was not frightened by this idiotic, silly, and literally vacuous movie that I saw on a full screen.One thing I do not like in a movie is for nothing to happen, and this is certainly in spades here. Those who are familiar with Cannibal Holocaust know the camera and no faces (and journey into woods/jungle) were not a new idea, and, still, in that movie that was only a partial effect and you saw most of the characters most of the time (I think faces and bodies -- at least some -- are important for a movie).  Of course, the characters in Blair Witch were such idiots that it is hardly worth knowing them; the men were jerks and the woman was a complaining and screaming (pun intended) loser.  All the interplay between the three was nothing but stupid; it is fitting they lost the map.  And the character development was limited to what we had here?My comment about nothing happening's being an albatross rings particularly true with a 'horror' film.  If I admit, having not been frightened by the tree etc. events throughout the movie, that I was slightly frightened at the end, so what?  The movie is so bad it not only should have been on no magazine covers, it should never have been made.1 out of 10.",1,2,4,19 September 2001
The Sound of Music," Beautiful story, cinematography
","The Sound of Music had such a powerful impact on people because it was a film of such great beauty--the beauty of innocence and wholesomeness (the latter perhaps a bit overdone), of the Austrian Alps and Salzburg, of wonderful music, of the Catholic Church from the best light, of idealization of family and children, and of incorruptibility, which it seems we need more of these days.The screenplay is imaginative, well-executed and well-paced, set in a broad, elaborate scenic backdrop combined with the elegance of more immediate surroundings (and I had the great pleasure of visiting Salzburg and the mansion when I was nine years old, after having seen the movie three times already). So wonderful was the cinematography!! Oh, well, Dr. Zhivago won it that year. The acting is also excellent, fittingly led by Julie Andrews as Fraulein Maria, and Christopher Plummer as the stern but virtuous captain who she lightens up and marries. The Baroness (Eleanor Parker) is Maria's rival for the captain's affections, while the Captain is foiled by 'Uncle Max' (Richard Haydn), who wants to get along with everyone, even the Nazis, and antagonist Herr Zeller (Ben Wright). Certainly, The Sound of Music far outdoes Maria's book, which was often quite boring. And hey, if the Captain's sturdiness of character is overdone in the film, it's also true he was the only one in the area without a swastika on his home. The music, catchy and lively, left a lasting imprint (and isn't Edelweiss ever so pretty). My Favorite Things even moves on to John Coltrane, and The Doors in Light My Fire. If you have not seen The Sound of Music, do so by all means. Aside from the film's being so uplifting, I suspect you'll agree with me that it demonstrates cinematographers should be capable of producing more than today's cheap special effects.",10,1,7,16 April 2003
Casablanca," Superb All the Way
","Few people need an introduction to this movie, altho there is always a first time for everyone.  But also for those who have seen it already, I wish to share a few thoughts.  My favorite scene is the singing of La Marseilles; remember, this is a movie about passion and good and evil, altho the ending and many other scenes are also great.  I also find it interesting that this was a play before, and many did not think it as effective as a play, but it worked so well as a movie.  The backdrop and the skills of film makers can add a lot (and the acting).  But although Ingrid Bergman fit in well here, I thought that the acting jobs by Bogart and others, purely in terms of being convincing, were better.  Excellent scenery, elegant French culture, so well scripted, and idealistic.  Yet altho Rick changed at the end, his person throughout the bulk of the movie allows a good outlet for people feeling life's frustrations.  But even for those, it is rousing to have the good ending, isn't it?",10,1,1,4 August 2001
As Good as It Gets," They can get better
","Jack Nicholson's persona in this movie -- his usual sarcastic self -- is highlighted with bigoted lines and obsessive-compulsive disorder, which provides good comedy and entertainment.  However, the love story with Helen Hunt does not work -- it is neither touching nor humorous -- Nicholson's character is just too unappealing.  In any event, this film was not academy award Best Picture material; apparently, there was a shortage of quality movies in 1997.",6,0,1,14 February 2002
Amistad," Original idea
","'Amistad' is a good film, presenting an interpretation of a real-life 1839 mutiny aboard a slave ship and the resulting trial in the U.S., with the freedom of the slaves hinging on the outcome.  What I like is the original idea--choosing this little-known but interesting event during the Presidency of Martin Van Buren (who?), having non-English-speaking black slaves defended in court by 'John Adams' (Quincy--who's that?), and the legal concepts involved.Both the plight of the slaves and the events in their quest for victory are dramatized well, moving and evocative.  Slave leader Cinque (Djimon Hounsou) is a sympathetic protagonist, and Anthony Hopkins as John Quincy Adams is stolid and staid but very eloquent in court.  Stately Morgan Freeman is citizen intermediary rather than a slave.  As for the critics who insist Steven Spielberg was trying to portray this event as a significant precursor to the Civil War rather than for its own sake, I say, give me a break.  There is nothing in the film that suggests that (gee, the mere mention of the Civil War?).  They need to say something to make themselves feel important, but the only way to get the answer to what Spielberg thinks is to ask him, and reviewers do not do such things.",7,1,2,4 December 2001
Batman Returns," Penguin an albatross
","Batman II is a disappointment.  Actually, a better word is gross.  There is really not much more to say about Danny DeVito's Penguin, operating in sewers, grotesque and crunched in features.  By contrast, Burgess Meredith was amusing, carried himself well -- actually, I think he was my favorite Batman TV villain, aside from Julie Newmar.  DeVito is shorter, squatter, grosser, uglier.  Apotheosis:  biting the journalist's nose, just great. The storyline for his part was too complicated, the cinematography too dark and pompous.  The only good thing at all was the attempt at the someone sympathetic look at him based on his origins, but this dies as the rest is just garbage (sometimes literally).  Michelle Pfeiffer partially redeems the movie as Catwoman, and her sympathetic storyline is thus enhanced some.  In contrast to his role in the battle against the Penguin and company, in which he is almost a footnote, Batman (and Bruce Wayne) square off against Catwoman, a sympathetic, modern-woman villainess.  Keaton, however, still seems not to quite measure up, overall presence, monotone or whatever.  Thus, he was told, skip it next time.Regardless of some good Catwoman moments, a so-so Batman and an abominable Penguin man have the overriding aura in this film.  No ride into the sunset, or the moonlight, but into the abyss.",3,5,13,22 November 2001
The Great Dictator," Masterpiece
","The Great Dictator is a beyond-excellent film.  Charlie Chaplin succeeds in being both extremely funny and witty and yet at the same time provides a strong statement in his satire against fascism.  The anti-Nazi speech by Chaplin at the end, with its values, is one of filmdom's great moments. Throughout this movie, I sensed there was some higher form of intelligence, beyond genuinely intelligent filmmaking, at work.",10,121,163,29 October 2001
Gettysburg," Nicely done
","I enjoyed this movie thoroughly regardless of its length--those interested in the subject matter should have no problems there.  Chamberlain's charge is a good choice for dramatic focus, tho it should be noted that there was another Union charge similar in nature under similar circumstances the same day.  Martin Sheen is a poor choice as Lee--he just doesn't have Lee's statuesque demeanor or dignity, and his acting was not good here (accent was a particular problem).  However, there were good depictions of Hancock, Pickett, and Armistead.  The dialogue was moving and original (compare Pearl Harbor), important in a war movie, where dialogue can be abstracted from 'plot.'  The cinematography did well all that was needed in an epic movie. Kudos for this one.",8,1,1,20 October 2001
The Adventures of Tintin," Did Spielberg Succeed?
","In recreating Tintin novels for a movie, Spielberg faced a difficult challenge. Did he succeed? I think Spielberg made a good try, particularly in the early scenes. The depiction of the story locations the Old Street Market, 26 Labrador Road, Marlinspike Hall, and aboard the 'Karaboudjan' ship made me feel I was in a Tintin book in a fair attempt. Snowy's chase of the cat was right on point with one and more actual occurrences in Herge's books.But recreating Tintin in another medium for more than 100 minutes is a big task. As one other commentator on this board put it, the panels in the Tintin books are uniquely stylized, and this raises two questions. First, can they be recreated on screen, and second, if not, can Spielberg do anything that in its own way equals Herge's stylization -- artwork, dialogue, atmosphere, action, progression -- in terms of magnitude of achievement?My answer in both cases is no. Except for the first three not-fully-developed (and sometimes silly) Tintin books and the last, with its mediocre story, to me, there is nothing like Herge's accomplishments with Tintin. It is hard to think of anything that will grip a reader more. Tintin books are so fully absorbing, unique, and compelling in storyline, atmosphere, and drawing detail that I do not think they can ever be matched on film, by Spielberg or anyone else. Even if Spielberg literally copied the dialogue, art, and panels, something would be lost with the film continuum as opposed to separate panels in the books. But no one is going to do that anyway, which leaves me to declare only that no one who makes a Tintin film with his own touches is ever going to match Herge. This is different from, say, taking something that was based only on written prose such as The Godfather, the story of Gordon of Khartoum, and the Seven Pillars of Wisdom and putting it on the big screen (incidentally, 'Lawrence of Arabia' will always be No. #1 with me on visuals). Yes, you can outdo prose and some drawing in terms of dramatic impact and entertainment (although some will subjectively say, a written format was still better for them).Having said that, I have a positive comment on the visuals. I went into this movie expecting overfast, confusing, and bloated action scenes because that is the trend of today. It is true of standard movies with regular people, so with a 3-D, motion-capture, computer-animated adventure movie, I certainly expected even more, as the norm. I am happy to say, I did not find anything overdone until the falcon chase scene and the final conflict, starting around 1:20. Otherwise, I found enough breathing room and thought the action scenes were fitting when measured against the action-packed Tintin books themselves. Starting at the very beginning with 'Tintin in the Land of the Soviets,' we know that the series will have a lot of wild rides, escapes, and chases on land, sea, air, and under water, even in outer space, as well as frequent fighting and combat, plus slapstick. The portrayal of the characters themselves I consider separately. Herge's Tintin was incorruptible and had character, poise, and heroic qualities. However, it is not an original comment to say he did not have much personality, as compared with, say, his basically equal co-hero Captain Haddock, Professor Calculus, Bianca Castafiore, and others. But should we demand Spielberg deviate from this and give him more personality? I suggest yes, some embellishment could have been done. There could have been some introspective discussion between Tintin and Haddock, for example, or Tintin could say more and emote more, or some inner thoughts of his could be revealed. He could even express his likes and dislikes for food or products or have hobbies. Perhaps it was decided that with this first film, which also captures the first meeting between Tintin and Haddock, not much would be done, but embellishment of Tintin's personality is a possibility for future films. In any event, I and others would welcome such an effort.As for the complaint that linking Captain Haddock to the bottle was overemphasized vs. the Captain as a person, I felt this a little on the first watch, but on the subsequent watch, I said not really. For one key thing, he even lectures Tintin on not giving up, reversing roles that were displayed in several different Tintin books (including two cases in which Tintin used the bottle to change the Captain's mind). I also note that the two books this was based on, 'The Secret of the Unicorn' and 'The Crab with the Golden Claws,' were the ones in which the Captain's whiskey and rum-guzzling were most prominent. So I cannot find much fault here, and even in other books, his drinking is always a theme. I also had no problem with the inclusion of Bianca Castafiore, though she is not in either of the two books on which the film was (mainly) based. Her persona and physical appearance added something, and Spielberg's engineering of a voice for the glass-shattering Milanese Nightingale complemented Herge's genius. Captain Allan, Haddock's ancient rival, could have been given more personality. The absent Professor Calculus? Ready for the sequel. As for Thompson and Thomson, I thought Spielberg, using wit, actually managed to make them even more dense and bumbling in their quest for the pickpocket than in Herge's 'Secret of the Unicorn.' All in all, a good effort by Spielberg, but I hope to see improvements in characterization in other Tintin films by him or whomever.",8,0,1,20 April 2012
The Doors," Film chains, tho its eyes lie some
","As a big Doors fan who is interested in the background of The Doors as well as their great music (tho, I have no problem in admitting, not as much), I am sympathetic to Ray Manzarek's criticisms about the failure of Oliver Stone's film to focus on Jim Morrison's better side, not to say there was not a very bad one.  He was extremely well versed in literature and poetry, and this is itself, as well as its contribution to Doors' lyrics, should have been presented, and it clearly could have been done so effectively. (Doors fans out there, you know about Jim's well-known [to people like us] challenge to pick up any literary book on his shelf and test him.)  And I certainly would not care if the result were a longer movie, rather than cuts in other scenes; I would remain riveted from start to finish to a 30-hour movie about the Doors.  Jim as the jerk is no-holds-barred throughout the film, but it is said that he could be intelligent and sensitive when he was not drunk, so why not make all this a first-half (or first-third) focus followed by a second-half degeneration?But a film's role is to entertain, and The Doors does not fall short, starting with a beyond-excellent acting performance by Val Kilmer as Jim. There certainly was accuracy in what one SAW of Jim, if not a fully balanced character portrayal.  Looks, mannerisms, physiognomy, voice and inflection, lip syncing and singing, anything relevant to being convincing--they were all here and on an Oscar level, altho the film world would never have let that be.  Meg Ryan was more convincing in her role as Pam than she was in any other movie in which I have seen her.  The editing could have been better, but the cinematography was fabulous, dazzling and chromatic, with great concert scenes.  (And I do not care whether those nude dancing girls hardly ever or never actually happened.)  The song selection was excellent. I thought the Indian scenes in the car crash and desert, the Whiskey-a-Go-Go scene, New Haven and Miami, the 'Celebration of the Lizard' footage, etc. were all well done.  And its fine to have some crazy stuff (I won't give examples, to avoid spoilers)--if he did not do it, you know, it is close, or something he easily could have done.I am a stickler for accuracy in life -- in writing, in quoting other people, etc.  But in movies, is not the most important thing whether the inaccuracy causes a meaningful, substantive distortion?  Thus, the 'higher' extra emphasis on Ed Sullivan--who cares, it was fun; the 'Come on Buick Light my Fire'; the UCLA film scene, which did not really make him look like a Hitler lover (but I admit I was bugged by 'I quit', which did not happen); composite Patricia Kennealy; the presentation of Andy Warhol.  Where there was substantive inaccuracy, as I said before, was in an unbalanced portrayal of Jim--the lack of the literary side (and I'm sure, some other positive qualities).  Perhaps some day we will see that on film, not just books.8 of 10",8,1,1,21 October 2001
Full Metal Jacket," Good depiction of bad dreams
","Stanley Kubrick takes on boot camp and Vietnam in 'Full Metal Jacket' and delivers nicely.  The dehumanizing (meaningfully, more so than mechanistic) drill instructor and tough camp fit in well with Vietnam--both represent meaningless exercises, with violence and a touch of insanity.  People become nonpersons, violence is a viable instrument of mechanistic existence, and Vietnam is nowhere, nothing, the journey into the abyss.  Snipers and jungle, no win, no lose, dark, amoral, disturbing.Kubrick blends in elements of the surreal, using slow motion and generally good cinematography, to convey his message, which has elements of satire. One recruit has the worst time, but his ultimate reaction (in boot camp, before Vietnam) is more noteworthy for being paranormal than violent.  And Kubrick's visual interpretation of Vietnam, from which his viewpoint can be abstracted, is well worth watching.",8,0,0,4 December 2001
The Godfather: Part II," Not so great
","The Godfather II is not nearly as good as Godfather I, even tho some intelligence and good acting went in.  After the Godfather I, and Michael's evolution is complete, who needs a sequel about unsavory characters so much? The Godfather I, led by Vito and Sonny, had elements that provided for great entertainment and made you less bothered by the evil and sleaze (temporarily).  Michael pales as an imposing figure next to Vito, and altho Al Pacino is a good actor, I just get tired of watching Michael too much--I was even getting a little tired of him at the end of Godfather I.  In other words, I think the disadvantage sequels have of becoming-tiresome subject matter are more present, not less, here.  The end of Godfather II, with Michael staring out morosely into the water from a chair, symbolizes the decadence of the story and the corrupt characters, especially Michael himself.  I think more toward a pathetic character than a tragic one, despite some of the events he had to endure.   And what is the point of Kay's back and forth moral concerns if she is staying with him?   And wasn't that 'abortion' blowup scene (natch, male child) so moving?  Not to me.The main story here is somewhat convoluted and disorganized, so when the flashbacks are inserted the confusion gets worse.  We have sordid characters (Hyman Roth etc.) who do not particularly entertain me on a movie screen, and the depressing figures of Fredo (geez, isn't he such a compelling character) and Connie.  This is a precursor to a lot of post mid-70s movies in which the plot is overcomplicated and not crisp and the characters sleazy and unappealing--in movies like this, I would like the characters to be less dwelled on and the action to rule.On the other hand, there is reason to be somewhat interested in the development of Vito and the flashbacks of the family.  Robert DeNiro does a good job as Vito, and the screenplay is thoughtful, but ultimately the main story dominates.  Yes, it is true, modern movies are less uplifting than ones preceding the mid-60s, but in spite of the many elements that some people complain about--violence, corruption, sex, pomposity, ridiculously overdone and confusing special effects--there are often some redeeming or uplifting features.  Certainly none here, and this film is depressing and sometimes boring, in spite of some good individual scenes and substance here and there to the story and characters.  To each his own--I can see why some people like this movie more than I do, but I really do not think it belongs on a pedestal either.",5,15,37,22 September 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Visual marvel
","The storyline in the 'Lord of the Rings' is well constructed and interesting, the film is well-paced (you never get bored tho it is long), and the action scenes are well done.  But most of all, it is a dazzling visual marvel.Whether outdoors--scenes of forests and trees, valleys, streams, mountains--or in caves and the like, the visuals are superb.  Color, design, intricacy, detail, contrasts.  The backdrops are excellent.  There are battles with monsters and things like that, but the special effects are not overdone or pompous--they work very well.  A key for me here was not too much sped up action to create excess and pomposity and to have a hard time following what is going on, like in sci fi space battles or the Mummy movies or flicks like that.  Indeed, not only the pace of the plot, but the action, has economy.  In the outdoors, the backdrops are very pretty but for the most part realistic, but in the caves things are done up, with somewhat exaggerated or surreal colors, designs, effects.However, there are other movies with good visuals, even tho it is difficult to think of ones that outdo this.  But what sticks out most, in my mind? Not specifically the things I mentioned in the previous paragraph, but the LIGHTING.  Yes, that overlaps with the other things--backdrop, colors, etc., but it is particularly this item and the obvious sophistication and care that went into it, and the resulting artistic brilliance and beauty, that make the visuals, the cinematography, so excellent in my mind.  Whether indoors or outdoors, the lighting effects, the beauty, blending, and contrasts, are the highlight of the film.10 out of 10.",10,3,3,17 February 2002
Apocalypse Now," Night divides the day
","Anyone who sees 'The Making of Apocalypse Now' will be struck by the difficulties Francis Ford Coppola faced.  Rough environment, actors getting heart attacks, a typhoon destroying the sets, the Philippine army going back to fight the rebels (it was supplying the helicopters for the film, being made in the Philippines).  On and on.  It took forever.  I think that it is safe to say that many people involved in making this flick had a tougher time than, say, Tippi Hedren in making 'The Birds.'But it was worth it.The Vietnam War came about within a confluence of elements in the key decade of the 60s.  The U.S. was not just the strongest military power, but the richest country, and with an ever-growing entertainment industry. Intellectual currents, lifestyle currents, openness of spirit.  Peace and love, yes, but also the arts, communications and mass media, broadening horizons.  What movies should be about, how they should be made.  Vietnam contributed to the currents and the legacy of the 60s, but many things would have happened on their own.  In any event, The Vietnam War made us question the morality of itself specifically, and war in general, and whether wars are worth fighting. Bear in mind something else.  Many war movies had been just straightforward, but there were antiwar ones too.  'All Quiet on the Western Front' and 'Paths of Glory' stood as classic.  As to Vietnam, John Wayne did 'The Green Berets,' but Oliver Stone comes along later with 'Platoon,' a basic antiwar flick.   But there was another thing Vietnam contributed in the eye of all the confluences.  That was reductio ad absurdum, a platform for war movies to my knowledge not used much up to that time.In my college political science class, U.S. Foreign Policy After 1945, the standard northeastern liberal critique, the principal textbook had a chapter on Vietnam called 'The Apotheosis of Containment.'  The supreme example, deification, glorification.  Just to contain communism, in a country like Vietnam, the U.S. did all this?  We spent all that, we dropped all those bombs, we killed and maimed all those people, ruined the land.  And remember, as to our own casualties, there were many other than killed and missing, and the number of killed and died would have been substantially higher if not for modern and technological advances saving people, at least 10,000.  In other words, even if you go back only to the time of WWII,  for sake of comparison, assume many more U.S. deaths in Vietnam, all conditions being equal.   The Vietnam War was a self-satire.  Bloated and ridiculous.  All in the jungle, in the middle of nowhere.  In the Heart of Darkness.  General Westmoreland asked for 200,000 more troops to follow up the U.S. victory after the Tet offensive, which he characterized as a last-gasp, 'Battle of the Bulge' effort by the North.  Some other things have come along, such as General Custer being reduced to a racist megalomaniac caricature in 'Little Big Man' (released during Vietnam).  But Vietnam provides a particular opportunity.  For example, Stanley Kubrick moves from 'Paths of Glory' to take advantage of this in 'Full Metal Jacket.'   'Platoon' contains some elements of satire.  There are othersFrancis Ford Coppola has his 'Apocalypse Now,' as Joseph Conrad had his 'Heart of Darkness.'  Coppola takes off with a plot involving, well, madness.  But before Colonel Kurtz (Marlin Brando), we have such characters as Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who is obsessed with surfing, in Vietnam.  A blond cowboy, with hat and dark glasses.  Are we in the wrong setting?  Coppola seems to think so as the helicopters rise, 'The Ride of the Valkyries' plays.  Casual napalm comments.  Actually, approval.
Martin Sheen plays Captain Willard, assigned to liquidate U.S. operative Kurtz, who is going off the deep end with his private army of locals. Willard and crew journey down a river, passing endless jungle, to Cambodia, where Kurtz is located.   It is well known that The Doors' 'The End' is used later, but 'End of the Night' might also have been used for Willard's river journey.  Except the midnight does not turn out to be bright.  Actually, it is here that the question is, 'Driver where're you taking us'?   We are returning to the more primitive, primordial.  Vietnamese in a Sampan are mowed down, save one young girl, except she too is slaughtered when, as is only later realized, she reaches for a puppy.  One of the crew may be killed by a Viet Cong bullet, but a native spear gets the other.  Upon arrival at Kurtz's camp, there are Weird Scenes Inside the Gold Mine.  Natives meet them in boats, bodies are hanging in trees, and heads are lying around. Bodies confused, memories misused.  Dennis Hopper, by profession a photojournalist, is a jester in Kurtz's court.  Strange Days.Kurtz is indeed 'lost in a Roman wilderness of pain, and all the children are insane, waiting for the summer rain.'  The blue bus calls.  The Doors could, alternatively to 'The End,' have come in with the cathartic climax to 'When the Music's Over':  'Save us, Jesus, save us...'  Kurtz is the personification of the overall character of the movie, and the war. 
'Apocalypse Now' has atmosphere, and how.  Dark, depressing, there is violence, and also drugs.  The viewer is engulfed in the negative aura, but this is mixed with surreal elements and very creative cinematography.  Not just the Heart of Darkness, but the Art of Darkness.Great job by Coppola.  A masterpiece.",9,0,0,24 November 2001
The Exorcist," The powers of good and evil
","I must admit I was frightened when I first saw this movie, as a teenager. Not just during it either.  I had never seen a horror movie  that had stuck with me much at all after I had left the theater.  I saw it twice more not much longer afterward.  By the third time, I was laughing at some of the scenes.Nevertheless, I see 'The Exorcist' as one of the all-time great horror flicks.  A novel idea, filmed in modern America, based on a true story, if exaggerated.  Max von Sydow was, of course, an excellent choice as initial exorcist Father Merrin.  The gradual deterioration of Regan (Linda Blair) is dramatically effective.  Jason Miller is superb as Father Karras. 
The special effects work because they are not, well, really special effects but part of the story.  People seeing today's special effects used in intergalactic sci-fi battles or ridiculous sped up action as in 'Charlie's Angels' tend to be drawn more away from the film than to it.  Absurdity is accompanied by tiresome exaggeration and repetition and disorientation of the viewer, who aside from finding the action hard to follow, gets diverted from the plot.  In 'The Exorcist,' however, Director William Friedkin made sure to use special effects to convey what William Peter Blatty, and presumably others, picture demonic possession to be like.  Legions of warships are not blown up, a bed is raised.  Superhuman strength is displayed, but within the confines of a single room   Body features are made grotesque, but for good reason.  The swearing etc. might be cheap in another context, but here it is not really obnoxious but powerful, intense, hateful--demonic.  I do not think of this film as sensationalistic, as some do.'The Exorcist' is highly evocative in its portrayal of demonic possession along with the immense power and tradition that the Catholic Church can summon to combat it.  Indeed, the imagery of the Church presented is dignified, majestic.  Historical background of demonic possessions and exorcism is in but is understated and subtly effective for that reason. This allows us to focus on the situation at hand rather than Devil stories. 
In sum, 'The Exorcist' contains some of the most dynamic imagery  of 'good' and 'evil' ever put on film.  This is its most important legacy.",9,1,2,8 December 2001
Pearl Harbor," Banal and unimaginative
","The only reason to see this movie is the battle scene toward the end, but in contrast to the scenes at the beginning of 'Saving Private Ryan,' it is not complemented by the rest of the film.  After a not-so-bad start, the screenplay of Pearl Harbor degenerates into the insipid and uninteresting.  Altho the acting, while not great, is not terrible either, it does not matter.  There is very little character development, especially of the women, and of course, none of the Japanese (contrast this to the great film 'Tora Tora Tora').  The cinematography shows some good sunsets, but overall loses the backdrop in favor of unneeded continual close-ups of the characters.  Very little of Honolulu and inadequate as to other surroundings --'Tora' was also much better here.From everything to lines like 'I just want to matter,' to the insipid love lines, to the reappearance of Rafe after the fall in the sea, Pearl Harbor exudes banality and triteness, hackneyed and clicheish lines, and predictability.  A further downside is achieved by including the Doolittle Raid (suddenly, fighter pilots are bomber pilots)--is not Pearl Harbor enough of an event in itself, with the focus partially lost by the filmmakers' need for a cheap vindictive counterraid?  Is not the implied result of the sneak attack on America enough?  And how many total unentertaining minutes does that give this turgid film?As one who sometimes thinks the critics are unfair, for various reasons (including self-aggrandizement) in trashing movies, this time they certainly were on target.  A blockbuster disappointment.",3,1,1,22 September 2001
Gone with the Wind," Vivien Leigh
","What can be said about this classic that is not redundant?  Well, it seems to be falling a bit from the top of peoples' lists, but in any event should always be seen as one of the all-time greats. Clark Gable was superb, but Vivien Leigh's Oscar-winning best-actress performance is one of the best female performances of all time, and to me, the best of which I am aware.",9,1,2,3 October 2001
Saving Private Ryan," Vivid, evocative
","I was told it was worth it to see this movie for the opening battle scenes alone, and that turned out to be an accurate statement. In no other war movie is there anything like the realism and aura in picturing soldiers being peppered, and sometimes hit, by machine gun fire.  From pillboxes on D-Day, no less, with the tensions of an amphibious landing.  The scenes of the wounded throughout this film are also something else, serving as the archetype and forerunner of 'Black Hawk Down.'  Some points in the battle scenes, beginning and later, might be described as real and surreal at the same time, a la Kubrick.The rest of the movie as well lived up to the good things I had heard about it.  Tom Hanks does extremely well as Captain Miller, the leader of the pack in saving a private behind enemy lines because all of his brothers, fighting elsewhere in WWII, have been killed.  Hanks is very natural and convincing in this role, leadership qualities and personableness, forcefulness and bravery.  The human element works, and we are moved during the film's progress and conclusion.  See this one.",8,1,2,26 March 2002
Lawrence of Arabia," Lean's masterpiece
","A masterpiece of cinematography and screenplay, Lawrence of Arabia will always be an all-time classic.  Although movies preceding the early 60s could sometimes bring out some negative qualities in a looked-up-to historical figure, this one was fairly unique at the time in bringing out specifically the disturbing side, as well as the heroic stature.   The latter is not deemphasized either, even as Lawrence's more ordinary moral conflicts become apparent.  Anyway, the overall screenplay, so well-written, is in itself as worthy a focus as the individual character of Lawrence.  The film serves as a bit of a 'Ball Four' (yes, I emphasize 'a bit') to later negative movie commentaries on war and political intrigues.  And as to visuals, the desert becomes as beautiful a place as the sea, the mountains, the forests, and the sky.  As one who considers 'Lawrence' an all-time favorite, I will nevertheless acknowledge that it drags a bit in both the first and second halfs.  Ultimately, tho, the story justifies the length and all the scenes.

JFK," Stone lone braveman
","'JFK' was and remains so controversial that any positive reviews (not to say they were characteristic) it received were dwarfed by the trashing to which it was subjected in the official press, which started well before it was released.  This was disturbing, for what is the big need -- it is just a movie.  But to so many 'JFK' was not, it was somehow threatening.
Ultimately, it does not matter whether JFK's conclusion is correct, and I am even willing to give a little more license than I normally would to more-substantive, as well as less-important, inaccuracies, although I have my limits here too.   But this movie's significance is just that it was made.  For although other films had chronicled the events surrounding the assassination, none had in any substantial way sought to discredit the Warren Commission, as was so absolutely merited.Regardless of your opinion on what really happened, it is my view that everyone should be critical of the media, which were so obsequious to the Warren Commission.  The New York Times from the start referred to Oswald as the 'assassin,' not the 'suspect.'    Life Magazine altered photos strongly suggesting a shot had been fired from the grassy knoll.   Many years later, when being interviewed by Dan Rather about his film, Oliver Stone said to his face, referring to the event:  'Where were you, Dan?'
Indeed, in a documentary he made, Rather said, 'in the absence of any CREDIBLE evidence, we can only...'  This fallacy is a betrayal of the legal definition of evidence, with Rather's poor characterization of the word 'credible.'  There is enormous, indeed endless, evidence contradicting the Warren Commission's view, and much of it is certainly credible, including all the evidence of the Commission's own efforts to conduct a dishonest and incomplete investigation and intimidate witnesses into changing their testimony to support the version it wanted.  In fact, I consider it Gerald Ford's greatest character flaw that he served on it and backed its conduct and conclusion, a far more disturbing matter than his pardon of Nixon. Whether the evidence to which Rather referred is CONCLUSIVE is another story; that is up to us, the jury.  The sort of smugness Rather shows has been characteristic of much of the media, and I do not know all the reasons they behaved as they did.  Thus, we needed a more courageous, enterprising person like Oliver Stone to step in and fill the gap -- the overwhelming majority of people believe the Commission got it wrong.Stone's enlistment of mere hypotheticals, theorized by Garrison (setting aside the final scene--there were moments before) or whoever, has been subjected to unfair, ill-conceived criticism.  Most people who knew anything at all about the assassination believed there were problems with the Commission's version before they saw this film, and came out of it with an elaboration and hypothesis, not a mindbender.  Even if we concede that some younger viewers knew little about the assassination, the notion of the critics of 'JFK' that the film would automatically program their minds is an insult to their intelligence, of the ability of people in general to think and come to their own conclusions.  Indeed, no one to whom I have EVER spoken has betrayed a view of events that reflects even most, if not all, of Stone's conclusions.  If any programming is called for, it is to program people against the Commission's version, not, as its defenders would wish, against Stone.  For no one can be programmed to accept Stone's alternate view.OK, some inaccuracies of Stone can be criticized, such as his portrayal of Garrison (All-American Kevin Costner, natch) as a wholesome hero, and the time-between-shots issue (it is now generally conceded that there was enough time, based on all the evidence, for Oswald to have done it, for those who believe he did).  Perhaps the speech by David Ferrie never occurred, but it still reflects the widely held view that the CIA and Mafia worked together in this matter.  Certainly, many people in the government despised Kennedy, and there were substantially more elements of this hostility than portrayed in the film.  Anyway, we can go on and on.  The Warren Commission tried to cover up overwhelming evidence that Ruby knew Oswald, that a shot was fired from the grassy knoll, that a dark-skinned man fired shots from the Dallas School Book Depository, and that Officer Tippit was killed by someone other than Oswald (actually, two people).  Well, at least some members resisted the single bullet theory (I guess that passes Rather's definition of 'credible'), although they ultimately signed the report.I do not agree with Oliver Stone's specific ultimate conclusion about the central moving force of the assassination.   But he has the right to suggest the U.S. government was involved, and many, including myself, think it was involved somehow, but that what is debatable is merely to what extent and how far up.  Hats off to Stone for his courage and thoughtfulness in making his necessary statement.9 out of 10",9,169,260,4 November 2001
Quiz Show," Answers raise questions
","This movie provides a look at the Quiz Show scandal of the late '50s.  It is good entertainment and raises questions about human nature--how people can be driven by greed to cheat, whether a situation of sort of 'entrapment' cheating is more morally justifiable than without, whether 'anybody would have done it,' and more specifically, whether you or I would have acted in the same manner in the situations depicted.Still, there is another issue:  whether trivia is so great as a thing in itself.  This question must be borne in mind, and was addressed well in a letter to the editor of a newspaper I was reading a few weeks after 'Quiz Show' was released.  It pointed out that we must be careful not to glorify trivia, and that in fact those who dwell on it too much are losers.  I consider myself a trivia expert in many categories, and I and many people enjoy trivia a lot, but we are reminded to look elsewhere (like writing movie reviews, I guess).  The high water marks of 'Quiz Show' project an apotheosis of trivia, trivia for trivia's sake, needing nothing else. Obviously, this raises questions of values, and substance.  Remember that other accomplishments in life, life's basics, are more important.",8,0,0,4 December 2001
Taken," Dynamic Action Movie, with a Vengeance
","'Taken' is a great movie and distinctive among modern action movies, combining more realistic heart-thumping action scenes with a straightforward story line. I find it tiresome when a film has nonstop, gratuitous action that is unrealistic, pompous, and too drawn out. I thought 'Quantum of Solace' fell into this category, although it was not as bad as something like 'Charlie's Angels' in terms of exaggerated effects. By contrast, I thought the action scenes in 'Taken' worked really well, in a suspense movie that steadily lets the mystery unfold.The continual suspense is presented in an easy-to-follow manner that naturally leads to the next stage. Liam Neeson plays Bryan Mills, a semiretired CIA agent whose daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) wants to go to Paris for a while, ostensibly to visit museums, but later it is revealed that she and her friend want to trail U2 on the rock group's full European tour. Mills was reluctant to let her go in the first place, in conflict with his ex-wife Lenore (that's Bond woman Famke Janssen). The characters have some personality, but Mills is a regular guy, and there is no over-dwelling on their psychology. (I could meet 'Dark Knight' halfway on the psychology, but I thought it went too far.) Mills remains skeptical about the trip, and then finds that Kim has been kidnapped into an Albanian sex-slave ring. That's the way I like it: good guys versus bad guys. I had a similar sort of visceral satisfaction as in 'Delta Force,' in which Chuck Norris really gives it to the terrorists.The movie's intensive action is mostly in close quarters: a room, an elevator, a car, or just a regular face-to-face confrontation. Skillful filming and sharp editing give scenes an aura of believability. Besides, Mills is an agent skilled in hand-to-hand combat, helping us believe. He does mostly one-on-one nailings, but he dishes it out to a few groups of bad guys too. The fighting and shooting scenes are not padded or overblown, and the viewer is left with the sense that the filmmakers were relying more on coordination and execution of quick movements than on special effects. As for wide-open action scenes, Mills, in a fast-paced, realistic sequence, chases down a villain, who falls onto a lower highway. Wide-open action scenes in 'Quantum' and some other movies contain too many unbelievable stunts (in 'Quantum,' e.g., exaggerated jumps from buildings or to other buildings).",8,1,4,1 February 2009
There's Something About Mary," Silly gross-out humor
","While not always averse to crude humor, although I usually would rather see it on a limited scale (Blazing Saddles is an exception), excesses and stupidity mean gross-out humor.  And they also make a movie silly and sophomoric.  And this idiotic movie about sophomoric-type people is not funny most of the time. For the romance, we have Mary (Cameron Diaz, attractive, not beautiful, in my book) pursued by numerous love interests, and finally won over by a loser/schmuck.  And was he ever.  My girlfriend asked me whether women, too, should be entitled to some appealing good looks and other things, you know, Cary Grant, Tom Cruise, whoever.  But I guess it was part of the humor, loser humor.  Cameron Diaz in this movie is pretty with a girl-next-door look, but not sexy, like she can appear in photos and other movies.  Her acting job, however, was better than that of any of the main men.  Aside from the dumb scenes, the movie drags at times, particularly at the finish, when I wanted the movie just to get it over with and end, end, end.Why did TV Guide name the gel scene one of the top 50 of all time?  It is one of the (narrower number) most idiotic of all time, and yet it still would have acquitted itself a little better if it were shorter and not pompously drawn out.  But it should be emphasized that almost all the crude scenes lacked the subtlety of When Harry Met Sally and The Truth About Cats and Dogs, and of Mel Brooks, who knows how to make crude humor funny.  And the stuff in There's Something About Mary does not have the humor of slapstick, which I love.  It is, look at me, how idiotically silly, rather than klutzy, I am.  Little intelligence or wit went in.  This movie is vastly overrated, and only for people with bad taste and infantile dispositions.",3,1,2,20 September 2001
The Untouchables," Big Al meets his match
","Talk about perfect casting -- clean-cut Kevin Costner as Eliot Ness, quintessential crime drama (criminal?) actor Robert DeNiro as Al Capone. Apparently, it is still possible (altho unusual) for a crime fighter in a post-1980s movie to be a wholesome person.  There is occasional pomposity, but the film is well done, with a good story and lots of action.  Sean Connery definitely earned his Oscar, as a very tough former cop who renews fighting crime, aiding Ness and galvanizing efforts against Capone.",8,1,2,14 February 2002
Enemy at the Gates," Original, Top Notch
","Today's citizens of WWII Western Allied countries are relatively unfamiliar with the details of the Russo-German conflict, which warrants the making for major release of a film such as 'Enemy at the Gates.'  But this superb movie, set in the battle of Stalingrad, the war's turning point, is original in more ways than this.I have not yet seen 'Saving Private Ryan,' but am aware of what it accomplished, and 'Enemy at the Gates' certainly brings the viewer into the battle. Great staged action, excellent cinematography and camera positioning, using close-ups and distance as necessary to make things very vivid.  Charges, German aerial bombings, the Volga river's transportation pipeline, civilian suffering.  After introducing us to the horrific street-to-street, house-to-house, factory-to-factory struggle with the massed armies pitted against each other, and showing German successes demonstrating the awesome task faced by the Russian army, a subplot of the battle becomes the plot of this movie: attacking the Germans with sniper fire, not just massed deployments.The sniper confrontations revolve around the two principals, Vasilli (Jude Kaw) and German Major Konig (Ed Harris).  Konig is brought on midstream to provide specialized help, after the sniper successes on the part of the Russians present the Wehrmacht with problems it is not trained to encounter. The psychological drama that develops, with no shortage of excellent acting, is among the most captivating and memorable in the genre.
The Germans' performance in the two World Wars is actually quite amazing, even though they lost, considering their few allies and the size and strength of their opponents.  Nevertheless, the analysis is that they plan out every detail with a superorganized approach, but make big errors, major errors of judgment  Of course, very basic is evaluating their opponents and taking on more than they can deal with.  It is unlikely (actually, more like impossible) the Germans would have won WWI even had they occupied Stalingrad (they blew it the year before, by invading Russia too late), although it would have created more difficulties for the Russians (and the U.S. and U.K., heavily supplying them, heavily bombing the Germans, and fighting the Germans in North Africa).But in any event, the character of Major Konig is not in the usual vein of the overorganized, rigid-thinking German.  He is steely, in the usual German way, but projects a quiet, more genuine confidence, and is trickier still than his opponents.  No particular Nazi party man, he is a professional soldier, not a bad guy (in the evenhanded approach demanded of modern movies, toward at least the common soldier) -- when he is obliged to kill a civilian, it climaxes a vignette, without sadism or graphic display.  He projects a feeling of command and invincibility so compelling that the viewer actually feels he will win, although knowing otherwise.  This is no spoiler, of course, yet we are left with the aura that Konig was the better man.  It would be a spoiler to say how it was done, and that is another gold star for Director Jean-Jacques Annaud.  Heroism reigns triumphant.By contrast, Vassili is, yes, more heroic than Konig, but he is a self-doubting hero.  He is 'developed' more so than Konig, but this is appropriate.  Brilliant in his initial successes, he begins to question how he fits into the prodigious circumstances, whether he is up to the challenge to Konig and in general, and whether and how things can be carried on. This is played out in his relationships with fellow Russians and a romance with woman soldier Tania (Rachel Weisz), providing an interesting and unusual, though uneven in intensity, love triangle (the other party is the other main Russian character).  Compare 'Pearl Harbor'; in fact, compare the triteness of the characters there to the much different depth of the Russian soldiers here, and civilians too--much of the story centers on a Russian publication, on the theme of hero-seeking.  Vasilli ultimately gets by, with a little help from his friends.Later-to-be chief of state Nikita Krushchev, more familiar to older viewers, is prominent in this movie, in line with his noteworthy role at Stalingrad.  But most of all, 'Enemy at the Gates' is about one of filmdom's best and most original confrontations between military protagonist and antagonist, and bringing the viewer into the experiences of World War II's most dynamic battle.",9,0,1,10 November 2001
The Bridge on the River Kwai," What's the Score?
","Great movie and great acting performance by Alec Guinness.   With David Lean involved, the cinematography is excellent, as always.  Most movies involving war are either antiwar or in praise of heroism, so this interesting idea of mixed views is refreshing.  However, as great as all this and the film in general are, nothing qualifies it as ABSOLUTE best in any category--EXCEPT Score.   It is the best of all-time in my view--if anyone has any alternatives, please do a message board post.",10,1,3,8 November 2001
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Tour de force, Nicholson's best
","Chief Bromden's narrative is matched for excellence is this film, with Jack Nicholson perfectly cast as McMurphy, who although not more rambunctious than the novel version of Ken Kesey's feisty character, has the edge in sarcasm.  Nurse Ratched is also portrayed very well, by Louise Fletcher, and the acting overall is stellar.  The portrayal of Billy Bibbit and his situation superb, as is the 1963 World Series scene.  (Interesting:  in real life, Tresh and Mantle did homer against Koufax, two-run and solo, respectively, but in different games, and that represented all of the Yanks' damage against him;  Koufax pitched in games 1 and 4, Downing in game 2.) However, my favorite moment is McMurphy's lifting effort.  We return again to the chief at the end, as the final scenes, like the rest of the movie, do not let us down.  Striking a blow for freedom, this film is Nicholson's finest effort.",9,1,2,3 November 2001
Downfall," Deutschland Unter Alles
","Frau Traudl Junge, Hitler's secretary, is the focal point of this 2004 German-made Bunker film. She is portrayed by Alexandra Maria Lara. In her comments at the beginning and end of the film, the real Traudl reflects on the forces that led her to be in the position she was and the immorality of Hitler and the Nazi regime. In the movie, the young Traudl has an innocent and despondent demeanor from the time she was chosen as Hitler's secretary in November 1942 until the end, when she and a group of other Bunker persons have fled, seeking to escape the Russians.Director Oliver Hirschbiegel does an amazing job in continually making the viewer feel the sense of siege. What is most striking about 'Untergang' is its graphic realism. All the scenes of shells dropping bring the viewer there, as if the viewer is experiencing it. In one scene, officers and other Nazis are dancing and making merry in the Old Reich Chancellery (connected to the Bunker by a tunnel) and a wall is blown up by a shell. This is a true story per Traudl's account. The realism of 'Saving Private Ryan' may have come a few years before, but in urban battle scenes that use darker colors, military green, and grayish shading, Hirschbiegel makes things interesting in his own way, very vivid. Furthermore, he presents a number of scenes involving the wounded awaiting or undergoing medical treatment, including amputations, that are very graphic and gruesome. There was plenty of morphine available, but other medical supplies were scarce.As for the characters, the Germans are divided between fanatical Nazis and those who are reasonable, those who have compassion for people suffering from the physical agonies of war. One of the central figures is Dr. Ernst-Gunter Schenck, played by Christian Berkel. He serves to symbolize the force of reason, as he objects to evacuations of installations and supplies that victimize remaining civilians, seeks morphine and other medical supplies, and questions the meaningless honorable-death mindset of remaining fanatical Nazis. Bur realities are remaining fanatics, wandering terrorized civilians, and the agonizing wounded. The scenes showing the human suffering serve to accentuate the evils of Hitler. He chose to commit suicide to avoid capture by the Russians, so he would not have to experience what everyone else was suffering through. In the meantime, many young German children, which could include females, were serving militarily and being killed or mutilated.Hitler is played by Bruno Ganz. He is the ranter devoid of reason with whom most people are familiar. Ganz is a more wrinkled Hitler than in real life, but he does a good job with the mannerisms, the ravings, and the tremors. He is a totally evil person, as shown in his demand to implement a scorched earth policy even though it would leave German civilians without any necessities. That is on top of his lecture on the savagery of apes, who trample on outsiders; Hitler says humans should learn to be like apes. On this comments board and boards for other Bunker films, it is often noted that the Nazis and others in the Bunker have human feelings and are not totally evil. This observation includes Hitler, who thanks his cooks for things etc. But to me, 'Untergang,' like other Bunker films, still shows Hitler, Dr. Goebbels, Martin Bormann, and some others as consummately evil, as they should be shown. There are some who seem not to be, military officers or whoever, yet even as they question what Hitler does, they are still loyal. He had a hypnotic effect on people. Even after Hitler refuses Eva Braun (Juliane Kohler) the favor of rescinding his order to execute her brother in law, a favor requested with all trappings of emotion, she says, 'You're the Fuhrer.' Magda Goebbels (Corinna Harfouch) worships Hitler like her husband does and is willing to kill her seven children and herself to avoid a world without him. A well-acted emotional moment, for right or for wrong, is when she holds Hitler and falls to his feet, before he commits suicide. How sad will be life without Hitler.One of the final scenes, after Hitler's suicide, involves Traudl in a group of Bunker escapees deciding what to do next. In combat garb, accompanied by a young boy, she is permitted to pass through the Russian lines with the watching Russian soldiers still. I guess it is silly to compare it to 'The Birds,' for Traudl is not Tippi Hedren. But as in 'The Birds,' when 'Untergang' ends the viewer is left with the sense of having been relieved from a siege in a turbulent epic.",8,3,6,21 December 2008
The Shawshank Redemption," Definitely good but deserves no pedestal
","I enjoyed 'The Shawshank Redemption,' but it is not a movie in its own league, as so many seem to say.  Starting off, it is almost a sure thing that no prison movie could ever be in that category for me.  The closest would be 'Papillon', which is clearly better than this, and other movies are better at capturing general mistreatments of prisoners even as they focus on certain main characters.  Here, altho there were other instances of abuse, the emphasis is on the main character in his role in the story, not the society of prison inmates.  Not that I am a particular lover of the total depressing side, but to communicate negative qualities of a prison, the bad stuff needs to be presented more--the violence more graphic, the negative conditions more thoughtfully.  I know people cite the story as well, but I think if this movie is to be on such a high pedestal there should be something more special about the portrayal of life in prison, and there isn't.I thought the acting performances of Tim Robbins (who plays chief character Andrew Dufresne) and Morgan Freeman were, similarly, quite good but not great, and although I was into the story, it just did not bring tears to my eyes.  I don't think the 'twists' were all that unique--I guess I've been jaded by the modern (80s onward) murder dramas.  Nevertheless, the storyline was good, the warden nice and despicable, and there were interesting ideas re Dufresne's functions in prison.  The ending was also well done, and I acknowledge, somewhat moving.  Certainly recommended.",7,0,1,12 December 2001
Paths of Glory," Ultimate antiwar flick
","The ultimate antiwar movie (very slightly ahead of 'All Quiet on the Western Front'), and I believe it always will be.  Stanley Kubrick did nicely in 'Full Metal Jacket,' but here he gets right to the point.  Isn't war even more terrible if the enemy is your own officers? Up and up... And war is horrible, period.  The evil of the generals who ordered a meaningless suicide charge and their horrible manipulations stands for itself, but most meaningful to me is the overall administrative smugness projected, a personification of all those involved in running a war, any war, who are not themselves doing the fighting.  The setting of a court martial hearing with Dax (Kirk Douglas--boy, has anybody ever been better?) defending the three soldiers serves well to dramatize the issues, the basic antiwar theme, which climaxes with the final scene, the apotheosis of the horror and absurdity of war, ranking with Rosebud among the all-time greats.",10,0,0,12 November 2001
The Birds," The Birds rules, birds rule
","Superb, original film by Hitchcock, combining a novel horror idea of attacking birds in a somewhat surreal country setting with a very pretty protagonist (or antagonist).  Tippi Hedren's character of Melanie evokes both sympathy and some disdain for her sneakiness, mystery (whatever might lay behind it), and (causation?) throughout the film, and in contrast to 'Psycho,' things are not resolved.  Attraction exists between Melanie and her beau, but closeness is deterred with a mutual feeling of distrust and suspicion, cleverly developed by Hitchcock.  While the characters --townspeople etc. -- are somewhat understated, as appropriate in most horror films, their psychology and interplay are well done, almost brilliant.  The color is subtly essential to this movie just as black & white is to Psycho.  But ultimately, the film is for the birds, ever ominous and on the offensive.  The ending reminds me of 'Chato's Land' (OK, I know 'The Birds' came first).  10 out of 10",10,1,2,21 October 2001
The Godfather," A classic all the way
","The Godfather is without a doubt one of the all-time greats, and the acting performances of Marlin Brando as Vito Corleone and James Caan as Sonny match that comment (Al Pacino is also good, but they have the edge).  The first two-thirds of the movie is definitely better, but the last third does its job in finalizing Mike's evolution into a Mafia chief.The movie adds to the mystique of Brando as Godfather by not having him the center of action except for the first third of the movie, keeping you from that overdone feeling, and his major decisions are made in the wedding and shortly thereafter.  But oh, the classic scenes that resulted:  the friendship scene with Bonasera, the 'making an offer that he can't refuse' line, the horse's head, the hand stabbing/strangling death of Luca Brasi. In the minority situation for an actor's being made to look older than he is, Brando is superb.  The cotton stuffing in his mouth works magnificently. He is The Godfather all the way -- way, way over Michael.  His wisdom and counsel are greater, and his majesty; Michael is a morose figure.Sonny is a formidable, memorable character (is he not much taller than James Caan is?), and his blatant id contrasts with Vito and Michael.  Tom Hagen is also played very well, by Robert Duvall, and other actors and actresses do a good job.  The hypocrisy crystallized by the Catholic mass setting is also excellent.  And hey, is not Sonny beating up his brother in law one of the very, very best fight scenes, even if one-sided?  What can I cite by comparison, Bruce Lee vs. Chuck Norris in The Way of the Dragon -- and yes, not sarcastically -- for what good fight scenes are so distinctive, intense and original, leaving such an imprint--what other very good fight scene also sticks out so much in one's mind over others?  You can't say, 'they're all the same' for this one.  Sonny, like Vito and Mike, is part of American popular culture (well, I guess international, not to be chauvinistic).One of my friends, and perhaps yours, has said, 'I was rooting for the Corleones.'  As one who likes many thrillers, action and suspense movies, and crime dramas, but does not like the overly depressing subject matter and sleazy characters and sometimes tortuous, overcomplicated plots that characterize the mid-70s onward (Pulp Fiction, Grifters, etc.), I note that this is unfortunately a forerunner of these, altho not hard to follow.  But I think it was the Godfather Part II that really was the precursor, and II's quality pales in comparison to I's (I do not care what others think), and much more than other sequels.  Because the genius of The Godfather I was taking such sordid subject matter and making it so entertaining, so much a part of our consciousness, and leaving us with such positive feeling when we think about it.  I do not believe this is the case for many later movies to which its influence can be traced.",10,1,4,20 September 2001
