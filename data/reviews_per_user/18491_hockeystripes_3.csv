Walk the Line," Reese steals the show
",I just watched this movie that I had heard a lot of good things about. It was all I had heard and more. The story itself is interesting and riveting at times and is well worth watching. The music is the main attraction though and Reese Witherspoon's performance is exceptional. I was never a June Carter fan but Reese Witherspoon's performance is nothing short of a show stealer. Her vocals are fantastic and her presence on stage performing looked genuine and real. I have enjoyed Johnny Cash's music for many years and was looking forward to seeing this movie and his story. After watching the movie I was far more impressed with Reese Witherspoon as an actor and singer. Boy can she sing !!,9,7,13,2 September 2006
The Notebook," I liked it !!
","I am a James Garner fan and this is why I watched the movie. Would I have watched if Garner wasn't in it probably not but I found myself being more and more drawn into the story and how it was being told. I thought the way the movie played out was excellent and the way the director set it up was excellent also. The narration and going from present to past really kept me interested and trying to figure out what was going on. In the back of my mind I thought something would happen, like Garner being Noah but I was still surprised when it ended. I was disappointed by the sad finish but when you think about it should it have ended any other way ? I know sad sappy movies aren't supposed to be 'guy movies' but I thoroughly enjoyed this and have watched it several times.",7,1,3,2 September 2006
The Good Shepherd," Wait for it on video
",While I found it very interesting it does drag on several times during the film. At over two and a half hours long it is better seen at home when you can hit the pause button and stretch. There are some very dramatic performances and a very interesting story but I found myself yawning several times. You need to pay close attention to details as the story goes from past to present and back and forth. There are some subtle things that you must watch for and that is all I will say about that. Matt Damon gives a very believable performance and Angelina Jolie is excellent as well at a role very subdued from previous roles. The lack of excitement (and blood) was a disappointment for most in the theater that saw it at the same time as I did. If you are looking for assassinations and killings there isn't a lot of this. I liked it but not at the cost of a cinema ticket and snacks.,6,1,3,2 January 2007
