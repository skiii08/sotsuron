Blade Runner 2049," soundtrack crushed a weak movie to begin with
","Just like the remake of Ben Hur you ask why would anyone take on such a responsibility since the original Blade Runner is the best science fiction movie ever made. Bad idea from the start, like trying to improve on Michelangelo's sculpture of David (yea remake that one), or like Custer who thought he was going to kick-ass on some Native Americans after following a trail for a couple of days that was a mile wide ('Please Mr. Custer, I don't want to go').But what made an impossibility even worse was the soundtrack. You couldn't even hear the dialogue over the synthesizer sound.Hans Zimmer has lost the plot. The pinnacle of his career was the music he composed for 'The Thin Redline' which was wonderfully appropriate and in big part made the movie. Dunkirk was on the edge, and Blade Runner 2049 fell off the cliff.Zimmer has lost the plot, and the director that accepts that he knows best better think again.Sorry but this sound track is too much, too annoying, too loud, too overpowering, it is so over the top that you don't enjoy the movie experience, you can't even concentrate on the movie. You feel drained, and least of all entertained.Like the real Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) said to the Cilician Pirate that betrayed him: 'go away' In the future I will check the composer of the soundtrack before I go to a big movie, and if its Hans Zimmer, I'm not going.This is Zimmer's Michael Cimino 'Heaven's Gate' moment.",2,22,47,8 October 2017
The Irishman," long live the king
","I know I'm a crackpot but I just have to chip in my 2-cents worth:My wife and I have watched this movie to the end three times in two weeks. The first time (on NEFLIX) I kept pausing it hoping it wasn't almost overt; good there is still one and half hours left. Who does that in a 3.5 hour movie.This movie is a 21st Century Ben-Hur (the movie my parents took me to when I was 6, and to this day until now there never been anything better).It's simply flawless. It's perfection in an imperfect world.From now on when you speak of Martin Scorsese , it is in the same breath as William Wyler, David Lean, and Stanley Kubrick.Long live the King, and god bless you sir for sharing your passion with all of us. This is real cinema, absolutely.",10,2,6,17 December 2019
Beasts of No Nation," too powerful for no mention
","There is a moment in this film which occurs 1 hour in that is movie making at its ultimate perfection. I can't remember a movie in the last 5 years that moved me so much, but you have to pay attention. The direction, the editing, the acting(even by children), and the soundtrack which is not intrusive but builds as the scene builds is bound together so completely that it will break your heart.And to think that this film didn't even get a mention at the Academy Awards; WTF (not yelling, this is a three letter acronym, a TLA)!This film, along with current events, makes you realize that nothing has changed much since the middle ages. If there is money to make and you got enough money, buy an army and go for it.",10,2,2,4 October 2016
1917," moments that will put you on the floor
","I wanted to see this movie for three reasons:
First, it is a Sam Mendez movie who never disappointsSecond, I read 500 page book about the English experience at the Battle of the Somme ('Into the Breach' if you're interested). It was historical researched and contained multiple excerpts from journals of people that where there. One of the excepts went like this (I paraphrase):' I sent my brother and another to call back an attack that would fail. They reached the companies, but where was my brother when they cane back? I was told he was in No-Mans-Land. What?!. The reply was ' No old man he didn't make it'.The writer wrote that in the end he sent his brother to save others brothers, and lost his own.Third: the soundtrack was composed by Thomas Neman, who is without a doubt the most inspired artist of his generation.There is a seen in this movie that is so emotional that it will put you on the floor if you're not sitting. The music at first seems wrong, because it is so majestic, but then you remember the mission, and the music is perfect.Only two other movies have made me feel so emotional, Shindler's List, and Gangs of New York. At first I was OK then on the way out of the theater I needed to lean on the wall and sob.",Null,0,1,1 February 2020
