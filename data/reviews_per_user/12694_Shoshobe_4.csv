The King's Speech," Ggggood, bbbbut not great
","This is a biopic of King George VI (Colin Firth) which focuses on the formation of his friendship with Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), a speech therapist who taught him how to overcome a stammer, so that the King could deliver inspiring speeches to his British subjects, particularly during World War II. Logue succeeds where others have failed because he refuses to patronize the King simply because he is royal, and instead he provides the King not only with speech therapy but also much needed emotional counseling which allows the King to mature into a man, if not a monarch.The King is depicted as insecure and childish who apparently acquired these traits as well as his speech impediment during his childhood as a result of an overbearing father, mean nannies and having lived a sheltered, privileged life. His wife, Queen Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) appears to be his polar opposite - a confident, somewhat haughty take-charge type of gal. However, this was distracting because the real Queen was nothing like this and the portrayal of such a mismatched couple leaves the audience wondering how the two could have related to one another on any level.With a timeless story line and a dream cast who delivered excellent performances, this was clearly a good movie, but worthy of the Best Picture? I don't think so. Although this is a buddy-flick, it has the characteristics of a trite love story where boy meets girl, then loses girl, and then gets the girl in the end. And the ending falls flat - the King manages to deliver a public speech without falling apart (hence the namesake, 'The King's Speech')...the end, or more appropriately...ThThThThat's all folks. This movie probably won best picture because it is so relevant to Hollywood. Movie stars are America's answer to royalty where you have bunch of egotistical, pampered wrecks who surround themselves with 'yes' people when what they really need is someone like Logue to give them a good slap in the face.",8,0,1,12 March 2011
The Favourite," It's Good to Be the Queen
","The Favourite is a movie that tells the real life interesting story of Queen Anne (Colman) who did, indeed, allow herself to be influenced and manipulated by two women that were total polar opposites -- the extremely wealthy and beautiful Duchess of Marlborough (Weisz) who bullied the Queen, and the Duchess' lower class cousin Abigail Masham (Stone) who flattered the Queen. While this serves as the core story-line, the movie takes on its own interpretations to fill in the historical gaps, although many of which are actually based upon reliable sources.Ultimately, The Favourite is a well-done historical drama with some comedic elements, and packaged in a way that brings the early 18th century English court alive with beautiful sets/locations, elaborate costumes, and dry wit that is typical of English dialogue.While there are many reviews from others complaining that the movie was boring and lacking on comedic content, perhaps they missed that this is a historically based story intended to be realistic. So you shouldn't expect to see a real 18th century Queen of England to be depicted as a stand-up Sarah Silverman delivering a litany of crude, adolescent jokes. If that is what you are looking for, you probably need look no further than the $1 movie bin at Walmart.",8,5,13,23 December 2018
Titanic," A Titanic Production with a Storyline that Sinks
","The main character, Rose (Kate Winslet), is a 17ish year old society girl setting sail on the luxurious Titanic to America with her extremely wealthy, handsome fiancé who adores her. What else could a girl want...or so you'd think. Well, inexplicably and unbelievably, our Rose believes that her life of luxury is just too boring for existence, so she decides to jump off the ship until Jack (Leo DiCaprio) talks her out of it. From here, you can see that a love story will unfold...Rose soon learns that Jack is a dirty, struggling American artist who hangs around one-legged French prostitutes, and she becomes impressed with his obscene drawings of naked women. Why wouldn't she dump her rich, adoring fiancé for this guy? So how does the romance develop...? First, there's beer chugging, smoking and dancing at a raucous party held by the steerage class. Then, Rose takes Jack back to her room, rips off all her clothes and demands that he draw her naked. After Jack fails to take this as a hint that she's in heat, Rose drags Jack to the cargo deck where they have sex in the backseat of some stranger's car (how romantic)...and, appropriately enough this is when the shi! hits the fan...I mean the ship hits the iceberg.The problem is that no carefully brought up girl in 1912 would behave this way. In that day and age, this would be throwing her life away just as if she jumped off the ship. Clearly, our Rose has a death wish because she also gives up a spot on a lifeboat choosing to go down with the ship, knowing that she will most likely freeze to death when she hits the water.Despite the storyline and the poor acting, the movie was well produced. In all fairness, it's understandable why the studio went with this story. This was a huge budget production, and if this had been styled as a historical drama with young ladies behaving properly, it probably would not have had the box-office draw the studio needed. All in all, this was an entertaining and watchable movie (though unnecessarily long), but entirely over-rated.",Null,2,3,6 December 2010
Love Actually," Two Hours of Nothing
","I didn't absolutely hate this movie, but it had some real problems. It's a mish-mash of vignettes that lead nowhere with absolutely no development of the characters or their relationships.To begin, there is the dorky British bloke who flies to America looking for sex, and literally just after he arrives, has a group of beautiful women ripping his clothes off...ha ha, end of story. There is also the grieving widower, who happens to meet the lust of his life, a look-alike Claudia Schiffer...ha ha, end of story. There's also the shy porn actor who musters up the courage to ask out his co-star who he just shagged...ha ha, end of story. While these are cute little 'what if' stories, this is where they start and end, each taking about 3.4 minutes of screen time, or actually wasting 3.4 minutes of my life.Other story lines are disturbing, and do not work well in a rom-com. There's Laura Linney who uses her emotionally imbalanced brother as an excuse for not having a life of her own. Then there's the little boy who, instead of grieving over his recently departed mother, only cares about being noticed by the popular girl at school who he's never even spoken to. There's also the story of the guy stalking newlywed Kiera Knightley by going to her home (with her husband in the next room) and declaring his undying love for her by flashing a picture of a decomposing mummy. And what rom-com would be complete without the exhibitionist, drug-addicted, washed-up rockstar who emotionally abuses his manager one minute and declares his gay love for him the next? Instead, the movie should have focused on the stronger story lines involving Colin Firth, Alan Rickman and Hugh Grant - none of which were properly developed.",3,9,14,5 November 2010
