Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Awesome!
","I just saw The Phantom Menace today and when the classic 20th Century Fox music started I had flashbacks of 1977 when the original Star Wars came out. My dad took me to see it in a drive-in theater when I was four years old. I loved it and still love it. Episode One fits right in. When the synopsis of what's been happening in the galaxy scrolls at the beginning, anyone who's seen the other movies can't help but feel right at home. From the time it starts to the time it ends, it's Star Wars through and through.This movie has all the classic George Lucas ingredients... speed, deep characters and a whole lot of intrigue. The Force is as strong as ever and it's mentioned and built on a lot. The casting choices are fantastic. Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan Kenobi is perfect. He has the same sort of nasal English speech that Sir Alec Guinness has. And the sword play is awesome. I couldn't get enough of it! I can't wait to see Episode II",10,1,1,19 May 1999
Titanic," Fantastic!
","I admit, I only wanted to see the ship when I first heard that this movie was coming out. When I actually went and saw it, I was so impressed with absolutely everything. I've been fascinated with the Titanic for years and often wondered what it would have been like to be there. Not for the sinking but to be on the ship. This movie brought me as close to that feeling as I think I'll ever get. Now I know what it would have been like.I'm also impressed at the historical accuracy of the film. It's definitely a tribute to those who perished and the survivors.For anyone who is passing judgement on the film before they see it because Leonardo DiCaprio is in it should get over it and see the film. If you like the Titanic, it's worth it.",10,2,3,6 April 1999
