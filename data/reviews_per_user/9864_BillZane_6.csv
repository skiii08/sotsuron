Casablanca," I don't get it
","I tried so hard to like this movie.  I understand - it's a classic, and anyone who loves movies should swear by this film because it's this and that and the other and it can cure warts and remove cellulite and fix your car... An hour into it, my date and I were so lost that we turned it off.  The acting was great, of a caliber we don't see much of in modern movies, but the storyline just didn't sit with me.  I had no idea what was going on half the time (the legal aspects, for instance) because I don't have an intimate knowledge of the time period or location, and when I did understand what was happening (the affair), I wasn't sure why this movie had become classic.  I mean no offense to the people who love this movie.  I just wish I could have loved it, too.",2,41,89,29 December 1998
Batman Returns," Who is this movie about?
","I went to this movie to see BATMAN.  I also enjoyed seeing Catwoman.  The only characters I really didn't like the Penguin and Shreck.  Well, in terms of time spent on screen, this movie was about the Penguin and Shreck.  The far more interesting Catwoman storyline only received about twenty minutes of time, and Batman himself was seen for maybe ten, fifteen minutes.  A Batman-Catwoman movie would have been great, but the addition of the other two villains was just too much.",3,1,6,27 March 1999
10 Things I Hate About You," 10 things I hated about this movie
","1. The pathetic, one-dimensional characters, with the exceptions of Bianca, Patrick, and Kat.2. That the '10 things' sonnet at the end of the movie really had about 14 things.3. That either Kat's transitions were edited out or she spontaneously bounced from bitch to lovable and back again, giving no reasons at all.4. That Cameron and Bianca looked too young for high school while Patrick, Kat, the nerdy guy, and the model looked old enough for college.
5. That the school band, consisting of maybe two dozen total members, practiced on the same field as every other athletic team in school AT THE SAME TIME.6. That they never identified the band 'letters to cleo'.  I'm sorry, they're not popular enough to recognize by SOUND, much less by sight.7. That Bianca's prom dress was inspired by 'I Dream of Jeannie'  meeting Clueless.8. That there was an entire relationship developed with the Shakespearean angle, with the nerd and Kat's friend, for no reason and with no logic.9. That this much sexual content and foul language was allowed in a PG-13 movie, AND10. That I really didn't completely hate this movie. While it didn't even have the low level of charm that Shakespeare's original dull play had, the actors were cute and the jokes occasionally funny. Very few of the characters matched their analogues in Taming of the Shrew, but for this movie it didn't matter.  While I feel that I wasted my time seeing this, I'm voting it a 4, very high for a movie I didn't even like.",4,1,2,1 April 1999
54," What went wrong?
","This movie had the greatest elements - Hot young stars, a dazzling set, and the ability to pull some of the country's most fun disco hits.  Instead, the movie turned out bland and downright stomach-turning in sections.  The soundtracks, with two volumes out now, have yet to scrape together four songs worth listening to.",4,0,0,13 December 1998
Good Will Hunting," the wrong recognition
","This movie won a Best Screenplay Oscar.  No!  This movie had its good points - the acting was incredible, and all of the characters were played believably.  But the writing was awful.  Robin Williams' character was so pathetically cliched that I personally wanted Will to go psycho and kill him, just so I wouldn't have to watch anymore.  And Skylar was no catch, but Will never EVER deserved her.  I mean, our first view of this guy has him assaulting a man who never did anything to him.  We're supposed to like THIS character?  No, mathematical ability is no excuse for this guy's anti-social danger.  I fervently believed that Matt Damon was this character, but that doesn't mean it was well written.",2,5,14,1 January 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Why?
","This movie had across-the-board first-rate acting from Alan Cumming and Sidney Pollack to Tom and Nicole.  Everyone seemed to be fully involved in who their characters were, and you could tell some time had been spent developing this.  But it still turned out to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen!  I can give you a plot summary in maybe four steps:Tom Cruise walks around New York to one of two locations and spends ludicrous amounts of money.Tom Cruise says he's a doctor.Tom Cruise thinks of Nicole Kidman.Repeat if necessary until you have thoroughly wasted 2 1/2 hours of the audience's time.The soundtrack was just some maniac on a piano banging a note at a time as hard as he could.  The only noticeable song, Chris Isaak's 'Bad, Bad Thing' was a bit of irony in that his characters never actually DO bad things. They just think about them or watch, and I'm sorry, but that's terribly boring.  I will do my best to remember this film for the stellar performances and not the depressing technical failures.  2 out of 10",2,1,3,19 July 1999
