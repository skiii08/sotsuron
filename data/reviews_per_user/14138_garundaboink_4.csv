The Legend of Bagger Vance," Laughable attempt at philosophy or golf
","I love the game of golf. I love movies with a good story. Hollywood has great success with fantasies but unfortunately golf is a sport that defies fantasy. Golf is a sport about things that you cannot portray on the screen and anyone who has played it seriously knows this well. Golf is an internal sport and it is very scientific. Magical characters don't suddenly appear in your head to show you the putting line that twists like a 30 foot boa over the Pyranees. Golf is about spending hours on your own on the putting range. It is a mental sport and if you had an ex-girlfriend chatting in your ear like a parrot while you tried to hit a drive, or a fictional Will Smith uttering maximus excrementia in your other ear just before a 200 yard carry over water you and everyone else on tour would probably shoot a lousy round of golf, perhaps your worst.This movie illustrates everything that is wrong with Hollywood when it goes bad. It makes up fantasies, and suckles the world's children on them making them believe that heroism and success are merely a figment of the strongest imaginations. If I imagine and focus strongly enough I can simply hit a 3,000 yard drive. What's next Mr. Redford, SpiderMan Joins the Tour? Stay away from golf stories, they're mostly internal, sort of like chess on grass. By the way, Matt Damon is most obviously not a golfer.",1,5,14,4 June 2006
Black Book," Hollywood can't beat this!!!
","This movie has everything!!! I was disappointed at the end because I didn't see Hitler fly into Paris on a Zeppelin balloon, jump on a bicycle and win the Tour de France, bribing the officials with stolen jewels from murdered Jews. But other than that, it simply has everything. Every single plot twist ever shown on the screen before, or to be found in pulp fiction smut magazines of the Forties. Naked sexy chicks? Got it. Mean Nazis whipping and having sex with said naked sexy chicks? Got it. Nazis shooting double-crossed innocents? Yup, got that, times three or four! I must correct other reviewers who seem to think this movie was based on fact. The titles actually say that it was inspired by true events. It was also inspired by the cigarettes they smoke in Holland that are not legally available elsewhere. I will give the writers some credit – there actually was a second world war, but that's about as far as the movie parallels reality.There are, in point of fact, about twenty betrayals and double-crosses in the plot, and a few false double-crosses where the lead character is thought to be a double-crosser but isn't really and she must prove her innocence before she can be killed. So on that score, this film wins on sheer volume and repetition of a plot mechanism. It becomes somewhat difficult to bear when we see Canadian soldiers hand out rifles to captured Germans after the war so they can shoot one of their own, a gentle, kind-hearted, sweetheart of a man who's in charge of the Gestapo and secretly saving the lives of guilty resistance fighters.The film also can win the Most Implausible Coincidences award for all the incidents that it uses to move a sluggish plot forward. For instance, how did the evil Dutch doctor (muahahaha) know that our intrepid Jewish heroine would convulse in uncontrollable grief upon hearing of the death of her Gestapo-boss lover? So that he could inject her with a 'sedative'. (muahahaha!!!) And why did the after-war prisoners (collaborators) haul up a cauldron of sewage twenty feet into the air? Is that what you do with sewage? Haul it up in the air? Just so it could be poured by the gang of haters onto our heroine? Did they know she'd be there? The worst of the implausible events is when the resistance fighters try to kidnap a double-crosser who leads Jews to their deaths in order to steal their wealth. The evil-doer (muahahaha) puts up a struggle and gets the upper hand, and a religious zealot has the only working gun, but he can't shoot because he'd be taking a life. The heroine is being strangled to death but the Christian can't kill to save her. The villain calls her a 'damn' whore and the Christian is so overcome with anger at the swearing that he is now able to start shooting the evil swearing man. He fills him with bullets and his friends have to pull him away from shooting more, not for choking a woman mind you, but for blaspheming. Only gold leaf can be stretched this far, but credulity, mmmm, not so much.Here is some truth about Holland's contribution to the war. It had a popular Nazi party. It fielded more than 25,000 soldiers to fight along side the Germans in Dutch SS divisions on the Russian front. This film about intense underground warfare, a complete myth, is nothing more than an attempt to firmly lock the closets, paper over the wall, and hide the skeletons of a not-so-glorious past. That can be the only explanation why such a fantasy could receive government funding. Blackbook is a brilliant example of inept writing, re-using plot twists and double-crosses, sex and violence ad nauseum, not until the story had come to a logical end, but until the funding ran out. Unfortunately, it also succeeds in draining one's patience, and I apologize to the actors. It must have required extreme professionalism to give top notch performances without bursting into laughter after each take, and to their credit they did not.",10,1,5,2 September 2013
Trainspotting," Yeck!
","Rubbish! Shock value high, with human feces top of the list. Dead baby, toilets, fingers in anuses, 345 uses of the c**t word, homicidal maniac with a knife but no known motive. You get the picture. It's got a high rating, don't be fooled; that's probably from all the scat-fetish people. Excessive, boring and unnecessary over-narration during the film attempts to shed light on this waste of celluloid and give it some meaning, but that fails too. Perhaps the editor got it backwards and all the good bits went into the bin and the rest became Toiletspotting. They succeeded if the attempt was to portray the effects of a drug addiction gone bad, waiting for the end to come to our suffering, even if that means death, because that's what you'll be wishing before this movie is over. Please God, kill me now. What amazes me is how trash like this gets funding! If this is the best Scotland has to offer...Choose life, choose a movie with a story and some redeeming social value. By the way, principal narrator, it's 'three piece suit' not 'three piece suite',(Soot not sweet). The fact that there wasn't a re-take to get that right should tell you loads about the production values.",1,20,51,15 December 2013
The Bourne Supremacy," Enough with the Jiggle Cam Already.
","The good story and action scenes have a high potential for a great movie. However, the director has ruined this film with the 'Jiggle Cam' effect. If the point is to make it look like it was a seasick camera operator with alcoholic withdrawal symptoms, then the effect worked. I watched this on TV and was praying for the commercials. The action scenes are a blur of incomprehensible snippets from a bad dream, pieces of jiggling camera flashes that confuse the viewer. Who is shooting who, what car is he in, why are we in an office and why is the cameraman jiggling around? Whose viewpoint is this shot from? Code Blue, in room 410, bring epinephrine STAT! This director went over the top using the effect with the result that a great film was made into a cliché hospital TV show. Jiggling the camera is cliché already. There, that ought to get the message across. Hollywood, ENOUGH WITH THE JIGGLE CAM ALREADY! IT HAS BEEN DONE TO DEATH!",5,0,1,18 February 2007
