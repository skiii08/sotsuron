Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A protracted experience
","In my humble opinion, this movie pales in comparison to the 1st volume of Kill Bill. Where the first movie was briskly paced, part 2 simply drags. Where the fight scenes shone, here they glimmer weakly.
***SPOILERS AHEAD***That's not to say there is nothing to like in Kill Bill: Volume 2. Daryl Hannah has her best role in a long time with Elle Driver, and the fight scene between her and Uma Thurman in the caravan is everything it should be - brutal, bloody and exciting. Gordon Liu is both unrecognisable and on good form as Uma's mentor, Pai Mei - he gets almost all of the laughs in this movie (bar one line spoken by The Bride's daughter at the end of the movie - 'Shogun Assassin' - had me rolling in the aisles!)***END OF SPOILERS***Tarantino's weakest film to date for me, but Tarantino at half-mast is still better than a lot of directors out there at their best!6/10",Null,1,2,25 April 2004
Final Destination 2," A very worthy sequel
","A most entertaining 90 minutes of gore, mayhem and thrills. I won't go into plot details here, as you can read about these elsewhere. However, I will say I went in expecting little and emerged with a big smile on my face, having been thoroughly amused and grossed out!*Spoilers ahead*OMG it is gory. The double-whammy of the 'pole-thru-the-head' and 'trisection-by-flying-fencewire' had me whooping like a girl. Totally unexpected.What I like about this movie is the way it blindsided you. You think you know what is going to happen next, how the character will be killed....then something else happens VERY suddenly that turns your expectations on their head and makes you go 'OH MY GOD!'9/10.",Null,0,0,21 July 2003
Identity," Thriller with a nice twist...
","A very well-written and directed thriller which is one of those sleeper hits like 'Frailty' that comes out of left-field with little fanfare, but greatly received and reviewed by most of those who have had the pleasure of seeing it.Pruitt Taylor Vince as the madman about to be executed was excellent, as was the rest of the cast. You think you know where this one might be going, but then it takes a 180 degree turn and throws you in a totally different direction. Great stuff, and a truly brilliant concept for a movie.9/10.",Null,0,0,8 September 2003
