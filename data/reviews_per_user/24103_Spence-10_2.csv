The Blair Witch Project," Underwhelming.
","I was really hoping to be scared by this movie. I really was. Unfortunately, I wasn't. Not a bit. Actually I was pretty bored. It was an exceptionally repetitive film. It would have made a pretty good 'short', but not a full length feature. I wanted to shout at them 'follow the damn river' but no, they wouldn't do that. Instead, they just repeated the same scenes over and over until, mercifully, it was finished.",4,0,1,8 September 1999
The Fast and the Furious," Fast & Predictable.
","Just when you thought that perhaps the movie wouldn't continue down it's inexorably predictable path anymore: It does. Suspense and surprise are thrown away in this movie. It also really doesn't have a really good race until the very end of the move, by which time you are merely waiting for the movie to finish in the unbelievably 'made to a Hollywood checklist' way that it does.",5,0,1,27 June 2002
