Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," pretty bad, not even comedy
","the jokes wear off in the first 10 minutes of the movie... i guess i should have known better than to keep watching...it's interesting that comments, commentary, and comedy in this movie (such as 'Kill the Jew') get a collective 'pass,' while other mediums today are castigated for stereotyping...i never considered myself out on the fringe of viewer ship (i like films such as 'Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead'), but i fail to see any redeeming quality in this film...how anyone could stand watching more than 30 minutes of this is beyond me...",1,6,14,24 May 2007
