Come and See," Unbelievable
","The best true-to-life war movie I have ever seen, and possibly the best movie I have ever seen. My eyes were opened when I saw this for the first time a few days ago. It made me realise what I miss 99% of the time when watching movies. So few affect me like this one did.No special effects of note, no big budget, no set-pieces of note, no heroes, no redemption. I feel quite sure the director has really captured what war 'feels' like - unlike Spielberg and Coppola's depictions of war, this director lived through WW2 and the horrific siege of Stalingrad, as well as spending many months researching the massacres in Belarus, one of which he depicts in this film (this from the DVD extras, well worth watching).The direction, cinematography, soundtrack and AMAZING acting by a first-time untrained actor in the main role are faultless, in my humble opinion.I found this film depressing and emotionally draining, but cannot wait to watch it again.",10,334,389,14 May 2006
Casino Royale," Great - now get better!
","What an excellent movie - intelligent, witty script, a steely, subtly emotional performance by Daniel Craig who is perfect for Bond, and a main female character who is for once an important part of the story, and not as is so often the case just dumb eye-candy supplied as a foil for Bond's wit and 'love interest'.Improvements? For starters, ditch the 12A certificate. The bean-counter requirement to pander to young kids does the movie's storyline and editing no favours - punches often don't connect, fight scenes are edited chaotically to minimise the impact of violence, and Bond never, ever swears. This is the 21st century folks, get with the program.Secondly, can anything be done to minimise the all too tedious product placement?Hats off to the director, who miraculously managed to get a torture scene (dare I say it, a witty one) in the film, and did as subtle a job as could be expected with the product placement requirements which were no doubt rammed down his throat by the suits.Keep up this level of script and film making and we can be assured of more entertaining years of the Bond franchise. But make it at least a 15 movie next time......",9,0,2,17 November 2006
