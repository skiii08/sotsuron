Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Slow, but decent
","This movie proves that not all 'Star Wars' movies are great.  The plot of 'The Phantom Menace' was fairly engaging, but no real surprises are left for the viewer: we know what becomes of most of the characters.  (As a side, if Darth Maul had kidnapped Anakin Skywalker for part of the movie, this would have created more suspense).I also felt the total use of computer generated images (CGI), in place of animatronic puppets proved to be distracting at times.  Although the CGI seemed real, some movements did not seem real enough for some of the characters.  (In Lucas' defense, I felt that the battle droids were exceptionally done.)  At other times, it appeared that the actors did not know where the CGI character was located.Any viewer should also be able to see strong parallels between events that occur in this movie and within 'Episode 4: A New Hope'.  Part of the problem that I had with this movie is there was no sense of urgency to escape an immediate threat, which was found within the first three 'Star Wars' movies.I'll be back in 2002 to see the next installment, but I don't plan on a return visit to the theater for this one.",6,0,1,21 May 1999
X-Men," Best comic book movie adaptation - bar none
","Finally, a movie based on a comic book that they didn't screw up.Having been a long-time reader of the comic books, I must admit that I had some trepidation attending this movie.  After all, I remember how disappointed I was after seeing Batman (1989).However, this movie works on two levels: for those who are fans of the comic book, and for those who have never read the comic book.The characterization of the X-Men, their enemies and surrounding cast all remain (if you'll pardon the pun), X-tremely close to their comic roots. There are some slight liberties that have been taken, but none that should offend the avid comic reader.  I was totally blown away by Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine.  It was outstanding.For those who have never read the comic, they too, will appreciate it. The plot is self-explanatory, packed with action and two great headlining actors, Ian McKellen and Patrick Stuart, who were absolutely fantastic picks for Magneto and Professor X, respectively.My prediction is that this will be 'The Biggest Movie of the Summer' for 2000!",10,0,0,17 July 2000
