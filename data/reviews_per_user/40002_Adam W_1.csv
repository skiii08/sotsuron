Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Cheese. Except for the parts that weren't, which rocked.
","From the start (well, almost), this movie was so full of cheese and attempts to be 'cute' that I was repeatedly tempted to bust out laughing in the middle of it.  It seems so much more directed towards children than the original trilogy.  Don't get me wrong - everything that wasn't cheese was done well, outside of character development.  It didn't leave me really caring what happened to anybody, aside from a vague interest in the future of Sen. Palpatine.  The effects were mind-blowing, the storyline was fun, and the twists were pretty nifty.  It's just that there was so much CHEESE in the movie that enjoying it was tempered by wondering what idiotic thing would happen next.",8,0,0,20 May 1999
