"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Run away...Maybe a just a rental...if that...
","This film had potential just a little too predictable and cliché' for me. I'm hearing it was supposed to be cliché' or something, but I thought that MIB and David Schwimmer's remedy to portray humour using a retrospect cliché' approach was directed horribly.Some jokes were delivered great, but the lack of maybe editing or direction. The joke was lost in time which leaves you with a whimsical giggle instead of head hurting laughter.I enjoy Simon Pegg very much so, who wouldn't, but this film was weak.There was a few funny moments. I use 'few' very lightly. if your looking for cliché'. Go see something else.",3,3,9,30 March 2008
