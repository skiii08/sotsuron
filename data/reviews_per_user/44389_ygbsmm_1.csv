Marie Antoinette," Why, Sofia, why?
","A soundtrack can do one of two things for a movie: enhance the viewers' experience or mask a poorly wrought project. I loved the soundtrack, I loved the sets, I loved the idea.... Vision and reality, like cold-fusion, require proof-of-concept. I cannot fathom the amount of money spent to film/produce this movie, but every cent was misspent. This was an absolute failure in everything but the soundtrack, sets and costumes. The only saving grace of this movie was seeing Kirsten Dunst and listening to the background music. This movie is an absolute waste of your good time. If you watch it, you'll never get that 123 minutes of your life back.",1,2,5,13 February 2007
