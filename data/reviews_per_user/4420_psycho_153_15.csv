The Blair Witch Project," AVERAGE, ALL THE HYPE WRECKED IT!!
","Okay when I went to watch this there was a lot of hype, of how this was the scariest movie of all time, the best low budget flick, but I think all that hype wrecked the effect of the film. Many people went in knowing what was happening, I think it would have been much more better if I went in knowing nothing and then yeah it might have been scary. The people reviewing it were maybe the first to see it, they new nothing about it and it was scary. But since that didn't happen, when I saw it I thought the Blair Witch Project was an average movie. Not really scary when watching it.(nothing scary happened) Overall it would have been a great movie but all the hype wrecked the whole atmosphere. I've heard about Cannibal Holocaust which is meant to be pretty much the same as BWP but it was made in the 70's. A group go in to the jungle to make a documentary on cannibals, they are lost, footage found and we see there footage. An BWP is meant to be original.",7,0,1,26 December 1999
Se7en," A EXCELLENT SERIAL KILLER MOVIE!!
","Seven is a great dark thriller, and in my opinion will be the benchmark for all serial killer movies to made. The film is very good, and the aftermath of the killings is also great. There is a killer killing people by the seven deadly sins. Greed, Glutony, Wrath, etc. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play detectives trying to find out who the killer is and why he is killing. Kevin Spacey's performance towards the end of the film is very, very good and would have been one of the best in the flick. Andrew kevin Walker script is excellent great directing, great acting great movie. Way better than other serial killer movies like The Bone Collector.",9,0,0,28 December 1999
Blade," GOOD ACTION/HORROR MOVIE!!
","This was one of those slick action movies that was made to look good on screen, and it did, the vampire fighting sequences were excellent, there was plenty of blood and gore the whole movie looked good to the eye. It was a fun watch and very entertaining. Good movie but I didn't like how Blade could slice vampires in half and they would just die, it looked good but vampires don't die by getting sliced in half. Other than the vampires and how many rules were not kept to in this movie, Wesley Snipes gives a good performance as Blade and Stephen Dorff is great as the evil vampire. The story is when Blade's mother was bitten by a vampire during pregnancy, she did not know that she gave her son a special gift while dying: All the good vampire attributes in combination with the best human skills. Blade grew up to be a vampire hunter for revenge on his mother's death. The vampires, who managed to infiltrate nearly every major organization, need Blade's very special blood to summon La Miagra, the blood god, in order to gain reign about the human cattle, as they call us. If you beleive that vampires can only be killed by a stab to the heart and the weapon must stay in the heart and chopping the head off are the only ways to kill a vampire you won't find that in Blade. But Blade has it's moments and I would recommend it as a good horror/action movie.",5,2,5,29 December 1999
The Mummy," ENTERTAINING WATCH!!
","This was an interesting movie, a lot of genres were included in this. I think it would have been muc better if it included more gore, throw in some blood and guts give it a higher rating. but it was more a family movie which was okay, great special effects, and some above average acting. Reading another review I found out some interesting facts which are very true which shows this movie is very similar to the evil dead moive, first off Rick O' Connell, played by Brendan Fraser, was kind of like Ash from 'Evil Dead', a square-jawed hero who was there just to do the dirty work while the smarter characters solved all the puzzles. A shoot first, think later kind of guy. There was even a Book of the Dead in the film, as there is in 'Evil Dead', which when decrypted has the power to bring the dead back to life, again just like 'Evil Dead'. The mummified priests in this film took the place of the zombie's in 'Evil Dead', having been brought back to life their only goal was to destroy Rick and his friends. Should have had the gore of Evil Dead. All up an entertaining watch, it'll keep your attention throughout.",8,0,0,10 January 2000
Sleepy Hollow," A GREAT MOVIE!!
","A great movie, a interesting plot and a who done it all the way through. I enjoyed this movie immensly, the countless decapitations were great and the headless horsemen looks great. Direction was great my Tim Burton, he created a great atmosphere that fitted the movie perfectly, Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplay based on the classic Washington Irving story the Legend Of Sleepy Hollow. The story is Johnny Depp is Ichabod Crane, sent to Sleepy Hollow to investigate a strange series of murders where all the victims have been decapitated by the headless horseman. A fun movie, heads do roll, lots of cleavage Depp plays the wimpy character pretty well all up a exciting and entertaining watch.",9,0,0,2 January 2000
The Exorcist," THE MOST OVER-RATED MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!
","In my opinion this is one of the most over-rated movies of all time. Scary, yeah in your dream. The Exorcist is one of the earlier horror movies that used graphic depictions of the devil and those type of things but in the 90's this movie stinks!! Wow, a girl possesed by the devil, lying in bed looking all wicked, spinning her head around and vomiting, SCARY STUFF. The Exorcist is a slow and boring watch and I wouldn't recommend you watching this movie. There are no scary parts, no suspenseful moments, no terrifying parts, no disgusting parts absolutely nothing that makes it a good horror movie.",4,2,9,25 December 1999
The Evil Dead," A MUST SEE FOR ALL HORROR FANS!!
","A must see see for all horror fans. Made with a extremely low budget, Evil Dead doesn't fail to bring one of the better horror movies of all time. Not many special effects, but a lot of blood and gore. The first of the trilogy and with some dispute the best. Although not scary, the director helps create and eerie feeling and a terrifying atmosphere. Great movie with a lot of excellent scenes. Funny at times and violent at many times Evil Dead is a great watch. You gotta love the chainsaw parts (for another great chainsaw scene, watch BRAINDEAD which is very similar to Evil Dead with the whole Zombie thing)",10,1,2,25 December 1999
From Dusk Till Dawn," LIKE A ROLLERCOASTER!!
","Okay this film is really strange. It starts off as a action type flick, with two brother criminals on the run. the steal a a van and take a family hostage and are on their way to mexico. When they get to mexico and to a bar called the titty twisters, all hell breaks lose when they find everyone are vampires at the bar. From there on it's a blood bath, with gore and violence every second. When making this film I don't think they were planning on keeping to the rules of killing vampires as many things were wrong in the movie if you listen to the other movies that is. I lived the dialogue in the movie like all Tarrntino movies have. i especially liked the Gecko brothers dialogue(especially Seth) and the owner of the titty twisters when they first arrived at the bar. Robert Rodriguez directing was a plus, with an all-star line up George Clooney, Harvey Kietel, Quentin Tarantino, Juliette Lewis, Salma Hayek make for a interesting watch. It's a very exciting watch, much like a rollercoaster with twists and turns everywhere. EVEN THOUGH IT WAS STRANGE I LOVED IT!!",10,0,0,23 December 1999
Psycho," A MUST SEE!!
","Psycho is a classic, and a great watch. I t may not be the best movie like many people have claimed, the movie isn't very scary and the shower scene is very quick and over in a few seconds, but I guess it was made in the 60's when nothing like this had ever been done before. Yes I enjoyed it very much and I was thinking the whole way through. Anthony Perkins plays the role of Norman great, his friendly smiles, his comments his speeches 'We all go a little mad sometimes') and just his general acting, the way he walked and moved. The story is Janet Leigh steals some money from her boss and takes off in her car to go to another city for the weekend. She stops off during a stormy night for a stay at the Bates Motel, run by Norman Bates. She gets into the shower in her room, but never comes out. Janet's family come looking for her, questioning all the places in the area, and they are curious about the Bates motel, for Norman isn't normal, and his loveable mother who sits in the house behind the hotel, isn't so loveable either. I long running time, but every second of it was needed and worth it. A must see!!",5,3,14,28 December 1999
Scream 2," AN ENJOYABLE WATCH!!
","Like the original it was a fun watch, but not as good. not as many horror movie references used in this one as Scream 1. The story is almost the same as the original with Sidney being chased again. Again the killers were to clumsy and tripped over to much. But in another way that shows that they are normal people. The story is 2 years after the first movie, Sidney Prescott has gone to college, she's got a new boyfriend and she's started a new life. But then people start dropping dead around her, and someone is making those calls again. Who is it this time? Enjoyable watch but don't expect too much from Scream 2, just expect to have an enjoyable watch.",8,0,0,28 December 1999
Scream," HIGHLY OVER-RATED!!
","I watched this before I started watching horror films and when I saw it, I thought it was highly entertaining. But now that I have watched many horror movie I've realized it's not all that original. The movie hasn't got much violence and gore and no great killing through the film (the one in the garage, was cool) The phone calls were good, but the calls in lack Christmas were so much better cause the killer was crazy and he wanted to let the person know on the phone that he was crazy and he was after her. I also didn't like the killers, because they were too clumsy and got their butts kicked by Sidney, you don't see Jason or Michael tripping over things and getting beaten by a girl. The movie trivia was a good add and very original. The story is It is a year since Sidney Prescott's mother was raped and murdered, now someone that has a fascination for horror movies is killing people close to Sidney. But who is it? Overall the movie is a fun watch, but people who say it is the best and so violent must not watch many horror movies because there is much more worst stuff out there and a lot of that stuff Scream ripped off. Highly over-rated.",8,0,0,28 December 1999
Halloween," One Of The Best horror Movies Ever Made!!
","Halloween is one of the best horror movies ever made. It doesn't rely on the gore and blood like many other 70's and 80's slasher films but relies on a terrifying atmosphere. The best of the entire series. Michael Myers the second best movie killer after Jason Voorhees. Although he doesn't kill as much Michael is a very smart killer. This is a most see and I recommend it to everyone a true John Carpenter masterpiece. One of Jamie Lee Curtis', many slasher films. Also check her out in The Fog, Terror Train, Prom Queen and Road Games (I think that's what it's called).",10,0,0,10 December 1999
Carrie," NO WAY THIS IS SCARY!!
","Come on how can you say Carrie is the scariest movie of all time. Not only is it not scary it is so, so boring. Up until the prom I was trying to keep myself awake. It's the classic tale of geek gets picked geek takes revenge out on her classmates. Sissy Spacek was great as Carrie but you can't say the movie was scary. There was the other protective mother, who's over enthusiastic religious beliefs wouldn't to make you sick. (she scream at Carrie for having her period) Don't listen to people who say this is the best horror movie of all time, there isn't any horror in it until the last 20 minutes the movie is just depressing!",4,2,11,23 December 1999
The Sixth Sense," NOT THAT GREAT!!
","I don't know about anyone else but The Sixth Sense wasn't that good. Good performance by Haley and pretty good by Willis and Collette but other than that the movie isn't that good. Alright the three dead bodies in Haley's house were pretty cool. The twist ending, before i saw it all I heard about was this big twist ending and while watching it I thought well isn't this obvious. When he's sitting with toni collette she doesn't even look at him like he is not there, in the restaurant his wife just looks around, and once you add up all these things you realize hey he must be.............. watch it and see. I don't know but maybe all the hype surrounding the film wrecked it like so many other movie that have made it big in the US before they come to Australia.",8,0,0,28 December 1999
A Nightmare on Elm Street," BEST OF THE LOT!!!!!!
","The best of the lot! i must admit I'm not a big fan of the Nightmare On Elm Street Series or Freddy Kruger. But to my surprise I found this movie to be a highly entertaining horror movie. From Wes Craven comes a classic that must be seen, a mixture of blood and gore and suspenseful scenes combines for a top rate movie. A killer in dreams stalking teenagers does not go by me well, as i am a fan of the killers like Michael Myers and Jason Voorhess, but after watching NOES i opened my mind and realized that Wes Craven had started a franchise which has the possibility for unlimited amount of sequels.",9,0,1,22 December 1999
