Requiem for a Dream," Move over DARE...
","After seeing this movie, I believe that the DARE program in school should be cancelled, and they should just show the kids this movie.  This movies accentuates the severity of addiction in all of its forms with extreme grace and style.  It makes you think and effects in a way that most movies can't. The cinematography is superb, thanks to Aronofsky.  One word to describe this film: Wow.",Null,0,0,13 December 2002
