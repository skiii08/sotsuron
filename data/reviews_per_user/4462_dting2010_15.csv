Skyfall," Only For True Bond Fans
","To me, this has the feel of old school James Bond. It goes back to the days of Connery, full of class and style. By far, one of Craig's best. If amongst his brooding demeanor, he brings a certain vulnerability to the role. It also brings a classy ending to a lifelong movie history relationship.",8,4,7,4 August 2018
Iron Man 3," Easily a 9 if not for the plot twist
","This movie started out to possibly be the best of the trilogy. The flashbacks, Guy Pearce, Ben Kingsley all made this movie something to watch. It showcases the human side and vulnerability of Stark. However, the ridiculous plot twist in the middle of the movie turns the whole movie into a comedy. Still better than Iron Man 2 though.",7,0,0,10 November 2018
Gravity," Gritty, visually spectacular and well acted
","I am always a little leery about seeing movies in 3-D because I have issues with motion sickness. But I sucked it up and saw in IMAX 3-D. Let me tell you from the start, this is the only way Gravity should be seen. From the opening scene, you will almost feel a sense of weightlessness in your theater seat. It is so much greater with the depth you feel in 3-D. The director does such a great job of switching between the awesomeness and openness of space and Earth to the claustrophobia that Bullock senses inside her own space suit. I will admit there are scenes during the movie that could have been moved along a little more swiftly. Believe me, those short respites from action in the film are welcomed. Most of the movie is a white-knuckle, edge of your seat thrill ride. Like others have said, Cloonie plays little more than a supporting role to Bullock. However, his 'character' is well-scripted and supports Bullock superbly. I have never viewed Bullock in a more gripping and introspective role. Not only does she have to deal with her physical surroundings, but she has to face down her own mental and emotional demons as well. For parents, there are a few swear words throughout the film, including a very quick F word. Also, Bullock is shown in a few scenes with little more than underwear and a t shirt on. This is a great movie and maybe the best movie in this decade.",8,4,10,6 October 2013
Aquaman," Ohhh, no no
","What a disappointment. This is the reason why I'm a Marvel fan. Aquaman was so cheesy, corny, and over the top. The introduction of Black Manta was completely superfluous to the movie. It was derivative of so many other movies (Clash of the Titans, Tron, Thor, Avatar, Moana, among others). I wish I'd gone to Spider-Man instead.",5,2,3,7 January 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," The Lord of Thunder!
","Forget the naysayers and go see this film. To me, it was a combination of Guardians of the Galaxy, The Hunger Games and Tron. Is there a deep and meaningful plot that connects this film with the rest of the Marvel movies? No, not really. It is just fun, funny and action packed. The soundtrack is pretty epic. Also, don't forget to stay for the credits. I have to say that this was a great kickoff to the holiday movie season.",9,2,8,3 November 2017
Man of Steel," What were they thinking???
","I actually debated a while before rating this movie even a six. I always knew Snyder had an over-the-top style with his directing, but this went miles and miles over the proverbial top. The total and utter carnage of this movie will make you feel like road kill when its all said and done. I just wish Costner and Crowe hadn't been associated with a film like this one. It was a total waste of their acting prowess. All Snyder seemed to worry about was how to 'up' his next explosion and/or fighting sequence. I kept thinking, by the end of the movie, what did Superman actually 'save' (and not destroy)?? Amy Adams character might as well have been deleted from the movie altogether. She served, through poor screen writing and directing, no purpose whatsoever. I don't worry about Affleck playing Batman in the next installment. I worry about Snyder directing it again. I think he needs to take a lesson from Superman and fly away.",6,1,3,1 March 2014
Dunkirk," Some Movies Deserve a Second Look. Dunkirk Does Not!
","As a huge Nolan fan, I was stoked to see this the first time in theaters. From the very beginning, this film is a confused and jumbled mess. Even with a miniscule synopsis on screen at the start, I had no clue what was happening, who these men were or where they were trying to go. There was also no particular character development. Tom Hardy was completely underutilized in the film. I just tried watching it again on television. However, nothing had changed. Nolan has so many great movies, so just skip this one.",3,2,4,31 July 2018
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Brawn and Brains
","After Avengers and the Captain America movies, I figured every other movie in the 'superhero' genre would pale in comparison. Wow, was I ever wrong. I went with my 65 year old father who usually despises anything Sci-Fi. After the movie was over, he had thoroughly enjoyed it! This movie has so many underlying themes of redemption, sacrifice and friendship. However, it also blends nicely into a high-octane Summer action blockbuster. It is quite refreshing to go to a movie with the right mix of both. I don't like feeling like I've come out of a knock down drag out with someone. Go see it today, I promise you will not be disappointed.",9,0,0,25 May 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," The best mission to date.
","Not only is the cinematography great with outstanding special effects, but the story gets more suspenseful than all the other movies combined.",8,1,1,25 July 2018
The Dark Knight," Best Movie Ever
","Forget best superhero movie ever, this film should always be considered among the best movies ever. It is a cinematic perfect storm. Firstly, there is (and probably always will be) one of the premier directors in Hollywood, Christopher Nolan. Pretty much everything he's had a hand in has turned to gold. Then, you bring in a young and brilliant actor like Heath Ledger to portray the Joker we all needed. His portrayal of a truly maniacal, homicidal mad man honestly harkens back to what he was meant to be.",10,0,1,17 July 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Nothing to Write Home About
","First, don't get me wrong. It was definitely a visually stunning movie with the same light-hearted characters we all came to love in Volume 1. However, things all seemed a little forced and cheesy in the second volume. I thought, personally, there could have been a little bit more action and less expository between the characters. I am all about character development, but every scene seemed to be another sad sob story with another one of the characters. Also, in the end, it never really seemed like the universe ever needed saving.",7,1,3,7 May 2017
Kong: Skull Island," Yawn
","Whomever said they saw this movie and thought it was 'fun' evidently did not see the same movie I did. To me, it was a very forgettable movie. There was absolutely no plot, character development or chemistry between the actors. The only saving graces for the movie were King Kong, Tom Huddleston and Brie Larson.",6,1,3,28 April 2017
Arrival," A Different Kind of Sci-fi Movie
","The best way I could describe this movie as a combination of the Day the Earth Stood Still and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. It is certainly not your typical 'blow-em up shoot-em up' movies like Independence Day or Transformers. It has a continual ethereal feel throughout and definitely thought provoking. Do I think it's an epic and life-altering movie? Not hardly. However, as a sci-fi fan, it should definitely be on your watchlist.",7,1,1,20 January 2019
Wonder Woman," DC's Best-Wonder Woman
","I, first, cannot begin to imagine why so many negative reviews are out there for this film. I am, usually, a total Marvel fan. However, this movie has started to change my mind in the wake of the other awful films DC has tried. I think they could not have picked a better person and actress to portray this role than Gal Gadot. She can be such a positive role model. The fight scenes are incredible and so are her moves. I disagree, also, that there was no character development shown in the movie. What about the whole beginning of the movie on the island, showing her as a girl growing into a great Amazon warrior? One slight downside was the portrayal of the villain. He was a bit underwhelming, in my opinion.",9,11,22,6 September 2017
Mother!," What the hell did i just watch???
","Have you ever had a dream where you're trying to get somewhere and can't? That's the storyline/direction of this movie. There is so much going, mostly going unexplained. Bardem and Lawrence's characters are so incompetent and inept. Frankly, a genre this director shouldn't be doing.",2,0,1,6 September 2018
