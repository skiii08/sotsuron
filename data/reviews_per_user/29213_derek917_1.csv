Ford v Ferrari," Motor racing movie that should appeal to many.
","Although based on the true events leading up to, and during, the 1966 Le Mans 24 hour race, there are quite a few inaccuracies in the story told here. For most people though, this is an enjoyable movie as Bale and Damon are on top form. Motor racing fans will love the racing scenes with good close up action featuring legendary Fords, Ferraris, and Porsches. At around two and a half hours, the overall pace should have been a bit faster, after all it is about racing! As always, many reviews here on IMDB make interesting reading, just don't believe the very negative ones.",8,1,1,13 April 2020
