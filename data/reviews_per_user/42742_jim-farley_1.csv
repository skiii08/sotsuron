Sucker Punch," Looked like a blast... ended up being a whole lot more. (spoilers at bottom)
","First off, I'll say I would have given this movie an 8 except, having seen it 4 times now, I keep seeing new stuff every time. It remains a not-quite-solved riddle. I don't mean I'm seeing props or action I had missed before; I mean I'm seeing more and more what the writer's really getting at. What's even better is the mind-'frying' never lets up. I still don't know whether to feel happy or sad about the ending! To me, that's a sign of a film's greatness.I'm a big fan of mind'fry' movies, I'll admit. But this one is special. It's like a huge, drawn-out sleight-of-hand trick. You will almost certainly be looking in the wrong direction for most of the film the first time through, but it was meant to be experienced that way. This ain't no action flick with hot chicks blowing stuff up, but it plays one on TV.As I mentioned, I'm still not entirely sure of the ending. Way too much symbolism to take it at face value! One thing I will encourage you to do is: watch the extended version, if you have the chance. It fills in a few bothersome gaps, and has a really fun musical number added.I knew this was going to be a film I would love forever from the moment I heard the opening note of 'Army of Me' during Baby Doll's first dance. If you enjoy mind'fry' movies, or drama, or action films, or comic book adaptations, put Sucker Punch on your short list. Oh, and one more thing: keep your eyes open!*EDIT* *SPOILER ALERT* I read some of the other reviews of this film, and decided I should go ahead and add some spoilers, because without them, you might not know WHY you need to see this.I'm a student of psychology and human behavior. What's going on here, is that Sweet Pea is telling her story, but the story starts with something happening to her 'Angel'. I am not sure, but I think Baby Doll and Rocket (as well as Amber and Blondie) are repressed aspects of Sweet Pea's personality. I think Sweet Pea is Schizophrenic in a big way. Probably due to trauma. None of the girls have names that make any sense. You expect a girl named Rocket to be hot stuff, right? She's not so much. You expect a girl named Amber to be anything but East Asian. You expect Sweet Pea to be sweet, but she's not! She's mean and fearful. Blondie's not a blonde, and Baby Doll is the only one with a name that makes sense, but only as an OBJECT. That's why I'm thinking that Baby Doll is the persona used to interact with the outside world. The clue is in the ending of the extended version. After the lobotomy, Sweet Pea gets on the bus (with a character from the fantasy world) and rides past a sign that says 'Paradise Diner' (there are a lot of uses of the word 'paradise' in here). Also, one of the movie posters says 'My dream is yours' and several say 'Gold diggers'. Sweet Pea, as they say, is gone, baby!",10,18,30,11 November 2011
