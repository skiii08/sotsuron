3:10 to Yuma," Western with a moral
","I loved this movie , it was all interesting from the beginning to the end . But in addition to the action typical of any western , this movie also touched on some philosophical ideas . While you watch think about what the real distinction between Good and Bad is . It is a movie about love too , the love between a parent and a child and just how precious family can be . You will see manhood challenged by the survival instinct , as a dangerous shot at glory is measured against a safe easy and prosperous yet cowardly outcome . Even though many of the attitudes described are clearly impossible impractical and idealistic , yet it is a reminder of how we like to think people , men can be and why we like to think that . Pure adrenaline action coupled with a nice romance . Excellent acting . I recommend you watch this movie many times , it's that much fun .",9,1,3,15 November 2007
Hereditary," Unnerving but not really scary
","I don't get what all the hype is about. I watched the movie and while I found the story interesting, although difficult to follow or understand at times, I can't recall being really 'horrified' at any point. You know, like when you think to yourself, 'Maybe I shouldn't be watching this at night alone.' (That is my yardstick and I think it is as reliable as they come.) 
Like so many others said, the characters do things that seem so implausible that not only make it hard to relate to them, at some points I found myself disliking them.
Just an average scary story in my opinion, so I give it a 5.",5,0,1,5 September 2018
2012," Orgy of awesome effects
","I gave this 9 out of 10 because of pure entertainment value i just came back from watching it some scenes left my heart racing , other times i was covering my head ! I sat close to the screen so maybe thats why it was almost scary sometimes . Anyway I can honestly say it was one of the best 9 dollars I ever spent ! Also for this movie I think watching the DVD would not even come close to the cinema experience . The effects were just so realistic ! What I didn't like was the excess emotionality and impractical actions and when they trade common sense for the drama and suspense . Suffice it to say I did not feel the time going by and the movie just keeps you waiting for the next scene and some comedy here and there also added a lot to the whole experience . Its been a long time since I enjoyed a movie so much . Judging from how entertained I was I do not think 9 is too much . I recommend you go see it !",9,2,10,13 November 2009
