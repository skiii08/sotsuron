Black Panther," Just more hype
","People seem to like this because they say first mostly black film etc. But no blackbfilms been around for decades and mostly always have a white geezer following behind
As in this
It's mr freeman's turn and it seems we're sort on us actors as he was supposed to be a American
Y not just keep him British or even get someone else. But then I remembered I think marvel have used most American actors alreadyI def expected more action only action last around ten min in Korea 
Go watch Andy lau films better action in South Korea all thru 
To me people just scared of saying don't like it
I'm not
Reminds me when I was in USA when avatar came out everyone goin on how grt it was I walked out of cinema thinking what a waste of three hrs and never watched again how he conned studios to make 2-3-4 lol
Well it's like this with marvel we all like comic book movies but getting to many I mean pt 1-2-3 etc y not do Thor 4 hrs or avengers 4 hrs with break in between like yrs back Bollywood do. But no BECAUSE they want us lot to listen to PAID reviewers and press and waste our money it's s scam tbh needs stopping rt IMDb all dodgy scores but get away with it
I for one would welcome a independent review
Most press screenings they get Little keep sakes now I wonder what's in them I really do
But watch enjoy but don't expect to much if u like it grt if you don't its grt again",6,3,8,8 March 2018
