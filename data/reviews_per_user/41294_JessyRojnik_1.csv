The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Favorite movie of all time
","This film has changed my life, if I could compare myself with a movie it was this. Sometimes you feel bad, sometimes good,but when I watch this film gives me a sense of relief again. Every time I cry at different times. I help myself with it to let go emotionally. I really loved the book, but the characters were so perfect for each roll. Sometimes i wish i could have friends or even someone that share the mind of me. ( with this movie and the feeling i got when i watch it. and also why i watch it ( and so much ) it really hits me every time. it makes me feel so much at once. my favorite movie.I am proud to be a wallflower.",10,1,2,19 October 2016
