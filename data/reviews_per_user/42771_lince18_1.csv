Blade Runner 2049," Not a Sequel just a remake changing dates
","What do you get for your money, and lots of time, watching this picture? not a sequel, it's the worst thing about this movie, they sold it as if it was a sequel, but it's only a remake ( and not a good one). It has nearly the same argument, Blade Runner chasing a special replicant, the same end, Replicant dies being more human than most humans and Deckard goes away with the girl, and thousand of copied winks from the original 1982 movie.But we're not in 1982, and what then was fresh and new, today are abused clich√©s, and technical improvements could not fill the gap between a master piece of cinema, and a 'cheap' remake",6,4,9,12 October 2017
