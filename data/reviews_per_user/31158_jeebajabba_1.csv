The Longest Yard," fantastic and cheesy
","this film is great for people like me, who like American football but live somewhere else, and, if you like Adam Sndler and Chris rock, look no further. Right well i guess you understand this is about football, and its quite a revenge story. i mean, come on, inmates .v. guards. it was always going to be good and i will certainly but it myself. Hmmm well there are some brilliant scenes of football here, some hard hits for you guys out there like me. Adam Sandler is witty and brilliant, and he is a credit to the film. And well, when i saw Nelly in it, I knew it was going to be great!!!!!! And as for the cheerleaders, what can I say, it has to be seen to be believed. Peace out",8,1,2,3 February 2006
