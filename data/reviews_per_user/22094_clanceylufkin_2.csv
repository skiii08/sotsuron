Deja Vu," Rock video editing and impossibly improbable
",This movie is a two hour music video. Jerky so called documentary style shooting and an edit every 8 frames or so. Even an epileptic experiencing a seizure could hold a camera steadier then what's presented here. I'm not sure if it's the ego of the D.O.P. the editor or the director that for so long this style of film making has been popular. Get over it folks....move on...this is a completely hackneyed look. So much of the viewers attention is brought to what's going on behind the camera instead of what's going on in front of it. To compliment this style of shooting you will find included a music score that never stops. I understand why though....this movie is so poorly put together that without it dictating how we should be feeling at any given moment we'd be completely emotionally nonplussed.I almost walked out on this film but I was hoping that with so many apparent holes in the plot line that it would somehow miraculously pull itself together with a surprise ending that would at least bring some intelligence to the film. It doesn't.The movie is dedicated to the spirit of the people in New Orleans. I think they could have done without this vote of confidence.I give it a two because I did for a few moments find myself enjoying the movie but ultimately the premise of the movie is so retarded that it was impossible to suspend my disbelief.,2,10,20,9 February 2007
Horrible Bosses," I think I've seen about 300 movies like this.
","I didn't absolutely hate this movie. For the most part the characters will well played and the heros likable. The problem for me is that the type of humor that is used in Horrible Bosses has had its day. What attempts to be edgy and shocking is hackneyed and all used up. There's nothing new anymore about bodily function humor . At one point it would make you squirm in your seat because it was uncomfortable, broke social standards and was funny because of it. The only squirming I was doing in this movie was being embarrassed for the fine cast that had to act their way through this tiresome affair.",Null,0,0,15 July 2011
