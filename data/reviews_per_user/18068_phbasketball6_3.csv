Casablanca," Possibly the Greatest Romance Movie of All-Time
","One of the best romance movies of all-time. Casablanca made Humphrey Bogart a top star in Hollywood and Ingrid Bergman a respectable actress. Claude Rains is also great in the movie and is an important character. Michael Curtiz, who I believe is one of the greatest directors of all-time, directs this the same year as Yankee Doodle Dandy. Curtiz direction was flawless and the close-ups mainly on Bergmann shown the emotions were great. The cinematography was astounding which makes the viewer seem like they're in the room. Despite the screenplay not being 100% realistic and believable, I don't think anyone cares because of how well and effective the movie is. The dialog is one of the best in cinema history which contains many famous quotes. This movie shows how important romance, friendship, and politics could be. The beginning introduces Rick (Bogart) who owns 'Rick's Café Américain' which is a nightclub and a place for gambling located in Casablanca which is in Northern Africa.. Usually the Vichy French, Italian, and Nazi officials go there. Rick looks like a professional businessman but seems depress for a reason we do not know. Ugarte (Peter Lorre), a petty criminal, arrives in Rick's club with 'letters of transit' obtained through the murder of two German couriers. The papers allow the person to travel freely around German-controlled Europe and to neutral Portugal, and from there to America. Ugarte plans to make his money by selling them to the highest bidder. However that does not work out according to plan and Rick ends up with the letters. Eventually Ilsa (Bergman) comes in with a man and Sam (Dooley Wilson) notices this and is not thrilled. She asks if Rick is there and Sam doesn't her to see Rick. She tells Sam to play 'As Time Goes By.' Sam seeming like he doesn't want to plays it anyway which angers Rick. Rick then realizes Ilsa is there and seems upset and happy at the same time. It is realized that the man with her was her husband Victor Laszlo (Henreid). Laszlo is refugee that is trying to go to America. Later that night Rick seems really upset about seeing her again and Sam tries to comfort him. While they are talking flashbacks are shown about Rick and Ilsa as lovers in Paris. While in Paris Rick had to flee and Ilsa plans to go with him however the minute that he leaves Sam gives him the letter from her saying she won't. Ilsa basically broke Rick's heart but now needs help along with her husband. Many viewers question who is going to get Ilsa, Rick or Victor? Is Rick going to help Ilsa after what she did to him?",10,2,3,5 May 2013
Apocalypse Now," Greatest War Film of All-Time
","Best war film and the best of 1979. Even the filming of Apocalypse Now was a war with the many production problems it had. Francis Ford first asked Roger Corman for his opinion on shooting at the Philippines with Corman responding, 'Don't Go.' At first the film starred Harvey Keitel but due to arguments with Coppola he was fired. Then Martin Sheen was hired for the part and later on had a massive heart-attack. A typhoon also ruined the film's production and set them behind schedule. Also Marlon Brando arrived at the set late to admit that he never read the 'Heart of Darkness' and was overweight. Coppola even threatened suicide a couple of times and lost 100 pounds while filming. Even though Apocalypse Now had many production issues, Coppola didn't give up and made it which turned out to be one of the greatest movies ever.The beginning of the movie starts off with Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) being drunk and troubled. He is assigned to find Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has gone AWOL. Willard is told that Kurtz has gone insane and is commanding a group of his own Montagnard troops. He is also told to terminate with extreme prejudice. Willard and his crew take off in the search of Kurtz and encounter many things on the way.This film shows the glory yet sadistic side of war with the Robert Duvall part playing 'The Ride of the Valkyries' in the helicopter scene, forcing people to surf, and giving his speech stating that he wishes that war never ends. It also shows the mentally endorsed pain that the war can give you with the Marlon Brando part.The direction was amazing by Coppola; it's his best work besides The Godfather films. Coppola did an outstanding job filming a bloated Brando to make him seem stronger and thinner by avoiding his belly, making him wear black and filming him in the shadows. The cinematography was also at an all-time best especially at the night scenes.The screenplay was amazing and the ending had a good twist to it. The acting by Sheen, Brando, Duvall, a young Fishburne, Hopper, Forrest, and Glenn was amazing. This film made Martin Sheen a notable actor, was one of Duvall's best performances and started Fishburne's acting career.",10,0,1,5 May 2013
The Godfather," One of the Greatest Films of All-Time
","One of the best films ever. After winning an Oscar for Patton, Francis Ford Coppola became notable in Hollywood. The Godfather, Francis Ford's masterpiece, places him on the map as a respectable director. The direction was great by Coppola and the adapted screenplay by Coppola and Puzo was amazing. The wedding scene in the beginning introduces the characters and shows their importance.Don Vito Correlone (Brando) is by far the most respected character in this movie. This is shown in the beginning during the wedding of his daughter when follow Sicilian?s pay their respects to him and asking for favors. Vito shows a moral life when he feels disrespected when a family friend decided to go to the police first. He also shows moral when he is against drugs because it's a crime with victims.Michael Corelone (Pacino) who is Don Vito's youngest son seems to be a nice and noble kid especially when he is treated like a war hero and seem to be a protagonist. Michael seems to not be interested to be a part of the 'business' but later on it seems like he was force to. Towards the end of the film when Michael lies to his sister and wife and closes door on his wife it seemed like it was the beginning of a new villain within Michael.Sonny (Caan) who is Don Vito's eldest son seems to be the next Don. However, he has his flaws especially being known as short-tempered and eager. He flaws would soon affect him and the chances of becoming the next Don.The middle child which seems to be the least important one is Fredo. Fredo (Cazale) is the child that seems not to gain any respect from anyone within the family. He is also known as the 'weak' one within the family.Tom Hagen (Duvall) who is the Don's adopted son is the right hand man for the family and he is the brains for them with all of the connections.The only daughter in the family is Connie (Shire), she is nice and tired of the mafia life and she is extremely gullible. She marries an abusive person but is gullible enough to stay with him and defend him.Kay (Keaton) who is Michael's girlfriend gets pushed around starting when Michael says he would never get involved with his families work but as we all know this isn't true. Michael's work for the family slowly tears apart his relationship with Kay. The ending of the film can easily be considered the greatest with Michael becoming the 'Godfather' in two different ways.This movie shows the life of a Mafia man, the scary and painful times. The acting by the whole cast with the likes of Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan, Cazale, Keaton, and Shire was amazing and was one the best of performances by them in their careers. Brando himself put up one of the greatest performances by an actor ever. Pacino has his best performance in his career which also starts it off.",10,1,3,5 May 2013
