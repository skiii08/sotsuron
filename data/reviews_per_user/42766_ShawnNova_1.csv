Scarface," This movie is great
","This movie has no flaws! its great in every aspect and i wonder why Imdb doesnt put it in the top 250 Al pacino doesnt only play Tony Montana, He is him i have bought this movie and watch it a lot... The way his foundation falls in the final 20 minutes is breathtaking, when he kills manny is just pure sad, and when Gina wants to kill him is really cool! The ending IS the BEst ending in movie history by far! Great!",10,1,3,7 May 2004
