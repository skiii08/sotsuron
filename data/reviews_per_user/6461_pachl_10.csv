Changeling," The 'Good Old Days' of movie making are right now!
","There is a hauntingly beautiful song called 'Dark Side Of Your Soul', sung by the under-rated singer, Kiki Dee. Part of the lyrics say, 'If you never know the darker side, you'll never see the light --- of your soul.' This past week I have seen the dark and the light. The movie 'Australia' was a clunker. It reminded me of the cloyingly morose songs sung by Celine Dion, who suffocates every line with sobbing, carefully-crafted sincerity. 'Australia' should have been a magnificent movie, but it lacks any warmth; instead it relies on the kind of plastic, manufactured sincerity that we saw in other clunkers like 'Pearl Harbor'.'Changeling' is the complete opposite. I was transfixed. What was happening on the screen commanded my total attention. Mrs. Collins' anguish became my own. I wanted her to find her son every bit as much as she did.'Changeling' is based on a true story about Christine Collins, a California woman whose son was abducted in 1928. Right from the start, you feel her anguish, and the frustration of not knowing where her son is, nor whether he is alive or dead.One of the elements of brilliance in this movie is how plausible everything is. Mrs. Collins is not just fighting the agony of losing her son, but also battling against the incredibly corrupt L.A.P.D. who see her as an embarrassment to the police force. When the public attention becomes too great a liability for the L.A.P.D. they have her sent to a psychiatric ward. This part was absolutely chilling, because it showed how completely helpless she was when everyone is part of the conspiracy of silence. No matter what she does, she cannot prevail.Angelina Jolie has to walk a tightrope of sorts in this movie. She is strong-willed, but she is not some ultimately invincible, puffed up superwoman that can single-handedly take on the whole world, and especially not this world, which is rife with corruption.At the end of 'Changeling' you learn if there was a happy reuniting of mother and son. Since I have chosen not to write any 'spoilers', you'll have to see the movie for yourself to know the answer. And that will be time very well spent because this movie truly is like the golden age of film making.**Addition added January 16, 2009** I first started writing these reviews in 2005. Sometimes three years went by without even one thumbs up or down on a review. So now I just regularly ask people to rate it. I'm just curious how many people read these reviews.",10,6,9,10 January 2009
Requiem for a Dream," Forget horror flicks.... this movie will REALLY SCARE YOU !!!
","I once saw a movie reenactment of Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. At the end of this short, yet powerful speech, there was no applause. People were so profoundly touched by the wisdom and insight of his words that the whole crowd just stood there transfixed, like statues, in quiet awe and contemplation.This is how I felt after seeing 'Requiem For A Dream'.In this movie, four people get involved with drugs. At first, drugs actually appear to be improving their lives. I thought this was going to be a lighthearted, pro-drug movie. However, that is just a clever lure because soon after, drug use takes a very, very ugly turn in these peoples' lives.Just as 'Fatal Attraction' would make someone think twice about cheating on their spouse, 'Requiem For A Dream' will probably scare the hell out of anyone, whether they have taken drugs or not. It's like seeing 'Jaws', and never again being able to dive into the ocean without a little tinge of fear.If High Schools showed this movie, drug use would plummet. The effect of seeing these lives forever and completely ruined by drugs is shocking and tragic. You will never think about drug use the same way again.Forget horror flicks.... this movie will REALLY SCARE YOU !!!",9,0,1,19 November 2005
John Wick," A rebirth for Keanu Reeves as an actor
","Let's be blunt: film snobs, along with many regular movie-going fans, think that Keanu Reeves' acting is, to put it mildly, a bit wooden. For those who thought he was a mediocre actor at best should see John Wick. It's proof Reeves has drastically improved as an actor.I read a 'professional' review in which the film critic still lambasted Reeves' 'robotic demeanor'. That is absolute nonsense. I was so intrigued when I saw the trailer for this movie. Immediately it struck me that Keavu Reeves seemed to absolutely own this role. But that was just short outtakes. Could he really be that good in the whole movie?Easy answer: yes.John Wick is a revenge thriller. He's emotionally wounded from the untimely death of his wife from some undisclosed illness. The son of a Russian crime boss makes the tragic mistake of attacking John Wick and killing his dog. We have no idea up to this point that John Wick is legendary as a killer. Ruthless and skilled, everyone fears him.No apology is sufficient for what was done to him so he embarks on a mission to kill the crime boss' son. As always happens in movies of this genre, John Wick is always outnumbered by ten to one, and yet he kills everyone in his path to revenge and keeps moving forward.Although at the end there was some dopiness to the plot, Keanu Reeves was stellar. He was focused, not wooden. He was dynamic, not robotic.We've seen a younger Keanu Reeves do comedy. He had some great successes. We saw him in Dracula, and wish we hadn't. We've seen him in near-misses like A Walk In The Clouds, that failed in no way due to him (he was excellent) but in cheap, sappy plot points that tried to bring an emotional closure.Now we see him clearly back in the game. I would love to see Keanu Reeves do something risky now; maybe take a chance on a comedy. It's clear he is up to it. His reputation as an actor should greatly improve after this rock solid performance.",7,8,20,24 October 2014
Dawn of the Dead," This movie proves the cinema experience dwarfs that of TV!
","If you're reading this review, you probably already know the general plot: an unexplained plague has created incredibly fast, strong, rabidly hungry flesh-eating zombies. The few human survivors take refuge in a shopping mall.Rather that describe the movie, let me tell you how it affected me, because the true test of cinema is if it made an emotional impact on you. Keep in mind that movie makers have an almost impossible task. Nowadays, we're all jaded movie goers. Seeing realistic dinosaurs, or spaceships hurtling through space often elicit yawns, not wide-eyed amazement.I saw Dawn of the Dead at a 10:30pm show on a Sunday night. When I left the theatre, it was pitch black, and my heart was pounding in my chest. Even though I am a very rational person, I couldn't overcome an overwhelming sense of fear. Just like a little kid who sees his first monster movie, I was scared and deeply affected.When I opened my car, I made sure that no one was hiding in the back seat (yes, that is ridiculous, but is shows what an astoundingly strong impression the movie had on me). I drove home in complete silence. I kept the radio off, and I drove through the blackness and the empty streets common after midnight on a Sunday in suburbia.I drove quietly down the same street I had been 10,000 times before, but very oddly, there was a police car sitting next to a cul-de-sac. In 30 years of driving, I had never seen a police car there. The lights were off, so I couldn't discern anything in the blackness. The first thought that went through my head was whether the policman inside was still alive, or already a zombie. Perhaps his partner was already feasting on his corpse. (What am I thinking??!! This is ridiculous. Get that movie out of your head. Pay attention to the road and just get home.)When I arrived home, it actually occurred to me that if I used the garage door opener, I would alert any zombies in the area that living people are in the house (mental note to self: stop! This is ridiculous. It's just a movie. It's just a movie. It's just a movie.) When I closed the door behind me, I made sure no one slipped in at the last moment. I walked carefully to the dark, unlit landing and........ pow!!!! A light bulb met a noisy, flashbulb type death as it burnt out. That scared the hell out of me, as if my heart weren't racing enough.As I walked through the kitchen, it occurred to me how vulnerable the house would be to a zombie attack. Too many windows. (another mental note: stop! Pull yourself together. It's just a movie) I closed my bedroom door, and did something I had never done in all the years I lived there: I locked it.If a movie can have this kind of effect on a normally unflappable adult, there is no question the movie accomplished what it set out to do: it scared the hell out of the audience.Note: Dawn of the Dead must be seen in a theatre to get the full experience. On TV, it's like watering down a beer. On TV, (even a nice big 50' plasma, all the doomsday visuals that previously astounded me seemed not only less impressive just whizzed right past me. In particular, the scene where they have retro-fitted a bus to make an escape. In the theatre, that scene looked like something out of Armageddon. It was awe-inspiring and awesome, rolled into one. On TV, the scene appeared to just race by me.",10,2,4,4 October 2007
City of God," 10 stars for this masterpiece!
","Some people shy away from foreign films because they:1) remember the (often) boring foreign films of the 1970s-1980s. 2) don't like reading subtitles 3) want some fluffy Hollwood escapist movie (forgetting that nine out of ten times they are disappointed)When I rented 'JFK', there was so much rapid-fire, complicated dialogue that I finally decided to turn on the English subtitles so I wouldn't miss any important detail. Ever since then, I realized that subtitles can actually enhance a movie. After a few minutes, you don't even realize you're reading anymore.Over the years, I have taken a dozen trips to Brazil, and in my estimation, this movie is an amazingly realistic depiction of life in the favelas (slums) of Rio de Janeiro. Some parts of that life seem really quite pleasant. It's not a depiction of abysmal poverty. Being poor in Rio doesn't necessarily mean sadness and despair. After all, these people do live in Rio de Janeiro, one of the most spectacularly beautiful and lively places on earth. You may not have much, but you can always go to the beach.That said, it still is heartbreaking to see how a clean, safe public housing site in Rio, so full of promise, degenerated into a chaotic nightmare of crime and death due to drug trafficking.However, don't think this movie is 'a downer'. It's a frequently riveting and intense film full of action, drama, and a bit of humor here and there. Other times, it is as laidback and carefree as the Carnival-loving, beach-going residents of Rio typically are.The story is narrated by a young boy, Buscape (whose nickname means 'Rocket'). His ticket out of slum life is by pursuing photography. From his perspective, we see how a once idyllic neighborhood is destroyed by gang violence, mainly due to fighting over the control of illegal drug sales.Even very young children, some only 7 or 8 years old are involved in horrific crimes, and others are the victims of crime. Some of these children seem to have no qualms about just killing anyone they dislike. They shoot someone dead, and laugh about it.If I wanted to convince someone to start watching foreign films, I would choose City of God as the best way to change their minds. It is not only one of the three best foreign films I've ever seen, but one of the most remarkable movies you'll ever see.I gave this movie 10 stars, and I don't think I've ever gone that high before!",10,1,4,5 November 2005
Gran Torino," Intelligent writing, great acting, interesting story
","From the Summary above you can already see this movie packs a 1-2-3 punch.I have a new perspective on movies ever since I moved to Europe (Czech Republic) two years ago. You would think that foreigners would mainly like action movies such as The Fast And The Furious, but the truth is, they are quite a bit more sophisticated.The American movies shown here in Prague are usually subtitled, not dubbed. As I'm listening to the dialogue, I'm also reading the Czech subtitles, and in this case, they were done quite well, which is surprising considering that there is A LOT of very hard-core slang used in the movie. None of it was lost on the audience. They were laughing unselfconsciously. They enjoyed the movie every bit as much as I did.The premise of the movie is very promising, and it certainly delivers on those promises: Clint Eastwood portrays a retired auto worker, a hard-talking, hard drinking guy who has just lost his wife. His new neighbors are Asian, and as an old-school man from the Midwest, he is not at all happy at the prospect of the neighborhood changing ethnically. But circumstances beyond his control induce him to change his perspective somewhat and his relationship with the new neighbors.You can guess a little what happens with the clash of cultures, but the more details I give you the less surprising the movie will be, so let's just leave the plot line with the simple sketch I've outlined above. What's important is that the movie is a combination of humor, drama, pathos, and a bit of tension thrown into the mix.No one lasts forever, and when Clint Eastwood someday passes away (we hope that occurs at some distant time in the future), this film will take its place as one of the big highlights of his career. I just came back from seeing the movie, and if someone asked me to see it again tomorrow, I'd accept the invitation immediately. Gran Torino is one of those rare films that is completely satisfying and makes you feel like the $10 you spent for a ticket was really a bargain.",9,1,5,11 April 2009
Mama," Movies like this give Hollywood a bad name!
","If you see this movie you are either desperate to get out of the house, or you're a fool. (if I had known what I do now, I would never have gone)Let me be frank: so many movies are just desperate attempts to catch the public's attention, and if they can accomplish that, actually having a decent movie is completely secondary. Independence Day suckered in tens of millions of people with a flashy trailer. Of course, the trailer was the best part of the movie.What's wrong with 'Mama'? It's such a tired re-tread of so many other movies, and one that just doesn't ring true as an 'authentic' story, one you could actually believe. It's so much like 'The Grudge' or 'The Eye'. The (over)-use of moths to represent evil was done just last year in the abominable movie, 'The Possession' (to the disgrace of Sam Raime).Another problem: we know very quickly what is happening so there is little real suspense, except for who will live and who will die. But since we can't buy into the story anyway, it doesn't matter very much.Too many movies act like if they add enough feathers, they can turn a sickly duck into a swan. In 'Mama' the only way to keep our interest is to use CGI... to death. Let's be honest: we know that CGI is CGI. It's not novel. It's not clever. It's desperation. It's fine when you want to show an army of 10,000. Then it can actually work well. But not in something like this where we know we are seeing lame computer animation. Enough already! Stop insulting the viewer's intelligence and sophistication. If this were 1960 you could get away with it. Not now.The central problems are redundancy and imitation. We know 'mama' is this bad, evil spirit. We know she will strike. But since 'mama' is a ridiculous CGI projection, we yawn. Imitation is the biggest culprit here. How many movies have we seen where a wrong was committed in the past and now the only way for the spirit to rest is for that wrong to be righted? This movie fails on so many levels. It's just so derivative or dozens of other movies that there is no point in watching.I gave this 2 stars. Looking back, I gave 'The Possession' 3. Probably should switch those ratings. Of the two, 'The Possession' was even lamer.",2,11,23,4 April 2013
Music and Lyrics," Charming, witty, and lighthearted comedy
","There are already 222 reviews of this movie, so the chances of anyone ever reading this are slim. However, I'm a sucker for a longshot. (so if you read this review, please give it a thumbs up or a thumbs down...I'm curious to know if anyone will ever read this, buried under more than 200 other reviews)When a friend suggested we rent this movie, my initial reaction was, 'NO!! It's a chick flick. And besides, it's got Hugh Grant in it. Those are two really big strikes against it.' However, and remember my fondness for longshots, the movie also casts Drew Barrymore in the other lead role. I couldn't resist.To my complete surprise, both actors were excellent, and Hugh Grant doesn't have a bad singing voice. To be honest, if he and Drew Barrymore wanted to record an album of pop songs, I think it could do quite well. Her strength is that she is perky and funny, and that compensates for lack of trained vocal talent. Sometimes you DON'T want to hear Barbra Streisand.Here's the quickie plot summary: Hugh Grant was in a popular band of the 1980s, and now he's reduced to playing for embarrassing venues like shopping malls, amusement parks, and High School reunions. When a Britney Spears-type singer wants him to write her new single, his life changes completely, but only due to Drew Barrymore's help.I now judge movies in part by how my European friends would react to them. I have to admit that some American movies are a little corny, but this movie passed the test with flying colors. A friend from Slovakia not only loved the movie, he insisted on watching the trailers and special scenes.... twice! It was a welcome relief to actually be proud of a Hollywood movie.I now have new-found respect for Hugh Grant, and my admiration for Drew Barrymore is higher than ever. She sure has a lot of talent for playing someone with pluck and a little bit of endearing wackiness.",10,321,352,3 September 2007
Final Destination," This movie exemplifies WHY we go to the movies
","Plot in a nutshell: High School student Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) has a vision that the plane he is about to take to France will explode. He and some other students get kicked off the plane for causing a huge disturbance.It seems they have cheated death, but that is only a quickly evaporating illusion. Everyone who survived is about to pay the price because the grim reaper is an intractable enemy. Think of death here like The Terminator, or the unstoppable Borg from Star Trek, but with a malicious sense of humor.Seeing Final Destination was one of the greatest movie-going experiences of my life. If they had been charging $100 a ticket, the price of admission would have been worth it. Movies like this should remind us all that waiting until a movie comes out on video is a poor decision. Almost invariably, the impact of seeing a movie is severely diminished on the TV screen (I don't care if you have a 70-inch plasma; nothing substitutes for seeing a movie in the theatre. When I saw Dawn of the Dead in the theatre, my heart was racing all night, and for the first time ever, I locked my bedroom door. When I watched it again on video.....zilch, nada.)The script has plenty of clever twists and turns. The writing, editing, and cinematography are absolutely brilliant. Imagine taking a John Denver song, and making it a spooky harbinger of impending doom.If I ever had to pick my top ten favorite movies of all time, Final Destination would definitely qualify.",10,0,1,22 February 2006
Her," Really hated the main character
","Although I am giving this film only four stars, that is based far more on the enjoyment factor of the film, not the writing or directing.My main problem with this film was Joaquin Phoenix's character. The way he is played is so annoying and hard to identify with. There is a scene where he goes on a date with a woman who seems to be out of his league. He's constantly annoying, poorly dressed; similar to a character Woody Allen might play, but without the mirth and whimsy.The woman turns out to be a bit of a needy nutcase. When he's not ready to immediately commit to her on the first date, she tells him 'You're weird'.BINGO! That's the central problem with this whole movie. Had it been played as someone more suave and normal, instead of some emotionally rocky NYC type, it could have been far more enjoyable. But over two hours of a bunch of emotionally damaged, fairly neurotic people who can't even figure out how to be happy is just too much, sorry.In short, I think the problem here was interpretation. I can imagine this story in which the main character isn't so much of a headcase. It's hard to get into a movie when you far prefer the 'character' of the computer operating system!The movie at least ends well. The story, in and of itself, is really interesting, but I hated the execution of it all. There was far too much introspection and neurotic people figuring out all sorts of ways why they can't have an enjoyable life and relationships. It was like taking a neurotic New Yorker and putting his neurosis on steroids.Enough is enough.P.S. I am always interested if anyone reads these reviews. If you read mine, please indicate if it was helpful to you.",4,2,3,6 April 2014
