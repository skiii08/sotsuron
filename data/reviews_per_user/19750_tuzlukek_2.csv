First Man," Indepth missing.
","This movie needs a different music. Story wise, first hour jumps abruptly to the wraps and seems shallow. Ryan needs a good side kick to held the script and his character. I liked the Clarie Foy, though, marvelous delivering with a micro expressions. Landing itself and capsule claustophobic feeling well crafted. Good makeup and overall design. But I am not sure what angle or tone were filmmakers up to; as in many of the biopic pictures, you can't explain everythin - either you go for the simple facts in historical order or you focus on a personal drama. The death of a child enters too soon and sets the mood that has little to do with the events that follow and gives a real trouble for Ghosling to find his ground in the events that follow. Anyway, I was to give up somewhere in the middle, but somehow watched to the end. Five stars.",5,1,2,15 December 2018
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Beautifull
","Raising questions about love, past and traumas, challenging the very foundation of a person's behaving and a person's way of life as such. Film could be finished at 91th minute of it's running time , but than it extends for another 10 minutes for what I thought
was 'the producer's ending'. But to mu surprise, it was worth it. Fantastic script, good directing, outstanding editing and brilliant performances. What else? Not for entertaining purposes.",10,1,1,26 January 2019
