The Avengers," Impressive action scenes but short history, history for kids
","It's a great movie but lack drama or more deep in the history, you feel like you are missing something.Robert Downey Jr. is the best super hero actor, SpoilerThe good guys are very strong for Loki they had to include another villain Loki is very weak, the last battle is very impressive but looks like the avengers was indestructible. SpoilerGreat audio, great graphics effects, great fun in this film DO NOT SEE THE AVENGERS IN 3D! See the film because you will not be disappointed even if you are not that interested into superhero movies.",7,1,7,21 July 2012
