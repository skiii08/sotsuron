The Rock," Fast-paced thrill ride is marred by silliness and occasional blurry editing.
","7 out of 10Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer are responsible for some of the most hated movies of the past five years.  But before every critic started pouncing on their collaborations, they gave us The Rock, arguably the best film of Bay's career and probably the most efficient example of the Bruckheimer formula, which is basically to put thousands of people in danger, having a ticking clock, and watch stuff blow and get shot up real good. 
At that, The Rock is a success, moving at a lightning pace that's guaranteed to entertain you from beginning to end.  There's shootouts, car chases, and fisticuffs; all the action's directed with energy and flair.  There are, unfortunately, some big letdowns.  Bay's obsession with quick cuts renders the San Francisco car chase into a big blur.  The script is stupid (take, for instance, the scene where virtually ALL the Navy Seals pile up in that one room, all strung up for one big massacre) and Cage is as annoying as he is amusing.  Standout performances from Sean Connery and Ed Harris, as usual.  This is an entertaining thrill ride, too bad Bay and the screenwriters had too much coffee.",Null,2,2,5 December 2002
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Aside from the beginning, middle, and end this is dreadfully dull.
","5 out of 10The Phantom Menace is the introduction to the Star Wars saga, meaning it has a lot to live up to.  For me, I'm just looking for good old-fashioned fun, but the movie mostly fails to live up to even those expectations.  Yeah, like some of the previous Star Wars movies, the dialogue is horrendous and the acting is incredibly stiff, but this would all be acceptable if the movie was consistently entertaining, which it most definitely is not.Is there anything commendable about the film?  Certainly.  The special effects are excellent and imaginatively conceived.  Liam Neeson delivers a fine performance, easily the movie's best.  And yes, the action sequences (of which there aren't nearly enough of) are quite thrilling, particularly the climactic two-on-one lightsaber fight.  All this, of course, isn't enough to make this a high recommendation but sci-fi/action fans will see it anyway.  At least this set up the far superior Attack of the Clones.",Null,1,3,28 November 2002
The Ring," A hair-raising, nerve-racking horror/thriller.
","**** out of ****Naomi Watts stars as a reporter who investigates the mysterious death of her niece and discovers the cause may have been a videotape that kills you seven days after you see it. Plot-wise, that's all you need to know as you should prepare yourself for a gripping, downright terrifying mystery that is easily among the scariest films I've ever seen.Gore Verbinski's wonderfully stylish direction makes up for the minor flaws that exist in Ehrin Kruger's otherwise chilling screenplay. The performances are all very good, with Watts delivering another standout turn.There have been plenty of outstanding genre pictures the past two years, but so far, this is the best. Yes, it's doubtful you'll ever look at your VCR or television the same way again.",Null,0,0,24 November 2002
Raiders of the Lost Ark," A wonderful movie, but I still prefer The Last Crusade.
","Rating: **** out of ****There is no doubt in my mind that Indiana Jones is the best movie series in the history of cinema. And the one start it all was Raiders of the Lost Ark, a fast-paced adventure packed with one death-defying cliff-hanger situation after another. To this day, Raiders remains one of the best action movies, holding up better than most of today's rapid-cut, MTV-style 'thrill rides.' Raiders relied on no CGI, no flashy editing, just pure, exhilarating film-making and storytelling, a combo of its kind that has only been surpassed by its second sequel, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.Harrison Ford stars as Jones, an archaeologist who dresses in a brown coat and fedora, armed with a revolver and lion-taming whip. A delightful opening involving elaborate booby traps informs us he's used to these adventures (especially his even closer brushes with death in Temple of Doom, which was a prequel). When he returns to the states from his latest 'excavation,' he's informed by the military that the Nazis are after the ark of the covenant, an artifact that could possess the power to make the Nazis an invincible army. So Jones sets out to retrieve the ark first, in what will prove to be one of his greatest adventures.There's probably little doubt that Raiders is the fan/critical favorite of the trilogy, but there are a few things that I actually have to gripe about, blasphemous as it may be. For one, even though the story is excellent, it's not without its holes. Most perplexing is in the film's opening scenes, when we wonder why Jones bothered to bring along potentially traitorous porters when it's such a short distance from the river to the cave temple. Also (spoilers), one needs only to see the film once to realize that if Indy had never tried to intercept the Ark, the Nazis would a) have never found it or b) still would have suffered the same horrible fate regardless.The action sequences are superb, though an early bar shootout isn't quite as adrenaline-pumping as it could be and looks quite bland compared to the film's other action scenes. Thankfully, the following street chase is playful and exciting and keeps the joyous momentum flowing. Overall, I'd still argue that both Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade boast more inventive action but there's no questioning that the action scenes in Raiders are fantastic and likely superior to any film you may have seen the last few years.As bitchy as I may sound, I'm not trying to harp on Raiders, at least not too much. The movie does feature the famous (and deservedly so) truck chase, one of the most unbelievably thrilling and exhilarating action setpieces I've ever seen (and given an extra boost by John Williams' beautifully rousing score). To this day, even with the recent chase scenes in The Matrix Reloaded and Terminator 3, this sequence has yet to be surpassed.Other standout sequences include a sarcophagus almost entirely decorated with snakes, imposing statues, and well-preserved mummies, and Jones' mano-a-mano battle with a seemingly impervious Nazi mechanic. The finale takes the film dangerously close to the horror genre, climaxing things with a truly memorable (and quite frightening) light show for the ages. Every Indiana Jones film has a scene that scarred me as a kid and I think every one who's seen Raiders knows what I'm referring to (as well as its sequels)I've said it before, Harrison Ford is wonderful as Jones, embodying a hero that's cool beyond words, yet still entirely human and believable. The supporting cast isn't as up to par: Paul Freeman makes for a decent but not particularly menacing villain as Belloq and Karen Allen is somewhat annoying as Indy's love interest, but there are an equal share in gems, particularly Denholm Elliot as Marcus Brody and John Rhys-Davies as Sallah (The Last Crusade wisely gave these actors/characters more screen time).Raiders of the Lost Ark was revolutionary cinema, paving way for summer blockbusters that would attempt for the same winning mix of thrills and humor. Only its sequels matched and/or surpassed it, but some have actually come close (The Mummy). If you haven't seen Raiders yet, put it on the top of your list.",Null,109,197,16 July 2003
Minority Report," A sci-fi thriller that's actually intelligent and exciting.
","**** out of ****If not for Kurt Wimmer's fabulous Equilibrium, Minority Report would probably be my choice for (so far) the best sci-fi thriller of the decade. Pretty hefty statement, I realize, but Minority Report's a pretty hefty movie, one that plays as an innovative mix of futuristic sci-fi and film-noir. And I'm a little surprised nobody prior to Steven Spielberg has tried for for a similar formula (cases have been made for Blade Runner and Dark City, though I can't entirely agree).Minority Report is set in the year 2054, a future that, outside of the roads and constant eye-scans, still visually resembles the present (or the past, in this movie's case). Tom Cruise stars as John Anderton, one of the heads of Pre-Crime, a division in Washington, D.C. that has the ability to stop murders before they happen, thanks to the work of three Pre-Cogs, psychics (two male and one female) permanently placed in a watery bath, delivering info about the future to the Pre-Crime division (just how it's done is revealed in a very clever and tense opening sequence).
Anyway, there's a debate over whether or not Pre-Crime should go national, and it's something that the people are going to vote on. The creator of this division, Lamar Burgess (Max Von Sydow), is a bit wary of the FBI agent (Colin Farrell) sent to investigate the way the division operates and the possible infallibilities.Anderton himself has a bit of a mess in his personal life. He lost his son six years ago, is divorced, and is addicted to illegal drugs. But matters grow even worse when the Pre-Cogs' latest vision displays a pre-meditated murder (unsurprisingly stated as a rarity in D.C.) and the killer happens to be Anderton himself! Going on the run, Anderton struggles to escape his old teammates and discover the truth behind this vision; is it a mistake or a genuine view of a nightmarish destiny?First off, let me say hats off to Steven Spielberg. The man's always had unfounded criticism tossed at him with virtually every film he's ever made. It's nice to see he's never dissuaded (or influenced) by such complaints, he's a filmmaker who's always crafted his films with a touch of confidence and genuine emotion that few directors could even hope to achieve in decades worth of work (in case you can't tell, I'm a Spielberg fan, meaning I've just incurred the wrath of David Lynch lovers).Spielberg's work here is, right off the bat, much unlike anything I've ever seen him do. Sure, there was A.I., but not a segment in that film resembled Minority Report's opening scenes, a montage of quick-cuts awash in blue colors that builds in both violence and intensity, in spite of the fact this sequence moves backward (meaning the violent act is committed first, then we see what led up to it). The segment ends with a close-up of an eye, with the camera pulling back to reveal a woman lying in a pool, ominously stating the word, 'murder.' It's a chilling, daring intro that holds a lot of promise, and instead of disappointing, the rest of the film actually manages to improve upon it.The future that Spielberg presents here is entirely believable, from both a societal and technological viewpoint. Most interestingly, when I first saw the previews, I'd expected a 'Big Brother' type society akin to 1984, one in which the government monitored all the actions of the people. But that's not the case here. The government presented here questions the ethics and logic behind Pre-Crime because if this were reality, it would be a subject matter of serious concern, and not just hive-minded behavior and blather about how this is for the good of humanity. Finally, we get a film that features a dark view of the future, but simultaneously gives us reasonable, intelligent characters that realize there are pros and cons to everything.On a dramatic level, Minority Report delivers with as much resonance as A.I., and maybe even moreso when you factor in just how coherently and cleverly Spielberg and the writers tie all the subplots together. The emotional baggage is handled mostly by Tom Cruise, who does quite an admirable job; maybe that's an understatement, like the man or not, he delivers one of the better performances I've seen all year.  In vital supporting roles, Colin Farrell and Samantha Morton shine with charismatic and powerfully dramatic performances, respectively.Plot-wise, the film is on solid ground with a few admittedly major stumbles. One of the movie's narrative burners is the move to make Pre-Crime national, which when you consider the logistics, is almost impossible (3 pre-cogs, an entire country, the cops have to decipher the location through the visual clues; let's face it, you'd need thousands of pre-cogs to pull it off). (Major spoiler here) The film's big plot twist, while fairly surprising and thought-provoking, doesn't completely hold water. It's a nice, well-done time loop, but if you consider what happens, then by that basis, I'd suspect a LOT of people could just as easily be accused of murder on such thin ground.Whether or not Minority Report would appeal to the traditional summer crowd is a little iffy. There's not a whole lot of action (though the jetpack chase/car factory fight is one of the most hectic, exciting action scene I've seen all year, probably surpassed only by the climactic battle in Equilibrium), the story requires undivided attention (and maybe even a repeat viewing to gather in all the themes), and the downbeat, almost pessimistic tone will throw a lot of viewers off. But for those who do get caught up in this twisty tale (and that should apply to most people), Minority Report offers a lot of rewards, more than you could reasonably expect from a big-budget blockbuster.A lot of people see Minority Report as a warning for how far technology could go and bite us back. While such a statement works to an extent for A.I., Report is mostly about morals, accepted ethics, and an intriguing look on just how far people are willing to go for their own survival in this 'winner takes all' society. As far as science fiction goes, the genre hasn't been this damned smart and thought-provoking since Dark City.",Null,6,9,9 May 2003
Underworld," Underworld finished under my expectations.
","Rating: ** out of ****As an introductory film to hopefully a larger, more epic and expansive series, Underworld fulfills its requirements adequately. There's enough action, blood, and tight latex outfits to satisfy a genre fan's thirst and the execution is decent enough that I look forward to the sequels, but there's the unmistakable sense of promise left unfulfilled. Set in an unnamed city, the gorgeous Kate Beckinsale stars as Selene, a 'Death Dealer,' a vampire whose job is to hunt down the remaining Lycans, aka Werewolves. According to vampire history, most of the werewolves should have been wiped out in past wars, but a subway venture reveals there is still a formidable-sized population of werewolves. Against the wishes of her master, Kraven (Shane Brolly), Selene investigates further and discovers that the werewolves are particularly interested in a human named Michael (Scott Speedman). After an encounter with head werewolf Lucian (Michael Sheen), Michael is bitten but saved by Selene, who grows infatuated with this human. Why, is never made clear, other than the fact that he 'saves' her life. As Selene pries deeper into the mystery surrounding Michael, she uncovers a conspiracy involving both vampires and werewolves that could tip the balance of the war.As most people have already said, by far the movie's most memorable image is the sight of Kate Beckinsale in tight latex. For those who find her a hot babe (like me), Underworld might just be worth watching for her alone. Hell, if she'd shown some nudity, I would have even bumped my rating up 1/2. Alas, she's still great eye-candy.The picture itself is a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, there's lots of shootouts and fight scenes that are well-staged and filmed and reasonably exciting. The werewolf effects are excellent and the transformation scenes are some of the slickest, most convincing I've seen on-screen, certainly better than anything seen in The Howling or An American Werewolf in London. Beckinsale, in addition to being a delectable hottie, makes for a kick-ass, first-rate female action hero. But on the other hand, Underworld is a grim, joyless picture, accentuated by its deadly serious performances and occasionally laughably earnest dialogue. Much like the Blade films, a lot of what the characters have to say is hard to take seriously, the mythology hampered by the fact that it's being juxtaposed with CGI-infested action scenes (though, admittedly, any five minutes of Blade has a much worse problem with this than all of Underworld).Underworld is neither scary nor suspenseful. Selene never really gets herself into any combative situation she can't get herself out of, usually because most of the opponents she fights aren't nearly as skilled as her. Though there are plentiful werewolf effects, I think I would have preferred more scenes of Lycans skulking around in their hulking bodies rather than watching them in human form.Undoubtedly, Scott Speedman must be one of the worst examples of a romantic leading man I've seen. He and Beckinsale have no chemistry, and considering it's her affection for him that spurs her to 'betray' her own kind, this is a pretty damning flaw. It's also during her scenes with Speedman that Beckinsale is at her least convincing; she won me over as a kick-ass vampiress, but I had a hard time believing she was in love with this bland nobody named Michael.Directed by first-timer Len Wiseman (who apparently stole Beckinsale's heart on-set, enough that she left Michael Sheen for him), Underworld is slickly-crafted and boasts a strong, pervasive atmosphere. Maybe with more passionate performances, more well-orchestrated thrills, and some bare skin from Kate, the sequel will be an unqualified success.",Null,4,8,3 February 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Depp and Knightley are fun to watch, but it's not the rousing adventure I was expecting.
","Rating: ** out of ****I saw the movie in the hoopla of all the hype, when most people I knew were proclaiming this one of the summer's best films. Not unexpectedly, I walked into this one with high expectations, hoping for perhaps another Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade or even The Mummy. Walking out of the theater a very long two-and-a-half hours later (actually, more like 2 hours 50 minutes, given the previews and the final scene after the credits) (this movie has way too many double crosses and false climaxes), I'm not even sure if this is better than The Mummy Returns.Based off an amusement park theme ride, a lack of solid plot isn't a surprise. Orlando Bloom stars as Will Turner, a dashing blacksmith who's in madly in love with the beautiful Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley, a Natalie Portman look-a-like, except she's much prettier and appears to be a better actress). But when she's kidnapped by a group of ghostly pirates (led by Geoffrey Rush), Turner enlists the help of pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), who appears a few cards short of a complete deck. Dark secrets are unearthed and it is revealed the undead pirates need to make a blood sacrifice to become human again.It's not that Pirates' premise doesn't hold any potential, the movie does, after all, give us the prospect of an oceanbound adventure, the kind of movies you don't see too often. But Indiana Jones on water, this is not, for it lacks all of that trilogy's infectious sense of fun and thrilling ventures into the unknown (not to mention the smart dialogue and rousing John Williams' score). If not for Johnny Depp's performance and Keira Knightley's beauty and strong screen presence, Pirates might very well have lulled me into sleep.The movie's biggest problem is its generic action sequences. Most of the swordfights are routine, directed without much flair or energy, and their bloodless presentation is just too juvenile-oriented for me. In fact, they all start to look the same after a while, so a little variety would have been appreciated. The film's one semi-creative fight, between Turner and Sparrow, is ineffective since you realize neither are in danger, and the climactic battle, pitting dozens of the undead pirates against the living, doesn't work since the fighting is done by characters I didn't give a damn about.I like the actual concept of fighting undead pirates, but most of the villains are so goofy (especially the one keeps that fake eye), it's hard to see them as an actual menace. And when they are played for laughs, they're not very funny, either (how many times can we see an eye pop out before it stops being funny?). Also, making them former mates of Sparrow's sort of demystifies them (as if their goofy behavior didn't do so already).As a pure adventure, Pirates is fraught with a lot of problems. It's repetitive, the characters keep going back and forth between the same islands and boats, sneaking in and out. The most successful adventures usually get the characters going from A to B to C, rather than A to C, then B, and then back to C, then B, and then back to C (and in this case, even back to A!). I got sick of seeing that island cavern over and over in ten minutes.But Pirates is not without merit. Its singular savior is Johnny Depp, whose introductory scene is so hilarious, I was afraid I'd choke on my laughter. Sure, some of his scenes don't work so well (like when he tries to get those two guards to distract themselves), but he's more often a blast to watch than not, and most of the scenes he's in are pretty enjoyable. I also liked Keira Knightley (almost easily the movie's best piece of eye candy when you compare her good looks with some of the goofy visual effects), who displays genuine fire and feistiness even when she's mostly played as a damsel in distress. Both performers make the best of their parts, elevating the material quite significantly (if Depp and Knightley weren't present, the movie would have gone from middling to bad in a heartbeat).Klaus Badelt's score sounds almost exactly like Hans Zimmer's work in The Rock given a period flavor. It's distracting, I spent too much time wondering in what ways Badelt would rip-off scores from Jerry Bruckheimer films. But at least it gave me an excuse to pay attention to something in-between th e scenes featuring Depp and Knightley.",Null,19,40,15 August 2003
The Fifth Element," Very silly but great to look at.
","** 1/2 out of ****The Fifth Element may very well be the most elaborate, visually magnificent film I've ever seen. Everything, from the spaceships to the flying cars to the city, is an example of eye-popping special effects. For that alone, I would recommend it. There are several other things going for it, too, though I can't forget the fact that the story is a mess and many individual scenes are annoying and headache-inducing. Hey, everything comes with a price, and these visuals are no different.In terms of plot, let's just say the film takes place a few hundred years in the future, and Bruce Willis is the hero who must save the Earth before a huge ball of evil will destroy it. To do so, Willis needs the help of the fifth element, turns out its Milla Jovovich. Impeding the good guys are a band of ugly aliens and an over-the-top Gary Oldman as a nasty businessman named Zorg.There are a lot of little things about The Fifth Element that bug me. First is Zorg's motivations. Apparently, he's been chosen by that big ball of evil to hinder Willis and Jovovich, and he cooperates seemingly because he believes in a big financial pay-off. Exactly what he can do with any riches after the Earth is destroyed raises more than a few questions. Basically, Oldman's just here to chew the scenery and give us a human villain, even though in the end, he isn't particularly menacing and never even comes face-to-face with Willis.Rather, the villains who participate in the physical action are a group of really ugly aliens (whose names I can't think of at the moment) that have the ability to shapeshift. These aliens look really silly, but I'll give director Luc Besson the benefit of the doubt and assume the effect was entirely intentional. Even then, they don't make for very imposing antagonists, they're almost as easy to kill as storm troopers, and they're only slightly more competent.But such flaws are made up for by not only the movie's great look, but its sense of fun. At its heart, The Fifth Element is not science fiction but a comical action/adventure with mismatched heroes, a 'damsel in distress', and bad guys who threaten the world itself. Bruce Willis makes for a great deadpan hero, and as usual, excels during the action sequences. Jovovich isn't quite my idea of the perfect being, but she's acceptable in her role. Almost taking me out of the movie is an annoying Chris Tucker as an androgynous DJ. He's here as comic relief, and while he gets off a few good laughs, he's more of a detriment than anything else.Surprisingly enough, even though The Fifth Element moves at a fast pace, there are only a few all-out action scenes. Aside from a flying car chase (which Star Wars Episode II obviously took inspiration from) and a big climactic gun battle, there's not a whole lot of physical violence going on here, at least not when compared to some of the other sci-fi action films released around the same time (Star Trek: First Contact, Alien Resurrection, Starship Troopers).Keeping the film consistently enjoyable is Besson's sense of humor. He knows well enough not to take such a story seriously, so don't be surprised by how much the movie acknowledges its own silliness. I've not seen a whole lot from Besson that I liked (I always found The Professional overrated and The Messenger a bloated, though not entirely unenjoyable, mess), but The Fifth Element comes the closest to a movie of his that I genuinely liked. There's much from this movie I enjoyed and I do recommend it, but cut off the chaff, and we could've had a sci-fi/action classic on our hands and not just a good timewaster.",Null,1,4,10 June 2003
Finding Nemo," Pixar's funniest to date.
","*** 1/2 out of ****Sure, the message of this flick (parents should have as much respect for their children as said children should have for them) is pure bland Disney all the way, but there's no denying that Finding Nemo is the funniest and most visually complex Pixar effort to date. And consistent laughs and great animation is all that I ask from such a picture.The laughs are mostly the result of the film's many entertaining and unique characters, from Dory (voiced perfectly by Ellen Degeneres), the fish with short-term memory, to Australian-accented sharks and sea turtles that sound stoned. Ironically enough, it's arguable that the film's two least interesting characters are the clownfish themselves, Nemo and his dad Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks, who's generally funny but whose constant shouting can be a tad ear drum-piercing).The story concerns these two clownfish, the only survivors from an attack by a barracuda. With his mate and the rest of his children dead, Marlin promises to always look over his remaining spawn, whom he dubs Nemo. But as time passes and Nemo has grown into a curious young fish, Marlin is still the most overprotective parent in the sea. In an act of defiance, Nemo swims too far from safe territory and is caught by a scuba diver and placed into the aquarium of his office. Desperate to find his son, Marlin enlists the help of the forgetful Dory, and it's their long journey proves to be the highlight of this movie.One of the film's smartest touches is dividing the screen time between Marlin's journey and Nemo's interaction with the other sea life in his aquarium. In fact, the aquarium bunch boasts the film's most hilarious mixture of eccentric characters, led by the always memorable Willem Dafoe. Also very funny are Brad Garrett as a puffer fish and Allison Janney as a sea star ('Scum angel!').Adventure fans will probably also want to give the film a look. The search for Nemo consists of an abundance of obstacles that range from dangerous to amusing. The eye-popping visuals ensure that this is a movie that's always visually entrancing in one way or another, and there's so much attention to creating a detailed underwater environment that it's practically begging for repeat viewings (this isn't as rewatchable as, say, traditionally animated efforts like Lilo and Stitch or Treasure Planet, but it'll definitely hold up in the coming years). Virtually every other Pixar picture I've seen either simply didn't provide much in the way of laughs (Toy Story 1 and 2) or just couldn't keep the momentum all the way through (Monster's Inc.). I consider Finding Nemo a lesson learned; even though it's actually the longest of Pixar's work to date (running at 100 minutes), the filmmakers realize we want to see adventure and laughs, not earnest attempts at sentimentality (though, as if it's requisite, we still have some sentimental moments).Finding Nemo's pacing is probably the biggest concern, the middle segment is a tad slow and runs short on laughs compared to the much more enjoyable opening and closing half-hours. But that's only a minor complaint; be sure to stick for the final scenes, the funniest since, unbelievably enough, Stephen Sommers' horror/comedy Deep Rising; both actually boast an identical line of dialogue to wrap up the film.",Null,0,4,7 May 2004
Blade," The Blade is dull.
","3.5 out of 10Blade's opening segment, an action-packed gun/martial arts battle set in a blood-drenched nightclub, is a knockout action sequence.  It's fast-paced, stylishly directed, and edited for maximum intensity.  It's also the movie's only watchable scene.  The rest of the film devolves into a silly tale about reviving blood gods and whatnot, most of it incomprehensible junk that serves as filler in-between the action, which quickly grows redundant.The movie is packed to the brim with stunts and fight scenes, but most of them lack the precious sense of fun that makes the best of action movies exhilarating (the recent Equilibrium wildly succeeds with its action in comparison to where Blade resoundingly fails).  Director Stephen Norrington has an eye for stylish visuals, but fails to bring invigorating energy to the proceedings. As the lead, Wesley Snipes is brooding and bland, a complete failure from a dramatic standpoint.  His impending crisis is neither engrossing nor particularly interesting, just another bland subplot in this soulless action thriller.",Null,6,12,12 December 2002
The Mummy," The best action/adventure since Indiana Jones and the Last crusade
","9 out of 10The Mummy is maximum adventure, a rollercoaster ride of non-stop action, cliffhanger thrills, and crowdpleasing humor.  Writer/director Stephen Sommers' homage of Saturday Matinee serials and past horror films is every bit as fun as the Indiana Jones movies, and even surpasses them when it comes to frenetic pacing.  Not since The Last Crusade have I seen an adventure movie so enjoyable and immensely likeable.  To keep the film from ever getting boring, Sommers wisely delivers a wide variety of action sequences.  There are massive gun battles (the opening is spectacular), chases (on foot, car, and even airplane), and swordfights.  So much of it is so thrilling, it's hard to decide which action scene is the best (perhaps the opening gun battle or the sandstorm or the climactic sword battle against the mummies).  The special effects are outstanding and Arnold Vosloo as the mummy Imhotep makes for a genuinely imposing villain. 
Most importantly, though, the characters are likeable and a lot of fun. Brendan Fraser makes for a dashing action hero, Rachel Weisz is an appealing heroine, and John Hanna is hilarious as Weisz's inept brother.  With characters worth caring for, the movie even builds up palpable suspense and excitement, all the way to the very end.  Too bad the sequel wasn't nearly as fun.",Null,0,1,10 February 2003
The Others," An old-fashioned chiller.
","6.5 out of 10Nicole Kidman stars as Grace Stewart, an overly protective mother of two whose children have a rare disease that demands they be kept from bright light.  She hires three new caretakers to help around the house (actually, a mansion), but not long afterward, that's when the 'others' arrive.  This old-fashioned chiller set in the late 1940's is a decent attempt at emanating the filmmaking style of the haunted house movies of the 70's.  The film is undeniably atmospheric and there is a quiet tension that's almost impeccable.Unfortunately, despite a terrific performance from Kidman and the child actors who play her children, the movie is coldly impersonal, never developing truly likeable characters to sympathize in this understandably maddening situation.  Even worse, the movie is ultimately little more than an excericse in crafting an eerie mood; by the end, you'll note little of importance has occurred and the climactic plot twist, while ingeniously executed, is somewhat obvious and doesn't quite add the extra spiritual depth writer/director Alejandro Amenabar was aiming for.",Null,0,0,13 December 2002
Troy," An often rousing and emotionally engaging epic, but could clearly have benefited from a stronger and more equal emphasis on its many themes, subplots, and characters.
","*** out of ****The die-hard Iliad fans who won't appreciate or condone the many changes and liberties Wolfgang Petersen's adaptation takes with the original literature should probably stay away from Troy, but I think they're missing the point entirely.  Having read The Iliad myself and having just seen Troy, I am convinced this is probably as good an adaptation as one can get.
To atually maintain rigid levels of faithfulness would require the story to be divided into at least two fairly lengthy films, but believe me, there's only so much interest this particularly small-scale war can hold for so long (for crying out loud, despite boasting armies in the dozens of thousands, it's fought over a relatively small stretch of unappealing land).  What director Petersen and writer David Benioff have merely done is condense the tale, tossed out almost all elements of the supernatural, and focus mostly on Achilles' desire for glory, giving him an even further human emphasis than the Homeric tale.For those unfamiliar with the famous tale, Troy is set over three thousand years ago, an ancient time when the many nations of Greece have been all but conquered by King Agamemnon (Brian Cox).  With only one kingdom remaining, Thessaly, Agamamenon calls upon his greatest but most rebellious warrior, Achilles (Brad Pitt), lord of the Myrmidons, to fight for him yet again.  In swift combat, Achilles kills Thessaly's reigning champion in a matter of seconds, and all of Greece is united under the power-hungry Agamemnon's rule.Meanwhile, in Sparta, the King's brother, Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson), has just made peace with the leaders of Troy, who are represented by the princes Hektor (Eric Bana) and Paris (Orlando Bloom).  But the peace lasts no more than a day when Helen, who has fallen in love with Paris, is smuggled aboard the Trojan ship on its return home. Upon this discovery, Menelaus wages war, asking his brother to join him.  This being the perfect opportunity to either crush or rule Greece's rival nation, Agamemnon accepts the offer.The Greeks plan to launch a thousand ships, but to ensure victory, Agamemnon uses Odysseus (Sean Bean) to enlist the aid of Achilles, who reluctantly agrees to join the expedition so that his name and glory may be remembered for all time.  Upon arrival at the beaches of Troy, the Myrmidons push back Hektor and his men, and take prisoner the priestess and Trojan King's (Peter O'Toole) niece, Briseis (Rose Byrne).  Achilles develops a sexual and romantic relationship with Briseis, which makes him question his outlook of the war and his reasons for fighting, but an act of violence against one of his men will propel him back into the war and against the Trojans' honorable and reigining hero, Hektor.At the heart of Troy is the story of Achilles, but the film tries to cover considerably more plots and themes than just his battle for reputation and immortality and his consequent romance with Briseis.  There's the love of Paris and Helen, the honor and strength of Hektor, the brotherly love of Hektor and Paris, the fatherly love of Priam, the greed and debauchery of Agamemnon and Menelaus, and an assortment of many characters who are given the short shrift compared to Achilles and the leaders of Troy. 
Therein lies the film's major flaw; with so many character, so many converging storylines, there's only so much one can accomplish with a running time of 163 minutes.  The storytelling is occasionally somewhat choppy, especially in the opening, in which Paris and Helen are shown as already being in love without actually showing how this relationship developed beyond the fact that each is considered exceedingly attractive for his and her respective genders.The uninitiated will probably find themselves slightly disoriented and bombarded with the many characters that are awkwardly introduced, each new addition inserted at the most opportune moment simply because he or she has to play an important role to the outcome of the story later in the film (i.e. Odysseus, Patroclus, Andromache, etc.).  But as distracting as these flaws are, there's no questioning that the core subplots the film does choose to focus on are the most compelling ones. There are many interesting relationships in the film, none more so than Achilles' burgeoning love for Briseis, which brings out a conflicting sense of duty, if not necessarily loyalty, among both.  Brad Pitt and Rose Byrne have such good chemistry that their moments together work, especially their final, poignant scene together.  Despite many reports to the contrary, Pitt is actually quite good as Achilles, supporting his character well through his many internal (and external) conflicts.As Hektor, Eric Bana excellently portrays the film's most effortlessly likeable character, a hero whose every move is torn between love for his soldiers and his brother, and deciding what's best for Troy.  Orlando Bloom also impresses as the semi-cowardly Paris who discovers the backbone and drive to fight.  Peter O'Toole delivers perhaps the film's best performance as King Priam of Troy; an emotional scene between him and Achilles might just be enough to land O'Toole a supporting Oscar nod, though it's a bit too early to tell.The film's numerous action sequences are rousing and keep the film moving at a surprisingly fast pace; while most of the massive-scale battles are a little too short to truly satisfy (the exception being the terrific siege sequence goes badly for the Greeks), it's the one-on-one fights that deliver genuine thrills and even suspense.  Three such showdowns are very impressive, Paris vs. Menelaus, Hektor vs. Ajax, and the best of them all, the battle between Hektor and Achilles, the most exciting and freshest take on ancient combat I've seen since Gladiator.  This fight between each kingdom's best warrior is representative of what works so well in Troy, it develops its main characters as genuine humans and doesn't choose sides over whom is hero and whom is villain (clearly, the Greek kings are meant to be the film's 'boo-hiss' bad guys, and not the warriors they command).  For that, this film is leagues more complex and complicated than any summer blockbuster I've seen this decade. 
Visually, the film is spectacular without being totally engulfing, which is a bit of a pity.  For all the money spent on the production, I didn't quite find myself drawn into this ancient world as much as I would have liked (probably because, as I said earlier, it's almost exclusively set on a small stretch of land).  It is, in fact, only in the climax that one can totally immerse himself in the film's reality, because of the imminent and wide-scale destruction, frantic behavior, and overwhelming emotions that are displayed.Also working as visuals, Troy boasts the most attractive cast in recent memory, with Pitt, Bana, and Bloom appealing to the female audience and Rose Byrne, Saffron Burrows, and Diane Krueger displaying the literal beauty of the time period.  I am particularly smitten with Byrne, whom I hope to see in future works.  Watch Troy for its cast and its great action, which combine for a highly entertaining if heavily flawed picture.",Null,5,10,15 May 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," Silly as expected, but undeniably very entertaining.
","*** out of ****I've always been pretty harsh on Roland Emmerich, whose movies are alternately cheesy, brainless, and almost completely ridiculous. But lots of stuff usually get blown up real good with thrilling action scenes and at least half of his films have starred first-rate actors who were above the material (Stargate, The Patriot, and the same goes here for The Day After Tomorrow). Professor Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) is a climatologists whose latest research in the Antarctic has led him to believe that sooner than later, perhaps in the next 100 years, a major climate shift will occur that will radically the change the face of the Earth. But such long-term problems are dismissed by American politicians, who believe the economy has more pressing and immediate concerns.Because of his occupation, Jack barely has any opportunity to spend much time with his teenage son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal), who heads off to New York City to compete in a school 'trivia' contest. But as he arrives, the climate abruptly shifts, bringing about massive storms all throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Soon, all of New York is flooded, the water turned to ice, and it begins snowing as the temperature dwindles, bringing about the new Ice Age. Sam and a small group (including Emmy Rossum as a classmate Sam has a crush on) have holed up inside the public library, burning the books to keep warm.Further research shows that the entire Northern Hemisphere will be part of his Ice Age, leading Jack to advise that any person who can possibly be saved be evacuated to Mexico. Desperate to save his son, Jack and his team set out from Washington, D.C. on a rescue mission, despite the steadily worsening conditions.The Day After Tomorrow (from here on referred to as TDAT) is no different than any typical film of the natural disaster genre, with only perhaps the special effects to stand out from the rest of the bunch. But given just how spectacular the visuals are, that alone is enough to warrant a recommendation. Yes, the film's premise is outrageous (I'm not going to delve in on the scientific details because I'm certainly no meterological expert), but it's outrageous to the extent that it remains fairly believable in the confines of Hollywood cinema.The film's two central story lines, Sam's fight for survival and Jack's rescue mission, are both nicely juxtaposed, with leads Dennis Quaid and Jake Gylenhaal delivering decent performances and developing their characters adequately enough that I cared for their plight. Quaid is actually a tad subpar here and there, particularly when he has to utter weather jargon that he doesn't look all that comfortable with, but remains perfectly believable as a determined, caring father.Most of the acting is a mixture of on and off. Sela Ward does little more than cry and show concern for the danger her ex-husband and son are in, while Emmy Rossum simply looks very cute as Sam's love interest. She also looks like a combo of actresses Anne Hathaway, Rose Byrne, and Brittany Murphy, and yes, that's a good thing. Occasionally awkward and/or unconvincing performances are delivered by Arjay Smith as a super-nerd (who keeps referring to himself as a nerd) and Dash Mihok as one of Jack's partners who has a crush on a Japanese scientist (played by the lovely Tamlyn Tomita).Those expecting all-out mayhem as the trailers somewhat indicated might be a little disappointed; there are only two large-scale disaster sequences, and only one of them actually works up genuine thrills and suspense, that being the flooding of New York City, which is spectacular and exciting, and probably the highlight of the picture. The twister attack in L.A. is visually impressive, but a little flat considering the focus of the situation keeps shifting from place to place and we don't care for any of the characters caught up in it. Most of the film is concerned with the survival story of the group holed up in the library, and so long as we find ourselves caught up in their situation, the film remains gripping. Thankfully, there's enough variety in their plight that it doesn't get repetitive (though I have to question the inclusion of wolves to up the ante). A later sequence involving the Eye of the Storm freezing everything in its path is just as memorable and nail-biting as the flooding (though I have to wonder if the freezing process is something people can actually outrun). Roland Emmerich may not know a thing about quality characterizations or writing dialogue, but he knows how to capture destruction and I don't think he's ever been better at it than he has here.As per any Emmerich film, there's an attempted sense of humor that seems requisite of any crowd-pleasing summer blockbuster. Anybody who's seen Godzilla or The Patriot will know humor also isn't Emmerich's forte, but I was truly surprised by the number of good laughs the film delivered. Sure, most of the humor is still either dumb (the guy's crush on the Japanese scientist) or overemphasized (the fact that Americans are the refugees crossing into Mexico, the very fact that the president looks like Al Gore and the vice president like Dick Cheney), but a lot of it's funnier than I expected.With all these silly but successful elements blending together, TDAT delivers on two hours of sheer entertainment. Yeah, the environmental message could use a little more subtlety and the final scene, though visually pretty, is also pretty cheesy, but the film moves fast and is always enjoyable, and that's all I ask for from this kind of movie.",Null,0,0,29 May 2004
X-Men," Smart and entertaining, a genuinely good adventure.
","*** out of ****I used to be an avid reader of the X-men comics.  Every month, I'd dash to the comic book store, eager to purchase the newest issues (the X-men had two running series) of this clashing team of mutants.  Like everyone else, I had my favorite characters; Wolverine, for his interesting anti-hero but honorable qualities, and Psylocke, who simply oozed sex appeal, intelligence, and could alternately kick any guy's ass in hand-to-hand combat.  What more could you want from a lady?But I wasn't completely sold on the movie when I first heard of it, particularly with unknown Hugh Jackman in the lead. So it was with cautionary anticipation I approached this film.  Hell, I was so cautious I didn't even see it until it came out on DVD, but in the end, this was an enjoyable hour-and-a-half diversion, and probably the best comic book to film adaptation since Tim Burton's Batman.As expected, X-Men spends a large portion of its running time as a set-up, for both its characters and future plotlines.  But for those curious, Patrick Stewart stars as Professor Charles Xavier, virtually the world's most powerful mutant with the ability to read and control minds.  He heads a school to teach other mutants to develop their powers, the heads of the classes being Cyclops (James Marsden), Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), and Storm (Halle Berry).  Two newcomers arrive after an attack in the woods, Logan AKA Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Rogue (Anna Paquin).  Their enemy is Magneto, a powerful mutant who wishes to make the world a place safe for mutants, even if it means the destruction of the human race.Almost all comic book adaptations are action/adventures, and while X-men certainly qualifies as such, many might be surprised that the movie spends more time developing its characters than placing them in dangerous situations.  I was pleasantly surprised, and given that these characters were interesting, the pacing never flagged and the build-up to the action-packed finale kept the film moving with surging momentum.In a movie like this, the cast is probably the most important aspect of the production, and the two most important characters to cast were Professor Xavier and Wolverine.  Screw up casting these two roles and the whole movie might have been in jeopardy.  But thankfully, the producers didn't screw up, and these two parts were casted perfectly.  Patrick Stewart makes for an honorable and gentle Xavier, exactly the way everyone imagined he would be (it's not as if though casting Stewart was ever question of if, but when, he actually looks like Xavier).  Hugh Jackman is the real find, totally cool and badass as Wolverine, but also with a down-to-earth quality that makes him so appealing.  I think we're all glad production on M:I-2 ran overlong, or else we'd have seen Dougray Scott in this part.Though I did mention the film spent most of its time developing the characters, the fact the cast is so large leaves a lot of them adrift, most particularly James Marsden as Cyclops and Halle Berry as Storm.  Janssen is a passable Jean Grey, though she seems a bit too old for the part.  Anna Paquin, however, is very good as Rogue, a teen who finds herself coming to terms with her powers.  She and Logan have this daughter/father relationship going, which means she also has the double role of the character Jubilee, who's actually nowhere to be seen (which might be a good thing, I recall she was incredibly annoying in the comics).The villains don't fare as well, each of them barely given any dialogue except for Magneto.  As the master of the metal, Ian Mckellen is fine, but looks hilariously silly in that costume and helmet of his.  Tyler Mane has the physique for the part of Sabretooth, that's about it.  Ray Park has the role of Toad, who's a bit different from how I remember him in the comics (didn't he secrete gunk from his hands?), but it's only slightly less lame. Rebecca Romjin-Stamos is in blue make-up for all her screen-time as the shape-shifting Mystique.The action sequences are exciting without ever being truly memorable.  In fact, some of the fight scenes could have been staged and filmed a bit better, but it's understandable why filming such fights would have been difficult, considering these mutants battle with a variety of powers.  The wirework during the Wolverine/Sabretooth battle is...lacking, maybe a little too Matrix-ish for my tastes.The only real problem I have (and it's a biggie) with X-Men is how unbelievably short it is.  Most comic book adaptations focus on one character and run for over two hours.  This one's got over a dozen, and it's barely an hour-and-a-half (sans credits) long!  Too much feels left out, too much is left unfinished, but I guess that's why we have sequels.",Null,0,0,5 May 2003
A Bridge Too Far," A spectacle that fails to compel.
","3.5 out of 10A Bridge Too Far has awesome production values, a great cast, and occasionally stunning cinematography, but it's a confused account of Operation Market Garden.  As a historical account, the movie is too rigidly executed, and as a war film, the movie is never particularly horrific in its portrayal of combat.Not a single actor stands out, everyone is on hand to simply give us some piece of information and slink back into the background.  Richard Attenborough's direction is lacking, without any depth behind the presentation he's giving.  The musical score is absolutely horrendous, coming off as bright and lively, completely the opposite of what's needed to fit the tone.  Band of Brothers, in its one hour segment about Operation Market Garden, did a far superior job.",Null,8,12,28 November 2002
Blade II," The Blade is still dull.
","4 out of 10Guillermo Del Toro's follow up to the bloody original is slightly superior, with slicker production values, superior lighting, and even more action sequences.  The story?  The vampire strain has mutated, the result being creatures called the Reapers that like to suck the blood of vampires.  Thus, an uneasy alliance is formed between Blade and the Vampire legion to combat this growing epidemic.Action fans who like their violence bloody with plenty of martial arts and gunfights will probably be pleased.  The movie aims to deliver more crowdpleasing battles than its predecessor and in terms of quantity, it certainly succeeds.  Quality is another story.  While a few of the fights are reasonably exciting (particularly the sewer battle and mano-a-mano showdown), some of it is cringe-inducing because the filmmakers actually employ unconvincing CGI stunts and wrestling moves.  The movie's final half-hour manages to take the ludicrousness of the premise and double it with inane plot twists that are obviously only there to give the movie a semblance of a story.",Null,4,7,11 December 2002
Empire of the Sun," Christian Bale is brilliant.
","8 out of 10Empire of the Sun is a powerful drama that tells the story of young James Ballard (Christian Bale), a British child who was trapped in WWII China as the Japanese quickly took power.  This is probably among Steven Spielberg's least well-known works, probably because of its box office failure and lukewarm critical response, but it's one of his better ones (which says a lot) and definitely his most underrated film to date.Spielberg's direction is typically first-rate; most of the film's quality actually hinges on Christian Bale's performance, and thank God he doesn't disappoint.  As a matter of fact, his riveting turn is the strongest display of acting I've ever seen from a child performer (yes, even better than the supremely talented Haley Joel Osment).  With Bale at the center, what could have been a lousy WWII drama is instead an emotionally effective and quite uplifting tale that never fails to grip you from beginning to end.  A definite must see for drama fans.",Null,1,4,27 November 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Multiple viewings only make it more obvious what a wasted opportunity this series is getting to be.
","** out of ****My interest in Star Wars is rather casual. I'll watch the movies in theaters, but not with the massive expectations so many people have. Truth be told, the only film in the series to truly impress me on virtually every level was The Empire Strikes Back (Star Wars was great fun as well, though with weaker dialogue and acting than ESB). But movies like these are rare, these big-budget slices of escapism that harken back to the old days of Saturday matinee serials, only with (much) higher production values and (in this case, marginally) better acting. Damn, I seriously can't wait for Indiana Jones 4.I actually looked forward to Attack of the Clones. The premise offered more opportunities, the special effects would be slicker than ever, and surely, even George Lucas could have improved his writing skills after the results we saw in Phantom Menace. But in the end, it's not much of an improvement over Menace, in fact, I'm not even sure it's an improvement at all. Despite the occasional energetic effort behind the camera, Attack of the Clones is mostly lifeless, pedestrian, and boring.It starts off quite well, with a failed assassination attempt on Senator Amidala's (Natalie Portman) life. For protection, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan Mcgregor) and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) are assigned as her bodyguards. If you'll recall, Anakin had a bit of a crush on Amidala in Phantom Menace and nothing has changed the ten years since. Anyway, another assassination attempt on Amidala fails yet again, with Kenobi and Anakin hot on the heels of the would-be assassin. This leads to a spectacular speeder chase that puts the similar sequence in The Fifth Element to complete shame. So far, so good.But whatever hopes I had for the movie were shattered soon afterward, when the film's core plot, the love story, became the central focus. I'm actually a sucker for a good 'forbidden love' romance; I loved Titanic, enjoyed Sabrina, and even found myself mildly won over by Fools Rush In. But the love story here is so dull, it bears nothing in the way of vitality or genuine chemistry. It's like watching a brother and sister kiss (disturbing memories of Leia and Luke's kiss are all flooding back in).Though Christensen and Portman fail to strike any sparks, it's not entirely their faults. George Lucas and Jonathan Hales' dialogue is horribly silly, there's actually a scene where Anakin compares and contrasts Amidala with sand, of all things. The culmination of Amidala's declaration of love for Anakin doesn't feel right, especially since it comes so soon after his murderous actions, which she apparently forgets almost immediately after he confesses to her.Christensen is an actor with maybe a kernel of potential. I've never seen Life as a House, but I keep hearing a lot of good things about him. As Anakin, he displays many of the qualities we expect: he's arrogant, hot-headed, rash, and temperamental. Christensen's delivery of the dialogue could easily lead one to assume that he's a no-talent pretty boy actor, but it's a bit more complex than that. Lucas' dialogue almost never does him any favors, even if the script does give him the opportunity to expand his ever-growing hostile personality. That the Jedi council doesn't pay more attention to him is a bit of a mystery, they know the kid's got potential (that's an understatement if I ever heard one), but even when he slaughters an entire tribe of Tusken raiders, he's not even berated for such actions (to be fair, it's not like he told anyone, though Yoda clearly sensed his feelings during the massacre).Natalie Portman is a proven talent, but much like Christensen, you could never guess it from her performance. She gives it her best try, but to no avail, coming off as one-dimensional, basically a perfectly safe role model for young girls everywhere without the slightest hint of flaw in her noble personality. It's a portrayal of cartoonish decency, written as only George Lucas could have.Like The Empire Strikes Back, the story splits into two narratives. Sharing screen time with the love story is Obi-Wan Kenobi's investigation of the assassination attempts. Hercule Poirot (or Indiana Jones, for that matter, who proved quite the clever historian at putting together clues to find his sacred artifact), he is not. Piecing together clues is obviously not Kenobi's forte. The script goes out of its way to make him look like an idiot (and the people he's investigating even bigger idiots!); take for instance, the scene where he finds no trace of a star system in the planetary archives, and has to inquire Yoda and a class of padewan learners why it's not on the map (duh, it was removed).His investigation leads him to the water-logged planet of Kamino. This is by far the most visually stimulating of the film's newly introduced worlds (too bad it's all glanced over). The Kaminoans live on ports supported in the same way an oil rig would be, only presumably in a far more complex manner, given the size of these habitats.  Kenobi discovers a clone army that was apparently ordered by a Jedi master named Sifo-Diyas, except the guy's been dead for ten years. The army was cloned from bounty hunter Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison), whose New Zealand accent leads me to believe there's a planet full of Australians somewhere in that galaxy.This converging storyline is only somewhat more interesting than the love story, but at least it sets up a couple of reasonably cool (albeit very short) action sequences, including Kenobi's hair-raising battle with Fett and an asteroid chase that'll remind many of The Empire Strikes Back. Ewan Mcgregor is a fine actor, easily the best of the film's leads, so you at least get the joy of watching this guy emulate Alec Guinness almost perfectly.Attack of the Clones is a much darker picture than Phantom Menace, but not necessarily any better as a result. The pacing here is almost as weak (in both films, we have fun bookending sequences and an elongated boring middle segment) and the climactic action sequences (six of them in the last thirty-five minutes!) are something of a mixed bag.My attention snapped back when the film suddenly came to life around the hour fifty-minute mark with a knockout battle sequence between several Jedi and hundreds of droids inside a massive coliseum. This setpiece boasts the film's most rousing scene, a scuffle between Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson, one of my faves, but clearly acting from a script beneath his talents), Jango Fett, and a giant rhino-like creature. The creature first charges at Windu, then charges at Fett, and finally there's a spectacularly rousing showdown between Windu and Fett that had my blood boiling. Damn, I wish this film had more moments like that.The succeeding action sequences don't fare as well, particularly the lightsaber duel between Anakin and evil Count Dooku (played well by Christopher Lee), which is quite a few steps backward from the climactic duel in Phantom Menace. Without the athletic moves of Ray Park, it's basically an eighty-year old man swinging a big stick of light at a twenty-year old, pretty boy actor.The film's silly title sparked a lot of arguments from defensive Star Wars fans (one friend of mine actually defended the title by saying it was good because it informed us what the plot would be covering) (that is, without a doubt, the lamest reasoning I've ever heard regarding the quality of a movie's title). But Lucas said he named the movie this way as an ode to the Saturday Matinee serials the film was inspired by. Contrasting this with Lucas' Indiana Jones trilogy, it's quite clear virtually all of that series' high quality was the result of Steven Spielberg, Harrison Ford, and John Williams. Lucas proves he can't craft a rousing adventure and not even Williams' rousing score can change that.",Null,29,60,21 November 2003
Predator," John Mctiernan's best.
","**** out of ****Despite boasting a very simple story and a cast that isn't exactly high-caliber, Predator remains one of the most effective thrillers ever made.  The film is a mixture of sci-fi, horror, and action, but it's execution isn't too different from a slaher.  You've got your small group of characters trapped in a desolate environment with some unknown terror in the jungle killing them off one-by-one.Arnold Schwarzennegger plays Dutch, head of a first-rate commando team that's been sent to the Central American jungles for a rescue mission. When the assignment is over, that's when the horror begins, with the alien (aka 'The Predator') hunting down Dutch's team in frighteningly quick and gruesome manners.  Finally, the survivors decide to stand their ground, determined prove the winners in this deadly game of cat-and-mouse.Though most people bill Predator as a Schwarzennegger testosterone fest, I've always viewed the film equally as a wonderful example of the horror genre.  This is easiliy one of the most viscerally terrifying films I've seen, with shocks that don't come cheap and bursts of violence that truly startle.  At the center of it all is the Predator, a ruthless creature whose simple motives prove more frightening than all else.  It's out to hunt these soldiers, and it won't stop until they're all dead.Predator's action is relentless and thrilling, though an early shootout with Central American rebels is a bit on the outlandish side.  But all the scenes afterward with the Predator, they're about as heart-pounding as action sequences get.  (moderate spoiler here) The film eventually boils down to a face-off between Schwarzennegger and the Predator, which leaves the alien unmasked, with what is a truly creepy as hell face.  The final half-hour is a series of well-executed showdowns between the two, with cleverly set traps and plans (end spoiler).Predator doesn't have a great cast, but no one else could have fit these roles.  Schwarzennegger is Schwarzennegger, meaning he's likeable and has got a few snicker-inducing one-liners.  Everyone else also gets to act real macho (and eventually, act real terrified, which Carl Weathers actually does a pretty damn good job at).  This is not a sophisticated bunch, but they're loveable tough guys who are easy to root for.  The only female in the cast is Elpidia Carrillo as a (pretty cute) rebel chick, whose only purpose is to give some audience members a relief from all this testosterone.
The plot and its execution is simple, but undeniably effective.  While I was never in question of the Predator's motivations, I was curious as to how long it'd been on Earth and if it even had the means to leave the planet if it wanted to.  Such questions were sort of answered by the sequel, which I remember thinking it lacked most of this film's charms despite a ton of bloodletting and boasting the same awesome score from Alan Silvestri. Magic can't always strike twice, which is why Predator should be cherished as a one-of-a-kind thrill ride.",Null,0,0,10 June 2003
The Bourne Identity," One of the best spy thrillers in years.
","*** out of ****Matt Damon stars as Jason Bourne, a man who's found afloat in the sea with several bullets in his back.  He's salvaged by a fishing boat and awakens to discover he has no memory of his previous life.  After he recuperates, he heads to shore to find his true identity.  With the assistance of a pretty German woman (Franka Potente), Bourne goes on the run with covert assassins trying to kill him and top government agents trying to cover their tracks.The Bourne Identity is an interesting summer thriller.  It's certainly not an all-out action blockbuster, as the previews might lead you to believe, but there are some terrific action sequences.  What truly makes the film work is Damon himself, whose first bid as an action star is completely convincing and engaging.  The movie nicely keeps us in the dark about his past, we know just as much as he does and eagerly anticipate every discovery he makes.  From a certain point-of-view, Franka Potente isn't useful except as a love interest, and on that level, her presence works.  Not only is she a fine actress, but she and Damon share a palpable chemistry.  Hopefully, she'll return in the sequel, and this series won't go the Bond/M:I route with a new love interest in every installment.  Take note, Hollywood, steadiness and consistent relationships are always appreciated.The Bourne Identity's premise is similar to The Long Kiss Goodnight's, but unlike that movie, takes its story seriously and aspires to work as both a thriller and a character-oriented drama, which it does.  Once Bourne's past is revealed (not that it isn't that hard to figure out), the film loses a bit of momentum, but does wrap things up believably and in a suprisingly somewhat quiet fashion (compared to say, Bond, Triple X, or M:I).For action fans, there's enough here to keep them satisfied, with the standout setpieces being an excellent martial arts fight set in an eerily empty apartment and an exhilarating car chase through the streets of Paris. I've seen at least two other films with auto chases set in Paris (Ronin, The Transporter) and this one's my favorite, even though it's also the shortest and features the least attractive car (a mini as compared to an Audi in Ronin and a BMW in The Transporter).There are a few disappointments here and there, particularly Bourne's showdown with The Professor (Clive Owen), which concludes rather abruptly considering the huge build-up.  Julia Stiles is also in the film, and her presence is rather distracting (I can't look at her without thinking, 'Hey, it's Julia Stiles!') in a role that could have been played by just about anyone.  But in the end, The Bourne Identity succeeds because it rarely goes over-the-top (no megalomaniacal billionaires here), maintains an even tone, and establishes likeable characters and good storytelling.",Null,2,5,14 April 2003
The Killing Fields," The best war film ever made.
","Rating: **** Out of ****Hard to say, but I believe when it comes to the war genre, The Killing Fields manages to edge out even Saving Private Ryan, and without a doubt, there's no better war film out there that's done a better job of capturing the realistic details and emotional loss of the time period (that being, the 70's in Cambodia/Vietnam).Thus, I've always considered it a little odd that no one I know has even heard of this film. When lists of the greatest war films are decided, I don't believe I've ever seen this film crack any list. And the reason is simple: The Killing Fields is often ignored because it doesn't come from a soldier's point of view, and neither does it feature any adrenaline-pumping battle sequences. The fact that a strong portion of the film (about 2/5's) comes entirely from a Cambodian man's viewpoint might throw off a few viewers here and there. And yet, the film does just as fine a job as any anti-war film in creating a frightenining, chaotic world.The performances all around superb without exception. Haing S. Ngor, who was tragically killed a few years ago, delivers a riveting, emotionally wrenching turn as the guide who is trapped in Cambodia and forced to fight for his life. He deservingly won the Oscar, though it's a shame he was snubbed for the best actor award. Inarguably, he's the film's central character and he also has more screen time than top-billed Sam Waterston. Despite my complaint on that matter, Waterston is also excellent as the journalist with a guilty conscience.The Killing Fields is a suspenseful and exhilarating experience, a journey through an apocalyptic landscape that features one shocking image after another. Watch, and you'll see why the film is so acclaimed.",Null,121,146,7 November 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A grand, exciting adventure.
","8 out of 10In a year filled mostly with weak movies, The Lord of the Rings clearly stood out as one of the best.  It also represents something we've been missing: a big-budget, massive scale fantasy/adventure that gives us an awe-filled quest, terrifying creatures, and plenty of sword-clashing battles. As an introductory tale, there are the usual flaws, mostly in terms of (initially) awkward characterizations.  But the movie finds its right footing once the fellowship is formed.  As such, you can expect thrilling action sequences (the Mines of Moria and the climactic battle in the forest are the standouts), magnificent special effects, and fine performances (Orlando Bloom as Legolas was my favorite) that bring these classic characters to life.  Peter Jackson's confident and assured direction nicely builds momentum as the plot moves forward.  Special mention should go to composer Howard Score, who's crafted the best pure adventure score since John Williams work in the Indiana Jones series.",Null,0,1,4 December 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," A thrilling conclusion, but still a huge miss on the wide opportunities given the premise.
","*** out of ****As the concluding film of an epic saga, The Matrix Revolutions is certainly more satisfying and thrilling than the likes of, say, Return of the Jedi or Back to the Future Part III, but its accomplishments are almost entirely in the visual sense; this is a sensational action experience, complete with epic battle scenes and a showdown for the ages.  There's barely any focus on the Matrix this time around, but in my opinion, that's okay, the previous films have already squandered enough opportunities that I don't mind (and even actually prefer) the switch of attention to Zion and the war against the machines.For those who haven't seen the previous installments, good luck trying to catch up.  When we last left off in The Matrix Reloaded, Neo (Keanu Reeves) fell into a coma after displaying the surprising ability to destroy sentinels in the real world.  He's currently trapped in a place between the Matrix and reality, a squeaky clean subway station run by the uncouth trainman (Bruce Spence).Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) team up with the Oracle's protector, Seraph, to rescue Neo.  Meanwhile, there are two burgeoning problems; an invasion force of 250,000 sentinels drilling their way into Zion and the ever multiplying Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), who's quickly taking over the Matrix.  You can see where this is leading.Much like Reloaded, most of Revolutions' glaring faults are in the first half.  There's slightly less philosophical babble this time around, but the constant questions and debates are as tiresome and silly as before. Returning is the Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) and his wife Persephone (Monica Bellucci), and while they're not saddled with the heavy-handed philosophy they were forced to utter in Reloaded, the minute screen time they're give suggests that the Wachowskis had no idea what to do with these characters.  I would have liked at least a mention of the Merovingians' thoughts on Smith's rapid multiplication, but we don't even get that much.
Nearly as annoying is Neo's final meeting with the Oracle (this time played by Mary Alice, who's just as good as Gloria Foster was), where the answers that are revealed are purely anticlimactic.  Like most others, we all wondered why Neo had the power to destroy the sentinels; the answer makes no more sense than anything else the Oracle says.  Most frustrating of all is that the Oracle could easily have revealed to Neo all the information the Architect laid upon him, thus rendering most of Reloaded's running time and plot rather pointless, but instead gives some b.s. remark about how Neo wasn't ready to be told, but in typical 'Oracle-style' fashion, gives the answer in a question form that has Neo responding to his own query in a lamely introspective manner.As Revolutions' plot progresses, there are several hints and plot strands that intrigued and frustrated me.  The Oracle mentions that Smith is Neo's opposite, the result of the equation balancing itself.  I gather this implies that the five previous 'Ones' had opponents similar to Smith, perhaps even Smith himself, as there is a line between him and Seraph that suggests at past rivalry (and led some to believe that Seraph was a previous One, not entirely an impossibility, given the color code he emanated in Reloaded, but not something I care to ruminate about at the moment). Unfortunately, it's merely a line that's never expanded on, we know little more than we did before.For this installment alone, I would think the most wasted opportunity was in not displaying Smith's rapid multiplication.  By the end of the film, he's taken over the entire virtual world, imagine the chaos and terror the population must have experienced at the sight of a man constantly replicating himself through human hosts.  I can't believe the Wachowski brothers didn't see the gold mine they were standing on with this potentially terrific subplot, but like many other aspects of the series, they simply avoid it.But the first hour is still more bearable than the similarly draggy moments in Reloaded; there are several cool scenes, like the end result when Neo tries running out of the subway or the shootout in Club Hel.  There's also a more palpable feeling of suspense, what with the imminent destruction of Zion.Where the film really takes off and almost never loses its footing from here on out is the Zion battle sequence.  It's a fabulously thriling and intense setpiece, as the sentinels bear down in droves into the dock and are, for a short while at least, held at bay by a massive army of APUs (many claim they're inspired by Aliens, but they're more similar to anime designs that existed prior to the James Cameron flick) and machine guns.  The twenty-minute battle is split three ways, but it's definitely the dock segment, which heavily resembles Starship Troopers, that delivers the most thrills.  I was particularly taken by Nathaniel Lees kick-ass Mifune, whose gung-ho attitude is exhilaratingly infectious.The battle still raises at least one major question; (mild spoiler) it's suggested at one point that one of the returning ship's EMP could knock out part of the invading force of sentinels.  Sure, it's something that should only be considered as a last-minute contingency plan, but shouldn't the Zion army have at least kept one of the ships behind in the most likely case that such an act of desperation would be needed?The non-stop action continues with Neo and Trinity's journey to the Machine City, leading to the trilogy's most purely awe-inspiring scene, the beautiful sight of sunlight.  The Wachowskis also have the cajones to kill off major characters, and I cared enough about the leads to be moved by their sacrifices.The climactic action sequence, the showdown between Neo and Smith, is a classic case of repetition.  Return of the Jedi had the same problem, considering it involved attacking yet another Death Star.  But the grievance here is to a far lesser extent as the fight does boast more than enough variety to separate it from the previous Neo/Smith brawls.  That said, the first half of the sequence is great, full of rousing choral music and slick martial arts choreography mixed with stylish slow-motion and freeze frame shots (one gets the feeling, though, that all this would have been utterly mind-blowing four years ago, and not just a blast to watch).  I especially loved the setting and look of the scene, the dark green tint and pouring rain amidst the lightning-wracked sky.Unfortunately, the latter half of the brawl is less satisfying, with Smith prattling on about the pointlessness of Neo's struggle.  Seriously, I just want to see the supermen duking it out, there's no need to strive for the greater meaning here.  The overall conclusion is satisfying enough on an initial viewing, but raises more questions than are answered.For one, I think it's safe to assume that everyone in the Matrix is at least a little leery and suspicious of their world, they've just seen a man in sunglasses absorb the entire population.  Thus, it's likely many will come to the conclusion that their world is a fabrication.  (Major spoiler) The Architect's final words, stating something along the lines of the fact that anyone who wants to be freed will be freed resolves nothing, making one wonder why machines had to even use humans as batteries in the first place.As I write this review, I realize I've spent more time harping on the movie's faults, but the truth of the matter is that I had a great time watching this film.  Taken purely as a sci-fi action epic, it delivers first-rate excitement and thrills and moves at a much faster pace than either of its predecessors.  Sure, it barely touches on the concept of the Matrix, but I'd rather fault that with Reloaded, as Revolutions' primary intent was to conclude the saga with battles and brawn, and not to further dwelve into the fabricated world of the Matrix.",Null,1,2,8 April 2004
Lilo & Stitch," Disney's most satisfying animated offering to date.
","**** out of ****Shrek, that Dreamworks film about that green ogre, had a wicked sense of humor that must have made an impression on animator Chris Sanders, who peppers his latest film, Lilo and Stitch, with his own brand of quirky humor.  But unlike Shrek, Sanders was also concerned with mixing in realistic human characters and strong, endearing emotions. The result paid off superbly, for everyone, as Lilo and Stitch happens to be one of the best animated films I've ever seen.Experiment 626 is an abomination of nature, a creature whose only function in life is to destroy.  But he escapes his captors by commandeering a spacecraft and crashlands on Earth, specificall Hawaii, where he's befriended by Nani and her younger sister, Lilo, who dubs this newfound pet, Stitch.  With his creator, a mad scientist named Jumba, on the trail, Stitch tries to evade his would-be captors while trying to adopt to his new family, torn between his genetic purpose in life and this warm environment he's been introduced to.With Disney slumming as of late, they've revived themselves the past year with this effort and the underrated Treasure Planet.  Lilo and Stitch offers a little bit of something for everyone: an unbelievably cute 'hero' in Stitch, believable and engaging human characters, a touching and well-delivered message, and some of the most beautiful traditional, hand-drawn animation I've seen.  For nearly an hour, much of Lilo and Stitch's humor is...different, to say the least. I should also mention I haven't laughed so hard during a movie in a long time as I did watching this film.  Stitch, perhaps Disney's most memorable character to date, is a mischievous fellow, but such an adorable one, too, that he wins us over even if he's such a destructive little tyke. The same goes for Lilo, whose initial abrasive attitude is a little disconcerting, but much genuine effort is made to develop her and her older sister into flesh-and-blood characters and it works.The film eventually won me over entirely with its heartfelt of message of the importance of family, which is delivered with surprisingly little sentimentality, a virtual first for the Mouse House company.  And just when you think the movie might lose its edge, the last two minutes deliver a simultaneously hilarious and sweet montage of its characters as the seasons go by.  A terrific end to a fabulous movie.  So please, Mr. Sanders, don't spoil it with a lame sequel.",Null,0,1,28 April 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," The best of this year's summer blockbusters.
","**** out of ****I feared the worst for Terminator 3.  It's premise is almost identical to T2's (Schwarzenegger Terminator heads back in time to save John Connor), the ads looked terrible, and on paper, this looked like the pitch perfect example of a popular series ruined by money-hungry studio executives.  While I have no doubt the producers of this film acted out of greed, I can safely say my fears were unfounded.  Terminator 3 is easily the summer's best pure blockbuster.It's been several years since John Connor (played by Nick Stahl) helped bring down Skynet.  But he's still frightened by the possibilities of the future, so he spends his days wandering around, his identity deleted.  Two more terminators are sent back in time, the Terminatrix (Kristanna Loken), a new design sent to assassinate Connor and his future lieutenants.  As before, a Terminator who resembles Arnold Schwarzenegger is sent as Connor's lone protector.  Added into the crisis is Kate Brewster (Clair Danes), whose presence will play a vital role into the fate of the planet's future.The possible signs of sequilitis are present here, but despite essential similarities to T2 director Jonathan Mostow crafts the movie with a look and feel that separates it from its predecessors, but does so without betraying its roots.  That's a pretty fantastic accomplishment.But before I make T3 sound like nothing more than a high-gloss rip-off, the movie does deliver an engaging story filled with genuine surprises and complications.  It works as a continuation of its predecessor's legacy, and surprisingly, this addition never feels the slightest bit gratuitous.
The action sequences are the movie's highlight, especially an astounding car chase that actually puts the one in The Matrix Reloaded to shame.  Expect shootouts and plenty of explosions, but delivered with flair and energy. The last half-hour is virtually non-stop action, and Mostow maintains a high pitch of intensity.  Most impressive of all is the one-on-one showdown between the Terminators, probably the most exhilarating action setpiece I've seen all year.What surprised me the most was the attention paid to the characters.  Nick Stahl's portrayal of John Connor is entirely likeable and convincing, blowing all memories of Edward Furlong's annoying performance to dust. Clair Danes, who I've never been a big fan of, is also quite good as the requisite-but-not-quite love interest (I loved the twist involving her character and the Terminator).  Schwarzenegger puts forth his most memorable portrayal of a Terminator, playing his role with a great sense of circumstantial humor.  T3 is packed with big laughs (the best being the sunglassses bit), thanks mostly to Schwarzenegger's sense of comic timing.  This is his comeback piece, and it's good to see the big lug back and better than ever.  As his villainous counterpart, Kristanna Loken is imposing as the Terminatrix, and bound to drive male teens crazy with her great figure (her nude scene frustratingly shows very little).Terminator 3's countdown to worldwide armageddon adds a sense of desperation its predecessors were missing.  The suspenseful build-up concludes satisfyingly in an ending that actually surprised and delighted me.  Sure, the set up leaves another sequel a possibility, but I actually can't wait for a Terminator 4.",Null,0,0,6 July 2003
The Patriot," Enjoyable, but easily the worst of Gibson's war epics.
","Rating: ** 1/2 out of ****Everything about The Patriot screams epic: the cinematography, the battle scenes, the score, the costumes, the sets, everything that is except for the script, which relies so much on overused clichés that some scenes are even a little painful to watch. Did we really need the subplot involving the little girl who won't talk to her father? Or the relationship between the racist and the slave and its contrived, 'Hollywood' resolution? The basic story sounds just fine, a father who must join the Revolutionary War to protect his son, but director Roland Emmerich and writer Robert Rodat felt the need to tackle as many 'issues' as possible to make this a true epic saga. It's too bad the screenplay lets the movie down because The Patriot is noteworthy in many respects. Mel Gibson delivers another terrific performance, quite effortlessly, too. This type of character, the revenge-driven family man, is dangerously becoming a stereotype for Gibson (the family man stuff is still in both We Were Soldiers and Signs, sans the revenge). Jason Isaacs proves to be his equal as the delightfully nasty Colonel Tavington, a rather cartoonish role but played with zeal and fervor by the talented and underrated Isaacs. Heath Ledger makes his breakout performance here, but I fail to see what the hype was all about; he's flat and dull, though he's shown marked improvement recently in The Four Feathers.The Patriot features two memorable action sequences, the first is a hair-raising, heart-pounding forest ambush that had me thinking the film would be daring to enter realms Hollywood usually strayed from. Silly me, the rest of the movie was pure Hollywood and seemed to forget all about the at best ambiguous behavior of Gibson's character during the forest attack. The final bloody battle sequence is appropriately rousing, thanks to the well-choreographed mayhem and John Williams' stirring score, but concludes on a somewhat pathetic note, as a certain character suddenly appears to grow eyes on the back of his head (you'll know what I mean when you see it). These first-rate action scenes deserve to support a better, more even film.Before The Patriot, there was the immensely superior Braveheart, a gripping epic that delivered genuine passion, heart, and rousing battle scenes that made the three hour running time fly by. After The Patriot came We Were Soldiers, a riveting look at modern warfare, and its combat scenes were among the best of its kind. So The Patriot qualifies as a bridge between two superior motion pictures. Since it's a crowdpleaser, I have no doubt many crowds will be pleased. But realize that clichés can never be an apt substitute for real drama.",Null,3,4,6 March 2003
Van Helsing," There's some fun to be had, but most of it's buried in this mess.
","* 1/2 out of ****The first fifteen minutes of Van Helsing are promising: a black-and-white prologue depicting mad scientist Frankenstein and his monstrous creation is a nice little homage to the Universal Pictures of past times. It's nicely juxtaposed with the movie's opening action sequence, an exhilarating battle between the titular Van Helsing and the evil Mr. Hyde (a silly special effect, but used well in this opening scene), with plenty of over-the-top stunts that are thrilling to watch.But most of the rest of the film is a complete and utter mess, so much that I wouldn't be surprised if the movie saw an afterlife as a cult classic of sorts. Truth be told, I sort of admire the movie's outrageousness and I honestly can't bring myself to totally hate it, but I sure as hell can't say I liked it, either.Hugh Jackman stars as Van Helsing, the Vatican Church's assassin of evil creatures. A clumsy monologue between Van Helsing and one of the priests serves as exposition, though you would think this conversation is one they would have had a long time ago (yeah, I understand it's to bring the audience up to speed but there are less idiotic ways of doing it). We're also introduced to a secret hideout under the Church with an arsenal of weaponry and inventions.Van Helsing's latest assignment is to head to Transylvania and help the remaining Valerious family (pretty much just Kate Beckinsale) kill the vampire Dracula, who if not vanquished, will somehow prevent the Valerious clan from entering Heaven. Van Helsing's also got another incentive for going: there's an insignia on a paper from Transylvania that looks a lot like the symbol on his ring. You see, he has no memory of his past, except lots of nightmares involving ancient wars he couldn't possibly have been part of (this, too, is clumsily introduced and is something that one would think he would have mentioned long ago). For this mission, Van Helsing brings along friar Carl (David Wenham), a milquetoast inventor but nonetheless faithful companion. Along with Anna (Beckinsale), they set out to end Dracula's reign of terror before he can finish with a plan that could bring to life thousands of his offspring.Beckinsale's introductory scene is also pretty cool (and also very silly), with lots of slow-mo, as she helps her brother fight off a Dracula-controlled werewolf. It's also a decent action sequence in its own right. Soon afterward, Van Helsing's arrival leads to yet another battle scene, this time between the Anna's townspeople and Dracula's sexy brides. This, too, is another passably enjoyable sequence, if also a little overdrawn.Come to think of it, most of the action scenes in this movie are passably competent, but not much more. I did like the coach chase, and I enjoyed almost every scene involving flying vampires (so long as they're not of the baby bat variety). But after a while, it's just overkill, particularly the insane climax, where we actually witness Frankenstein swinging around on rope and accidentally knocking over not one but two villains who are about to kill our heroes on two separate occasions. The baby vampires are also ridiculously lame, and a possibly exciting action sequence set inside an elaborate masquerade conveniently ends very quickly with the use of a 'grenade' (think Blade II).The performances are about what I expected, overdone but fitting. Matter of fact, despite some initially annoying turns catching me off-guard (David Wenham's Carl, for instance), most of the leads actually kind of grew on me after a while. That said, Jackman is a tad bland, surprising when you consider what a charismatic actor he normally is. The gorgeous Beckinsale is fine in her role, even if her cringe-inducing accent isn't. Wenham scores some laughs as Carl, none more effective than a scene where after he's saved a hot chick who asks how she can repay him, he answers with a 'naughty' request. Richard Roxburgh is quite amusing as Dracula, hamming it up in every possible moment and proving quite enjoyable to watch. Kevin J. O'Connor also delivers a few good laughs as Igor, I especially loved his response to why he keeps torturing the werewolf.But there's only so much fun performances can do to keep such a poorly crafted and written film afloat. Lots of questions go unanswered; why would Frankenstein the monster show any feelings for his master when you consider the fact he never even speaks to him (the movie opens with the scientist proclaiming 'it's alive!', then is killed by Drac less than five minutes later, hardly enough time for Frank and the monster to bond)? Why has the Vatican waited so long to send Van Helsing to kill Dracula when considering he's presumably had many assignments beforehand? Why does Van Helsing bring along Carl for this mission? Why does that creepy, white-haired Transylvanian guy stay out in the middle of night when there are vampires and werewolves lurking about? How exactly does Dracula maintain control over his werewolves and why exactly does he even need them? Why is the werewolf antidote confined in such an elaborate manner when it proves to be something Dracula would hypothetically need to take hold of in quick fashion?A few of these questions might actually have been answered but with all the indecipherable accents and loud score and soundtrack, I couldn't tell you. The foley guys must have had a field day cranking up every sound threefold, and Alan Silvestri's overwrought score has this distracting tex-mex style twang in the background. The story, in general, is convoluted, but put together with so little coherency that every time an action sequence pops up, its random appearance is more disjointed than thrilling.The CGI is extremely overwhelming, but instead of creating a visually atmospheric and engulfing environment, it's a goofy example of extreme overload. F/X shots are inserted with little care to their effectiveness, and the film is packed with obvious and annoying CGI stunts. It's actually almost as bad as LXG in this regard, but is at least not nearly as bloated (from a running time POV) and visually plain as Pirates of the Caribbean (which gave us little more than underused CGI skeletons and a lot of plain-looking islands and warships).The movie's super-cheesy final scenes lead me to wonder if Sommers was on crack when he included those last few f/x shots. I hate to say it, but he's now almost on the same level of George Lucas when it comes to pasting together plot, action, and special effects. Hard to believe this is the same guy who gave us the terrifically entertaining The Mummy, but with every successive film, he's actually going further and further away from what made his first blockbuster such a joy",Null,38,73,10 May 2004
Face_Off," Very entertaining, but hardly the best action film ever.
","*** out of ****Easily John Woo's most acclaimed Hollywood film to date, Face/Off is often mentioned among lists of the top action films of all-time. But I can't say I agree, I didn't even think it was the best action film of 1997; that honor belongs to Wolfgang Petersen's nail-biter, Air Force One. What Face/Off has going for it is an ingeniously silly premise and Woo's expert hand at crafting mayhem. Both aspects work well enough to make this a fitfully enjoyable thrill ride, but never quite as satisfying as it should have been.John Travolta stars as Sean Archer, an FBI agent whose son was killed by a terrorist named Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage). After years of exhaustive search, Archer tracks down Troy and his brother, and captures both siblings after a violent shootout. But his brother, Pollux, reveals that a bomb is set to detonate somewhere in Los Angeles, and the FBI have little clue as to the whereabouts of the explosives and when its set to go off.So one agent comes up with a wild idea, and shares it only with Archer and his partner. It appears there's a secret laboratory that has enhanced technology capable of removing a person's face and placing it on another 'patient.' The plan is to place Archer uncercover secretly in prison as Castor, but everything goes wrong when Troy awakens from his coma and takes Archer's face and identity, and even his family life, leaving the real Archer stuck in prison. Knowing this isn't a prison drama, you can guess what's going to happen from there.John Woo is an adept action director and his work in Face/Off is superb. The action rolls at a breakneck pace, mostly with bloody shootouts, much of them employed in balletic slow motion, adding a graceful touch that somehow feels appropriate. There are also exciting fights and even a pulse-pounding boat chase in the finale.Human drama is actually quite effective here, with Joan Allen giving us a solid and likable character who's caught in this whole mess, wondering who to trust and how to escape this nightmarish situation. Nicolas Cage is just as good in creating a likable character in Archer, which is all the more amazing when you consider that he begins the film as a psychotic villain. Even the sexy Gina Gershon brings humanity in a role as a protective, but crime-prone mother. Woo also plays on the whole good vs. evil concept, and it works just fine; there are the requisite doves and, uh, face/offs.
With great action and characters, what's wrong with the movie?Right off the top of my head, it's John Travolta that bugs me the most. Not only is he an overrated actor, he doesn't make a particularly convincing action star. Overweight as he was at the time, watching him perform so many flips and death-defying stunts (obviously done by stuntmen) is too difficult to believe, perhaps even moreso than the silly premise of this film itself! And when the transformation occurs, Travolta's performance doesn't match what Nicolas Cage gave us in the opening. Sure, he's equally off-the-wall and insane, but he's actually just giving us another rendition of his villain from Broken Arrow.The opposite can be said for Nic Cage (for the most part, he does go too over-the-top in a few instances), who actually improves upon Travolta when he becomes Archer, displaying frantic emotions with more urgency and believability. As an action star, he's more physically cut for this kind of stuff. Watching Cage perform balletic flips and outrageous stunts provokes an adrenaline rush, rather than an unintentional laugh.
The whole concept behind the movie is highly improbable, and the film manages to make it seem even more unlikely! As far as dramatic intentions go, the premise works, particularly in a scene where Cage as Archer tries to convince Allen that he's her husband and another scene where Archer's daughter holds a gun toward both men, not knowing who to shoot.
But, man, this story is filled with plot holes. The most noticeable right off the bat is the FBI agent whose ear is shot off in the opening gunfight. When Travolta visits the lab, he sees the scientists and technicians rebuilding this man a new ear. As stated before, this lab is meant to be secret to even the FBI, so how the hell would this agent explain to his co-workers how he got this new ear? Castor (when played by Cage) is a fairly thin man. Archer (when played by Travolta) is a fairly chubby guy. I'd like to know how these scientists made the relatively thin Castor into a chubby guy. Whose idea was it to keep this whole undercover plan secret to the FBI? Sure, I see the need to keep it from leaking to the prisoners, but shouldn't at least the head of the FBI be aware of what's going on, so just in case the unthinkable happens, they'll know how to deal with it. For that matter, how can such a laboratory, full of the latest in high-tech equipment AND holding the world's most dangerous terrorist, be left with absolutely no guards at night? And why the heck did Nick Cassavetes kiss Gina Gershon (who plays Cassavetes' sister) full on the lips from just out of left field (okay, I realize he was a thug and was dying, but how many people do you know would give such a sleazy kiss to their sister as a farewell?).
With so many infuriating plot holes, Face/Off annoys almost as often as it thrills. Admittedly, I had a higher opinion of it before repeat viewings, but the best action films still hold up in spite of implausibilities (Indiana Jones, Speed, Air Force One, The Mummy) because they possess a certain magic that keeps them above the rest of the crop. Face/Off has style to burn and action that gets more exciting as it moves along, but by the end, I just didn't feel that much-needed movie magic that would have attained this masterpiece status.",Null,0,2,25 July 2003
Spider-Man," Decent movie, but marred by miscasting, creaky plotting, and bad CGI (meaning it's got the same flaws as a lot of summer blockbusters).
","** 1/2 out of ****Not too long ago, I was a rather avid fan of the Spider-Man comics, always anxiously awaiting each month to see what new catastrophe our webbed hero would have to face. I stopped keeping track of the stories after the 'clone saga' mess, which is simply one of the worst cases of 'overblown' I've ever read. Then I heard news about a Spider-Man movie, which quickly became reality. It was an event I was neither looking forward to nor dreading. Unsurprisingly, it's a movie that I felt neither unbridled enthusiasm for nor utter disdain. It's about as middling as a decent movie can be.High school student Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a nerdy amateur photographer who's bitten by a radioactive spider, consquently being endowed with arachnid-like powers. He has super-strength, can jump great distances, and maybe best of all, he's got a spider-sense that warns him of danger. With these new abilities, his first acts are only thinking of himself, generally trying to make as much money as possible with his strength and agility.But when Peter's uncle is killed by a robber, he realizes that 'with great power comes great responsibility.' Haunted by his uncle's death, he goes about as a crimefighter, dressed in a red and blue costume, calling himself Spider-Man. A new, even more powerful foe called the Green Goblin arrives on the NYC scene, causing a lot of destruction in hopes of...well, that's not really clear. Meanwhile, Peter has to balance out his crimefighting with his personal lives, particularly with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), a redhead he's got a crush on.The very core of Spider-Man's biggest problem is its casting. While Willem Dafoe is terrific as Norman Osbourne/Green Goblin and J.K. Simmons is a wonderful J. Jonah Jameson, almost every major character is miscast. Tobey Maguire is a mixed bag as Peter Parker. When he concentrates on the dilemma of the mixed lives he has to juggle on-screen alone (or with Dafoe), he's very good, but comes across totally flat when he actually interacts with his co-stars, particularly James Franco and Kirsten Dunst.Speaking of Franco and Dunst, how can these two be so charmless and without emotion? Franco does little more than brood, making one wonder why the more chipper Parker would even hang out with such a guy in the first place (Harry Osbourne was different personality-wise in the comics). Kirsten Dunst is the worst bit of comic book-to-film miscasting since George Clooney as Batman. Mary Jane Watson, arguably the most important character in Parker's life, is now little more than a grating redhead who lacks a discernible personality beyond constant superhero doting.For all that's wrong with the portrayal of those major characters, the origin story is really rather well done. Truth be told, I actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit until Parker suited up as Spider-Man. The character's first CGI appearance is just a total distraction. Perhaps it was unavoidable, but the action scenes look more like cartoons than physical, death-defying showdowns. Unconvincing CGI was probably inevitble, but that doesn't mean I have to accept it.The movie also blows it in regards to the Green Goblin's motives. True, he initially wanted revenge against the board members that voted against him, but what about after that? Maybe the Goblin aspect of Osbourne's personality is power-hungry, but then again, all the Goblin ever does is blow stuff up. Maybe he just likes to see stuff blow up. If so, that's one of the laziest and lousiest villainous motives I've heard to date.Truthfully, not every aspect of the movie's central story or the action is as bad as I make it out to be. (moderate spoiler in this sentence) The dichotomy of the hero and villain is fairly interesting and their final mano-a-mano to the death is rather rousing, even if it ends on an idiotic note (was the Goblin trying to intentionally kill himself in the process of killing Spider-Man?)(he didn't have to get up like he did). But damn, those goofy CGI stuntmen and half-bad acting really put a downer on what should have been an exciting and touching summer blockbuster.",Null,0,0,21 November 2003
Cross of Iron," Weakly written war actioner.
","4 out of 10Cross of Iron bears the marks of director Sam Peckinpah: the traditional death-in-slow-motion, the occasional graphic violence, but it's all for naught when it amounts to little more than an action spectacular.  True, the battle scenes are exciting and superbly choreographed for such a low-budget production, but I like a little more substance with my action.  All the performances, even the late James Coburn, are weak.  Not a single character registered any emotion out of me, except maybe Maximillian Schell, playing a cowardly, glory-seeking officer who you just love to despise.  There's very little plot, nothing more than a WWII German platoon trying to get out of Russian territory, and the ending is a pretentious letdown.",Null,3,10,23 November 2002

Vin Diesel is the head of one particular racing gang that enjoys stealing DVD players off trucks, preferring to do so while the truck is moving at high speeds, perhap for the sheer thrill of it (and spending countless money on NOS, no less).  That's just one of the movie's many idiocies, which would be forgivable if the movie was consistently entertaining.  It's not.Instead of high-octance action, we get too much focus on a plot that's sleep-inducing and actors who look more comfortable posing for a magazine than enunciating dialogue.  Only Vin Diesel makes an impression, though he's certainly not aided by the giggle-inducing dialogue ('You break her heart, I break your neck').  As for the story, it can be summed up as Point Break with fast cars and the idiots who drive them.  Lead Paul Walker is thoroughly unconvincing as the undercover cop and he shares zero chemistry with Jordana Brewster, the girl whose only purpose in the film is to make him lose his edge.  There are a couple of chase scenes near the end that are reasonably fun, but it's too little too late by then.  For truly thrilling, mindlessly enjoyable car chase mayhem, watch The Transporter instead.",Null,0,2,12 December 2002
Pearl Harbor," Pretty much a guilty pleasure
","6 out of 10Pearl Harbor thinks its a glorious masterpiece that meditates the meaning of love, brotherhood, and the loss of innocence.  Sorry, Mr. Bruckheimer, deep this movie isn't.  What he and director Michael Bay have done, however, is craft an extremely entertaining action/romance which at least does partial justice to those who died in the Pearl Harbor attack. 
Yes, my enjoyment of this film is of the guilty variety.  The writing is full of cliches, overblown speeches, and one-note stereotypes with a mediocre love story at the center of it all.  But the performances are all charismatic and surprisingly fitting for a movie set in this time period and the battle scenes are spectacular and visually stunning.  Pearl Harbor obviously wants to be Saving Private Ryan meets Titanic, and it's definitely second rate on both attempts, but being second rate to those films at least means it makes a decent timewaster.",Null,0,1,24 November 2002
Die Hard 2," Easily the most boring film of the series.
","* 1/2 out of ****I tried. Honestly, I tried my best to enjoy this film, the sequel to the slightly overrated but still exciting Die Hard. And this film's sequel, Die Hard With a Vengeance, was simply one of the best action thrillers of the 90's. But Die Hard 2 is the weak link of the trilogy, stupid and silly without the thrills to compensate.Bruce Willis returns as John McClane, the world's unluckiest cop who's relocated to L.A. after the Nakatomi incident (which apparently brought him closer to his wife). Anyway, it's Christmas and he's waiting for the arrival of his wife (Bonnie Bedelia) at Washington Airport, but all hell breaks loose when a team of ex-commandos led by the renegade Colonel Stuart (William Sadler) places the airport under siege, forcing all the approaching passenger airliners to circle around the city until the terrorists' demands are met. Naturally, McClane's going to take the situation into his own hands, especially since his wife is in one of the circling planes that's running low on fuel.All things considered, Die Hard 2's premise isn't half bad; it could make for one really nifty thrill ride if crafted with a better hand. But it's directed by Renny Harlin, who while being technically proficient as an action filmmaker, fails to put any of the extra flair or juice that separates the classics (Raiders of the Lost Ark, for instance) from the pretenders (this film, as a perfect example).There are three major action sequences in Die Hard 2, and they're all relatively small scale and a little underwhelming. The first, a fight in the baggage area between McClane and two of the ex-commandos, is well-choreographed and filmed, but the foley guys must have had an off day. The sound effects for the kicks and punches are only a tad better than what you'd expect from a late 70's chop-socky flick, and this is coming from a film that reportedly cost $70M to make.The other two action scenes are solid enough, a bloody shootout in a terminal that results in quite a massacre, and the climactic setpiece, a fight set on board the wing of a moving airliner, is terrific and the only totally satisfying scene in the whole picture.Thpse two action sequences aside, Die Hard 2 is virtually without thrills. Hindering the film is Steven E. de Souza's script, which calls upon McClane to utter terrible one-liners ('What is this, a tag team?!' 'Just the fax, ma'am.') and pits him agains the airport's own chief-of-security, yet again employing the whole 'hero clashing against superior officers' cliché that marred much of the original Die Hard, but is actually even worse here.That's because the chief of security is played by Dennis Franz, one of the most grating actors on the big screen (surprisingly enough, he's bearable on NYPD Blue). The screenplay sets him up as a lazy, incompetent idiot who can't accomplish one aspect of his occupation with any efficiency. The film, in fact, builds so much tension for the audience against this character that we expect and demand an even worse comeuppance for him than the villains. But the script actually has the cajones to overlook the stupidity of this slob and make him into a requisite good guy at the end.While Bruce Willis is fine as John McClane, it's the supporting cast that irks me. Almost everybody outside the lead role is completely unmemorable or stupendously awful. The former applies to William Sadler and Fred Dalton Thompson and the latter is exemplified by Art Evans, whose acting skills have convinced me that I can also appear in over fifty films by uttering dialogue as if though I'm reading it off a cue card. This is one of the worst performances I've seen, period.With little in the way of exciting action or plot, Die Hard 2 is clearly the worst of the much vaunted action trilogy, and will probably still retain that dubious honor when Die Hard 4 is eventually released.",Null,6,13,21 April 2004
Resident Evil," Nice try, but not as fun as it should have been.
","** out of ****Resident Evil is sort of an unbalanced mixture of old-school zombie horror and new-school filmmaking and special effects.  Everything about the movie has to be a lot faster (except the zombies themselves, somewhat surprisingly), there has to be martial arts complete with even some wire-fu, and it has slimy monsters that are rendered by CGI, not old-fashioned animatronics.  As you can see, I was never particularly won over by the film.Resident Evil opens in an underground laboratory called 'The Hive, a top-secret facility owned by a company called the Umbrella Corporation, situated underneath Raccoon City.  One of the lab workers sabotages the place, shutting the power down and unleashing a deadly virus that kills its victims and brings them back as zombies.We then cut to a cutie naked chick (Milla Jovovich) called Alice, who awakens in a bathtub inside some large mansion; not only is she unclothed, she's also suffering from a mild form of amnesia.  Before she can collect her bearings (though she has enough time to put on a dress), an elite military task force barges into the building, taking her and an outsider (Eric Mabius) to the underground facility, directly connected to the mansion.  Their mission is to shut down the Red Queen, the computer controlling the lab, but they''ll have to get through flesh-eating zombies and maniacal defense systems to accomplish that.As directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, the same man who crafted the far superior and terrifically frightening Event Horizon, Resident Evil is unfortunately lacking in much of that film's thrills and chills.  Anderson shows an inconsistent hand at staging and filming action sequences; the movie's numerous shootouts and fight scenes are only mildly exciting at best, hampered too often by close-up shots of big guns and expended shells. Worse yet, all the violence is sanitized; there's hardly any blood or gore in this picture.Actually, what's probably most memorable about the picture as a whole is how maddeningly inconsistent it is in terms of pacing and excitement.  For every scene that's fun to watch, there's another that's just plot-stopping, whether it's watching it's watching the survivors move from one bland-looking corridor to another, or Milla Jovovich jump-kicking zombie dogs in slow motion, or a computer program tiresomely going over the very simple zombie rules.There are also some glaring technical faults that I'm surprised were't fixed or edited in post-production, such as an unbearably loud industrial score that blocks out most of the expository dialogue, most of it uttered by Colin Salmon, who if you're familiar with his work, already has a pretty quiet voice that'd be inaudible matched up against anyone else in the cast.The zombies in this movie are your basic 'pale and rotting skin' undead, some with the occasional missing bits of face and flesh.  Unfortunately, the zombies in this film have goofy-looking mechanical movements, as if though their joints were so stiff, they could barely show much in the way of mobility.  Maybe it's the effects of rigor mortis, but this makes zombies far less enjoyable to observe.Most of the cast ranges from non-descript to just plain awful.  Easily the worst of the bunch is Michelle Rodriguez, whose only distinct trait is a perpetual frown; she's given a lot of macho dialogue, but Jenette Goldstein she is not.  Surprisingly, it's Jovovich who stands out as the film's kickass heorine.  Sure, she's not much of an actress, but she's got the physical stuff down pat, for the most part.  And she's cute enough that I don't mind seeing her in a slinky red dress, as well as a couple of scenes that briefly reveal some of her naughty bits.Because there's hardly any gore, Resident Evil doesn't really work all that well as a zombie flick.  And because it's not scary, horror is out of the question, too.  But being a zombie fan, I'm prone to forgiving movies of this ilk simply because I'm pretty easy to please.  Resident Evil is a passable enough timewaster, worth a rental, but it's certainly nothing I'll ever give much thought to again.Compared to the recent spate of zombie horror, Resident might very well be the most lackluster of the bunch.  It's never as intriguing or intelligent as 28 Days Later or as marvelously thrilling as the Dawn of the Dead remake and it's never as hilariously enjoyable as the misguided House of the Dead, proving that mediocrity really can be less entertaining than plain awfulness.",Null,1,2,2 April 2004
Independence Day," Mindless entertainment isn't a bad thing, but this one's still pretty weak even at that.
","4 out of 10Collaborators Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin have time and again proven themselves the most unoriginal filmmakers working in Hollywood today. Independence Day is the epitome of their lack of ideas, as they simply steal concepts from previous movies (better or worse movies is still questionable) and graft it here, typical so that it can lead to stuff getting blown up real good.  That is the extent of Independence Day's appeal, to see things blow up, and believe me, that can get old real fast.A lot of things about the movie have always bothered me, whether it's the unnecessarily lengthy countdown the aliens have toward destruction, as it gives ample time for city-dwellers to escape.  Or perhaps it's how pathetically easy the aliens are to defeat once their shields drop.  Are we to assume that raggedy groups of inexperienced combat pilots could suddenly defeat the ferocious (and far numerous) swarms of alien fighters?  Perhaps taking the cake is the very fact that the alien motherships, when destroyed, actually crash by slanting sideways so as they won't fall on the targets below them.  The action sequences deliver sporadic thrills, but they get repetitive very quickly, as it's mostly watching fighter jets and alien spacecrafts blow up. Some variation, perhaps infantry combat, would have been nice.  I think it says a lot about Independence Day when I state that it happens to be the 3rd best alien invasion flick of 1996 (the superior ones being Star Trek: First Contact and The Arrival).  When you realize how rare alien invasion movies are, then it's obvious that being 3rd best is a dubious remark.  There's been talk of a sequel for years now, but come on, do we all seriously believe that won't be a bad film, either?",Null,8,15,7 March 2003
Blue Crush," Fluffy entertainment, no more and no less.
","** out of ****Maybe it was just the fact I was in the mood for something lightweight and melodramatic, but I found myself oddly entertained by Blue Crush.  That's not to say I give it a strong or even cautious recommendation.  Hell, I'm not quite sure what to say, except that I found the cliched story mildly enjoyable and lead actress Kate Bosworth both quite pretty and talented.Bosworth stars as Anne Marie, a hotel maid in Hawaii who lives with her two friends (Michelle Rodriguez and someone I don't recognize) and her younger sister, Penny (Mika Boorem).  In their spare time, she and her friends surf, particularly as practice for the upcoming 'big' competition that you know is going to pad out the lengthy conclusion.  Anyway, complications arise when Anne Marie finds herself falling for a handsome pro football player (Matthew Davis) who's arrived for the pro bowl.  Which will she place above all else, her newfound boyfriend or the big surfing competition?As far as lightweight entertainment goes, Blue Crush delivers just enough that you won't feel you've completely wasted almost two hours of your life. This is thanks mostly in part to Bosworth's performance, she's sympathetic and likeable, showing hints of a promising career.  Then there's Matthew Davis, who's shown he can deliver a good performance (Below, for instance) and is okay as the pro quarterback, but more importantly, he and Bosworth actually have some decent chemistry together.  Most people consider the movie's anchor to be the surfing sequences.  Aside from a scene of horrible CGI, these setpieces are lovely to look at and shot quite well, but they are repetitive, and by the final competition, it just drags uncomfortably.  Amidst the story are the typical cliches, including a scene in a bathroom stall that you just know right from the get-go how it's going to pan out.  Aside From Bosworth and Davis, the rest of the cast is serviceable at best. Michelle Rodriguez continues her 'angry chick' acting and she's not very good at it, either.  Mika Boorem is a talented young actress, but there's nothing here to stretch her acting chops.  It's easy to see how Blue Crush became a minor box office hit.  The 'girl power' story draws in the scores of teenage girls and the tantalizing promise of girls in bikinis will have the guys salivating.All this comes at the expense of the portrayal of the men in the story, who are almost exclusively seen as hot-headed, rash, and uncleanly.  Only Davis shows some honorable qualities but even he is revealed to be a bit of a wild guy.  Still, complain as I might, Blue Crush did entertain me for most of its running time, and I guess that counts for something.  As Saturday night rental fare, this is a movie that should go down fairly easily.",Null,1,2,24 April 2003
Saving Private Ryan," A harrowing and powerful experience.
","**** out of ****
Five years can really put a lot in perspective. At the time of its release, Saving Private Ryan was the talk of the summer. It introduced a new gritty style of war filmmaking that was only occasionally glimpsed at before. The acclaim was virtually unanimous, I'd never seen so many critics place one specific film at the top of the year-end-best list. Five years later, SPR has suffered a minor critical backlash, not too dissimilar from Forrest Gump or even Titanic (two movies that I largely adored as well). It's now considered the most overrated war film. Forget critics or the Razzies, immense popularity can do more damage than those two combined ever could in droves.The question is: how good is this movie? I've seen it three times. Twice in theaters and another time on DVD, after it became a perennial punching bag for Spielberg haters, who came to see it as all that represented what was wrong with the popular director. For me, nothing's really changed. It's still a harrowing experience, I still find myself quivering and shaking by the film's conclusion, but I'm not unwilling to concede the film's faults. Five years (of which I've become a more demanding, even pickier, moviegoer) and three viewings have made that clear enough to me.Most people probably know the film's basic premise, so I won't go into a detailed explanation. Tom Hanks stars as John Miller, a WWII captain who leads seven men into enemy territory to search for a Private James Ryan, whose three brothers were killed in combat. Their orders are to relieve him of duty and bring him back immediately. Unsurprisingly, many obstacles hinder their search, to the extent the men question whether finding the private is worth the sacrifices it will take to reach him.The central premise is what keeps the film standing out from the rest of the genre. It's rare to see a war film driven by plot when it's usually a random series of events, typically battle scenes, that hold these movies together. The premise is simple, but it's effective. Whether eight lives are worth risking to save one is enough to spark a debate that probably won't reach any satisfying conclusion. Everyone's got their own opinion on the matter, myself included, but it's to the film's credit it at least made me question the topic. Viewers should at least be open-minded enough to absorb the film's moral quandaries, they're partially the glue that holds the film together.The camaraderie and interaction among the eight soldiers is that other piece that completes the film. There's an equal mix of humor, tension, respect, and pathos between these men. Robert Rodat's script lays out each supporting character nicely, they may initially read like stereotypes, but the performers bring them to life. With that said, SPR boasts one of the best ensemble casts I've ever seen. Among the eight soldiers, there's not a single weak performance in the lot. Even the annoying Jeremy Davies comes through, mainly because his character's supposed to be annoying (and, at one point, the lone voice of sanity in, ironically, a world that deems his actions cowardly)(spoiler: oddly enough, the film later goes on to show him kill the man he earlier defended, what this is supposed to speak out about his previous actions, I'm not entirely sure, other than war can lead to extenuating circumstances).That's not to say I liked every aspect of the film's storytelling. I'm not sure whose idea it was to give us those flashback bookends, but while they weren't grating, I'm not sure they're necessary, either. I even see the point of those scenes, Spielberg clearly wants to tie in our feelings in the present and connect us to the past. In that sense, the scene works, and you do question who the old man is in the beginning, but one gets the feeling it's somewhat superfluous.  Spielberg's greatest criticism has been his need to display sentimentality. SPR is no different, there's a bit of emotional manipulation in the final moments, but to say it didn't affect me would be a complete lie. I was endeared to the characters, and their deaths were shocking, sobering, and saddening.The battle scenes are virtually without peer. The furious intensity of the combat footage surprised me. Prior to SPR, Platoon was the most intense war film I'd ever seen and the battle scenes in that film almost look plain in comparison to the work accomplished here. It's gritty, bloody, uncompromising, and disturbing, exactly the way war should be. The level of violence has been repeated over the years (most recently in 2002, when Black Hawk Down, We Were Soldiers, and Windtalkers all aimed for the same level of graphic realism), but has never been quite used as effectively as it has been here, a lot of that having to do with attention paid to plot and character.In the lead performance, Tom Hanks feels like an initially odd choice to play a U.S. captain. For some reason, I keep picturing Harrison Ford in this role (and who knows what he could have accomplished with it, especially after seeing his interesting work in K-19), but Hanks is fine. For all intents and purposes, he delivers a great performance, perhaps the most powerful one of his career, but Rodat's script puts a few too many John Wayne-ish tendencies into Miller. The man achieves three-dimensional characterization mostly because of Hanks' touches.The ads and trailers clearly show that the platoon finds Ryan; I think I would have preferred not knowing that going into the film, might have added to the suspense and certainly would have given an extra edge to the moral questions surrounding the plot. Matt Damon's performance as Ryan is quite good, but yet again, Rodat's script makes him into almost a cartoonishly unselfish and honorable character. But Damon is convincing enough that some of his more one-dimensional actions didn't bother me much.First-rate direction and acting go a long way in covering script deficiencies, and while Rodat's script is definitely the most flawed aspect of the film, it's still a well-written story of well-developed characters who risk and sacrifice their lives not only to save a man, but so that we could enjoy the freedom we almost take for granted these days. Lauding heroism in war movies is an easy sell to mass audiences but tough to win over the critics who generally hold the opinion that war produces no heroes. Maybe not intentionally, but it's undeniable that the men who fought were braver than I could ever hope to be.",Null,9,16,3 November 2003
The Transporter," The Transporter proves action movies can still be fun.
","*** out of ****The Transporter has little in the way of plot or character development. That alone will put off a lot of viewers, but for those looking for a slice of thrilling escapism, there probably won't be a more enjoyable pure action film all year. The filmmakers here have accomplished with a very moderate budget (30 million) that most big-budget blockbusters can't with three times the amount, and that is to work as a consistently entertaining thrill ride from beginning to end.The imperturbably cool Jason Statham stars as Frank Martin, a transporter who follows three rules. Unfortunately, he breaks his most valued code: never to look at the package. What he finds in the trunk of his car is a young, beautiful Chinese woman (Qi Shu) named Lai. She eventually tags along with him, as various thugs and henchmen try to kill him and retrieve her. From there, it's one brawl after another all the way to the film's eighteen-wheeler finale.Corey Yuen has always been an exceptional action director, and this time around, he stages some of the most memorable fight scenes of his career. Most particularly, I'm referring to the oil-slick fight, a delightful setpiece that displays a kind of (intentional) sloppiness that's refreshingly fun to watch. The high-speed finale pays homage to License to Kill and Raiders of the Lost Ark, boasting spectacular stunts and fast-paced mayhem. The film's last half-hour or so is virtually non-stop action, delivering the sort of virtuoso choreography that most of today's American action films lack (Equilibrium being a major exception).Overall, there's not much to say about the acting. Matt Schulze is terrible, as always, and Qi Shu struggles with her English (though she and Statham make for a surprisingly decent romantic pair). The lone standout is Statham, who's I'm convinced will be the next big action star. He has more charisma than Vin Diesel and is also a more physically agile performer, able to show off plenty of fancy martial arts moves in a completely believable fashion, even if he doesn't actually know any martial arts (who knows, he might). The Transporter's story isn't anything special. From what I gathered, it's about illegal smuggling and people being made into slaves. Basically, it's a script perfect for typical action fodder. A great story isn't necessary to enjoy The Transporter, which succeeds because of Statham's charismatic performance and Yuen's fabulous action sequences. The Transporter is tight and fast-paced, lots of fun, and a must see for action fans.",Null,0,1,3 April 2003
Seabiscuit," A bit dry, but still a decent feel good drama.
","Rating: ** 1/2 out of ****Seabiscuit is the epitome of the kind of film the Oscars generally award: it's packed with respected and talented actors, it's an underdog story, and it's a 'biopic' of sorts. But in this day and age, it apparently takes a little more oomph than this kind of film has to take home the best picture statuette (this was easily the least critically acclaimed of all the films nominated for best picture in 2003).But it's also those same elements that make Seabiscuit an appealing film, one that's generally easy to enjoy and appreciate. The film tells the story of three men in the 1930s Depression-era whose lives merge after they've been beset by tragedy and heartbreak. Self-made millionaire Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) takes an interest in horse racing and hires Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) as the trainer. Smith is a tad old, but it's the horse and jockey that spectators question. Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) is too tall and the horse, Seabiscuit, is too small, but Smith sees the same fighting spirit in both of them and sets out to make winners of this unlikely pairing.And since this is clearly the story of underdogs who give their all, there's nary a single moment in this film that's not predictable or even slightly manipulative in one fashion or another. In a less well-crafted and well-acted film, such blatant incursions would have been unforgivable, but the film succeeds admirably for the majority of its running time.I still have a number of issues with the film, namely in its opening 1/3, which sets up the lives of our protagonists. Pollard's, in particular, is probably given too much extraneous focus; early scenes with his parents, obviously meant to tug the heart, just don't have that effect because we don't know these people. Worse yet, there's no emotional payoff, when the parents say 'We'll be back' but we ultimately end up never hearing from them again, I wondered why writer/director Gary Ross went to the trouble of even including his parents in the picture (the later quotes from famous works of literature that Pollard recites from his childhood adds absolutely nothing to the picture).In comparison, the film's more interesting characters, Charles Howard and especially Tom Smith, are given the short shrift, particularly Smith, whose brief set up mostly consists of him riding and lassoing horses. Unsurprisingly, because they've got more interesting (in quality, certainly not in quantity) material to work with, Jeff Bridges and Chris Cooper deliver far superior performances over Tobey Maguire. It's a bit unfair to compare Maguire to two highly experienced pros, but in this day and age when child actors can hold their own among the older crowd (as Max Pirkis amazingly did in Master and Commander), I expect more from even a dullard like Maguire.The training scenes are among the film's most amusing, best of all is a hilarious off-screen encounter between Seabiscuit (the horse) and a goat. The payoff is predictable, but undeniably priceless. The film's horse races are directed with a nice sense of energy and are sometimes a little suspenseful even when the outcome is never in doubt. Marring such scenes are the obvious moments when camera angles are used to obscure the fact that a stunt double is being used in the more dangerous moments instead of Maguire. The film slowly stumbles in its final act, which drags interminably until we reach the admittedly rousing and triumphant finish, which wisely concludes before the proceedings get sentimental. This is not the masterpiece the studio would like you to believe and it lacks much of the passion that the best underdog stories have, but it's still a decent accomplishment that displays strong efforts from almost all involved.",Null,5,10,6 May 2004
Men in Black II," Completely unoriginal sequel.
","4.5 out of 10Director Barry Sonnenfeld's sequel to the popular Men in Black is a total retread, without a whit of originality.  Will Smith once again stars as Agent Jay and this time he's got to bring back Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) from retirement to help him find the Light of Zartha or the Earth will be destroyed.  That's as far as it goes in terms of plot and as you can tell, it's not that different from its predecessor.  The movie fails to explore its fun premise by extending new ideas, it's basically all formula, designed to ensure the masses will churn in their hard-earned cash.  Consequently, boredom eventually sets in when you realize the movie almost never offers any surprises or fun ideas.The movie isn't, however, a total bust.  The opening, involving a giant alien worm, is an enjoyably wild sequence.  Will Smith's performance is energetic and likeable and he does manage to squeeze off a few good laughs here and there.  There are also a couple of genuinely fascinating concepts the movie introduces, such as the miniature globe that's actually another planet altogether and an alien race living in a train station locker that worships the keyholder as their god.  And yes, the final scene is very cool, and makes a good set-up for another sequel.  Let's just hope they follow through on it the next time.",Null,0,1,3 December 2002
Mission: Impossible II," It's not Mission: Impossible, but for me, it was still lots of fun.
","*** out of ****Maybe it was because I was in the mood for a blockbuster action thriller or maybe it's because I was never a huge fan of the original film in the first place, but Mission: Impossible II satisfied my craving for an adrenaline rush, and on that basis alone, I highly recommend it.  Put it this way, if you enjoyed the first M:I for its emphasis on teamwork and convoluted storytelling, then don't even bother with the sequel, as the credited director John Woo should give you a damn good idea of what to expect.Tom Cruise returns as IMF agent Ethan Hunt, our intrepid spy who now appears to have a knack for rock climbing and martial arts.  His assignment is to recruit thief Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton) to go undercover for the agency to spy on renegade agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) and his formidable army of henchmen.  Ambrose has plans of becoming a billionaire, but in doing so, could cause great devastation to the population of Australia.  Naturally, it's up to Hunt to rescue the girl, kill the bad guy, and save the day.
Through and through, M:I-II never feels like anything less than a Woo production.  Almost all his signatures are here: balletic slow motion, two-fisted guns a'blazing, flying doves, and a sort-of gun standoff.  The only thing missing here is the countless gallons of blood we've come to expect.  M:I-II, as it turns out, is his first and only PG-13 production, and the lack of ultraviolence didn't bother me in the slightest.What is less forgivable is the almost utter lack of action in the first seventy minutes.  Well, that's not entirely true.  There is that climbing sequence and the car chase not long thereafter, but Cruise doesn't even stand off against his first true nemesis until after an hour in.  What's to hold our attention until then?  Maybe the plot, if you're into typical Bond stuff, which is exactly what this story is, typical Bond material.  We've got the almost megalomaniacal villain (he doesn't want the world, but he wouldn't mind devastating parts of it to get what he wants), the gorgeous love interests, and a few neat gadgets here and there.When the action hits, M:I-II is almost a non-stop thrill ride, delivering tense gun battles, a fast-paced and simply awesome motorcycle chase (one of my favorite John Woo action scenes), and a fun mano-a-mano duel to the death.  Cruise is completely convincing as a physical action star, he's got the style, the charisma, and the moves.  He's the star of the show, which might disgust some, but he capably carries the production.  Newton makes for a gorgeous love interest, and Ving Rhames is THE man as Luther Stickell, everyone's favorite computer hacker.  Dougray Scott disappoints as the villain, though, he doesn't conjure enough spite and isn't menacing enough.From beginning to end, if there is one consistency to M:I-II, it's how lovely the film looks.  Shot on beautiful locations with a great eye, this is a movie that's always nice to look at.  As such, the film should be enjoyed for what it is, an action blockbuster in the vein of James Bond. Sure, it probably could have used a tad more action in the first half and Woo does go overboard on the slow-mo by the finale, but M:I-II is purely fun stuff, and when the action's on-screen, it's exhilarating.",Null,1,2,20 April 2003
Black Hawk Down," I never thought I'd call a Jerry Bruckheimer production the best film of the year.
","**** out of ****To call Black Hawk Down the best film of producer Jerry Bruckheimer's career might not say much, considering he was responsible for silly action thrillers like Con Air, Gone in Sixty Seconds, and Bad Boys,  but that would be short-selling this amazingly crafted war film, brilliantly helmed by Ridley Scott, a director who's on a critical and commercial streak unlike any filmmaker since Steven Spielberg.The opening scenes, played over the haunting sight of dead bodies, recounts the events that led up to the disaster in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia. In 1993, warlord Mohamed Aidid is more concerned with keeping power than feeding his starving people, claiming the food brought in by the U.N. as his property.  Once Aidid starts attacking American military personnel, U.S. American rangers and the Delta Force are sent in to deal with the situation, namely by capturing two of Aidid's top aides.The mission was estimated to last only an hour, but everything goes horribly wrong when a ranger misses his jump and is wounded.  A black hawk is then shot down, and eventually, the rangers and Delta Force are stuck in enemy territory, engaging in a fierce firefight with thousands of Somali militia that would last 17 hours and claim over a thousand lives.Black Hawk Down is an interesting war film in that it never pushes and force feeds us any moralization or blatant, patriotic flag-waving.  It's not necessarily concerned with giving us the political background, only the chaotic warfare, because let's face it, these soldiers didn't give a damn about politics once the fighting began.  All that mattered at that point was survival and keeping the men next to you alive.There have been plenty of complaints about this film's political stance, that being that it's pro-American all the way, but I can't entirely agree. One of the film's major strengths is the unbiased, neutral manner in whichit views the situation (something that was also accomplished by Steven Soderbergh's Traffic).  After all, the film also shows how the plight affects Somali civilians.  True, the militia is almost a faceless mob, but to the soldiers, that's exactly what it was.  Another strenght is that Ridley Scott never tries to tell us how we should think or feel about United States' foreign involvement.  He simply presents the facts at hand, and lets us resolve everything else with our own opinions and deductions.  To some, that will seem like lazy filmmaking, but I find much to appreciate in a film that's open-minded and willing to respect its audience's intelligence. True, whatever opinion you held about America's involvement in foreign nations may not change, but it says a lot that Scott's film makes you think about it.But for now (meaning the duration of the film's running time), forget about politics.  Where Black Hawk Down excels (and magnificently so) is in the battle scenes, and Scott choreographs some of the best action sequences I've ever seen.  For nearly ninety minutes, we're bombarded with over a dozen firefights, all of which display a gripping intensity that rivals Saving Private Ryan.  The fear of being outnumbered, outgunned, and being killed is presented in a harrowing, all-too-believable fashion that makes this film an effective emotional powerhouse.  Despite frequently going back and forth between several groups fighting in the city, it's a credit to Scott's direction and Pietro Scalia's editing (which received an Oscar, by the way) that the battle scenes remain intelligible and clear, even if it's confusing and hectic for the soldiers.  Scott's aim to show the hell a soldier experiences in combat leaves nothing to the imagination, so be prepared for graphic, realistic violence.Another critical backlash against the film is the so-called lack of character development, with many critics and viewers pointing to We Were Soldiers as a better film overall because of its rich characterizations. I also disagree on this matter, since I found Soldiers' characterizations often corny and unbelievable.  If anything, Black Hawk Down never loses sight of the characters.  It may be a bit unusual for some viewers to see that Scott wasn't striving for a star-driven vehicle, but a team effort, because it was as a team that these rangers and Delta Force fought for their lives.  Even then, there is attention paid to several specific individuals.Coming in top-billed is Josh Hartnett as Sgt. Matt Eversmann, an idealistic, young soldier who's first taste of combat leaves him reeled and conflicted. Hartnett has never been a great, or even especially good, actor, but he's fine here.  Tom Sizemore is excellent as Danny Mcknight, the colonel heading the convoy as they make their way through the streets of Mogadishu.  Ewan Mcgregor brings some humor to the role of Grimes, a coffee-maker who's suddenly been plopped into combat.  He's shaky at first, but never loses his confidence.  As good as those performers are, for me, the best performance of the film belonged to William Fichtner.  Fichtner, always a solid character actor, is simply superb as the take-charge, courageous Sgt. Jeff Sanderson.  With each tense situation, he keeps his cool and strategizes he and his men's way through each firefight.  If I were in battle, this is the kind of soldier I'd want fighting beside me.  The film also plays a developing friendship between Sanderson and Grimes, and Fichtner and Mcgregor have good, palpable chemistry together.The rest of the cast is good, with Jason Isaacs as a strict, but well-meaning captain.  Ewen Bremner plays Nelson, one of two soldiers who gets left behind by the convoy.  His barely contained panic is so effectively conveyed, you almost feel like you're right there with him. Eric Bana is good as the Delta Force soldier trying to retrieve his comrades, and Ron Eldard is fine as pilot Michael Durant.
There is much technical merit to be lauded, with Slawomir Idziak's atmospheric cinematography conveying the haunting, tragic mood. Hans Zimmer's score is among his better work to date, even if parts of it feel a little too derivative of his own work in Gladiator.By the end of this 144-minute experience, it's unlikely you'll ever view modern warfare the same again.  This is a clear display of the fact that the U.S. is not a perfect fighting force (though they certainly, as Roger Ebert put it, 'gave better than they got'), but even more importantly, this is a film that delves in important issues such as foreign involvement, fighting for your mates, and more importantly, the horrors and reality of combat, without ever insulting the audience's intelligence.",Null,1,1,13 July 2002
The Mummy Returns," Tons and tons of action, but it's not that fun.
","5 out of 10Stephen Sommers' The Mummy was easily the most effortlessly enjoyable action/adventure since Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.  So it's with high hopes that I approached the sequel, which is unfortunately a basic overdone retread of the original, with little thought toward plot, character, and most importantly, it lacks the infectious sense of fun the original had.The surviving cast returns, so you can expect more one-liners from Brendan Fraser, who still makes a convincing action hero, but has very little to do here other than slug it out from one action scene after another.  Speaking of action, I don't think I've seen an adventure film packed with so many gunfights, chases, and gargantuan battle sequences.  That's sure to please some viewers, but the action is seriously hampered by Sommers occasional attempt to ape The Matrix (slow motion) and completely, blatantly defy the laws of physics (Fraser outruns the sun!).  The last forty minutes are horrendously silly (let's count down: there's a melodramatic death scene made twice as bad with reincarnation, a Matrix-style fight scene, and a big battle with a CGI Scorpion King and Anubis warriors that looks pretty ridiculous).  Decent rental fare, I suppose, but it pales to the original and any of the Indiana Jones movies.",Null,0,0,1 December 2002
The Mummy Returns," The title says it all: it's an expensive rehash that isn't much fun.
","** out of ****Because of how much I enjoyed the original, I looked forward to the prospect of a sequel to The Mummy; that is, until I noticed the title, The Mummy Returns, which virtually promises this to be a sequel that does little more than rehash its predecessor. Basically, this means the same villains, same setting, somewhat the same story (except bloated exponentially, I'll get back to it later). Damn, I'm starting to appreciate Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom even more. Hell, forget that, TMR makes it even more obvious how great of an adventure movie Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was because that film also took its predecessors basic elements but reworked them into a fresh, cohesive, and smashingly entertaining joyride. As for The Mummy Returns.ugh.Set in 1933 (eight years after the original), Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz reprise their roles as Rick and Evelyn O'Connell. They're apparently super-rich, judging from the luxurious British mansion they live in, so they must have cashed in on all that treasure they inadvertently brought back with them in the final scenes of the original. The couple also have a young son, Alex (Freddie Boath), who's probably more mature than his Uncle Jonathan (John Hannah).Rick and Evelyn's latest `excavation' in Egypt uncovers an artifact that curious Alex clasps to his arm, revealing the location to.gah, damned if I know, suffice to say that Imhotep the mummy will be revived and there's lots of talk of reincarnation, prophecies, saving the world, and big scorpion kings that half look like a WWF wrestler.Therein lies the movie's problem, the messy story, which might have seemed reasonably passable in preconception stages but comes across as totally confusing and confused on-screen. Director Stephen Sommers isn't a master storyteller, but his work in The Mummy clearly shows he has a love of escapist filmmaking and crafted the plot in a simplistic but engrossing enough manner that it didn't get in the way of the characters, the action, or the adventure. He obviously didn't learn his lesson.I'm actually a pretty big fan of the man's work, but this is easily his biggest misfire since The Adventures of Huck Finn. The Mummy Returns is just turgid filmmaking in almost every aspect of its production. Only the likeable cast and the general fact that Sommers is better at delivering pure spectacle than say, the likes of Michael Bay, Joel Schumacher, and Roland Emmerich keep this film generally watchable.But didn't Sommers realize that what would have made this second go-round far more invigorating would have been to place our already beloved characters into a totally different environment with new dangers and villains? He seems perfectly content recycling virtually every aspect of the original film, and then geometrically bloating every little detail into something bigger, which appears to have been the key word going through his mind.Everything about this movie is bigger than the original. There's more action and it's larger in scale; there are more badguys, more special effects, more flashbacks, more Magi, and more prophecies, all this without the much-needed freshness or the rousing sense of adventure.Whenever Sommers gets into a bit of a speed bump in the plot, he simply explains it away with prophecies and reincarnations. Rick O'Connell himself is a bad-ass adventurer, making him into a prophesied warrior destined to save the world puts a bad taste in my mouth. Couldn't they have just kept him a rugged, hunky hero without the mystical crap? Same goes for Evelyn, who as it turns out, is the reincarnation of a murdered pharaoh's daughter, conveniently the same pharaoh killed by Imhotep (why he didn't recognize her in the original is beyond me.oh, wait, that's right, Sommers just made this B.S. up for the sequel). The reincarnation bit does little for the character other than explain why she can suddenly fight so well with sais; why was it included again?  At one point after the hour-and-a-half mark, Sommers knocks off one of the main characters in a scene that would have been genuinely affecting if this same character hadn't been revived by an ancient Egyptian ritual ten minutes later.Cliffhangers can be a lot of fun, but when they're resolved the way they are here, it's like someone's intentionally slapping you in the face. At one point, O'Connell, who's carrying his son in his arms, actually outruns the sunrise. In one of the climactic battles, there are not one, but two instances where characters grab spears that have already been thrown mid-air and one of those moments is shot in Matrix-style slow motion!And thus we segue into the action, which should be the movie's selling point, but is instead a good part of what holds the film back. Off the top of my head, I can't think of any adventure movie so intent on piling on one action scene after another, so much that it becomes a bit of a headache after awhile. I should be in action movie heaven, but Sommers' occasional miscalculated direction makes a lot of the fights and chases pretty boring. The slow motion I've already covered, but a couple of the fights and chases boast too many quick cuts, nothing as extreme as a Jerry Bruckheimer production, but too distracting to make the action genuinely exciting.You remember how in The Mummy, it was damn cool and exciting to see what sort of havoc Imhotep could reek? To find out what cool power he would use next? All he does here is repeat what he'd already accomplished in the first go-round, he `telepathically' lifts people off the ground and tosses them around and instead of making a giant sandstorm, he makes a giant wall of water. Yawn. As far as new villains go, Velazquez's Anck Su Namun is hot, but where the hell was her reincarnated self in the previous movie? The Anubis warriors are pathetically useless and The Scorpion King is just a terrible visual conception.But much as I wish I could hate the movie, I just can't. The cast is just too damned adorable. O'Connell is no Indiana Jones, but he's about as cool and fun a substitute as you can get. Fraser is obviously having a ball in the role, even if he has put on a slight bit of unflattering weight. Rachel Weisz's Evelyn is the best Indiana Jones girl Indy never had. Hell, forget that, she could kick all the Indy girls' asses in a three-on-one match and still come out looking as pretty as ever. Evelyn's my kind of woman: tough, intelligent, beautiful, with all these great qualities wrapped around a warm, caring heart. I think I'm in love.John Hannah is, unfortunately, not as funny as he was before; like the movie itself, his humor's lost its sense of freshness, but he's still a bit amusing and certainly still a charming, greedy doofus. But then there's that crucial casting error, Freddie Boath as little Alex. Kids in action movies tend to be the purveyor that destroys tension and excitement. As a matter of fact, the only kid sidekick I've ever liked was Short Round from Temple of Doom and let me tell you something, Alex sure as hell is no Short Round. He's funny in spurts, but ultimately just not a charming or talented enough actor to pull the role off.A good cast can do a lot for a film, much like what Fraser and Wiesz do here, but while they make The Mummy Returns ultimately a middling experience, it's a little sad to see such fun characters that don't get the movie they deserve.",Null,0,1,10 December 2003
Saw," Despite a good premise and signs of potential talent from James Wan, Saw completely falls apart in the last half-hour.
","Rating: * 1/2 out of **** Opening to acclaim throughout a number of film festivals, Saw became the low-budget horror flick that came out of nowhere and took everyone by surprise. But hype has its backlash, and in my case, I can't say I came out of this film particularly impressed. There are elements in the film worth appreciating, but aside from a few tricky plot twists, it accomplishes nothing that other films haven't done before with more skill and freshness.Getting straight to the point, Saw opens with young photographer Adam (Leigh Whannell) awakening in a bathtub, disoriented and confused towards his whereabouts. As it turns out, he's in a large, dank, grime-filled bathroom, chained to the pipes. He's got a chained companion on the other side of the room, Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes), and in between them lies the body of a dead man.Through a series of clues, Gordon deduces they're dealing with the 'Jigsaw,' a serial killer who finds elaborate methods of forcing his victims to perform a series of grueling tasks, and if they fail, the penalty is death. A message left behind by tape informs Gordon of his task; he must kill Adam in eight hours or his own wife and child will be murdered.It's a good premise, but it's obvious the filmmakers aren't going to make a feature-length production set entirely within a bathroom. Unsurprisingly, it's the scenes set outside the bathroom that the movie first shows signs of faltering. Problem number one is that the sets appear rather low-grade, no surprise given the budgetary constraints. Problem number two is that the movie still wants to keep its villain's identity a surprise. In fact, I wasn't swayed at all upon the initial revelation of the killer, especially when this 'surprise' is still juxtaposed alongside scenes set in the past where the filmmakers' still keep the killer's face hidden.Such twists and turns grow tiresome, all the more so when it's obvious that the killer always (and I mean ALWAYS) has a trick up his sleeve, making the final shock quite obvious moments before its underwhelming unveiling. Hey, I like my serial killer flicks to feature a smart villain as much as the next guy, but it's just plain annoying for them to be all-out omniscient.The scenes set within the bathroom are initially effective. The acting between Elwes and Whannell is convincing enough, with Whannell showing hints of genuine charisma that could serve him well in the future. But all this takes a flabbergasting nose-dive in the last half-hour, beginning with the cigarette scene. It was by this point I wondered if director James Wan was winking at us because prior to this the film was serious in its intent to scare.I can't help but admit that this far into the picture, I started laughing and couldn't stop. I was willing to suspend my disbelief at a lot of the plot, even at the fact that five hours could suddenly pass and catch up on the protagonists (surely, at least one of them would keep better track of the time?), but that the killer would know that at least one of the two men would look inside his wallet and find the right picture and message, and to be aware of how desperate one of them is for a smoke in even such a dank environment and have a back-up plan to test the possible contingency that could result; well, I have to say, it felt like a parody of all the 'smart' serial killer flicks we've seen before, and the acting only goes further to serve that belief.Decent at first, Elwes goes off the deep end in the movie's climax. One has to question how someone would truly respond in such a situation, so I'm not going to criticize his acting in that respect. I just can't deny that my immediate response was pure hilarity; Elwes is not a very good actor, but he's competent enough for me to believe he was perfectly aware of how silly he looked and overplayed it for all it was worth. Considering the absence of suspense, I think the laughs go a step or two in making up for it.Also, without giving too much away, there must have been other ways for a certain character to resolve his predicament (like seeking help) if the danger that's posed upon him is slow-acting enough for an incredibly elaborate plan to unfold over the course of many hours. The danger is, in fact, so slow-acting that after all those hours, this man (who should not be a very skilled fighter or marksman) is still capable of engaging and holding his own in shootouts, chases, and fistfights with a crazed and determined ex-cop. Director Wan has potential, but he needs to lay off on camera tricks and realize quick cuts and sped-up camera-work serve as distractions and do little to build genuine scares or suspense. In fact, I was surprised by how easy it was for me to sit through this film. At no moment did I ever feel a sense of dreadful anticipation like I do with the best (or even solidly competent) of the genre. Much of the reason for that has to do with the flashback structure, we're clearly aware of who's alive or who isn't considering we know who's telling the story. It doesn't help that each twist spirals the movie further into a hole it can't dig itself out of, the final strike coming in the last moments with a preposterous surprise revelation. We barely saw this guy prior to this scene, so why make a big deal out of this surprise by going through a pointless flashback? This is one case where an otherwise middling movie is destroyed by a terrible ending.",Null,19,37,21 February 2005
Stalingrad," Stalingrad fails on almost every level it intends.
","* out of ****Joseph Vilsmaier's Stalingrad poses an interesting question: do laughably bad battle sequences ruin an anti-war film? The answer, it depends. Battle scenes take up only a small portion of Stalingrad's running time (two sequences, adding up to just under fifteen minutes total), so these cheesy segments alone can't really bring the film down to complete garbage. But considering how the film fails on every other level, the battle scenes are really just another icing on the cake that dooms Stalingrad as a war film debacle.The story is pretty basic and does little to distinguish itself from most war movies out there. We follow a German platoon as they head into Stalingrad, and follow them through each deadly situation they encounter. Each of these men begin as respectable citizens, but by the end, virtually lose their grip on humanity. Actually, the title might mislead some viewers who think they're going to be seeing a film about the bloody battle of Stalingrad. Like Enemy at the Gates (a mediocre but superior production), the city is used as a backdrop for the catastrophic tides of war.What's wrong with the movie? Okay, just for a moment, ignore the fact that the violence looks like something out of a 60's spaghetti western (the gore wounds look like rubber, the bullet wounds actually sometimes spew sparks instead of blood, so on and so forth). Now we focus on all the other scenes, which as some viewers have noted, are meant to create a hopeless, downbeat feeling. But director Vilsmaier has yet to learn that for such a depressing edge to work, you have to populate your film with three-dimensional characters that are worth caring for, and Stalingrad has none (keep in mind, one guy comes close).Stalingrad displays virtually none of the same qualities as immeasurably superior character-driven war films such as The Killing Fields or Gallipoli, though it certainly aspires to. The acting is second-to-third-rate, with characters who do little to define and differentiate themselves from everyone else. Let's see, there's the up-and-coming Lieutenant, the Guy Who's Afraid His Wife is Cheating on Him, and a few other guys who make zero impressions. The actor who plays the Lt., Thomas Kretchsmann, comes close to creating a genuine persona, but he's hampered by a screenplay that replaces real personalities with cliches. Stalingrad features many other terrible aspects, such as the cheap and obvious sets, the grating musical score, and the general feeling that this is a movie, and not a genuine, harrowing experience, probably the most damning flaw the film bears. Rarely for a moment did I actually feel I was in the the thick of the war-torn city streets or the snow-covered tundras, a detachment caused by all the problems I listed throughout the entire review.
Despite all that's incredibly wrong with the film, the conclusion almost works. The ending alone, a horrifying display of how seemingly inescapable the second world war was, almost creates visceral emotion on the basis of just how cruel and ironic it is (once again, could have been even more effective with great characters)(see Gallipoli for a truly nightmarish, heartbreaking finale). It's during these last few moments that, finally, Vilsmaier shows a competent hand at direction and shows us what he intended the whole time. It's just too bad it took over two hours to get there, and the trip beforehand isn't worth it.",Null,3,23,26 July 2003
Total Recall," Well, it's not a total disaster.
","5 out of 10Total Recall is a movie with good ideas, at least for a while.  The film toys with the belief that memories make us who we are, a concept that's inherently fascinating (and was done with superior execution in Dark City). Recall is a futuristic thriller that stars Arnold Schwarzennegger as an average joe named Douglas Quaid who finds his life in turmoil after a visit to a Rekall center for a 'virtual' vacation.  Seemingly everyone is out to kill him, even his wife and friends, he doesn't know who to trust, but believes the answer to his past lies on Mars.  This Arnold Schwarzennegger action vehicle has a superb opening half-hour, mixing just the right amount of intrigue, bloody action, and dark humor to make for a suspenseful mind-boggler.  Unfortunately, once the film sets on Mars, it's all mostly downhill from there.  Bringing the movie down significantly are a lot of silly subplots focusing on mutant rebels and 'instant atmosphere' machines left behind by aliens.  The mutants, in particular, are extremely annoying, and quite loud and crude.  And we're supposed to be rooting for these guys!Not all is entirely lost in the final 75 or so minutes.  There are a few more plot twists that are genuinely surprising and while the action scenes aren't spectacular or even all that thrilling, the graphic violence is pretty amusing.  The open question to whether or not this entire adventure is just Quaid's dream adds an extra dimension to the film, even if it ultimately never makes much of a difference. Still, when all is said and done, Total Recall isn't all it could and should have been.  Director Paul Verhoeven's over-the-top style doesn't quite fit this intriguing premise and a lot of those subplots should have been excised or rewritten.  The end result is simply a middling endeavor.",Null,1,8,25 December 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Great action, but too inconsistently entertaining.
","** 1/2 out of ****If I were to review The Matrix Reloaded based purely on its action, this would be an easy *** 1/2, maybe ****.  But there's a story here, tons of filler in-between the martial arts battles and car chases, and rather than pushing forward the momentum, it actually drags the film down.  Hard to believe a plot about the surviving human race duking it out with their A.I. 'masters' could turn out so boring, but there you go.When we last left off, Neo (Keanu Reeves) had proven himself to be The One destined to free the human race from the Matrix, an artificial intelligence that has most of the population unknowingly trapped in a dream world.  Those who escaped the fantasy settled to a city called Zion, where they're in preparation for a war against the invading machines.Neo still has his doubts, but none are shared by his lover and companion, Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), nor Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), the man who discovered him.  But Neo, curious to discover what further action he should take, heads into the virtual world to search for the Oracle, who tells him to search for the Keymaker.  Meanwhile, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), formerly one of the Matrix's prime enforcers, has become a rogue program, slowly taking over the system with an interesting reproducing technique.For me, the original The Matrix hasn't held up so well over the years.  I still argue that movie failed to achieve its potential, given such a rich and fascinating premise (which wasn't fulfilled here, either)(this series exists for the action, through and through), and its action sequences were somewhat overrated, similar styles having been accomplished (albeit with less slick and polish) from earlier Hong Kong pictures.  That, and Dark City (a movie which The Matrix borrowed from) beat it to the punch with the concept of memory manipulation.But the movie succeeded enough to at least make me look forward to the prospect of a sequel and that's where Reloaded comes in.  And unfortunately, as fun as the plot may sound, too much of it is shaky and pretentious.  That philosophy would be presented as a major theme is not unexpected, but for it to come across as so dull and uninteresting makes its inclusion heavy-handed.  The scene where Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity debate with the Merovingian drags for far too long.  Unless these characters have something truly interesting or vital to say, they should shut up and get moving (in case these people forgot, there is a countdown to the possible destruction of the only remaining human city).Too much of this series is easy to rag on.  In the virtual world, the Zion humans too easily bring attention to themselves with their tight, dark attire and sunglasses.  The Matrix is capable of manipulating the virtual environment (like blocking the exits in a building with brick walls, which is what happened in the original), but rarely does so even when its use would prove helpful in defeating Neo (and such further obstacles would have made the action even more fun).  The film's lead and hero, Neo, is played by Keanu Reeves, whose acting skills are dubious (to be fair, he has improved over the years and it's not as if though co-stars Carrie-Anne Moss and Laurence Fishburne are any better here).But complain as I might, the action saves Reloaded and makes this otherwise strictly mediocre film worth watching.  The most popular setpiece appears to be the highway chase, a fourteen-minute long spectacle that, for the most part, lives up to its reputation.  It's not the best chase ever (Terminator 3 boasted an even more frenetic and exciting setpiece and Raiders of the Lost Ark still has the most rousing on-screen chase), but it is one hell of a thrill ride.  Coupled with the preceding martial arts battle set in the castle, the non-stop fun lasts about twenty minutes. Not since the Indiana Jones trilogy has a movie delivered non-stop creative and thrilling action for such a long period of time (In Raiders, it was the combo of the snake pit, Indy's battle with the giant Nazi, and the truck chase; in Temple of Doom, it was Indy's battle with the Thugee cult, the mine cart chase, and the bridge setpiece; in Last Crusade, the desert shootout and tank chase), though the more recent Terminator 3 definitely has Reloaded beat on all counts.  Best of all is Neo's battle with the Agent Smiths (played deliciously by Hugo Weaving, who remains the most consistent bright spot in the series), who quickly grow in numbers and have our superhero surround from all sides and angles.  The sequence is a total blast and one of the more entertaining fight scenes I've seen all year (though, once again, the Terminator vs. Terminatrix jamboree in T3 has it beat).  All of Reloaded's action put together adds to about thirty or so minutes, not even a fourth of its running time, but the quality of it is enough for me to recommend the film, even if most of the rest of it is a bit of a bore.",Null,0,0,4 October 2003
Enemy at the Gates," An unsatisfactory war film.
","** out of ****Based on surface look alone, Enemy at the Gates is an impressive production with excellent visuals and a high-caliber cast and crew. Unfortunately, despite the hefty pricetag and technical merit, the film is mostly a mediocre accomplishment, and really, almost all the main cast and crew are at fault.Gates does begin in a very promising fashion. After the flashback pre-credits opening scene, we're thrust into the mayhem of the battle of Stalingrad, and in this seven-minute setpiece, director Jean-Jacques Annaud captures the chaos, the terror, and the outright horror of the fighting, stumbling only when he decides to let James Horner's score drown out every other sound (why is it directors these days feel the need to employ this method?) (worse yet, Horner's score in this scene sounds far too similar to John Williams' work in Schindler's List). From there, the film narrows its focus to two central characters, the sniper Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) and his opponent, Major Konig (Ed Harris). The rest of the film is a game of cat-and-mouse, as well as a tacked on love story that occasionally plays in between the sniper sequences. As far as war films go, Enemy at the Gates fails to deliver. Once again, another film that seems to promise to show the graphic horrors and epic scale of the battle of Stalingrad merely uses it as a backdrop (the other film would be Stalingrad). True, the sniper hunts are fairly riveting in a visceral manner, but never truly engaging because you don't feel for the protagonist. This is mostly the script's fault, which doesn't give Jude Law the opportunity to develop into a full-fledged, three-dimensional character. All we really learn about this guy is his lack of self-confidence, and even though he might be scared, the suspense is confined to a minimum because the outcome of the situation is never in doubt.Ed Harris, unsurprisingly, fares much better as the villain of the picture. Actually, despite playing the obvious bad guy, he creates a rather complex character who isn't as unfeeling and inhumane as he may initially seem. Unfortunately, director Annaud must have been afraid we would have sympathized with him too much so he turns him into a typical monster by the end, definitely the worst move the film makes.The love story honestly isn't of much interest. Law and Rachel Weisz have zero romantic chemistry and every scene that focuses on these two is a complete bore. Joseph Fiennes is on hand to be the third wheel of this supposed love triangle, but nobody else in the film seems to want him around, so why bother? Gates is marred by all sorts of little problems. The editing and pacing is off; for instance, one scene features a Russian sniper briefly leaving his post, then the next, he's suddenly in German hands. We never see him get caught, we're just told so. The sudden move from one place to another occurs often among the characters; it's rather jarring and not necessarily believable considering the snipers that are lying in wait to pick off trespassers.The film never works as an anti-war stance, in spite of the grim tone and the bloody violence, it fails as a romance, and as a game of cat-and-mouse, you never feel the stakes to be as high as they should and you find yourself rooting for the villain because he feels more human and believable (for the majority of the running time, at least) than our so-called hero. For all the elements I listed above, you can find more effective films that employ them with more precision and entertainment value. Enemy at the Gates is really just a forgettable war film.",Null,1,2,5 May 2003
Die Hard," Still pretty entertaining, but hardly a white knuckler.
","6 out of 10Die Hard's plot has pretty much been the springboard for the action movies we see nowadays.  Basically, a group of terrorists hold lots of civiliant hostage so they can steal some money.  The premise has been done over and over and more elaborately than Die Hard, which uses the simplicity to its advantage.  It's one cop vs. a dozen terrorists, nothing particularly hard on the noggin about that.  While the action scenes are well executed, the movie is constantly shot in darkly lit areas, making some of the shootouts and fistfights harder to make out.  But most damning of all is the fact that, off the top of my head, I cannot recall a big-studio action film that featured as many annoying supporting characters as the number in this movie.  There are the by-the-book FBI agents, the idiotic police captain (who, when hearing of a body being thrown at a building, actually suggests it may have been a guy who committed suicide), the drug-addled businessman who's out to save his own skin, and the cutthroat, no-mercy reporter who tries exploiting the story even at the risk of the hostages' lives.  It's hard to concentrate on the action when all I can think of is how each of these characters' is going to get his comeuppance.  It's also pretty insulting to see each of these people act stupid only to drive the plot forward.",Null,6,20,27 November 2002
Army of Darkness," An absolute blast for action/comedy/fantasy fans.
","*** out of **** (theatrical release)
** 1/2 (director's cut)Proving you can't keep a good deadite slayer down, Army of Darkness marks the return of Ash in the third film of the highly popular Evil Dead trilogy. Ash (Bruce Campbell) is no longer confined to the isolated cabin in the woods, now that he's been transported to the 14th century (don't ask), apparently somewhere in England.  He's seen as an enemy by the local Lord Arthur, but quickly becomes hero and savior to the people when he kills a couple of deadites.  Consequently, and in order to return to his time, he's sent on a quest to retrieve the Necronomicon, the Book of the Dead.  What should be a simple task results in the creation of the army of darkness, which Ash must battle to keep evil from spreading throughout the land.Army of Darkness' plot is pure nonsense, sort of a mix of Monty Python and just about every fantasy movie you may have seen.  The entire movie's success is based on humor, and it delivers with consistent comic ingenuity. All traces of horror its predecessors had is all but gone here, those expecting to experience terror with their mirth will be sorely disappointed. Army of Darkness is a silly comedy from beginning to end, and it revels in its silliness.Easily the movie's anchor and probably the only reason I couldn't stop giggling for all 81 minutes is cult fave and comic genius Bruce Campbell. Roles of this kind are perfectly suited for him, and he doesn't disappoint. Whether it's his sharp one-liners, priceless facial reactions, or general good-nature about making a complete fool of himself, Campbell is hilarious as Ash.  This is undoubtedly my favorite performance of his, period.Director Sam Raimi shows off his usual kinetic style, delivering plenty of zooms and swirling camera movements.  Most of the action sequences (and there are a LOT of them) are played equally for laughs and thrills, but probably succeed at the former slightly more successfully than the latter. The only movie I can think of that managed to keep its action completely thrilling while consistently mingled with silly physical humor is Stephen Sommers' The Mummy (which obviously gained inspiration from this movie).As much as I enjoyed Army of Darkness, it's not as if though the movie couldn't have been improved.  Some jokes fall flat and the concept of Ash fighting his evil twin hardly lives up to its full potential. While the intentionally cheesy and fun special effects and make-up effects are perfectly suited for the film, I would have preferred more sets.  Most of the movie is based around one castle (albeit a very large one), without even a small village surrounding it; kind of gives off that low-budget vibe (though it's easily the most expensive of the Evil Dead series).The director's cut attaches another fifteen minutes to the movie, most of which neither hampers the movie nor enhances its enjoyment.  In fact, I would have welcomed this 96-minute cut if not for the alternate ending, which may be more in tone with the trilogy, but doesn't measure up to the hilarious S-Mart finale of the theatrical cut.  As far as comparison with its predecessors, it's different enough in tone to not warrant any comparisons, but what the hell, I'll give one, anyway.  Army of Darkness is more consistently enjoyable than Evil Dead 2 (which wasn't scary and only sporadically funny), but not up to par with the original The Evil Dead (which remains one of the most frightening films I've ever seen).",Null,1,2,12 July 2003
Die Hard with a Vengeance," The buddy action film has never been better.
","*** 1/2 out of ****When one thinks of buddy action pictures, Lethal Weapon is immediately the first film to pop into your mind, since it virtually birthed the genre. Another choice would probably be Midnight Run or Rush Hour, the latter of which somehow took pop culture by storm (I recall my friends going around, shouting 'My daddy once caught a bullet...').  So often left in the dust, probably because it was the third film of a trilogy and strayed quite a bit from its predecessors, is none other than Die Hard: With a Vengeance which, off the top of my head, is the best buddy action film I've ever seen.How can this be?  Better than Lethal Weapon 1 and 2?  Better than Rush Hour? Hell, I'll even say it's better than Die Hard and Die Harder.  Here is a film that wisely knows, as a second sequel, not to simply repeat the same material over again.  This has partially to do with the numerous Die Hard rip-offs (namely Under Siege and Speed), so those hooks were gone, and I absolutely thank God John Mctiernan and company didn't suddenly decide 'we'll do Die Hard on a plane!,' which would eventually be done three times (Executive Decision, Air Force One, and Con Air).  But what the filmmakers have done here is ingenious, they've widened the setting to include all of New York City.They do this and still manage to retain the intense claustrophobia that permeated the previous entries, doing so by displaying just how frantic morning traffic is and just how BIG New York is.  As nonsensical as that last statement may sound, imagine trying to get from point A to point B in the middle of a traffic jam.  Mctiernan really knows how to let the tension ratchet up from just the sound of honking horns.  Then there's the case of John McClane himself.  This time around, he's at the whim of a madman named Simon who requires him to perform certain tasks or New York buildings will be demolished by explosives. In the first two films, McClane was an everyman, which added much appeal, but he also acted a bit too much like a superhero to work consistently as an everyman, so what the filmmakers have done here is turn him into a jaded cop. He's seen this stuff before, so he's not as scared as he was before.  Willis is great at this role, too, seeing as he's done it before in The Last Boy Scout, but takes it to perfection here.Rather, who we now have as the everyman is Samuel L. Jackson as Zeus, and he's a brilliant addition.  Not only is Jackson simply awesome in his role, he's likeable, tough, and hilarious, but he's also easy to sympathize with because he's not an action hero.  He doesn't know how to use a gun, he has no combat training, and he's never had to take on terrorists before.  What makes him so effective is his street-wise nature, and this quality of his works perfectly with McClane's own street smarts AND action heroics, which they combine in their day-long adventure.  These two have a chemistry that at least equals Riggs and Murtaugh and if there's a Die Hard sequel, Jackson needs to come back.     Too many action movies give us poor villains who aren't menacing, vile, or charismatic enough to make for effective antagonists.  Jeremy Irons' Simon Gruber is an exception.  He is the best Die Hard villain, oozing charm and snaky intelligence.  This was one of the last few roles of Irons' career I could take seriously.  He's done what since then, Dungeons and Dragons? Pity how his career has taken such a downward spiral.And last, there's the story and action.  The plot's a lot of fun, with McClane and Zeus having to use both their brains and brawn to save the day. The contrivances in the finale (the scene with the handcuffs, the aspirin bottle) aren't enough to bring the climax down, though it's true the conclusion isn't as exciting as the rest of the film.  That's understandable though, since the rest of the action is magnificent, particularly a car 'chase' through the streets of New York which is as unstaged as a car chase can possibly look.  The film moves at a lightning pace that grips you from the opening scene to the very last.  Die Hard: With a Vengeance is an action flick that has it all.",Null,110,128,16 April 2003
Con Air," A goofy comedy posing as a thrill ride.
","* 1/2 out of ****I love action films, but as I was watching Con Air, I kept asking myself, 'where's all the action?' Apparently, director Simon West decided he'd hold off the typical gun fights, car chases, and big explosions until the last half-hour. Big mistake. This is a Jerry Bruckheimer production, and I don't expect to have to wait 90 minutes to get to the action, which even then, is extremely disappointing in how routine all of it turns out to be.
So, instead, it might be more applicable to view this as a comedy about a relatively simple situation that goes awry. After all, this whole mess begins when an army ranger named Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) defended his pregnant wife and killed a man. Even though he was just defending himself and his wife and pleads guilty, he still gets the maximum sentence because he's seen as a 'deadly weapon' in the judge's eye. It's too bad Cage, normally an okay actor, plays his role like a mix between Elvis and Forrest Gump, and as if to make the latter more obvious, Poe's best friend is none other than Mykelti Williamson, AKA Bubba! This Poe Fella and his buddy manage to get on board a plane full of the most dangerous criminals alive (meaning a good number of these inmates are all from the same prison!), who come up with an escape plan that's executed perfectly despite them having never even set foot on the plane before. Poe has to try and thwart them, and this goes on for pretty much the entire movie. So what we have here is a film with a lame protagonist, even lamer villains, and average action scenes that don't get the pulse pounding. Oh, yeah, and there's constant bickering between John Cusack and Colm Meaney over whether or not to shoot the plane down. The answer should be a no-brainer, but since that description fits the movie itself, you can guess what they decide to do with the plane.I get a lot of amusement over the family reunion in the movie's final scenes, where Poe meets his wife and his daughter, whom he's never seen before. Though probably intended as heart-rending drama, this reunion is about as well-handled as something you might see on the Lifetime Channel, maybe even worse.(Spoiler) Take a look at the scene where Malkovich's villain is killed. It's pretty obvious he falls in such a position so that his feet, and not his head, would be facing that crushing machine. This is the kind of haphazard editing that's displayed throughout the whole film, so it's of no surprise Simon West would go on to direct Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, the worst film of 2001. Hey, I actually see that as a good thing, since it kept West from directing Black Hawk Down, which was, ironically enough, the best film of 2001.",Null,0,2,27 June 2003
The Mission," Roland Joffe's follow up to the masterful The Killing Fields is well-crafted and often easy to admire, but ultimately comes up a bit short.
","Rating: ** 1/2 out of **** Back in 1984, Roland Joffe accomplished the near impossible; his major motion picture debut, The Killing Fields, defied every expectation typically associated with neophyte filmmakers and what Joffe delivered was one of the most powerful and moving films I've ever seen. So it's no surprise I highly anticipated his follow-up film, The Mission, and it's obvious that by bringing back the same team (producer David Puttnam, cinematographer Chris Menges, and editor Jim Clark), they attempted to capture the proverbial 'lightning in a bottle' a second time. Unfortunately, the end product isn't quite cinematic magic.Set in the 18th century, Jeremy Irons stars as Father Gabriel, one of several Spanish Jesuit priests (including Liam Neeson) assigned to convert the Guarini tribe of South America into Christians. His efforts are gradual, but successful. Converging with this story is Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert De Niro), a slave trader who seeks penance after killing his own brother in a fit of rage. For all the Guarini that he has killed or sold off into slavery, they still show compassion and forgiveness towards him, and he is accepted into the mission, even converting into a Jesuit priest under the guidance of Father Gabriel.The priests and the Guarini natives eventually find themselves in heated discussion with politicians and slave-owners, who are debating over whether the mission should fall under the rule of Portugal, thus endangering all the Guarini with the possibility of being made into slaves. Determined to prevent such an action at any cost, Mendoza takes up his sword once more, coming into conflict with Father Gabriel's peaceful approach.The Mission was released in 1986 with little success in theaters, despite garnering a respectable 7 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. Since then, it's developed a devoted fan base who consider it among the most underrated films of the decade. As much as I'd like to, I can't quite agree. Though a respectable and often beautifully crafted effort, the film ultimately comes up short in human interest and emotions, with Joffe often favoring lingering shots of lush jungle scenery and needlessly overlong political machinations involving secondary characters whom we couldn't care less about.The film is divided into three acts, the first, involving the spiritual transformation of Mendoza, is easily the most compelling. Despite De Niro's occasionally stilted performance (his delivery of some of the dialogue, particularly 'Are you laughing at me?' still makes me cringe), his emotional torment is heartfelt and absorbing and his acceptance into the mission is genuinely moving. It's almost all downhill from there.The build-up in the second act is initially effective, with the heated debate over the Guarini engrossing, but the conflict eventually loses steam when we're subjected to dull, endless dialogue that grows inadvertently confusing even as it intends to clear up the matters at hand. It's also in the middle segment the film loses its human focus and all that's really left is the question of will they or won't they fight.The third act is the inevitable battle, and while there are a few powerful moments amidst the chaos, the sequence is a badly choreographed mess. The editing also feels a little rough, with quite a few scenes feeling like they clocked in a little too soon (the sudden transition after Irons' 'God is love!' line is disjointed, to say the least). The Guarini are never developed beyond the typical 'noble savage' portrayal, so it's difficult to feel for their plight beyond the fact that their forced subjugation and mass slaughter is a heinous crime. I wanted to feel more for them, but they're merely a backdrop for the more seasoned cast.As Father Gabriel, Jeremy Irons is superb, unquestionably one of the film's consistent bright spots. It's unfortunate he's never that well-developed in any of the film's separate acts, but his performance alone is able to draw us in even if the script lets him (and the audience) down. In supporting roles, Ray McAnally and Liam Neeson are excellent, though a bit limited in screen time. For Neeson, this was more of a hint of greater things to come.Ennio Morricone's score deserves a special mention; whatever emotions Joffe is unable to convey on screen, Morricone's music can conjure in just a few notes. It's one of the most beautiful scores I've had the pleasure to listen to, especially in segments with oboe and flute. The chorus in the background is perhaps a bit much, but an overpowering score can do wonders in a film otherwise unable to muster all the intended emotions.Joffe's work in the film is still overall quite solid, but he completely lost his footing soon afterward, losing a grip on his career with a long string of critical and financial disasters, including Super Mario Bros., The Scarlet Letter, and Goodbye Lover. I'm convinced The Killing Fields was not a fluke, but the sign of a genuine auteur who showed his prowess thanks to a brilliant script and cast. Blend those two elements with his natural skills and I'm sure we'll get a film worthy of mention alongside his debut. Let's just hope this happens sooner rather than later.",Null,62,103,1 May 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," Quite possibly the greatest movie in existence.
","Rating: **** out of ****For me, The Shawshank Redemption and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, two movies which have virtually nothing in common, have forever been ingrained as my favorite films of all-time. The reason: both films represent the reasons why I watch movies in the first place. In The Last Crusade's case, it's plain and simple fun escapism, and never has Hollywood movie magic achieved the rousing exhilaration that the third Indy movie has done for me.Then there's the other, more complex reason I see movies, to be enlightened, thought-provoked, challenged, and inspired, all of which The Shawshank Redemption accomplishes and more. Back in 1994, I would have thought someone was pulling my leg if they told me a prison drama starring Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins (the latter of whom I had never even heard of at the time) would endure as one of the most popular films ever. Now, I'm just kicking myself for never having seen the film in theaters.Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne, a banker who's been sentenced to consecutive life terms in prison for the murder of his wife and her lover. His first year is in 1947, and from this point on, we're introduced to several other characters and situations over the many years that pass, Dufresne's developing friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), and his becoming a mentor to a hotheaded thief (Gil Bellows), all of which culminate to a masterful conclusion which sharply delivers the film's message.What is that message, you might ask? Why, it's all about hope, about what we do with our lives. To most, living is hell, a harsh reality that involves pain and endurance. But if we take charge of our very own existence, appreciate everything we have and can accomplish, then the very process of living can be wonderful. Even the most cynical people I know still love this movie, a grand statement for just how powerfully effective it is. The plot may not sound interesting to the uninitiated (take my word for it, I first saw this film when I was a 14-year old with the attention span of a fly, and the movie still gripped me like no other), but it fits perfectly with the themes at work, and much of the dialogue is so beautifully written, the film simply demands repeat viewings to gather it all.Frank Darabont adapted the script from Stephen King's novella, keeping much of the story lines and dialogue verbatim, while making a few crucial changes, for the better, believe it or not. Darabont's direction is equally as terrific, keeping things low-key and seemingly unexceptional, but truly crafting something memorable and brilliant. Thomas Newman's remarkable score is emotionally touching and uplifting, perfectly fitting with the movie's tone.But great as the direction and writing may be, what puts this over the top for me are the performances. Everyone here is excellent, without the slightest minor exception. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins deliver the best, most powerful performance of their careers in crafting two of the most memorable characters in cinema, with the former proving why he's the greatest actor around and the latter showing why he's one of the more underrated performers. The film is primarily about the friendship between Dufresne and Red, how a man can bring hope to a cynic in even a place as confined as Shawshank Penitentiary. In supporting turns, James Whitmore and William Sadler are exceptional as prisoners who befriend Dufresne. Sadler, in particular, begins the film as a total ass, and it's to his credit that by the end, his transformation to a genuinely likable character is entirely believable. Even Gil Bellows is excellent here, and anyone who's seen Ally Mcbeal knows he typically defines bland.The Shawshank Redemption's ending is, quite simply, fabulous. Everything about the final half-hour is perfect, from the big surprise twist to the pacing to the music to the acting right down to the very final scene. I'm probably sounding a bit repetitive by now, but everything about the conclusion (much as the rest of the film) is pure genius. There are flaws in The Shawshank Redemption, most particularly why Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown never appear to age over the years that go by, but such a minor mistake isn't even worth muttering to the overwhelmingly positive attributes the film bears. The Shawshank Redemption is the perfect film, and I'm absolutely certain nothing will ever match it, much less surpass it.",Null,0,0,6 March 2003
Signs," A well-made thriller with heart.
","7 out of 10M. Night Shyamalan's success streak continues with Signs, a horror-oriented thriller about an ex-priest (Mel Gibson) who discovers something odd happening in his cornfields at night.  As far as plot goes, that's enough of a decent set-up for Shyamalan to work his magic.  Signs is not a story-driven excursion, as the previews may lead you to believe (it does NOT give clear-cut answers to the existence 'crop circles' and such) but an exercise in sharp filmmaking and acting.  For the film to work, both must be top-notch.  Thankfully, we're not let down.The film delivers its share of suspenseful situations, much of it highlighted by brief glimpses of creepy images and exposure to fear of the unknown (the pantry scene is classic).  Most of it works, and because of the stellar performances (there's not a weak performance among the cast), we genuinely care about the film's resolution.  The movie's ongoing theme, that of a man regaining his spirituality, is thoroughly unimaginative, but Gibson's sincere performance makes it work well enough to distance itself from the routine horror/thriller. Unfortunately, the climax is a disappointment, concluding with a ludicrous plot development that needlessly cranks the silliness up a couple of notches.  It is a major dent to an otherwise solid thriller.",Null,0,2,13 December 2002
Speed," One of cinema's best pure action films.
","*** 1/2 out of ****Keanu Reeves is a rarity: he's a second-rate actor (at least compared to other big movie stars like Mel Gibson and Harrison Ford) who has kept his career afloat courtesy of a critically and commercially successful film every now and then.  These films usually have the tendency to keep his big-screen acting career going steady for another five to six years, by which then he somehow latches on to another big hit.  I hear he's going to be starring in the period epic Tripoli, so expect his career to extend to at least 2012.Speed is one such film, his second after Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure), but it's actually worth of all the acclaim it's received and then some.  Bringing together a highly unlikely cast (Reeves, Dennis Hopper, Jeff Daniels, and a then unknown Sandra Bullock) and first-time director Jan De Bont, it must have spelled a recipe for disaster.But by miracle or just pure filmmaking bravado (more the latter than the former, though if the film had been made yeseterday, I might be more inclined to agree with the former), they pulled off a great action film, one of the best in big-screen history.After beginning with what must be one of the most intense opening credits sequences, the plot quickly gets underway.  Mad bomber Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) has just rigged explosives to drop an elevator and its apparently wealthy occupants down quite a few floors to their deaths.  But his plan to extort $3.7 million is foiled by quick-thinking LAPD cop Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) and his partner (Jeff Daniels, in pretty much the thankless role that really doesn't go anywhere).Out for revenge, Payne raises the stakes further in his ransom demands by rigging a bomb under a city bus.  Once the vehicle goes over 50 mph, the bomb will be activated, and once the bus goes below 50, it'll be detonated. Traven makes a mad dash for the bus, arriving after it's already passed 50 mph, but able to keep the bus from going below.  Unfortunately, the driver is shot in a mishap, leaving spunky passenger Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) to take the wheel.  To make matters worse, they're in the middle of morning rush hour; staying about 50 mph will be almost an impossible task.Speed is divided into essentially three acts and setpieces: the opening elevator sequence, the centerpiece with the bus, and finally a climactic (or post-climactic as some may see it) resolution which I won't divulge here. The bus sequence is easily the movie's highlight, quite possibly the longest action scene I've ever seen.  The whole setpiece lasts just a little over fifty minutes and throws in every imaginably plausible hindrance there is to keeping a bus over 50 mph.The stark simplicity of the premise is what fuels the film.  There's probably no greater compliment I can pay the movie than to say that I can't imagine the plot being pulled off better.  Every strand related to story and script is merely a means to keep the action and suspense going; I've rarely seen films maintain such a high level of intensity and pure thrilling, crowdpleasing fun for such a lengthy period of time.Director Jan De Bont's work here is probably among the best feature film debuts out there (only Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead comes to mind, but was that even released in theaters in the U.S.?); he keeps the editing super-tight and the pacing frantic, but still putting the action together with crystal-clear comprehensibility.  That's a fantastic accomplishment. Whatever happened to the De Bont who knew how to deliver such kinetic thrills?  Each of his successive films are progressively worse, and he's even gone as low as making a Tomb Raider sequel.  Mr. De Bont, you're better than that.The acting and dialogue are adequate enough that they don't distract from any of the action or thrills.  limited as his talent may be, Keanu Reeves is just one of those actors who I can't help but like.  His performance here is better than usual and occasionally even quite good, but still fraught with obvious moments of poor acting.  Still, he's a pretty damn easy guy to root for.Sandra Bullock is perhaps the real standout of the picture.  As feisty and sexy in a girl-next-door way as any heroine, Bullock is appealingly down to earth and entirely convincing as just a normal bystander caught in an unbelievable situation.  She also has damn good chemistry with Reeves, one of the vital elements missing in the sequel.  Dennis Hopper is fine as the villain, this isn't really anything we haven't already seen from him in one form or another but his schtick was still amusing at the time.  Cast directors must also be applauded for all the extras and character actors they used to play the bus passengers; there's a genuine sense of teamwork and solid chemistry at hand.At no point does Speed ever crumble; its perfectly lean storytelling ensures that it never strays from the thrills on hand and it's so exciting only the biggest hard-hearted churl would try to nitpick the implausibilities.  The last few minutes might seem a little excessive when one considers how exhausted we already are from all the non-stop action.  That said, the third act is still very exciting, just not as inventive as the action that came before it.Speed was inevitably followed by a sequel, which wasn't entirely unenjoyable in its own right, but misses a lot of the spark that's evident in this picture.  Hell, I'd even say it needed Keanu Reeves, but by that magical Keanu rule of blockbuster hits, he wisely passed reprising the role of Traven and went on to star in The Matrix.  Yup, I don't see his career extinguishing any time soon.",Null,5,10,16 March 2004
The Matrix," Solid sci-fi entertainment, but still misses on wide opportunities.
","*** out of ****Five years I've held off writing a review for The Matrix.  Why?  For the simple reason of watching all its sequels and spin-offs before I determined my final judgment.  Whaddaya know, my rating still hasn't changed, or at least not significantly (I like it a little less than my very first viewing, some three viewings back).  This movie has been, through and through, a *** picture, no more  and sometimes possibly even less.By day, Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) leads a simple and uneventful life as an office worker who dwells in his little cubicle.  By night, he's Neo, a first-rate computer hacker who feels there's something not quite right with his world.  At a nightclub, he meets Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), a dark-haired woman who gives him even more cryptic answers to his questions. Curious, Neo pursues for further answers, leading him to a mysterious man named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne).And it's during a particularly dark and stormy night that Neo discovers the truth; the entire world is a program fabricated by machines of artificial intelligence that have overrun the planet.  These machines feed off 'sleeping' humans as a battery source to continue their own existence. When Neo is awakened, he's in for an even bigger shock; he's the destined hero to free the human race from the machines.  Whoa.There are a lot more intriguing plot elements, including the mention of an underground city called Zion, the last refuge of the human race with a population of approximately 250,000.  The program the humans are in, called the Matrix, operates and keeps the fabricated world in order through individuals called agents, who have the ability to take over anyone connected to the matrix in the similated world.  This is all a tad more complicated than it seems; unless you really hate science fiction with a furious passion, you'll probably find the plot fairly easy to absorb (then again, I'm still surprised by the number of those who find themselves completely confused by this movie's plot).The central storyline, Neo's ascent to near deification, is interesting if not as well-handled as one would like.  I enjoy the fact that most of the film focuses on the individuals aboard a ship called the Nebuchednezzar. Scaling down this epic tale affords more opportunity for character development, which writers/directors The Wachowski Brothers use to their advantage on several occasions.As a sci-fi tale, The Matrix runs fairly smoothly.  None of the ideas presented are particularly original, but they're fascinating concepts and they're presented in an intriguing fashion.  It's through the visuals that The Matrix succeeds in delivering its plot; by giving us a world in which rules can be bent and even broken, there's ample opportunity to display jaw-dropping visual effects that have rarely, if ever, been used in this manner.Unfortunately, there's still much about the sci-fi aspect that's sorely underused or unexploited.  If the Matrix is, in fact, a world in which the A.I. could manipulate to their advantage, it's disappointing that all they do is put up a few brick walls and throw a few kung-fu skilled agents into the mix.  I expect a lot more than just martial arts in a movie that claims to turn the world upside down as we know it.Unfortunately, the story nearly falls apart at the point the Oracle (Gloria Foster) gives Neo her prophecy, and like the rest of the film, chooses not to give any clear-cut answers and istead merely mentions that Neo has to make a choice that could result in either his or Morpheus' death.  She also mentions he's not the One but has the gift (uh-huh, makes it sound like being the One is an occupation open to application).  Almost as bad is the fact Neo fails to pry further in his questioning.  He just stands there with barely a single expression on his face.If the Oracle can tell the immediate future, she should learn to actually do more than spout a lot of nonsense that proves pretty futile (this would later really mar the sequels).  This scene completely insults me because it's obvious the Wachowskis only wanted to try and obscure the climax for us.  If you actually believe either Neo or Morpheus will die at the end or if Neo isn't really the One, then maybe the Wachowskis know their target audience better than I do.But by far the kneecapper of the whole picture and ultimately the reason why I can never muster more enthusiasm for it is the scene where Neo chooses to rescue Morpheus and risk almost 'certain' death.  What does he do?  He loads himself up with heavy artillery and with Trinity's assistance shoots up a lobby full of security guards without showing the slightest hint of emotion. I understand this is for the Greater Good, but that our hero, who so previously had been in shock at the discovery of the reality of his entire universe, could kill dozens of innocents without even batting an eyelash is absolutely confounding.  I almost didn't care about the rest of the film after this scene.The action sequences afterward are thrilling enough to provide momentary distraction, especially the kickass subway martial arts battle between Neo and Agent Smith.  But somehow the film sidetracks itself yet again with a melodramatic and overdone climax that would be more fitting in a daytime soap opera than an epic motion picture.Still, most everything before that is entertaining and interesting enough that I definitely recommend this picture.  I should also mention Hugo Weaving's performance; the man has carved a name for himself in this memorable role, crafting one of the best pure villains I've ever seen.  He is, in fact, so good I'd almost choose him over the heroes.Undoubtedly, The Matrix trilogy will be endlessly debated for the years to come, but I'm neither one who finds himself in ecstasy over this picture nor do I despise this film with seething hatred.  It's enjoyable enough to stand up to quite a few viewings, which means there's plenty of worthwhile material on hand.  You just have to bear through the subpar stuff to get to it.",Null,4,11,27 February 2004

The production is marred by too much so-so acting (Harrison Ford being the only exception), lame dialogue, and contrived plotting, but it's highly enjoyable escapist entertainment that's grown a massive following for a reason.  The climactic action sequence is an exciting knockout.",Null,1,5,24 November 2002
Gangs of New York," I suspect it'll be a forgotten film in ten years.
","* 1/2 out of ****You know how every year, there are usually a few best picture nominees that are completely forgotten and when you look back on them you wonder why they were even nominated in the first place.  Well, Gangs of New York is one such picture.  I have yet to see The Hours or The Pianist (heard nothing but great things about the latter), but so far, I've been quite disappointed by the crop of 2002 best picture nominees.  The plot to Gangs is really quite simple.  Leondardo Dicaprio plays Amsterdam Vallon, whose father was murdered in a gang war by Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) for control of the Five Points in lower Manhattan.  Vallon, as a young man, returns to avenge his father's death, but becomes conflicted when Bill takes him under his care.  There's also a lazily inserted love story that's purely on auto-pilot.Gangs of New York is a film that's hard to categorize.  Primarily, I'd say it's a drama, but a drama about what?  The titular gangs are hardly given much depth or development, a surprise coming from director Martin Scorcese, the man who gave us Goodfellas.  Almost as damning is the fact that Vallon's burning desire for revenge is hardly touched on (yup, after the prologue, we skip several years later).  Instead, the movie often gives way to Dicaprio's love story with Cameron Diaz, and the two share the flattest romantic chemistry I've seen in recent years.  Any scene just featuring these two is a pain to watch.The opening battle sequence, while sufficiently brutal and violent, is a mess of a scene, looking more like a setpiece suitable for MTV than an epic drama.  I'm talking about headache-inducing quick cuts, herky-jerky slow motion, cheesy wide angle shots, and extreme close-ups.  Almost all the power of the scene is sucked out by Scorcese's odd directing choices. 
Keeping the movie afloat and semi-watchable are Day-Lewis' performance as Bill and the production design.  At least the film captures the look of the time period, if not necessarily the feel (in all honestly, I'm not sure what the 'feel' would be like, given that I've never actually seen a movie about gangs of new york set in the 1860's).  Day-Lewis is fine in his role, shining comfortably while most everyone else tends to slink into the background.Scorcese hasn't done much worth mentioning lately, his last solid film being Casino, which was a virtual remake of his best work, Goodfellas.  Running at nearly three hours, Gangs of New York feels even longer than it is, probably the harshest criticism I could give to a so-called epic.",Null,2,8,27 September 2003
Windtalkers," A lot of wasted potential
","5 out of 10Windtalkers has a lot of action.  For much of its 134 minute running time, it's simply one bloody battle scene after another.  On a visceral basis alone, I suppose you'll get some satisfaction.  Those looking for anything resembling good drama, characters, or a well-written script will be sorely disappointed.  The movie, after all, has an intriguing premise, but sours the potential with one-dimensional characters, cheesy dialogue, weary war cliches, and occasionally unrealistic battle scenes (complete with grenades causing fireballs and American soldiers who never miss). 
I'm certain action fans will enjoy the carnage (I know the action fan in me found the combat scenes engaging), but those looking for genuine drama will be left cold.  Interesting, ambiguous questions are barely scratched on the surface (whether killing a Navajo codetalker in cold blood is worth it to save the lives of countless marines) and the movie's preference to focus on the white male over the Navajo codetalker is a bit insulting. Decent performances from Nicolas Cage and Adam Beach give the cheesier moments a lift, but they can't lift the film from mediocrity.",Null,1,2,23 November 2002
Gladiator," A stirring, action-packed epic.
","8 out of 10Russell Crowe stars as Maximus, a Roman general whose family is slain when he refuses to swear loyalty to the new emperor (Joaquin Phoenix).  Sold into slavery, Maximus becomes a gladiator, and upon proving his mettle in combat, plans his revenge against the emperor as he begins to win the audience over victory after victory.  Visually stunning and brilliantly directed, this epic tale does come up lacking somewhat when it comes to plot, but the film is so meticulously crafted and exciting, it's hard to care.  The gladiator battles are the movie's highlight, never copping out when it comes to explicit violence and brutality.  A sequence involving chariots and surrounded gladiators is an intense, bloody fight to the death.  Expect tons of visceral satisfaction if gory combat is what you're looking for.  But those wanting memorable characters and heart will also be pleased. Russell Crowe's powerful performance brings genuine emotion and drama to the screen, you can't help but feel for the man's pain.  Hans Zimmer's score is his best to date, alternately rousing and emotionally satisfying.  Don't be surprised if the music is enough to induce you to tears.  Gladiator has something for everyone: action, drama, romance, laughs, and ambition.  This is in every way a stirring epic.",Null,0,2,4 December 2002
Contact," A brilliant, awe-inspiring sci-fi drama.
","9.5 out of 10Jodie Foster stars as a radio astronomer who receives a signal from outer space, and thus begins a media frenzy of speculation over the signal's origin, its purpose and its intent.  This brilliant sci-fi drama from director Robert Zemeckis achieves heights of awe-inspiring visuals and ideas not seen since 2001: A Space Odyssey, and in its approach to develop Foster's character, surpasses even that film. I'd like to say more about the movie, about its themes and controversial debates, but much of the joy of watching Contact is discovering how the plot unfolds and witnessing the visual surprises for yourself (suffice to say that the opening and closing segments are among the most beautiful passages ever seen on film).  Sorry, Steven Spielberg, the greatest director ever you are, but protege Zemeckis showed you up on how to craft a true sci-fi drama.",Null,5,13,30 November 2002
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The Last Crusade is the best of the Indy trilogy.
","Rating: **** out of ****My opinion of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade could be deemed slightly biased. It is the first film I ever saw in theaters and it's also the first movie I purchased on video. I even own the same, worn-down, beat-up copy (and look upon it even more fondly than the widescreen edition, for sentimental reasons, of course) (but nothing beats the pristine quality DVD). I think it's fair to say it's this movie that cemented my love of cinema, the high regard I hold for great escapism, which is sorely lacking from today's cinema; movies that should be fun now drag or bludgeon themselves with relentlessly awful scripts or MTV-style direction that turns relatively simple scenes into chaotic blurs. The Last Crusade may only be thirteen years old, but I think I can safely say they don't make them like they used to.The film stars, of course, Harrison Ford as Indy Jones, the archaeologist/adventurer who's on yet another quest, this time to find his father, who'd been searching for the Holy Grail. Said Dad is played by none other than Sean Connery, whose highly charismatic performance is quick to place this film, acting-wise, above the others in the trilogy by giving Ford a genuine acting equal (let me put it this way, he's only half a notch below Harrison Ford/Indy in charisma and appeal if that tells you anything). The rest of the film focuses on this ongoing journey between father and son (eventually joined along by Sallah and Marcus Brody), complete with amazing action and stunt sequences, clever humor, and nasty (but fun) surprises.The script, by Jeffrey Boam, takes a few cues from Raiders of the Lost Ark, but actually improves upon that story by paying more attention to characterization. The delightful opening scene (all three movies really open with a bang, don't they?); which details how young Indy got his scar, whip, hat, and fear of snakes; makes for a better prequel than Temple of Doom (and any of The Adventure of Young Indiana Jones, for that matter).The story is engrossing because there's a lot of fun clues offered towards the location of the Grail and, thus, there's a lot of engaging little discoveries (love the 'X marks the spot' scene). I'm quite certain, like with Raiders of the Lost Ark, the plot has a few holes, but they're fairly hard to notice, and I've seen this movie quite a few times, but maybe it's just my enjoyment of the film clouding that up. Either way, it speaks volumes in favor of Spielberg's direction and the performances.Given that action and adventure is the series' selling point, you can expect the thrills and wondrous delight of discovery delivered in spades. The action scenes are terrific (and matched well with John Williams' rousing, memorable score, also the best of the trilogy), the best being a fantastic ten-minute chase sequence on board (and in) a tank, possibly the best action sequence of Spielberg's career. I also loved the motorcycle chase and the Zeppelin setpiece, where the heroes go about dispatching of two enemy fighters in unexpected, but quite hilarious, fashion. The climax, complete with frightening booby traps, is a suspenseful venture into the unknown.The Last Crusade is far more humor-oriented than its predecessors, but part of the movie's effectiveness is that it's able to deliver belly laughs without defusing the tension during the action sequences. Some of the jokes are just brilliant, including one with Indy armed with a Luger in confrontation with a trio of Nazis on board a tank that's even funnier than the swordsman scene in Raiders (well, to me, at least).The supporting cast is all-around superb; John Rhys-Davies is back as Sallah, wonderful as ever and displaying a bit more enthusiasm searching for the Grail than he did digging up the Ark of the Covenant. The late Denholm Elliot also returns as Marcus Brody, the most lovable goof of a museum curator. Alison Doody is interesting as Elsa, the blonde historian whom Indy falls for; a twist involving her character and her actions towards the climax make her not as one-dimensional as she may initially appear. Julian Glover is the best of the main Indy villains, he's far more menacing than Paul Freeman's Belloq and less over-the-top but equally enjoyable as Amrish Pruri's Mola Ram. I also enjoyed Michael Byrne's performance as the Jones hating Colonel Vogel, who relishes in torturing Indy and his father. When it comes to pure delightfully nasty villainy, Byrne is even more fun to watch than Glover.Harrison Ford delivers his best Indy performance (maybe even his best performance, period) in this particular adventure. With the addition of Connery as his father, it reveals a personal side to Indy we haven't seen before. It's his rapport with Connery that separates this film from the rest of the genre. They craft an uncannily touching, funny, and genuine bond. That, coupled with the superb action and thrills, solidifies The Last Crusade as the pinnacle of high adventure summer entertainment.",Null,258,312,2 November 2003
The Bourne Supremacy," Sequels seem to be getting better every day, don't they? This is the best action film of the summer.
","Rating: *** 1/2 out of ****2004 boasted one of the better batch of summer offerings in recent memory, and The Bourne Supremacy stood tall and mighty above the rest (well, almost all, Shrek 2 was another great movie), proving that it's still possible for Hollywood to make a gripping action thriller that doesn't rely on CGI or gimmicky concepts. This film is actually superior to its predecessor (a fine film in its own right), moving at an even faster pace, delivering even more kinetically-charged action sequences, and sporting a plot that's more intriguing and rife with conflict.Picking up two years later where the original left off, former government assassin Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is still trotting the globe with his girlfriend Marie (Franke Potente), hoping he's put his sordid past behind him. But at the behest of a mysterious employer, a Russian hit-man (Karl Urban) tracks him down, killing Marie and leaving Bourne for dead. There are even further complications, as Bourne has been framed for the murder of two CIA operatives, thus pitting agency deputy director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) on his trail. As Bourne tries to evade the CIA and discover the reasons for why he's been framed, past memories continue to haunt him and may even bear connection to his current dilemma.The Bourne Supremacy is structured in much the same manner as its predecessor, giving us an anti-hero who finds himself the target in a mystery he must unravel, meanwhile trying to piece together his past. In between the expository/character scenes are heaps of slick, thrilling action scenes which, despite the familiarities in their set-ups, are more than adequate proof that martial arts battles and car chases can be exhilarating if executed with precision and a fresh eye. The Bourne Identity accomplished such a task so effortlessly I feared this follow-up would only seem like a pale imitation, but I'm glad my apprehension was unfounded. Director Paul Greengrass surpasses what Doug Liman accomplished, filming and editing almost the entire picture with relentless energy through gritty camera-work and quick edits. Far and away the film's standout sequence is its climax. In fact, those disappointed by Identity's lack of a big action finale will find little to gripe about with Supremacy's concluding setpiece, one of the wildest, most exhaustingly thrilling and memorable car chases ever filmed. I don't usually give this much attention to just one scene, but Greengrass brings everything together perfectly during this chase through frenetic filming and editing and employing genuine automotive stunts in favor of CGI-laden crashes. Only Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead featured a more thrilling climax in any film this year.But even with the first-rate action, what makes Supremacy such an effective thriller is Matt Damon, who provides an unconventional and even morally ambiguous but likable protagonist. Bourne is easily more intriguing than both James Bond and Ethan Hunt combined. Should the franchise extend beyond Damon's involvement, it'll be a difficult task for his successor to match his work in the past two films. The supporting cast doesn't have nearly as much to work with as Damon, but acquits themselves admirably, particularly Joan Allen (looking more attractive with each passing year) and Franka Potente.The story admittedly boasts some questionable logic; why would Bourne bother checking into that one hotel when it'd be much easier and would draw far less attention to him if he just snuck in? I grant that his move may have been intentional, but with more risk than was necessary. I also have no idea how one of the film's villains (whose identity is a surprise) planned on getting away with that murder he committed. But on the whole, the plot is engaging and the mystery builds to a surprisingly emotionally satisfying resolution. Here's to hoping The Bourne Ultimatum can deliver just as terrific a mix of action, plot, and suspense.",Null,56,84,9 October 2004
Jurassic Park," One of the best examples of thrilling escapist entertainment.
","**** out of ****When I was a kid, I always had an obsession with dinosaurs, so it was natural that, at the tender age of 9, I embraced Jurassic Park as THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE. I have since grown considerably since then, and now in my late teens, have come to the conclusion that Jurassic Park is indeed not the greatest movie ever made. But it's a damn good one, and it's an even match with any of the Indiana Jones films for sheer escapist adventure (thank God Steven Spielberg directed films during my adolescence).
This movie is, of course, hardly plot-driven, but a summary of sorts is in order. Sam Neill stars as Alan Grant, a paleontologist who doesn't much like high-tech equipment, or kids for that matter. Laura Dern stars as his girlfriend, Ellie Sattler, apparently a paleobotanist. Both of them (along with Jeff Goldblum as a chaos theoretician) are invited to an amusement park by a rather kindly, enthusiastic old man named John Hammond (Richard Attenborough). Well, it turns out the park is full of cloned dinosaurs and they've arrived as experts to deem whether or not the place is safe for tourists. But a saboteur within the park knocks out the power, leaving the guests stranded somewhere in the island, and the hungry dinosaurs on the loose, searching for food.Premise like that sounds like fun, doesn't it? And yes, Jurassic Park is very fun. It's unlikely anyone who's reading this review has never seen the movie, but it's always nice to reiterate to a fan (or detractor) why it is I hold such adoration for this film. Ever since Jurassic Park's initial theatrical release, the movie's always had a lot of unfair criticism thrown at it, a lot of it aimed at how Spielberg should have learned his lesson from Jaws and show restraint toward presenting the dinos, or how the character development was somewhat lacking. I'm guessing the fact it was directed by Spielberg set it up for far more nitpicky complaints than if it had been helmed by someone else (which makes it all the more amazing how acclaimed Spielberg's movies, especially his most recent ones, are).To both alleged faults, I cannot agree with. Whether or not anyone actually noticed, Spielberg actually showed restraint by not revealing the T-rex (or dilophosaurus) right off the bat, waiting patiently until the perfect moment, when all hell breaks loose. As a result, its first appearance is truly terrifying. Besides, these are dinosaurs, gargantuan sights that are appropriately astounding and awe-inspiring (with these images nicely boosted by John Williams' rousing score), and with such great special effects on hand, holding back the sight of the dinosaurs would be a pretty silly notion.As for the characters, most everyone here made at least a slight impression on me. Sam Neill is great as always, playing the likeable Grant as a convincing action hero who never resorts to ridiculous stunts. The friendship he develops with the two kids (Joseph Mazzello, Ariana Richards) is 'typical' Spielberg, but what's typical of his is still far better done than your average, first-rate filmmaker (yeah, I admit it, I'm an exremely ardent Spielberg fan). The other performances are good; Jeff Goldblum is very funny as the sarcastic chaotician, Laura Dern makes a sexy heroine, and Bob Peck is simply too cool as the park's game hunter. Loved the man, wish he was in the movie more.It's interesting to note that the pacing is so good, I never noticed that the film doesn't get into the dino action until almost the halfway mark. The film was enjoyable before the dinosaur mayhem, and once the dinosaurs start chomping down on puny humans, the movie jumpstarts into a remarkable thrill ride. There are two action sequences, in particular, that stand out. The first is the T-rex assault on the motionless cable cars, which nicely builds up suspense, then pays off in spades. The climactic cat-and-mouse game with the raptors is an even more impressive nail-biter, initially set in a kitchen, then turning into a full-blown chase through the ducts, all the way to a wide-spaced museum.Opinions for this movie have always been rather mixed, but with the majority aiming toward the positive. JP's got great action, first-rate special effects, and charismatic leads; what's not to like? Personally, I enjoyed it a bit more than Jaws, probably because Williams' score never goes inappropriately playful at any point in JP. By certain definitions, Jurassic Park might not rate as a great movie, but it's great entertainment, and what more could you ask from a film?",Null,2,13,5 May 2003
