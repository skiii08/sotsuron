Catch Me If You Can," Entertaining throughout
","Few directors can lay claim to as much diversity as Steven Spielberg  he's shown us every now and then with his ability to produce two films of starkly contrasting tone in the same calendar year. Most recently, 2005 saw Spielberg deliver the spectacular alien-invasion blockbuster War of the Worlds followed closely by the somber Best Picture nominee Munich. In 1993, it was the one-two punch of crowd-pleaser Jurassic Park and the uplifting Best Picture Schindler's List. 2002 was another year of achievement for Spielberg  after wowing audiences with the thought-provoking sci-fi thriller Minority Report, they were treated with the light-hearted, thoughtful, and endlessly fun Catch Me If You Can.Set in the 1960's - in New York initially but spanning all the way out to France - Catch Me If You Can tells the tale (the film opens with 'inspired by a true story') of Frank William Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), a fraudulent con artist who had successfully posed as a teacher, a pilot, a doctor and a lawyer, stolen millions, and gotten away with it, all before his 19th birthday. Throughout the entire three-year episode, detective Carl Handratty (Tom Hanks) is the FBI agent who gives determined chase, setting up a cat-and-mouse affair where Frank always seems to be a step ahead, but who more than once offers to give himself up to the agent he forms an interesting dependence on over time.What seems a simple premise is taken beyond that by a clever script and assured direction. The two leads are cast wonderfully, DiCaprio as the youthful con artist who seems to revel in the thrill of just getting away with things but who can in a moment snap into loneliness and yearning, and Hanks as the all-too-serious agent who loves to mess with Frank's mind. The supporting cast, too, give excellent turns but it's Christopher Walken who stands out as Frank Sr.- his sad, unfulfilled eyes speak tomes of the emotional struggle he's been through and the shaft that the law has treated him with. If there's a failing with the picture, it's the pacing during the opening sequences which establish the context of Frank Jr.'s situation - they seem to slow and weigh the movie down a little before it even kicks off proper with Frank Jr.'s first con. The closing sequences, too, serve as an epilogue that's a little bit unnecessary - Spielberg could have easily finished the film ten minutes earlier and audiences would not have been any less satisfied.It would be a shame to finish the review without touching on the technical aspects, and it's here that Janusz Kaminski's brilliant photography seems to glitter in gold, combining with excellent costuming and John Williams' score (inspired by 60's Sinatra hits and James Bond-style cues) to give a believable, immersive sense of period. Indeed, perhaps what makes Catch Me If You Can so effective is the supreme sense of amusement and fun it seems to have been made with, and that is something that's directly channeled on to the audience. There's no heavy, resonant story here that delivers an important message, but where Spielberg succeeds is in not trying to: it's a cop-and-crook flick that simply excels as entertainment, even if it's a tad on the long side for the scope of the story it covers.",8,1,3,17 June 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Powerful and poignant. I wish it knew how to quit haunting my thoughts
","'If you can't fix it, Jack, you gotta stand it'So goes the adage that Brokeback Mountain's tragic central character, Ennis del Mar (Heath Ledger), lives by. In the summer of '63, two aspiring ranch hands with little to no prospects find themselves work herding sheep upon picturesque Brokeback Mountain. It is a place of desperate loneliness, and as much to their surprise as ours, the two men form a connection over that summer that develops to a lifelong relationship. 'Brokeback got us good,' remarks Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal), during their first reunion that occurs only after four years of longing have passed since the day he and Ennis bade each other gut-wrenching goodbyes. By this time, both men have moved on and married: Ennis to his sweetheart Alma Beers (Michelle Williams) and Jack to rodeo queen Lureen Newsome (Anne Hathaway). They are marriages more of convenience that anything else  society would never, ever accept a relationship such as the one they share in secret. Ennis knows this better than any other, having been forced by his father at the tender age of nine to look upon the dried up corpse of a man beaten to death by tire iron when it became common knowledge he was living with another man. Over the next twenty years, we watch as Ennis and Jack retreat for fishing trips on Brokeback Mountain, where little fishing is done and where Ennis discovers that he is never as fulfilled as when he's in the company of Jack Twist, drinking whiskey under the moonlight. Despite any romantic ideas Jack might have that the two could settle down together, Ennis, scarred by his experience as a boy, repeatedly pushes Jack away so as to deny himself the happiness of being with the one person he truly, deeply loves. By the time the film closes, you cannot help but feel your heart has been ripped out of your chest: raw, same as Ennis.With Brokeback Mountain, all the aspects of film-making combine coherently to paint a visual expression of Annie Proulx's sparse prose under Ang Lee's delicate, consummate guidance. Writers Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana don't just adapt the 30-page short story; they expand upon it to fill a two-hour feature, by adding crucial moments that flesh out character and underline drama. Against a backdrop of Rodrigo Prieto's picture-perfect cinematography and Gustavo Santaolalla's emotive, expressive score, the young cast impresses. Gyllenhaal's frustration is palpable, Williams' devastation is incredibly powerful and sympathetic, but the phenomenon here is Heath Ledger: all clenched fist and clenched mouth. It's such an impossibility for him to express emotion that when he does, with his final promise to Jack, it breaks your heart.After leaving the cinema screening of Brokeback Mountain, I was haunted for weeks by its emotional resonance. Upon a second viewing on DVD, it elicits an even greater reaction. I simply cannot comprehend how, as Ang Lee's obvious masterpiece and what has developed into the most acclaimed film in motion picture history, the Academy could fail to honour this touching, tragic, universally powerful story that carries with it  but never preaches  an important message about love it's own Best Picture statue. It's a travesty we can't fix; a shame we have to stand.",10,35,40,20 June 2006
Crash," It works; but in such a manipulative manner that I couldn't enjoy it as much as I wanted
","The directorial debut of Oscar nominated Million Dollar Baby screenwriter Paul Haggis, Crash takes a close-up look at the lives of a dozen or so Los Angeles citizens over one 36- hour span, and how, when 'pushed to the limit', each of these characters will reveal their suppressed prejudice and racism. It is a picture that would really love to be important. It would really love to preach the good word about racism and tolerance in contemporary times, but sadly, it ultimately fails. In an attempt to assert the importance of Crash's message to the masses, Haggis here has taken himself too seriously and the result is quite the opposite: it's a little laughable.I couldn't help but feel like I was being beaten over the head with the film's message every ten minutes; such is the unnatural, repetitive nature of Haggis screenplay. There is a scene mid-way through the film where two policemen are discussing a crime which may have been racially motivated, and the white policeman spurts, 'f**kin' black people, huh?' which almost makes one throw his hands in the air and give up. It's abrupt, ridiculous, and absolutely not the way anybody would naturally react in such a situation. In another instance, a white woman (Sandra Bullock) begins shouting racial slurs about the untrustworthiness of the Latino locksmith (Michael Pena) who's doing her a service, but - here's the kicker - she chooses to do so in the immediate vicinity of the Latino locksmith. Crash is littered with these contrived moments, seemingly written to force characters into situations of racial tension to remind the audience that the film is, in fact, about racism and tolerance (as if by some god-forsaken chance we'd forget!).Crash is not without it's positives, however. The majority of the ensemble cast do their earnest best with an average script, Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges (whose every second word is something ludicrous about black people being mistreated by white people) aside. Matt Dillon gives probably the film's best performance, capturing the struggle and frustration of his situation with believability and conviction, and opposite him, Thandie Newton was superb.In addition to the good performances, Crash's second act does have two quite powerful sequences: the first involving a collision, both literal and metaphorical, between Dillon's and Newton's characters and the second involving the 5-year old daughter of the Latino locksmith who apparently has devastated a Persian store owner. Not surprisingly, these two situations are some of the more removed from Haggis' subject matter of race in Crash, dealing instead with issues like sexual harassment and a parent's inherent desire to protect their children. Of Million Dollar Baby's calibre this is not, but while I don't doubt Haggis' good intentions for this film, I do indeed doubt his execution.",6,5,10,15 June 2006
The Godfather: Part II," More ambitious and grand in scope, Part II packs a powerful emotional punch
","Given complete control over the directorial proceedings by Paramount, and a much larger budget to boot, you would be forgiven to think Francis Ford Coppola had it good when, two years after the release of The Godfather, the studio convinced him to direct The Godfather: Part II. Despite this free reign, Coppola still faced challenges  most important being the daunting task of matching the first picture, creatively and financially. There are many critics who regard the second part of the Corleone saga as not only equal, but superior than the first, and while I don't think Part II is as 'classic' as it's original, I can concede without hesitation that this is the more ambitious and grand in scope, and certainly more powerful as an exercise in tragedy.The Godfather: Part II continues the story of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), established in the end of part one as the new Don of the Corleone crime family, who has moved all their interests out to Nevada. Michael looks to expand his empire and invest in businesses in Havana and Miami, where Hyman Roth (one of his father's aging ex-partners) resides. When betrayal comes from where he least expects, Michael must make decisions and sacrifices, however difficult, to save his family, and in doing so will perpetually change who he is as a person. Throughout Michael's ordeal, Coppola flashes back to the turn of the century, where a young Vito Corleone (then Vito Andolini) must flee Sicily when he becomes hunted by the local Mafioso at the age of only nine. As an immigrant, we are shown the rise of Vito (Robert De Niro from young adulthood onwards) as a man of respect, loyalty, enormous generosity and ever growing authority on the streets of New York.Coppola must be given due for the transitions between the two parallel story lines, which are absolutely seamless. They come at natural breaks so as to not take away from the pacing of either narrative, and the episodic approach to covering thirty-odd years in the young Vito storyline is perfect for keeping the audience on the edge of their seats for the developments in the Michael story. With the interconnectedness of the narrative, Coppola encourages a contrast of the way Michael and Vito take control of their respective families  what decisions they make, what they value  and this helps to further punctuate and underline the film's harrowing final scenes.In keeping with the tone of the first picture, Part II sees the return of Gordon Willis' dark, under lit photography, and Nino Rota's memorable, distinctive score (largely utilising the same cues as the first, with the addition of a few new themes including the magnificent 'The Immigrant'). The acting across the board is quality  just as it was in the original. John Cazale has a larger role here as Fredo, whose outburst at being stepped over as the family Don is as forceful and potent as any in his regrettably short career. Newcomers to the picture give excellent supporting turns, Michael Gazzo as caporegime Frank Pentangeli and Robert De Niro as Vito Corleone, preserving Brando's famous gesture and manner, but it's Al Pacino's picture through and through  his Michael is so intense, but yet is an empty shadow of his former self. By the end of the picture, Pacino's beady black eyes are cold: completely stripped of life, and reflect upon the tragedy of the loss of the family he committed all his power to trying to protect. It's a haunting, powerful, parting frame that lasts.",10,4,5,26 June 2006
The Last Samurai," The way of the samurai is not necessary any more ...
","Director Edward Zwick's unfairly maligned Japanese epic, The Last Samurai, is one of heart, sweeping beauty, rousing emotion, and a passionate romanticism of the Samurai. There's nothing wrong with romanticising the Samurai, of course, they are a fascinating people after all, and at the end of the day The Last Samurai is a motion picture, and motion pictures are fairy tales  make believe. Critics should forgive Zwick, then, for what may or may not be a lack of historical accuracy both in chronology and behaviour, for not to do so would be to forget The Last Samurai's touching, resonant story about the rise of modern Japan.Set in the late 1870's, the film begins with war veteran Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) of the American army, pitying and drowning himself with liquor for hatred of his past actions. An old friend (Billy Connolly) persuades him to consider an offer from Mr. Omura (Masato Harada), in association with the man responsible for Algren's forgettable past, Lieutenant Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn), to train the Japanese military in the use of American firearms. Despite his dislike for his former Colonel, Algren agrees to do so for the money. When Colonel Bagley orders an unprepared regiment of Japanese soldiers to meet a group of 'savages'  Samurai led by the rebel Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe)  in battle, hundreds of soldiers are killed and Algren is captured and taken to the Samurai village, deep in the mountains. Katsumoto, a student of English and war, finds much to learn from Algren and holds him in captivity until the spring, when a safe passage will be cleared for his return. During this time, Algren begins seeing the Samurai in a much different light and by the time of his release, he has been shaped for the better by their gentle, spiritual, and honourable ways.The cinematography in The Last Samurai is breathtaking, shot primarily in the landscapes of New Plymouth in New Zealand, capturing the essence of the Samurai way of life. The performances don't disappoint, either. While Tom Cruise was fine as Algren, and probably at the top of his dramatic game, it's the Japanese actors that stand out: Ken Watanabe, as the leader of the Samurai, delivers with such integrity, and the smaller roles of Emperor Meiji (Shichinosuke Nakamura) and Algren's caretaker Taka (Koyuki) are acted with subtle, quiet, and understated power. Throughout the film's 148 minutes, Zwick adopts a slow, meaningful pace and combines his minimalist dialogue with Hans Zimmer's truly majestic score to forge the sense of epic.",8,1,3,19 June 2006
The Godfather: Part III," Undeservedly vilified
","'When they come  they'll come at what you love'How prophetic Michael Corleone (Al Pacino)'s words would prove to be. In Francis Ford Coppola's hugely anticipated follow up to The Godfather: Part II, almost twenty years have passed since the final moments of the previous picture, where Michael ordered the death of his own older brother, Fredo. It's 1979. Michael Corleone is one step away from fulfilling the promise he made to his estranged ex-wife Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) in the idealism of his youth in The Godfather  if he secures a deal with the Vatican to take majority shareholdings in the international conglomerate Immobliare for a hefty $600 million, the Corleone family will take it's final step into the world of complete legitimacy. The deal requires the Pope himself to approve, however, and forces conspire to prevent exactly that  forces from deep within the corrupt Vatican, and from criminal underworld Michael has been battling for a quarter of a century to escape. Michael's life as a Mafia chieftain has etched a deep tire into him that is channeled through his body language. He no longer sits cross-legged in a supreme position of power: his shoulders droop, his face is drained. He seeks only for his family to be together again, for forgiveness and redemption  for his whole life spent in devotion to protecting his family to not have gone to waste. He seeks youth to pass on the burden he bears. His daughter, Mary (Sofia Coppola) is naïve and unknowing of who her father is, but loves him deeply. His son Anthony (Franc D'Ambroiso) is more perceptive and is determined to never be involved in his father's business. Michael's nephew, Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia)  the illegitimate son of his older brother Sonny  is just as hotheaded and volatile as his father was, but is eager to change to work for his uncle. More than any complex plot, the picture's best moments come with the exchanges between Michael and Vincent, once Michael agrees to take him under his wing at the behest of his hardened younger sister Connie (Talia Shire). Watching Andy Garcia's transformation is remarkable, drawing parallels with Pacino's own in The Godfather, of course, and perhaps Coppola's ability to capture the spirit of Part I, if not Part II with these moments is what saves The Godfather: Part III.The distinctive elements of a Godfather picture are all present for the third reprisal: from excellent acting bar the already scathingly criticized Sofia Coppola (a dead horse that doesn't need beating), to Willis's cinematography and the famous score, to Coppola's eye for majestic scope in his direction. If anything, Part III is let down by an overly convoluted plot, and the glaring absence of Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, who brought a personality to the business dealings. Nevertheless, The Godfather: Part III is not a bad picture. It could never hope to be on the same level of the first two (the 16 years between films would only serve to heighten that pedestal), but Part III, with it's climactic Opera sequence that showcases Coppola at his virtuoso best  gut-wrenchingly tragic ending and all  provides an apt finale to the Corleone Saga that has been undeservedly vilified for the shortcomings its older brothers expose.",7,0,1,29 June 2006
The Shawshank Redemption," Excellent: an inspiring tale of hope and redemption
","It's a shame that The Shawshank Redemption was never as critically or commercially successful during it's run in theatres, as perhaps it should have been. If it were, then maybe the travesty of having Forrest Gump take the 1994 Best Picture Oscar could have been avoided, the award collected, instead, by either by this film or by Tarantino's groundbreaking Pulp Fiction, which were both stronger efforts. But I digress.Beginning in 1946, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted for the murders of his wife and her lover. He's sentenced to serve two life terms back to back in Shawshank Prison, ruled with an iron fist by the Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) and the foul-mouthed, violent Captain Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown). Shawshank, Andy soon discovers, is a place of corruption and injustice, which begins at the Guards and stretches to the Warden himself, and includes a group of sodomites known as 'the Sisters'. Amidst this, Andy finds himself part of an unlikely group of friends, Red (Morgan Freeman), the 'man who knows how to get things' and Brooks (James Whitmore), the good-natured, aging old-timer and librarian, among them. As we watch these men through the next 20 years of prison life, a tragic subplot develops with the Brooks character which deals with the nature of spending too long behind bars, and how, eventually, the bars and walls of prison can influence even a man of Brooks' good nature.When a young convict arrives at Shawshank with proof that Andy is innocent, injustice at the prison rears it's ugly head. Andy is faced with a choice to make  'get busy livin', or get busy dying'  and he does just that, propelling the film from that point forward into a rousing, uplifting climax which tests the bonds of friendship between himself and Red, and ultimately provides the audience with an important message about hope, salvation, and redemption.Writer/director Darabont reclines in his role and lets Shawshank's modestly-paced, subdued screenplay flow through it's 142 minutes. The film achieves the rare state of never seeming to drag or feel rushed. There's no flashy action here; rather, Darabont allows his audience to be compelled by the dialogue and the array of terrific performances, from the assured conviction with which Robbins believes in his innocence, to the thoughtful grace of Freeman's Red.",9,0,0,12 June 2006
Raging Bull," Scorsese knows he can fight, but he'd rather recite
","Both the masterpiece of lead Robert de Niro and director Martin Scorsese, Raging Bull is a picture that thoroughly deserves its place in the pantheon of great films. Documenting the rise and fall of boxer Jake La Motta (De Niro) from the early 40's through till the early 60's, Scorsese has crafted visual poetry that at once presents an unflinching, brutal look at the sport and a compelling, intense character study of a man who was disliked by almost everybody.Jake La Motta is shown in Raging Bull as exactly that  a foul, ugly, violent man who shows no respect for any of his opponents in the ring, and certainly very little for himself. When he marries the beautiful Vicki (Cathy Moriarty), whose surname we never learn, it's not long before Jake begins doubting her faithfulness. It starts at just a mention by Vicki that an upcoming opponent of his is young and good looking (La Motta opts to deal with his opponent's looks by brutally dismantling his face in the ring), and develops rapidly into an all-consuming jealousy and bottled up anger that erupts into a violent fury and rage. Jake's suspects are at first local mob members Salvy and Tommy, but he soon trusts no one, even accusing his own brother, Joey (Joe Pesci), of having an affair with his wife. Jake's frustrations manifest themselves in the ring, the only place he can express his emotions  when he's angry, he'll destroy the poor soul who comes up against him, but when in a state of depression, he'll allow himself to be beaten to a pulp as the only way he knows how to punish himself.Much has already been said about De Niro's performance in Raging Bull, and I'll add no more here, except to state that it's certainly the best of his distinguished career and resonates with so much brutality, intensity, and eventual tragedy that it will surely go down as one of modern cinema's great achievements. Supporting turns by Pesci and Moriarty are equally impressive, Pesci's Joey exhibiting intelligence and the same capacity for violent outburst as Jake, albeit in a more composed manner, and Moriarty's Vicki in all her quiet and understated seductiveness.Raging Bull is shot is sobering black-and-white, bar a montage of home video footage midway through the film. It's a stylistic choice that speaks of the brutality of violence in and out of the ring, and it's violence that Scorsese has no hesitation in showing in all honesty. Too often these days, biopics celebrate the achievements and milestones that the precedent reached, but Scorsese takes a different approach - the fights are often very short montages of video clips and still photos, always emphasizing the fact that the focal point of the picture is the study of the character, not the study of his accomplishments. In doing so, Martin Scorsese has created a unique biographical drama where behaviour becomes more fascinating than any plot, and that's entertainment. That's entertainment.",10,1,2,18 June 2006
The Truman Show," Fresh, Original, and All-Together Fascinating
","In an age in motion pictures where heists, explosions, action set pieces, love stories and comic book adaptations dominate the silver screen, it's remarkable to come across a picture as fresh, as original, and as all-together fascinating as The Truman Show, director Peter Weir's part drama, part comedy, part social commentary on the nature of television and one's right to privacy and a normal life.Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is an ordinary man, good natured and kind to all, who lives a sweet life of bliss in Seahaven where he works for an insurance company. He has a nice place, good neighbours, and a loving wife (Laura Linney), but what he doesn't have is any knowledge that everybody he's ever known is an actor, that those he doesn't know are extras and that Seahaven is a concealed dome: a giant stage in Los Angeles. He has no idea and that every second of every day of his life has been recorded by over 5,000 carefully placed cameras and broadcast to the entire world. He's the star of the Truman Show, the first unwanted child legally adopted by a corporation. When a figure from his traumatic past revisits him on the streets of Seahaven, Truman begins to notice a series of strange occurrences that offer clues of his actual existence. I suppose it's an inevitability that Truman will eventually discover the truth, it's not the film's best kept secret, but the way in which it all occurs to him is certainly more than half the fun.In all his films, Jim Carrey has never put in a performance so composed and articulate as he does in The Truman Show  possessing just the right amounts of humour and innocence necessary for Truman Burbank. In some ways, he's even funnier than he can be with any number of the over-the-top faces he has in his comedic arsenal. Ed Harris, as the show's creator and director Christof, has a small role but delivers well, and the scene where he and Truman finally speak like man and God is terrific.There's nothing flashy in the production of Weir's documentary-style approach to The Truman Show, bar a few well-composed shots from various hidden cameras in Seahaven. What he achieves is effective, though, in the way he proposes that what society can be so engrossed in  of all things  is an ordinary man living an ordinary life, that we are willing to accept the complete sacrifice, even if not in a literal sense, of a man's entire life for the sake of entertainment. It's what makes The Truman Show ultimately so interesting for the audience, who watch it as beings even higher than Christof. It's so captivating that I felt a little dissatisfied at the end of the picture, having wanted more of Truman, more of behind- the-scenes, more of the same monotony. If it weren't for the story feeling a little too rushed before it was all over, The Truman Show could have been even more deep, felt, and enjoyable than it was, but that being said, it is an excellent and highly original motion picture.",8,0,0,18 June 2006
The Godfather," In American motion pictures, it's as authorative as its title role
","It's amazing to think, having listened to Francis Ford Coppola's DVD commentary, that his 1972 epic The Godfather was produced under such incredible studio and financial pressure  one can only imagine what this picture could have been if Coppola was given a little more control. To this day, The Godfather remains a classic, truly extraordinary, and etched into the memories of all who've seen it. It is one of the most widely acclaimed and financially successful films of all time, consistently among the top film lists of most, and is my personal favourite motion picture.Set in 1940's New York, The Godfather tells the tale of the patriarch of a mafia organization, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando)  a man who commands enormous authority and power  and both his literal and figurative families. When the Don refuses a proposition by the drug dealer Virgil Sollozzo, believing that narcotics is 'a dirty business', Sollozzo  backed by the power of a rival mafia family headed by Don Phillip Tattaglia  orders an assassination attempt. Don Corleone barely survives the shooting and, for the love for his father, Vito's youngest son Michael (Al Pacino) decides to take action, masterminding a calculated move that will forever draw him in to the life of crime he always wanted to avoid.The cast assembled for The Godfather can lay claim to being possibly the greatest ensemble ever featured in an American film. Marlon Brando's career-reviving turn as the Godfather himself has already cemented its place in cinematic history  no more needs to be said. Al Pacino demonstrates a remarkable transformation from idealistic youth to cold, calculated heir to the Corleone throne. James Caan as Sonny, the Don's eldest son, is as explosive, violent, and temperamental as the pages of Puzo's bestseller describe, and Robert Duvall as adopted son and family Consiglieri (Counsellor) Tom Hagen is all logic and composure. But the praise should rightly stretch out to all, even those in small roles, as all play a part in making Coppola's world of Italian culture and underworld crime authentic and believable.When I try to pin down what it is, exactly, that makes a motion picture a 'classic', I can't help but return to the notion of how memorable it is. This is ultimately where The Godfather qualifies  just about everything in this film is memorable in one way or another. We remember the acting  there is not a more iconic performance committed to film than Brando's Don Corleone. We remember Gordon Willis' celebrated cinematography, from the shadowy, atmospheric tension created in the offices where 'business' is dealt, to his presentation of the sweeping, sun-kissed landscapes of Sicily. We remember the beautiful themes of Nino Rota's score  the haunting, lone trumpet that opens the picture and the full- fledged orchestral arrangement of the instantly recognizable 'Godfather Love Theme'. And who could forget the masterful inter-cutting during The Godfather's climactic baptism sequence? From the opening shot of the thickly accented undertaker proclaiming 'I Believe in America', to final unforgettable shot in the Don's quarters of the door closing on Diane Keaton, who finally realises the truth of what has happened, Coppola has attained a directorial quintessence with The Godfather that he may never again reach. While watching the picture, we simply cannot wait until the time comes to sit down and view it again. It's a rare quality in a film, and the hallmark of a cinematic masterpiece.",10,0,2,23 June 2006
