Raiders of the Lost Ark," Some good fun, but highly overrated.
","This movie is like the 1930s Saturday matinee serials, and it has some fun moments, but it isn't a brilliant masterpiece, or anything close. It falls into the same category as George Lucas' 'Star Wars' trilogy: fun, but not really intelligent. It's bizarre how people can confuse the two. 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' has a very intriguing, though slight, plot and it is fun to see Indiana Jones search for the Ark of the Covenant while fending off the bad guys in some great action scenes. But the slight plot starts to wear very thin after the ark is discovered, and the movie dives into a constant battle of Indiana getting possession of the ark and Belloq taking it away, and it becomes very tedious. After the ark is discovered, the movie becomes plagued with filler scenes, beginning with the scene in which Indiana and Marion try to steal the plane, and continuing with the truck chase and the boat ride until the gruesome end, which is very lazily written. Sure, there are some fun moments, and those less interested in plot development will get a kick out of it, but a masterpiece, or even a very good movie, it isn't.",10,1,2,6 December 2001
Star Trek," An Insult to Our Intelligence
","Just as the 3 'Star Wars' prequels ruined the Star Wars franchise (though I never liked it to begin with), this new 'Star Trek' prequel is a damaging blow to the Star Trek movie franchise, and this prequel crap needs to stop now. The pathetic writers of this new Hollywood generation can't come up with any new, creative ideas, so they just keep going back in time (as they did with 'Batman Begins') with established franchises, as if we need to see over and over again how the characters we love so much got their start. And the BIG problem with this new 'Star Trek' movie is that they TOTALLY foul up the history of these characters and then insult our intelligence by having Spock (Prime - the older Spock) say that his actions altered the course of history (which, we learn, is why Kirk's father dies on the day of his birth this time around). What a lame, poor excuse for why the history of Mr. Spock, Captain Pike, Captain Kirk, Dr. McCoy and even Chekov is so radically different from what it is in the Original Series and its Original movies. What is different? For one, in TOS, Kirk first served under Captain Robert April on a different starship, and had years of experience as a first officer before becoming captain. In this movie, Kirk's serves with Captain Pike of the Enterprise first, right alongside Spock, and on his FIRST day of service he becomes first officer and then on the very same day is suddenly promoted to Captain! Quite a leap up the ladder! In TOS, Spock is supposed to have served under Captain Pike 13 years before he and Kirk meet. Also, Dr. McCoy suddenly becomes Chief Medical Officer on the very same day that Kirk suddenly becomes Captain. Wow, what a coincidence! This movie so ridiculously rushes the whole thing, but it's OK because Spock altered everything, right? In this movie, Chekov is on the bridge as navigator even BEFORE Kirk ever steps foot on the Enterprise. That means he has MORE experience than Kirk! So in TOS how did Kirk become Captain while Chekov was a lowly ensign? Oh yeah, Spock altered history. And Chekov is said to be 17 in this movie. When did he start at Starfleet Academy--when he was 13?! Finally, this movie has no intelligent (or even intelligible) story. It has a ludicrous story of the Romulans (who look like a biker gang in this movie) creating Black Holes out of planets. And this movie is all action and loudness with dizzying camera shaking, which totally goes against TOS's cleverness of playing on ideas rather than action. Abrams has no business in the 'Star Trek' franchise, and I hope he never makes another 'Star Trek' movie. But I guess as long as they make plenty of $$$$, it doesn't matter. That's more important than being faithful to the characters and history of the show, right?",1,162,250,17 May 2009
Gone with the Wind," A classic: sure, a masterpiece : NO!!!
","Gone with the Wind is probably the most overrated film ever made, right next to Citizen Kane. Don't get me wrong, the film was excellent in look and design. Put the two together, along with story and characterization and the outcome isn't quite the same. This whole movie is basically the life of Scarlett O'Hara before and after the Civil War and her sick and twisted many loves of Ashley Wilkes and Rhett Butler and other men. There is just way too much of Scarlett and her stubborness and greedy self included in this movie and so little of everyone else. Clark Gable is the top billed star in this movie, but if you add up everybody else scenes compared to his, he's about the tenth star. The film looks great in the beginning and also all throughout the entire picture. Magnificent directing, well structured and detailed art direction, and great costume design. Some great scenes are featured, the burning of Atlanta, the massive amount of extras of wounded Civil War solders and the errie and stomach churning scene of the war vet getting is leg amputated, by the use of shadows of the man's leg and tortured screams. Cleverly directed by the three directors who lent a hand in making this classic film. The problems this movie has that I think doesn't make it a masterpiece, is like I said before this is a film about Scarlett O' Hara, not Rhett Butler. I think love story's make good for classic's, but not masterpiece's. A masterpiece in my opinion are film's that aren't love stories, films like Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Adventures of Robin Hood, and Psycho. I wonder if Gone with the Wind was filmed in black and white, featured a lower budget and had no Clark Gable, would people still look at the film as great as they think it is now. I don't think so. Gone with the Wind has a great cast who did an extordinary job in bringing these characters to life. The ones who really catch your eye are Vivian Liegh and Clark Gable. Both do great jobs in portraying these complicated characters, especially Vivian Leigh. She defeintly deserved the oscar she recieved, but it's a shame Clark Gable didn't get one. He was snubbed. The person who played Mammie should of gave her oscar to him. I wonder how Errol Flynn would of done if he was chosen to play Rhett Butler, I think he would of played him probably more dashing, kinder and cooler. To sum it all up, a film for everyone to enjoy who are into classic's and love stories. **1/2 out of ****.",Null,1,3,3 August 2003
Meet the Fockers," Trashy, Juvenile Comedy
","I just saw this movie yesterday and I was appalled at it. All of the humor in this movie is dirty, juvenile trash, with nothing the least bit clever or unique. The humor of this entire movie is every bit as shallow as the Focker/F***er pun that the title implies. It was particularly sad to see talented actors such as Robert Deniro and Dustin Hoffman try hopelessly to restart their now-pathetic careers with this sub-standard vehicle for Ben Stiller (who keeps repeating his 'There's Something About Mary' role). The whole situation between Robert Deniro's character and the little baby nephew was just tedious and unfunny, and the fact that the movie tries to generate laughs by showing a baby picking up on foul language from others shows how low the writers went for humor. And Barbra Streisand is just outright annoying. Overall, this movie is just a jumble of desperate toilet humor, and sex jokes, and is a complete disgrace.",Null,13,28,26 December 2004
The Dark Knight," A Total and Complete Disappointment
","****WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS HERE*** This movie is a monumental disappointment. I had seen all five of the previous Batman movies on the big screen, and I watched as they kept getting worse and worse and worse. I hoped that this one would break the trend (and with all the raves surrounding Heath Ledger's 'great' performance, I really thought it would), but it did not. This movie is so trite and so absurd, and what is most reprehensible is that it suggests that there is no Good vs. Evil anymoreas a matter of fact the movie closes with Batman himself being chased by the Gotham Police(!). And constantly throughout the movie Batman (now suddenly called 'The Batman') is seen as being the reason behind all the murders, robberies, and destruction the Joker is perpetrating in Gotham City. By the way, Gotham City here does NOT at all look like the Gotham City that we know; it is Chicago pretending to be Gotham City, which is very boring. What happened to the stunning production design that Gotham City is supposed to have?!! As for Heath Ledger, he makes a great impact in one of his first scenes in the movie (when his sudden killing of a gang member serves as the punch line to a joke), but after that scene the Joker's energy totally dwindles away and he becomes another smart-aleck, philosophical killerand even downright boring. In an attempt to keep things entertaining with the Joker, the movie resorts to dressing him in a nurse's outfit (a cheap laugh). To make a quick comparison, 'The Dark Knight' is very much like 'Live Free or Die Hard' (and a million other movies) in that everything is on the verge of complete destruction and chaos at the hands of a villain, and like Die Hard 4 (When are needless sequels going to stop?!!!!) it tries to replicate the feel of 9-11a real-life tragedy that should not be incorporated into comic-book stories like Batman. Batman himself makes a pathetic showing in this film, as he is much clumsier and more ineffective against the villains than ever before. But then again, why should he even try when everyone is calling him a 'vigilante killer'? When I was eight years old and saw the first Batman movie at the theater in 1989, seeing my favorite comic book character brought to life in such a stunning way was a dream-come-true. Had 'The Dark Knight' been the movie that was released instead in 1989 (especially seeing Batman getting chased by the cops at the end), I would have been devastated. Now as an adult, I can honestly say I am disappointed.",1,65,177,20 July 2008
Reservoir Dogs," For the dogs.
","The idea that Quentin Tarantino could be seen as a great filmmaker for 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction' is ridiculous, and 'Reservoir Dogs' is proof exhibit A. 'Reservoir Dogs' is simply one of the most shamelessly plot-driven movies I have ever seen. First of all, what is the point of the commode story? In the movie, the crooks are supposed to keep their mouths shut, but Tarantino has Mr. Orange go on and on, pointlessly, about the commode story just so Tarantino can make an attempt at art filmmaking by showing Mr. Orange talking to the actual police officers in the bathroom and dry his hands in slow motion. Talking that much would only make it more obvious that Mr. Orange is a policeman, anyway. Also, as one viewer pointed out, Mr. Orange doesn't shoot Mr. Blonde before Mr. Blonde cuts off the police officer's ear. Want to know why? Because Tarantino needed Mr. Orange to hear the bad guys say they were going to return to the warehouse after ditching the cars, but he also needed the ear-cutting scene. What else was there to do except make Mr. Orange not give a damn about the police officer, which is totally ridiculous. Also, why in God's name was Mr. Blonde going to set fire to the police officer? Wouldn't that have drawn attention to the warehouse hideout? Sure, it would. But Tarantino threw out that logic just so he could make a 'thrilling' scene as Mr. Blonde prepares to set fire to the police officer. Also, what sense does it make to have the warehouse in the middle of a neighborhood? What a bunch of smart crooks. It's no wonder they couldn't snoop out the undercover cop. This movie shouldn't even have made as little as it did (one million, I believe). And it figures that after about three years Tarantino's name dropped out of sight.",Null,13,26,15 October 2001
Pulp Fiction," Yet another disgrace by Tarantino.
","Quentin Tarantino so obviously has no ability for creating a decent story in his movies (see my 'Reservoir Dogs' review) that for this one he chose to give it a title that would excuse its ridiculousness. As I said in my 'Reservoir Dogs' review, the man is hopelessly plot driven, which means that he can't create a story in which events naturally happen, so he has to MAKE them happen any way he can. For instance, it's bad enough that in 'The Gold Watch' he creates a pathetic excuse for Bruce Willis to have to go back to his apartment, but then how could he make it so that Willis is able to outwit John Travolta, who is waiting there for him? Have Travolta idiotically leave his machine gun on the counter while he is using the bathroom! Come on! And then in 'The Bonnie Situation,' how could he make the accident in the car happen? Have Travolta completely unnaturally rest the gun on the car seat over his shoulder while he talks with Marvin! And Tarantino introduces the Wolf only for him to give Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson obvious advice for how to solve their problem while he mouths off humorous comments. Anyone wonder why Tarantino has disappeared now? Because he used up all the unoriginality he had.",2,14,28,31 January 2002
Psycho," Without a doubt, Hitchcock's best.
","Many of Alfred Hitchcock's movies are considered classics, but 'Psycho' is easily his best. But the reason for that isn't Hitchcock, it's the cast and story. Hitchcock is the kind of director who succeeds best when his movies deal strictly with person to person situations, and 'Psycho' does this best. I have seen many, many Hitchcock movies and my peak of interest in all of these movies is when there is an intriguing situation between two  or more people, such as the one-sided murder plot and its resulting conflict in 'Strangers On a Train,' and the attempts of Barry Kane in 'Saboteur' to clear his name of sabotage. However, in the case of these two movies and many other Hitchcock films, the person to person situation is almost destroyed by an overly large climax that is ridiculously corny. The merry-go-around scene in 'Strangers On a Train' is an embarassment, and the Statue of Liberty scene in 'Saboteur' is a few steps too far. Other bad climaxes include the hilariously bad fall Jimmy Stewart has at the end of 'Rear Window,' and the lackluster mountain climax in 'North by Northwest.' 'Psycho,' however, avoids these kinds of climaxes. 'Psycho' stays on a person to person level throughout the entire movie and does not include a terribly corny ending (unless you count Norman being able to perfectly imitate an old lady's voice). Considering the odd set-up, a man assuming the role of his mother, the story of 'Psycho' is executed rather realistically. Also (and I don't mean to slam Hitchcock) 'Psycho' contains far more realistically portrayed characters than any other Hitchcock film. In other Hitchcock films, only one or two characters have any depth, while in 'Psycho' there are five characters (Norman, Marion, Lila, Arbogast, and Sam) that have depth (though John Gavin's performance is a little stiff). Even supporting characters like Al Chambers and the detective at the end are very believable. Pat Hitchcock, however, as Marion's friend at work, does her part in destroying depth (as she did in 'Strangers On a Train'). But most of the scenes in 'Psycho' are very well-acted, especially the questioning scene between Arbogast and Norman and their light-weight argument outside. As usual, 'Psycho' contains the Hitchcock knack for irony ('The first customer of the day is always the most troubled,' and 'Insect or man, death should always be painless), but, for the most part the realistic performances save the movie from too-much corniness and truly make it one of the finest movies ever made (one of my top five). 5 stars out of 5. The underrated 'Psycho II,' (released in 1983)  contains excellent performances all around and contains no irony whatsoever. Although 'Psycho II' is generally liked, straying away from Hitchcock didn't sit well with some.",Null,0,1,18 October 2001
Back to the Future Part II," My favorite of the trilogy.
","As different as these movies are from each other, they represent probably the single most consistent and greatest trilogy of all time (Yes, better than those idiotic 'Star Wars' movies!). 'Back to the Future  II' is pretty insane, but it is simply hilarious, hilarious, hilarious....and fun, too. Whereas the first one tried to seem realistic in its fantasy, this one throws out all the logic and introspection with surprisingly excellent results. All the actors deliver great performances, especially Thomas F. Wilson, who portrays young Biff, middle-aged Biff, and old Biff so wonderfully that it's hard to believe it's the same actor. And the scene in which old Biff gives young Biff the sports almanac is one of the overlooked all-time classic scenes in cinema. One of the great things about this movie is that every little detail is devoted to hilarious mocking of economic and political situations. Pay careful attention to all of the newspaper headlines ('Nixon Seeks Fifth Term' in alternate 1985; and Biff's success at the race track in the 1950s gets more space than Kruschev becoming Soviet premiere). Yeah, there are a ton of illogical flaws in the movie, but if you set that aside, you'll find it as entertaining as a movie can get.",Null,1,2,31 January 2002
Speed," 'Die Hard' on a bus, 'Basic Instinct' on an elevator
","'Speed' represents Hollywood at its most commercially desperate and cheap: take a 'Die Hard'-like set up of a story taking place in primarily one location; put some heartthrob (though I'll be damned if Keanu ever acts like a man) as the star cop; throw in some over-the-top supporting characters; bring in some cartoonish action scenes; and end it with a kiss. And even a story this lame and simple is not done without a ridiculous amount of goofs--for example, about ten times that bus would've blown. By the 'Basic Instinct' part of the summary, I am referring to the obviously deliberate, brief shot of the second woman to be pulled out of the elevator, in which her skirt is lifted up, revealing her bare buttocks clad in thong underwear. It is flagrantly obvious that in this shot Keanu and Jeff were told to lift this rather pretty woman's skirt up, which the upward camera angle (used only in this shot) proves. This was done either to appeal to male viewers or for Jan de Bont, who was fresh off of directing 'Basic Instinct', to fulfill some of his own fantasies. Either way, it's immature, and I'm surprised no one else seems to have noticed this.",Null,0,1,19 April 2003
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Maybe a slight redemption
","In my March 2002 review of the ridiculous 'Indian Jones and the Temple of Doom' I call this third installment somewhat of a redemption, but, after seeing the third one on DVD I would have to say that it is a very slight redemption. While 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' is more sane than 'Temple of Doom,' it lacks the adventure of the first and second Jones films. I would say the third one is, overall, better than the second one, but it still isn't a good movie or even close to 'Raiders,' which itself isn't all that great. The big problem with 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' is that the plot is simply too thin, and after Jones teams up with his father the movie just becomes the Joneses constantly evading the Nazis who are on their tale, and the movie just goes from action scene to action scene with no development at all. To put it bluntly, this third Indiana Jones film is a near-disaster until the end at the Holy Grail, which makes the movie somewhat more interesting. To sum up the series, 'Raiders' is an adventurous, light fantasy take on the archeology profession, 'Temple' is an outrageously absurd, over-the-top, but highly adventurous take on archeology, and 'Last Crusade' is a barely-adventurous, quite-absurd take on archeology.
