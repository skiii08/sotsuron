Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I'm 4 years old again
","There have been few movies that made me as happy as Phantom Menace. The opening music filled the theatre and a dumb grin became fixed on my face. That grin never did leave my face.Visually and musically the movie was stunning.  George Lucas' vison and John Williams score combine to form an experience that will take your breath away. The GGI's were perfectly blended into the action.  Williams played the audience like an instrument getting reactions out of us.The plot was a full of a couple gaps.  That is to say there was a complex set of situations that were only partially explained. This made some of the scenes feel rushed.  This inspired me, and many other fans with whom I spoke to use their own imagination and thoughts to fill in these gaps. Which makes this movie not very different at all from its predecessors. This is the closest to a negative criticism that I can get.See this movie.  You won't regret it.",10,0,0,20 May 1999
