The Blair Witch Project," A bad movie
","A low budget gives you what it has to give: a low quality movie. Although it made millions in cinemas, it doesn't mean that you are about to see a must-see movie. I think that the idea is not bad, but it just stays there; I mean that the facts are always the same: walk at day, fear at night, walk at day, fear at night, and so on. No argument is followed. But I must talk about the cinematography. Poor. Very poor. You exit the cinema while your eyes are going back to normal movement. It is unseenable. You only see grass, trees, leaves, sticks, some faces, some water, more grass, more leaves, more trees. I also must talk about the sound and voices. Poor. Screaming, sharpened screams. You exit the cinema and you just want to listen some music. Finally, the actors. How much did they get paid for that? Any money would be a lot. My advice is not to spend time and money watching this thing that some say it's a film. The only horror is the movie itself. There are a few movies I can recall as truly bad. This is one of them.",Null,0,1,11 December 1999
