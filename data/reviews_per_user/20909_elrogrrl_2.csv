The Monuments Men," Should Have Been Amazing
","This movie is like a combination of Ocean's 11 (an entertaining and comic heist) and Inglourious Basterds, a serious stakes operation set in world war two torn Europe. George Clooney directed this movie and there's obviously tons of opportunity there for a great story and film even without the amazing abundance of great acting talent at his disposal, including not just himself but Matt Damon, Bill Murray and John Goodman and several others. The story is built around them attempting to steal back priceless works of art from the Nazis, it sounds amazing and should have been but sadly it just comes off as a pretty average movie. The big problem is that the great actors in this aren't given enough time to work together or even just enough time on screen at all, way more Bill Murray would have helped! Still a decent movie for the entertainment value and worth watching.",5,0,1,28 February 2014
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Fun!
","Cloudy with a Chance of Meat Balls is a really fun movie that the whole family can enjoy. There are a lot of jokes for the adults to like but the kids will also be glued to the screen for the whole thing, which is great.It's not something adults will love from start to finish but there are pretty much zero movies like that around any more, Frozen is probably the best example of that that I can come up with or a few of the best Pixar movies.The voice acting is really good and there is just a lot of great, zany, wacky fun.",8,1,2,28 February 2014
