Ali," Excellent Adaptation of Ali's fights
","The fights are not rocky-type or 'entertaining' but REAL. Inside the boxing ring, things are different. I was glad to see close to perfect adaptation of Ali's fights (I watched documentary on Ali's career). Michael Mann gets credit for painting all the different aspects of Ali's life superbly. Well, 'Ali' is based on a real legend and not a super-hero and so it is hell of a job to portray such a personality on big screen and make it so entertaining to watch.The only downside of the movie was to focus a little longer on effect of Africa on him. But the 'Loud mouth' CHAMPs witty and 'punchy' remarks in his real life along, with his big blows inside the ring, will keep you glued for more.Overall, Will Smith's hard-work, Mann's adaptation and Mohammad Ali's legendary life makes 'Ali' a must watch for movie goers.",10,75,106,26 December 2001
