Iron Man 3," Three, I was hoping.
","OK, Number three? Well One was great, Two not so much, Three, I was hoping.And I had hope, lets face it, its still got Robert Downey Jr.and importantly its now got Shane Black, one of the most under appreciated writer directors around. In my view his Kiss Kiss Bang Bang also with Downey Jr. is one of the best films of the 00's.So with a hope and prayer I sat down in the cinema AND!!!Man was I impressed. Somebody grab all the studio executives and hack directors show them this movie and say 'This is how you make a Sequel'. And boy they need to be shown. I hope J.J. Abrams, Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman see this movie.Usually by THREE they get lazy and it's the safe same old same old and usually with a less budget. But not Ironman Three. Three is the key word here, I always say there are 3 pillars a movie stands on, the actors, the director and the script and here they get all 3 spot on. The actors, whoo, Ben Kingsley and of course RDJ, the director, impressive and the script? My God, the director and writers who actually think the audience is intelligent! Yes Michael Bray, look shocked with this radical concept, the general public want more than 'look she go boom!'Plot Holes? There ain't none. Yes Orci, it can be done. At last a story that is original, humor in the right places and real plot surprises. See it soon and enjoy a movie that respects its audience and does not think we are all 12 year olds. Yes I am talking to you JJ.",9,11,31,24 April 2013
Star Trek," Great Movie but with one gaping plot hole.
","OK this my second review of this movie. The first time I wrote it straight after seeing it at the cinema, then later I watched it again when it was released on DVD. And then I thought what a turkey! After re-reading my first review I believe I was delusional. I must have hoped that the movie was going to be so good that it at first I had some sort of placebo effect. But seeing a second time I realized it was terrible. Three things make a good movie, the actors, the director, and the script. You can occasionally escape this trio if you get an inept director or a bad actor, but NEVER with a bad script.The actors were good, they had to be to able translate this wham bang script to a believable level. The director, OK, he too, was good, but frankly he was in charge, couldn't he have looked the script and asked what high school kids were responsible for this.The script, well it was almost religious text. That is because it was so holy. Plot holes galore.Previously I used the term Wham Bam. That's what this was, all lights and sound, no content. The plot was ridiculous, every time they wrote themselves into corner they use techno babble to get themselves a freebie and trust me there was a lot of those. See 'intergalactic beaming to a starship at warp' I have looked back on the writers previous efforts. Mediocrity springs to mind.And finally it is uniquely obvious the writers and director have no idea of plausibility. They create such a plot holes that Nero's Star Ship could fly through.How can Kirk possibly jump from Cadet to the Captain of Star Fleets newest Starship just because he did a great job. In the movie he was able to jump 6 levels of promotion. Spock who a Commander, 5 levels above the cadet happily handed over command? Why? Was it just Spock and Pike who were on board the Enterprise above the rank of Lieutenant? I am sure they have other Captains and Commanders in Star Fleet with the experience and seniority available.I can imagine the scene in the Board of Review. 'We have 2 applicants for the new post of Captain. One guy has had 20 years of Service and has had 3 commands OR CADET Kirk with 3 years of recruit school, who has a history of fighting authority, has no experience with handling ships personnel but who, with the help of some other young recruits and a Commander with emotional issues saved Earth.' Gee lets pick Kirk, cause it's a movie.",5,4,11,10 May 2009
The Hunger Games," This was a good movie, not a great movie, just good.
","This was a good movie, not a great movie, just good. There was a lot of subtext, in a lot of ways like the James Caan movie, Rollerball. It had, good acting and a good script, BUT, the director??. What is with this constant moving camera, extreme close-ups and fast cuts??? Whatever happened to the long shot. It all seems to have started with the Bourne movies and Paul Greengrass. Every director thinks it is cool and realistic for close-ups and moving camera. It's a crock. Its confusing in a lot of scenes as you spend half your time trying to work out what Is going on and in the action sequences looking for the sick bags because you are getting vertigo. Even in the scenes with more than 2 people, close up and fast cuts were used.Like when Peeta throws the weight in the training area. He picks up the weight, CUT to see the strain on his face, CUT to see the concern on Katriss's face, CUT to see the look of disrespect on Kato, CUT back to Peeta OH the strain, CUT to again see the concern on Katriss's face, CUT to see Kato laughing with his team mates, CUT as Katriss looks with disdain at Kato _ _ _ THROW THE DAMN WEIGHT ALREADY! A lot of people do not like 3D, Hunger Games wasn't 3D, but if it was it may have saved the movie from being edited like a gunfight in a spaghetti western. Directors of the world enough, bring back the long shot.",7,0,5,3 April 2012
Oblivion," At last, a thinking mans science fiction.
","I was going to wait for this movie to go to DVD (That is what I did for Looper). But my father who is 78 went to see it and called me and said I should see it straight away. My Dad has 2 movies he marks all Sci-Fi against, Alien and Blade Runner. To my surprise he said that he now has 3, Oblivon. I was in shock, my father is a very harsh critic and he is not a Tom Cruise fan at all. He doesn't like Super Hero movies and he thought Joss Whedon's Serenity was OK and Star Wars, he thinks is silly.So off I went with the wife to see Oblivion and he was right. Now, I don't mind Tom Cruise, but really in a lot of movies he plays the same type of character and in Oblivion, his Jack could have been Nathan Algren (Last Samurai) or John Anderton(Minority Report) etc. But in reality that is who Jack was. The questioning main character who doesn't just accept things as they are, he questions.Joseph Kosinski, the director was impressive, the actors especially Andrea Riseborough, were near perfect and the script? Get the Sci-Fi channel writers to watch this to see how it is done right. No cookie cutter plot here. A real science fiction plot, not sci-fi but science fiction, up there with Forbidden Planet and 2001.Why some people give the movie a low rating is beyond me. But after reading the Hated It section I believe that there is no pleasing some people.What more can I say other than see it fast before the office buffoon or some TV critic gives away the great plot.",10,5,10,28 April 2013
Alien vs. Predator," Hey I liked it. BUT??
","Okay as I always say in any review 'it's a movie, it isn't Shakespeare'. But sometimes I wonder if the scriptwriters understand the word Sequel. You would think that they would think, 'Goody, the back story is written now I can really get down to it'. That is, they build on the story, writing a script, which is continuation of the popular myth the previous successful movie created. In AvP they had the perfect opportunity, but instead of fitting the script to the myth, they, and they are not alone in this, (I sometimes think the screen writers guild must run a course called 'Sequel Writing – How to ignore the blatantly obvious'). They tinker with the details of the previous successful movies to fit their substandard script, (IE the gestation period of an Alien is changed to 30 seconds) rather than be constrained within the back story.What this does is create an environment that produces plot holes. Because when you start tinkering with the basic story this leads down to making other changes that eventually creates more and more compromises. This movie had plot holes a plenty, but I just ignored them and enjoyed the shallow movie it was.One comment though, the Predators better speed up the testing their Warriors. If the 3 Predators are an example of their best then these boys must be in decline. In previous visits they took on Aliens in there 100's. These guys had trouble with 9. I would ask their Coach, have they become too reliant on their shoulder cannons?? And whomever makes their Armour should be speared, please at least give these novices acid resistant Armour.",6,1,2,4 April 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Sony give Spiderman back to Marvel.
","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a classic case for why Sony should return the rights to Spider-Man back to Marvel. When Marvel do a movie with their list of characters they do it with a reverence to their comic based history. Marvel do so with a respect to the product, they care. Happily this reverence for them has made money.Sony, well they are in it for the money. Spider-Man 2 is the movie for the Suits. If Marvel had allowed the Hollywood Executives (the Suits) control to their library you would get the super hero genre dead after 2 movies.You can compare Captain America Winter Soldier with The Amazing Spider-Man 2.CAWS, was an intelligently written high intense super hero action movie. TASM2, was a romantic, lets talk about our feelings super hero action movie.I can imagine the Suits all sitting around at the Spider-Man 2 pitch. 'Marvel is doing so well, our answer is the super hero movie with the emotionally challenged lead character with some kick ass action!' The suits would look at the movie Pitcher and say 'WHAT?' 'It's Spider-Man meets the Twilight Saga, that is sure to make money Yeah'Give me a break. These are the guys that ruin things. Do not get me started on J.J. Abrams and what they did to Star Trek and what they are going to do to Star Wars.Sony give Spider-Man back to Marvel, they can and do a lot better than your clichéd attempts.",6,35,72,19 April 2014
Taken," Great Action Thriller
","Taken was a good action thriller. It's the type of movie where you cheer the hero and boo the villains. My father recommended this movie and called it 'Old Bourne - The movie they made if Bourne had retired and had a 17 year old daughter' It was so good that I watched the 2nd half again, straight after watching it the first time. If you liked Bourne I whole heartily recommend this movie.I use IMDb often to get a feel for whether a movie is worth spending the dollars to see at the cinema or wait for the DVD release. When the score from the Users ratings is really low I don't even bother with that. But when I truly enjoy a movie, I always find it amusing to read the 'hated it' section of the User reviews. Why? It confirms my belief there are people out there with pushing some radical view point or have very narrow views on what is acceptable.This is very obvious in the reviews with Taken. In the 'Hated it Section' you have the guy who is anti-American', the reviewer who is anti-violence, someone else who took offense just because some of the bad guys were eastern European and another who completely doesn't understand that review rating is controlled by the number of viewers who liked or disliked the movie, but berates IMDb & the majority of reviewers for not agreeing with his point of view. OK, you didn't like it, but please respect other reviewers opinions.The main character, Bryan Mills was right when he told his daughter, 'I know the world, sweetie.' Because he knew there are people out there that have different agendas and values to those held by average middle class westerner. Which is the whole point of the story and is evident by some reviewers hostility.Good movie, watch it.",8,1,2,11 January 2009
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," How perfect do you want it?
","This was a great movie, why? Because it catches the book perfectly, how? It follows the book religiously. Yet we get some user critics complaining it 'was a bit flat' or 'I didn't like this portrayal' I also notice that the critics that rate this movie low, have the comments 'I haven't read the book _ _ _ _'. Well that's the point, the movie is biased on a Children's book, therefore it is not an original screenplay. One reviewer actually suggested changes!!! If the film makers had made the film any different there would have been howls from here to Timbuktu. My first suggestion is to some of the User critics, don't be so picky. My 2nd suggestion Read the Book, See the Movie, you would appreciate the whole experience more.I had the happy experience sitting next to my 8 year old daughter, to watch the movement of emotions across her face was well worth the price of the Ticket. Go see it.",9,0,2,4 April 2012
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Very good ending of the series but problems with the characters
","I am probably one of the very few Star Wars enthusiasts that prefer Phantom Menace to Clones. Why, well I never could put my finger on the issue. Now comes Revenge. Now let me say from the start I thought it was good. Better than Clones, but again Phantom Menace somehow had more of an effect on me. Again why? Revenge had all the elements that I would say to anyone go see this movie, but hey, you will need to see it a couple of times, as it has so much going on.After Revenge and a couple of days of reflection I realized my unease was with the characters. Lets face it Anakin, Padme and Ben are no Luke, Leia and Han. I liked the twins and the boyfriend more than the parents and their guardian. I cared what happened to Luke & Co. But with Anakin & Co I was an observer not a participant. The final fight between Darth Maul and Obi-won in Phantom had an emotional context, which may explain my preference. Clones & Revenge lacked any emotional connection. There was a story behind the flashy effects you just had to keep your eye on it. The most uncomfortable aspect was the relationships between the 3 main characters. Luke & Co really liked each other, Dad and friends put up with each other.Lets face it Anakin was not a person to like. He was arrogant, selfish, ignorant and just plain vain. Obi-won did a lousy job training him and Padme was a victim. She reminded me of the batted girlfriend syndrome, abused physically and emotionally by a bully who would fix things up by apologizing and telling her he loved her after the abuse. I had no respect for the characters, whether this is the fault of the actors or script is debatable.But may be in the end its to do with Lucas casting of Hayden Christensen he just never invoked any sympathy in his character.At the end of the movie I could understand why Kenobi\McGregor just left Anakin\Hayden, his supposed friend on the bank to burn rather than put him out of his misery. Think about it, faced with his greatest failure who bashes pregnant women, kills little children, defenceless women and bad acting, old Ben\Ewan went on the dark side and thought 'Burn you little s^*t.'",8,1,2,4 April 2012
