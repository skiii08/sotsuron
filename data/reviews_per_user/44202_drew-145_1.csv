Requiem for a Dream," Reality: How a Movie Should Be Made
","I have been telling my friends, those who go to see 'Batman Returns' and 'Charlie's Angels,' that the reason I do not go see those movies is because they are not reality, i.e. the good guy always wins, or the ending is shiny and happy.  I told them that if I was ever to make a movie, it would be based upon reality:  life is difficult, and we have to live with the choices that we make, and most of the time those consequences are not what we had hoped for.  Aronofsky drives this point home, excuse me, bulldozes, this point into oblivion.  Where 'Pi' left the viewer undecided, and, in the case of this reviewer, a second screening of that movie confused me more, 'Requiem' left little to the imagination, but much to the conscious mind. I left the theater wondering if I could sit through another movie such as this. The camera work and effects were some of the best in moviemaking to date; maybe not groundbreaking or earth-shattering, but in the context of this movie, so appropriate and disheartening.  The players played to an unbelievable level, especially Burston, who topped her 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' performance.  She was so stunning as an everyday addicted-to-life woman and (at one time) mother that I still am having trouble thinking of my own mother for fear that she may succumb to this way of living.  Leto was amazing enough to follow to any G-rated movie that he may do in the near future, which is hopefully never.  And Connelly was so convincing, so hurtful, that one cannot fathom all the pain much she causes amongst herself and Leto's character. It was reviewed that the viewer falls in love with the characters, but I take the contrary position.  These characters know that their choices are spiraling them down, yet do little to stop themselves due to their addiction and lack of love for anyone but themselves, except when withdrawal kicks in. No, I never found myself yearning for a happy ending, only for one that would spare ME the heartbreak and misery that they were subjecting themselves to. Now that I got to see the movie that I always wanted to make, I don't know that I ever want to see one again.  Maybe the everyday Peoria-living movie audience is right, Hollywood should be an escape.  Aronofsky, please do not take heed of the Midwest train of thought, and may BATMAN be as dark as the original comic strip and your last two movies.",Null,0,0,20 December 2000
