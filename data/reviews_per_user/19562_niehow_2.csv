It," So much hype for such a piece of trash!
","We have a group of kids; one tells lame jokes beyond his maturity, one is the hero that has at least five spotlight scenes of 'come on guys, we can do it' and the rest are just kids who tag along. A budding romance is thrown in also. This isn't scary at all, neither on a psychological basis or blood basis. Every scene you see coming, the clowns super powers are never explained...AT ALL. It has to be one of the worse waste of time films I've seen in many years. All around a piece of trash.Check out Korean or Japanese films if you want REAL horror.",2,0,1,27 November 2017
Thor: Ragnarok," Same old stuff ruined by Led Zepplin
","I was hoping for something more than a recycled story of revenge with better blue- screen. If you were to change characters around it would be, 'Oh, I've seen this before'. That said the absolute horrific thing was the inclusion of Led Zeppelin's two most widely beloved songs used in the movie. Robert Plant is just so iconic and to infer that his music and this 12 year old 'superhero' movie are on the same par was atrocious! At the second inclusion of Zeppelin I walked out of the theater. I know these actors make millions but don't they ever tire of doing the exact same plot over and over and over? How about a film without guns, magic, and mutants? I don't think Hollywood can make that anymore.",2,6,16,5 November 2017
