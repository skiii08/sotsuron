Iron Man 3," The most enthralling Marvel sequel
","There are certain actors and certain production houses that are just predetermined to bring you on the edge of your seats every single time those veterans are there to display their prowess. Iron Man 3, well just like the 2 prequels, it was ripe with action sequences that are guaranteed to leave you spellbound. Certain scenes,especially the one where he pulls 13 people falling from an airplane to safety, are so scintillating and yet so immaculate that you cannot stop yourself from indulging with the rest of the audience in praising that moment. Tony is still the suave guy whose ingenuity and cogency continue to hold the audiences captive but the Mandarin, the main antagonist, is so impeccable in his execution that Tony has to refine his ways. With the wrath of Mandarin reaching more and more blatant magnitude with every strike and with the Mandarin now sighting the final destruction of a nation, Tony can only consort with his own intellectual brilliance and his own 'toys' to become the savior yet again. Will he be able to pull off the decisive victory, will he be able to overcome his own internal demons to triumph against the most devastative of alliances. He may very well do that because ultimately, He is the iron man. But you gotta watch this one to know if he does that.",9,3,8,4 May 2013
Minority Report," Spielberg is the consummate of foresight
","When you watch a movie like this, you wonder how in the world can the guys come up with the setup of a future that is so specious and yet so real. But Spielberg as we know, is a master of that art. The mannerism in which 2054 AD is depicted, the technology,the gizmos, the transport,the infrastructure and every single component of the plot, it seems like Spielberg himself is a precog who has the ability to foresee the future and tell us how it'll be. Cruise, like always is at the zenith with his action and involvement but for this movie, its the plot and the cogent story line which will capture your imagination. You'd actually feel as if you belong in a real world from the future because its appeal is so very massive. In a nutshell, the movie is about the Colombian department of pre-crime, a department that has been setup with the intention of stopping criminal incidents before they happen. How ? Well, its 3 precogs who are supposedly inculcated with the capability or rather with the gifts of coming up with previsions of crimes that are yet to occur. With state of the art transport, the cops can easily get t the crime scene and stop it from happening. But then comes the twist. A twist that's the real thing to watch out for.",10,0,1,7 January 2013
1408," It had two endings but had a multitude of plots
","The film,it seems, has 2 endings with one being the original one and the other one being conjured after the first one was sensed to be a little disappointing. Whatever it may be, the movie has a hell lotta places where you find yourself at the edge of your seats. When other horror movies are following a recipe book, this one comes up with a flummoxing entanglement of events and realizations. Elsin, who apparently is a writer of paranormal books and who supposedly doesn't believe in the authenticity of third world forces, gets a challenge when some ostensibly anonymous person sends him a postcard suggesting about the Dolphin Hotel in New York and advises him not to enter the room no. 1408.. Elsin, who takes this up as a challenge makes sure that he does enter the room once and survives for more than an hour - something that 56 people acc. to the manager failed to do in the past 95 years. Initially, Elsin's doubts seem right with nothing unusual happening in the room but the moment the radio clock starts by itself and plays the song 'we've just begun' and sets the timer to 60 minutes, you're already begun with the real 60 minutes that this movie is all about. And in actuality, 60 minutes in the movie nearly amount to 60 minutes of your viewing time.. Really worth a watch.. :)",9,0,0,13 January 2013
