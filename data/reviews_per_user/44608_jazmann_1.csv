Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It made me feel 12 again...
","I don't know how to say it, but as soon as the words starting scrolling up from the bottom of the screen reading 'EPISODE I' I freaked out. The movie is wonderful. It is a little campy at times but so were the other films. As soon as the movie ended I felt like buying toys and playing again like I did twenty years ago.",10,0,0,26 May 1999
