Howl's Moving Castle," It's not the best Miyazaki film but it's good
","I bought this on Blu-Ray along with the DVD 'My Neighbour Totoro' and while I think it's not the best of Miyazaki's films it still has a good storyline, amazing visuals and memorable characters. The design work of Howl's castle is very creative and steam punk-esque and the entire film has an amount of steam machinery such as cars, boats and trains etc. The voice acting is pretty good and I was surprised that Disney/Pixar had casted Christian Bale as the male protagonist, I always try and come up with a Batman impression of him for his character just for the fun of it. The fantasy of the plot is good but it's really not his best film but granted it's still a watchable film by the visuals of the film.",9,0,1,13 May 2014
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Boring!
","I'd watched this on Disney+ as part of my day-to-day Star Wars marathon in time for 'The Rise of Skywalker'. This was my first time watching the movie from start to finish and I did hear how infamous this movie was and after watching through it all, it was bad.To me, I feel the movie focused too much on the politics and to me that whole plot line was just a total bore. The original trilogy and heck even the sequel trilogy feel more like adventure, mystery and fun and less about politics. Plus it's kind of odd to hear from George Lucas that 'Star Wars is for kids' but what kid would be so interested in political talk?The actor who played Kid Anakin, I'm sorry but his acting was really bad. I don't blame him though solely, unlike those 'fans' who were horrible to Kelly Marie Tran on social media, I do blame the direction that he took and the bad writing. I mean Qui-Gon Jin was telling him to be safe from the bad guys and Anakin was like 'Okay' casually. It ruined the tensed moment which makes the final battle scene underwhelming.Now we come to the most infamous character, Jar ajar Binks and yeah he was annoying as hell. Once again I don't blame the actor solely for it I blame the direction that Lucas wants to go with. Jar Jar's presence was annoying with his babbling dialogue and unnecessary comedic slapstick and even he ruined the final battle scene with his cowardice behaviour, yet he was promoted a general. Plus the CG character looked uncanny valley to me since they never blend in well with the physical effect characters.There were some good like the choreography and I think both Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor were the best actors in this movie. I also think CG Yoda was much a better choice over the puppet. The former has more expression and flexible movement whereas the puppet dies feeling limited and I can see why they went with that for the other two prequels. Don't get me wrong I like the puppet.Sadly in the end, this movie was flat out bad.",2,0,2,9 December 2019
Beauty and the Beast," It's A Classic But The Book Could've Worked
","Before any hate comments I like to point out like I said in the title, it's a classic and I like it. It has a good story, great animation, wonderful music etc. but after reading the plot of Beauty and the Beast book on Wikipedia I think it could've worked better. In the original, Belle is one of the six children in a wealthy merchant family, now you might think she'll be bratty or selfish and all that clich√©d stuff but really she sounds very nice and kind, as of course Disney had adopted the personality into the movie so credit for that. Though the sisters really have that 'ugly step sister' appeal like from Cinderella treating Belle like a servant and secretly taunt her. The merchant lost his wealth in a storm and was forced to live in a small farmhouse. Years later, the merchant, found out that one of his ships had survived the causality and returned to the city to find out in the end that wealth has been seized to pay off his debt. Beforehand, thinking that the ship might have something valuable promised his daughters some jewels and dresses and Belle a rose, which is from the beast's garden, more of the plot can be seen on Wikipedia. The book's plot pretty much works better then Disney's adaptation and as I said before, the movie is a classic. But I love stories that has also have no villains, Gaston is a really memorable villain, not plotting revenge or wanting to kill someone, well minus beast so he can win Belle, but not for glory. He's just pompous, self-centred person. But films like 'My Neighbour Totoro' works without a villain, it's shows the struggle of the main character. As much as I love this film and its story, the book version would've been a better choice to adapt. As of the movie. I love the side characters and climax, and I do accept the Disney version by the way. The songs are fun and the animation very fluid and colourful.",6,3,4,19 August 2014
Rise of the Guardians," Not great
","I'm a fan of Dreamwork's films since I saw Shrek and think that they were great. But after Madagascar 3 and with the Shrek series coming to a close and that there is a wait for another Kung Fu Panda sequel, I think their films are going down hill and that began with this movie. I understand Jack's feelings of being alone and feeling unappreciated but the acting was very bland and sound more like it's for a pretty boy rather then a whimsical character. I think Alec Baldwin as a Russian Santa was really good as he had put on some great voices for some characters, like his Fat Controller/Sir Topham Hatt voice in the 5th and 6th season of Thomas the Tank Engine in 1998 and 2002. I'm not a fan of Hugh Jackman's acting, I find him bland and him as the easter bunny was bland and stupid as he sounds like an Australian bogan. The voice for the character should've gone to Chris Hernsworth, he has a booming voice that sound so bad ass for him. Hugh Jackman is no bad ass, not even him in Wolverine make me want to see it. The villain was bland and not even fearsome to look at and sandman's revival was never explained in the end of the film. I don't like this film and it's not worth watching.",2,5,19,21 July 2013
My Neighbor Totoro," One of the best animated films of all times
","I've heard so much about this film for years but never had the time too. However I bought myself the DVD, along with a Blu-Ray version of 'Howl's Moving Castle', another of Miyazaki's great work. And with its fantastic storytelling and 2D animation I was fascinated by its work. The characters are memorable, the music brings out some emotion and the story was nice and simple and is not like the many kids films were it needs to have a hero, a villain etc. it's just a story of two little girls who have an imagination of a bear character known as Totoro. As kids films do have a message, like most of the director's great work, it's hard to underly what the message is of the film, most idiots may 'think' that Totoro is the symbol of death, when really he isn't as the mother in the hospital was OK, look at the end credits, and that the shoe that was found in the pond was not Mei's at all. To me I think there is no message, it's just a fun film to escape the depths of reality. As of the voice acting for the US audience I prefer the Disney version. I never grew up with the Fox one but I've seen it and the voice acting is just stiff, loud and awful, I'm sorry if I've offended fans of the 1993 dub, but not everyone is a nostalgic hipster and are not blinded by the rose coloured glasses of nostalgia. The Disney's version, before anyone asks Disney is the distributor and dubbing work of the Ghibli films for the English audience. The latter version is better as the voice actors were better. Their voices are more relaxed, realistic and great, especially the fanning sisters. I think Totoro is one of the greatest animated films of all time and probably one of the greatest movies of all time. It's a very inspiring piece of work that it fuels up my dream of becoming an animator and writer. If you have the chance to see the movie with your kids or if you're a big Miayzaki or Studio Ghibli fan I recommend buying this DVD.",10,1,3,13 May 2014
Suicide Squad," An Avengers style movie with a bit of Deadpool but with bad guys instead
","After watching the horrendous 'Batman V Superman: The Dawn of Justice' I was hoping that this movie would be better and to be honest. It was average. But there were some flaws, major ones too. One of the characters I hate would be Slipknot, while they introduce us to the characters they never mentioned about him once and he was just there for a few minutes and then they killed him. So why do they need to introduce him? Why do they if he's not going to have any importance to the plot. They never mentioned him again and they don't seem to care about it. Next time if you're going to introduce the character that will have no impact towards the plot just don't do it. Second of all I hate how The Joker is so minimal within the movie when he did nothing that was important. But he's better than Jesse Eisenberg as a comedic version of Lex Luthor. But he was hyped up throughout the trailer acting like he's part of the team as well. But no DC decided to cut all his scenes out. Is he going to be part of a standalone Batman movie? I don't know, but most likely he is, but next time don't hype him up if he's going to have any bare part in it at all! But also a person suing WB because of it for some reason.Also why does a government official think it would be great to have a league of villains to stop the 'next' Batman? Even the characters question it. Why couldn't it be better to hype up the Justice League movie by having the JL characters band together and work as a team? Call it, 'The Dawn of Justice' I think it works that way better rather then this considering it feels like filler ready for the Justice League movie. The government official didn't even have a reason why to do this sort of thing anyway. We didn't see her wanting power, wanting to be better than the rest or anything all we see her is that woman who band these villains together.To be honest the actress of Quinn was pretty good though more average in my opinion. She definitely plays a crazy Quinn but some her lines that she delivered were sort of meh but the scene when she defeated the villain was good reverse psychology as we see her reverting a bit back to her old self like psychologist. I also like Will Smith's role too. The character he played, Deadshot. I like how he cares for his daughter despite what he does as a job. It definitely shows he has a heart and a human when it comes to the people he loves. Plus some of his lines that he delivered were good too as they have that Will Smith charm to it as well, especially, 'Lady, you are evil!' The same applies to El Diablo he felt bad for what he had done to his family and become a pacifist and rather not to kill anybody else. I think those three characters deserve there own movie and they should've been built up for this one like Marvel did for the Avengers. It would've been better if we get to know the characters and see them battling together. Plus it feels like Deadpool with the dark humour but trying to be serious as well.The other characters were bland or not really funny. I don't think Captain Boomerang was funny. His humour feels very childish and annoying and he hardly had any development nor backstory and pretty much most of the other characters in the squad didn't really have enough focus or time. Since there are deleted scenes it's not really surprising considering that DC and Warner Bros. had ripped some of the fans off with the theatrical version of Batman V Superman.The villain, Enchantress in my opinion was pretty meh. She was not really threatening, her motivation was clich√© and the whole flash thing that she did was not really anything and the CG, I think, for her was really bad. Her head stayed still but her body was shaking for some reason. In the end it was average but I don't think it's worth it for a moviegoer and since it's most likely this'll be down voted by DC Fanboys, bear in mind critics are people too and they too a movie fans as well. They have their own opinions like many things because like art, music etc. films are subjective, period and there's no such thing as a right or wrong opinion.",4,2,5,9 August 2016
Justice League," OK but Boring
","OK start your dislikes folks but these are my views of the film and I'm sticking to them. Of course I despised 'Batman Vs. Superman' probably one of the worst movies from Warner Bros. and DC comics. I hate the effects, I hate the characters and the story. All of that was to hype up this movie and what can I say about this one? I think it was OK but it was boring in some places! There was not enough action, the story was dull and uninteresting, the introductions of The Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman were weak, the villain is just unmemorable and dull and the there was so much overuse of slow motion during scenes with The Flash!When some of the actions was happening there were at times some excitement with the music and build up but after that it was all talk, talk, talk that really felt like a chore to watch. I know it was all build up but maybe we could've had the time to know more about The Flash or Cyborg maybe more about how they got their power, what were lives like before their super heroic abilities? Rather than doing that for a stand alone film. You know character development.There introductions were weak and thin, we know hardly about them. I think Aquaman was the weakest out of all the new characters. All I see in him is a bit like a douche bag and that's it. Sure everyone might say its a comic book movie for the fans of DC but I'm not a huge comic book fan but I enjoy seeing these types of movies. But for an average movie goer they would have no idea who these characters are and what they were like. It would've been better if DC and WB release the stand alone films first and then the big crossover movies. Marvel does that better. Marvel showcases the characters first so we can get to know them and their story and their super power. DC seems like they're taking shortcuts.The villain, oh god I think he was dull. He's your typical super villain that wants to destroy the world and that's it and despite that I do love animation, the CGI render of him makes him look more like something out of Playstation 1 game heck some scenes are its out from PS cutscene. The CG in this movie is good at times but it was overdone in the film. I think Cyborg looks so fake as his head was swaying from side to side when he walks while his body was in place. I hate the overuse of the slow motion when it comes The Flash's scenes. While I was watching the movie I kept rolling my eyes and groaning to myself inwardly at those scenes. It feels like it was dragging itself to meet the movie's time frame. Maybe it could've been better if you just showed the Flash doing things in real time? They did that earlier in the movie when he was visiting his father in jail. I know it's suppose to be those moments where it was his perspective but give it a break, we get it! He runs so fast!There were some good stuff. There was some good laughs such as after Superman threw Batman to the ground after he was resurrected and said 'Do you bleed?' Batman was actually hurt and bleeding and it gave me the little chuckle. The little banter between the heroes was a chuckle too. I think there was some good acting particularly from the guy who plays as Cyborg I think he was good with the serious talk and Gal Gadot was great as usual as Wonder Woman, which I have to say her stand alone movie was the best thing coming from WB and DC! There was character development, her strong powerful personality really shines with her sense of leadership and caring for people. She discovers the outside of her Island and learns how to blend in without being stupid! All of that that lead to this movie is something that WB and DC should try and do if they ever thought of rebooting this universe. But in the end, the movie was OK but dull and boring in the end. I was hoping this would be good after seeing 'Wonder Woman' but sadly it didn't.",4,2,5,21 November 2017
Cars," What's So Bad About It?
","People do have their own opinions but there is one thing I came across with, why do some people don't like this movie? I've seen when it came out in 2006 and loved it and I think its better then its sequel, in my opinion. Is because of the world of talking cars? Disney has created many films were animals talk, look at the Mickey Mouse cartoons, there is no people in there world, minus the ones during the early years of Disney. The story can be clich√©d, a big city race car driver goes to a small town, caused a ruck, hates the small town, get to know them and realises he was a jerk and so on and so forth. To me I like this movie. It has some nice atmosphere with the small town and the American dessert of the well- known route 66 with the animation and I do like the world of cars. The story is good too and even though its not in the bar of such great films like the Toy Story series and Monsters Inc. from Pixar, it's good recommendable movie for your kids.",9,35,36,23 June 2013
Frozen," It's Good But Not An Instant Classic
","I enjoy Frozen and I think it's definitely one of Disney's best, but after seeing this film a few times, I started to know that there are flaws in the story and the characters. Most particularly, it would be Elsa. She said that she doesn't care anymore about how people would see her, as mentioned in the good but sometime overrated 'Let it Go' song, I don't hate the song and I understand its message and impact of pop culture. But there are times when people need to shut up with singing that song! Back to Elsa, she said she's doesn't care about what people think of her, but when her sister came over to help, she was still scared of being an outcast because of what've happened earlier, by revealing her frozen powers to the people. Another thing I don't like about Elsa was that the movie never explained how she got her powers in the first place, my guess they could open up to a prequel or a short film, depends on where Disney is going with it, but it seems to lack her character. Elsa is not a bad character, but not a great character too, though I do like that her love for her sister. Coming to the other characters like her young sister, Anna, I really find her great. She's feisty and fun but also good hearted. Olaf, I know many people might as well despise the comic relief character as being either being obnoxious and annoying, but I find his naive nature funny and charming and his song 'In Summer' in my opinion is nice and catchy. Kristoff is another good character, despite his own personal flaws, he was a nice guy to Anna's nature.The story is nice, but it's nowhere serious nor better then 'The Lion King'. TLK's storyline is very serious and shows us the meaning of life in the pride lands and yes I know people would say that TLK was 'the Frozen of the 90's', but there's a reason why TLK was much loved, because of its serious storyline. 'Frozen' has a good story and it shows that love for anyone can thaw everything, love for your sister is the example in the storyline. Plus the storyline does break many of Disney's barrier's such as 'girl and boy fall instantly in love with each other and get married, ignoring who they are.', we see the developing relationship between Anna and Kristoff and it does well. Although I wouldn't say it was the first that there's no man to save the princess or Queen, that to me belongs to 'Brave', yes it's a dud from Pixar, but I find it decent.The CGI animation looks amazing, the snowy landscape, Arendelle is amazing to look at as well. So Frozen is good, but it has its flaws and I won't call it an instant classic and I do see why some people can call this movie overrated, that's if they've seen it and not finding it be 'cool'. But it's definitely one of Disney's good ones with its characters, story and animation.",8,2,6,19 October 2014
The Lion King," It's the original but with CG
","I LOVED the original as a kid and I still do today. I had it on VHS, DVD, Blu-Ray and now I can stream it. The 1994 classic still lives up today with its gorgeous animation and art style, memorable story and characters and timeless songs that would last many generations thanks to 1994 movie. But with Disney remaking old classics you know that The Lion King was done the line given its popularity over the years.Now I honestly don't have a problem with Disney doing them, especially to movies like Dumbo because of its age. Remake the classic to give it an update. However remaking The Lion King to me sounds like a bad idea because the film really didn't need to change. The Lion King didn't really have the same problems in the style of Dumbo. But because of this trend of remaking classic, Disney are bound to do it anyway.In the end, the visuals are good but the story is the same and even adding in little different scenes like the 'Be Prepared' scene and all really doesn't impact the film's narrative. While the visuals are good I REALLY HATED the emotionless faces of the animals. I remember the director saying that they wanted the animals to look realistic but here's the thing, emotions are important because it visually shows how the characters are feeling. He also said that there's body language but I'd hardly ever seen that much body language through the characters. It's a shame because the actors playing in this had done it their all with the emotion.However I felt the story was a bit rushed with its pacing around the third act and the scene with Simba talking to his dad in the cloud really didn't have much effort put into it unlike the original. No fault towards the VFX artists who worked hard on this film, this is more to the director of the film. I do like his films like 'Iron Man' but the direction was not really good here.This is geared towards Disney's marketing but I also hate how they keep saying these remakes are 'for a new generation'. How can these films be for a new generation when families have great access to the original films through every home media variation there is. Disney had been harping on the words 'Timeless classic' for a reason.People might say, 'If they changed the story then everyone will be up in arms.' and yeah that's a good point but there are choices for this film. Either remake it the same, change it or just not remake it at all and I feel. I feel that the Aladdin had done a far better job with its remake. It feels like its own film and while there were scene that weren't in the original they felt needed and moments like the Genie having a girlfriend didn't drastically deviate from the original story of the 1992 classic.At the end of the day, at least the original is still with us. Disney will keep playing the original classic more often on TV, streaming services etc. and the remake, while it will exist, it will be released on DVD, Blu-Ray, TV and streaming service (Disney + more likely) and that's it. I hardly see any of the recent remakes getting the same love post-cinema screening the same way as the originals.In the end, the film is the same as the original with dull emotionless animals. If you hate the idea of the story being similar, just watch the classic you're not really missing out anything. If you like the remake more power to you.",5,1,2,22 July 2019
Grave of the Fireflies," Powerful Story of What War Can Do
","I decided to watch this on YouTube as I've heard about it before. To me the movie is sad with its powerful storyline about what war can do to families. Loosing a family member from death, starvation and survival. The animation and the music make the movie emotional too, especially the death of the boy and his baby sister. The animation is incredible. The lining colour and backdrop really made this movie great along with the storyline. Though I don't much like the Voice acting that much. The teenage boy sounds a bit bright for a movie like this, but it's not annoying as I know he sounds like that just to make his baby sister not too worried about her mother. The ending was nice too. It shows us the spirits of the two kids now looking at the modern city in Japan. Though I would love it if were the whole family being reunited together and enjoying their afterlife together as a family again. But seeing the two kids was emotional to see and a nice way to end a great movie. The creator says that the movie that it's not an anti-war film but I think the theme shows what war can do to a family. It breaks them apart by death and starvation. The movie is a great one and definitely deserve a watch.",10,0,1,18 June 2013
Les Mis√©rables," Les Miserable
","I've seen this movie on the plane on my way back from Singapore to Sydney from London and I decided to give this movie a watch and see why everyone love this movie. I've seen the trailer and thought it has that over the top thing with its angles and quality of film and thought it was bad but I wasn't hard on it as it was a trailer and I thought this movie would be, like all musical films, to be having a story with dialogue and then some songs. But this...The entire movie was nothing more then just singing and singing and singing and singing, with a rare part of people talking, that it's just unbearable to watch. The movie felt like a series of songs as I don't even know what the story is about! Granted I haven't read the novel, but I'm not into whatever genre the book is in. The singing, the only actors that are good at that were the extra characters that played as the poor towns people and Anne Hathaway. However Russell Crowe is just awful he is no Pavarotti to me the movie feels like that it needs big name actors like him to make this movie a success. Hugh Jackman's singing, it's a little better then Russell Crowe's but it's not the best. As I stated before I haven't read the novel, but I don't even understand the story. What is the story? It's just a series of songs. Plus I find it very ridiculous of how Hugh Jackman's character manage to lift a huge mast from a boat off the ground by himself! It was just unrealistic of him to do that as that would've weighed how many tons! I know it's a musical, but when I see musical films I see the ones like 'Grease' or 'Give My Regards to Broad Street', I know that wasn't a success to some critics but at least that one has a story! Those movies have music numbers and dialogue that make a story and I think the director should've stayed close to the book rather then the musical. Plus I don't understand why in the movie it was set in France and yet all of the characters speak English, that also happened in the 1998 version. I haven't seen the musical but I can tell that the musical has more potential then the actual film. In conclusion, it's overrated, I don't understand the story with the singing and that they could've chosen better actors then big name ones. They should've called this 'Les Miserables: The Musical Movie'. However I do think Anne Hathaway is a good singer in this movie, so that is my only positive criticism about this movie. But that won't make me change my opinion about the entire film.",1,1,4,21 July 2013
The Disaster Artist," A Great Tribute to a Bad Movie
","I remember being first exposed to 'The Room' via the Nostalgia Critic back around 2011 I believe. I remember how bad the story is and the acting of Tommy Wiseau. But after seeing it it did leave me with a laugh. The movie was so god awful that it was hilarious and it felt natural rather than those movies *coughcoughsharknadocoughcough* that are forcibly bad because it was trying so hard to be a bad film it has no enjoyment to it. Hearing this movie coming out, I was very interested to see what went behind the scenes and oh my god I feel like this was all really filmed! Mostly during the sets of the film. The acting is superb probably the best acting I've seen in a movie and I think Dave Franco did great as Greg Sestero and James Franco was brilliant as Tommy Wiseau, heck the make up for him was stunning work that I almost feel like I was seeing the real one, but I'll get to him in a minute. The scenes during the set, particularly around the 'sex scene' where he was arguing with the crew. It had that raw emotion and how the way Wiseau treats his crew without any respect, what a scumbag! I genuinely felt angry that he did that! That goes to show that James Franco is a great actor. Now onto Tommy Wiseau, I feel a bit mixed with his character. I know he was suppose to be a scumbag as he was in real life but how the way it was delivered made me think him more as a glorified a**hole. Like how he treated his best friend for not taking that big opportunity to be part of 'Malcom in the Middle' because he has his reasons which resulted breaking up with his girlfriend. How the way he treated his cast and crew by spying on them, firing them because of reasons and was being weird towards them and yet 'The Room' is considered as his masterpiece despite all the crap that went into it. Now I don't hate the film but I don't like the creator of it all and it just put me off about him. However after seeing this movie I am interested in reading the book that it was based on to see more of what had gone on during the set as I heard there was more to it than what the film portrayed. In the end the movie was very good. I love the acting including Seth Rogen, I thought he was really good too! The story was interesting to watch and you can feel for the characters throughout the film that it makes them believable, although the actual cast and crew are real in real life :P I recommend this movie whether you know what The Room is or not! It's that good!",9,0,2,13 December 2017
Sausage Party," Funny and Crazy at the same time!
","I've been to my local cinema on Friday this week and ever since I saw the trailer I was rather interested in seeing this film with its concept and creativity. You could say 'What if food have feelings!' which is based upon the meme when 'Inside Out' came out in 2015 by Pixar. The movie is both funny with its R rated humour (or MA 15+ here in Australia) and crazy as well. It's a typical Seth Rogen film with his jokes about sex, drugs everything you see in one. Although I'm glad it's not about a sausage having sex with a hot dog bun and now he has to be a father, since there were two of those made by Rogen in the past; 'Knocked Up' (2007) and 'The Night Before' (2015) although for the latter it wasn't the focus but it still has that Rogen element. Although with that idea with food it would be pretty disturbing. The structure of the story was very good and the use of the characters were good too, they had a purpose to be part of the feature and they don't come off as pointless. The douche character was funny within the story with his jokes but I think they should've cut him out. The orgy scene though was very disturbing but as I said before it was a Seth Rogen film but it was also funny as well. The fourth wall joke at the end too was kinda pointless and didn't add much. Maybe it opens up as a sequel I don't know. Maybe they should've kept it as a post credit scene. It's funny though that the director, Greg Tiernan, in the past had directed the episodes and CGI specials of Thomas the Tank Engine. How funny is that! In the end the movie was good but I don't consider this to be the best animated film in comparison to other ones. It's funny, it's clever and it has messages about racism and different beliefs. Maybe this could lead to other CG Adult animated films but who knows.",8,16,35,12 August 2016
The Lion King," The King Of The Disney Renaissance Era
","I have the Diamond Edition of this movie on Blu-Ray and even to this day, The Lion King is one of the greatest movies that Disney has ever made. This is the movie gave Disney Renaissance a big name, a story based on Shakespeare's 'Hamlet', with great actors like James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons and Nathan Lane. Many memorable songs written by Elton John and Tim Rice, like 'Hakuna Matata' and 'Can You Feel The Love Tonight' that to this day, even the younger viewers of classic Disney films love to listen too. This movie has to be one greatest animated movies of all time and its certainly one of my favourite films ever. Their are a few dark scenes that children from around 1-5 would get scared of, so this movie is good for kids around 8 - 12, but its a movie for everyone, if you're a fan of classic Disney movies then I suggest to see this movie, buy it on DVD or Blu-Ray its still in stores.",10,0,1,22 April 2012
Mary and Max," Fantastic Movie!!
","I always say Australian films aren't great and as an Australian I don't really enjoy many movies made in my home country and I find mainstream actors like Hugh Jackman to be overrated in my opinion, sorry Jackman fans. But this film, made in Australia, is a rare one because I love this film period. The story of the film was great it shows the developing friendship between the two pen pals. The animation was incredible too with splendid smooth movement of the character unlike the clunky and weird stop-motion of Harviee Krumpt, which I do like. The music was nice and catchy too, especially the theme song as well. But if I have to choose my favorite scene, it has to be the ending when Mary found Max dead peacefully in his apartment room and when she saw all the mementos that Max kept from her all the way from childhood such as the pictures and the letters was emotional to watch, I nearly cried there at the ending. I recommend this movie and I liked this very much and its really one of my favorite animated movies of all time. You can feel the character's emotion and understand what they go through throughout this movie. Fantastic work and story.",10,1,4,8 April 2013
The Croods," Not Great but it was Good
","I'll be honest, but I think Dreamworks' movies aren't great since Madagascar 3. I've watched 'Rise of The Guardians' on the plane between Singapore to London from Sydney and didn't like it one bit and I've seen this movie on the plane between London to Singapore on my way to Sydney and I thought it was better then 'Rise of The Guardians'. There are some likable characters and it has a good message about not being afraid of anything new and the outside world. Plus the story was entertaining to watch. Some people are saying that this is the 'New Shrek' but looking at this film I don't see it as a Shrek film as those films have hilarious jokes, despite some toilet humor, that is made for adults and kids. There some funny jokes like shoes but they weren't laugh out loud jokes and as well as the 'Family road trip' scene when the dad says they'll enjoy it as a family and in the next scene the kids are moaning and arguing but they did give me a chuckle. If I have to choose one likable character it has to be the grandmother. Her personality was funny of her hating her son-in-law and her voice was well suited including her 'still alive!' joke. I heard that they're making a sequel and I wouldn't mind seeing it. In the end, it was good but just not the best Dreamworks movie.",5,0,2,21 July 2013
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Superman 2: Starring Batman and Wonder Woman
","I'm more Marvel than DC when it comes to movies. However I do like watching DC's animated TV shows as a kid and I don't really hate DC. The only DC comics movie that I enjoy was 'The Dark Knight' as it has a dark story but not droopy story with a good villain with some motivation and a good story structure. Something that this movie failed to do from start to finish. The bad things is Jesse Eisenberg portraying as Lex Luthor who is a mastermind and evil business man who hates Superman because he always foiled his plans whereas Luthor in this movie had no rhyme or reason to hate Superman and get his revenge. Plus how the way he portrayed the character was more crazy like the joker rather than evil and cold hearted and he gets very annoying in the end. Another problem is the forced and poor build up of Wonder Woman, she was just...there. Her character was nothing more than a random woman that chats with Bruce Wayne. We never see what she can do nor do we see her actually doing anything at all before joining the two superheroes in the final battle. If this is the way to build up for the Justice League or her own movie, they should've done it after the credits. That's how Marvel pulled it off so well when they are hyping up for their next movie like 'The Avengers'. Another big problem is the reason why Batman and Superman hate each other. The reason was so vague that it doesn't really make their rivalry anywhere interesting. It was just two big names fighting. I'm not a comic book purist but the comic book did a much better job for the rivalry between the two when it comes to the differences for justice and that could at least make them more interesting and more dramatic, in fact 'Captain America: Civil War' did that better when it comes to rivalry between Iron Man and Captain America. My god even the CollegeHumour video of the two has a much more better reason for them to hate each other, even if it's stupid. Plus the movie focused more on Super man rather than Batman to be honest. I also hate the total hypocrisy of Metropolis people. At first they hate Superman thinking that he caused major catastrophe, the 'Superheroes are bad' clich√© that even The Incredibles did as well, yet after he died people were somehow mourning for him. We never see the townspeople developed to like him at all. Marvel did the whole clich√©. But you don't see the townspeople or the people of earth just somehow liking the Avengers at the end after they defeated a villain as there are some people who hate them still for killing and hurting other people. Probably the worst thing of this movie is Superman's death. This is to hype up the 'Justice League' movie and so...what is the point of his death when he's going to come back anyway? They did it better in 'The Dark Knight Rises', *gasp* I'm comparing a DC movie not Marvel? How the way they deal with Batman's death was at least good with him faking his own death in order to finish his duties as Batman and live a normal life. Here Superman is dead, his body is shown dead and that's it and with that it is pointless now with the announcement of Justice League. Yes Superman is a strong (Mary-Sue) character but his death is just pointless. You could just say that he's leaving to think of what he can do to bring more justice to the world or something. Plus his 'resurrection' was poorly done as well. If you have people who aren't comic book fans then they're not going to get it. However I did hear from a friend who's a comic book fan that its the sun that's resurrecting him and since that makes total sense now and that DC is only pandering to the fans and not the wider public about this, it makes this character even worse.I heard that the director's cut is more better than what was seen in the cinema, and after reading up about because I can't be bothered going through this trash again, I don't think it would be any better. But that's also a problem towards Warner Bros. since the DC is praised by fans it makes me realise, why? Why release the theatrical cut rather than the DC version as originally intended? I think it's stupid that they did this but despite that I don't think 30min of additional footage would make the movie even better. The effects for the final fight scene was over the top and bland to look at and Ben Aflex to me was a terrible choice as he looks like a grump that doesn't want to play Batman. There are so many problems that this movie had suffered with but if you want to see two famous heroes fighting then this movie is for you. But just to let everyone know...I'm not 'paid' by Disney, despite that claim is absolutely stupid and DC fanboys shouldn't be making petitions to close down websites like Rotten Tomatoes period because they don't like hearing negative reviews. Marvel did their movies much better because they balance out the comedy and drama so well and they have enjoyable characters too. This movie is horrendous and not a worthy watch at all. The directing is bad, characters are bad, the motivation for two main characters is very weak, the story is everywhere and it feels like they were cashing out on Marvel/Disney success.",1,4,9,8 August 2016
Monsters University," Better Then The First
","Many people will say that sequel will not live up to the first movie. It happened to Cars 2 and even though I find that movie good I prefer the first movie more. But after seeing this movie, it does live up to the first. The movie has a well written story line, great character development and like all Pixar movies over the years, fantastic CGI. There was so much detail on the monsters that its better then the first. Even though the movie have the clich√©d college storyline like the jocks the villains, the nerd and simple people are the lame but good guys and of course the 'believe in yourself' plot line. But there are some moral teachings like 'You can't change' and 'Even though you aren't what you want to be, you can be surprised' and 'Being different is special'. It may not be the 'box office hit' critics and fans are expecting like 'Toy Story 3' but it's definitely well worth the ticket price when you see in the cinemas or theaters if you live in America.",10,8,14,23 June 2013
Saving Mr. Banks," Surprised Really
","I finally got to see the movie on Blu-Ray and I have to say the movie is really good and it's rather surprising for how mature Disney went with the movie. Usually when Disney or any film maker like Don Bluth makes a film about a real life historical figure, Pocahontas (1995) and Anastasia (1998), it's all sugarcoated adapting away from the real life events of that figure's history. Here, while it does adapt away some reality from the characters, they tend to keep most of it in. For example, P.L Travers' mother's attempted suicide, when her father died of the flu she, the mother, was struck with grief and was about to drown herself in a nearby lake, this is during her childhood, it wasn't successful, although that was adapted slightly different in the film, but they still put that part in and tend to have such a dark scene coming from the 'The Happiest Place on Earth' that also goes to her father's alcoholism, I do not support suicide or alcoholism though, if you suffer from them or anything else unhealthy, please get help, I'm just surprised that Disney put this stuff in as in the past they sugarcoat their past movies when it comes to historical figures making it inaccurate, that's a very mature move from Disney.The acting of the characters are so good too, Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson had done so well playing as them. Hanks manage to put some humour, light heartiness and emotion into Walt Disney and Emma Thompson really put in some stern, anger, cold emotion into Travers. I understand that there are some fictionalised parts in the movie, like Walt Disney helping out with the production as in reality he didn't, as it was Travers working with the Sherman Brothers and all in the production of 'Mary Poppins' adaptation. I'm not defending it but I understand that they put it in there for chemistry between Disney and Travers. I recommend watching this movie, it has good humour and it doesn't feel sappy or bad, you can actually feel for the characters, mostly Travers.",9,0,3,5 August 2014
Godzilla," Beats the 1998 version out of the water
","I remember seeing the 1998 version of Godzilla as a kid and years later after seeing it again, it was a terrible film. It was more focused on destruction with cheesy acting and terrible CGI and the design of Godzilla was more a dinosaur then what it was back in 1954. This version is better then the 1998 'adaptation'. It has great build up, tense and dramatic moments, a good storyline and back story. The characters are good too, maybe not too memorable though, but the actors did well in the film. The visuals are fantastic of the monsters (e.g - Godzilla) sticking close to the original design of what the Japanese films were like, in fact this fight scenes in the movie remind me of the old school Godzilla films and makes me want to watch them. I will admit there is a lack of fights between Godzilla and the monster but its all made up by the third act. It's better then the 1998 version and I've seen that film, as previously mentioned before, and it's terrible. The 2014 version is better.",9,3,9,17 May 2014
