The Lobster," How do films like this get a green light?
","A better question is how credentialed actors lend themselves to such a project. A totally preposterous story line, if there is even a linear thought here. A wooden script, read by actors as if they are still sitting around the rehearsal's first reading. If this is the future, then it's good we are living now.",1,0,3,5 May 2020
1917," War Movies - Tough to Make
","It's said that 'Dying is easy; comedy is hard.' Well that can be said for War Movies as well. This film might be technical and visual perfection, but it's a one trick pony after 15 minutes. I had a sneaky suspicion from the trailer how it would play and it lived up to expectations.",4,0,1,9 February 2020
Green Book," Uniformly Presented Period Piece Marred w/minor Errors.
","Most of the favorable responses accurately capsule this film and don't justify repeating. But such care in producing a fine effort is always diminished when annoyingly full of historical error. Aretha Franklin (referenced) was not a well-known performer in 62. A black police officer on the Macon force in 62? Hummm. Maybe. Lawrence of Arabia (background marquee) not released until a year after the setting. And always, wrong vintage cars being used. And would someone fact check whether Bobby Kennedy convinced George Wallace in 62 to order a small-town police chief to spring both guys within hours after what was, technically, a righteous detention? Come on, two years later he couldn't get a black in 'Bama without Federal Marshalls. Millions spent on such productions are routinely skimped when it comes to due diligence.",9,3,6,12 January 2019
