Source Code," Worthy of the SyFy channel
","Science Fiction is supposed to explore the unknown areas of science, not contradict common sense. Source Code talks about capturing the 'afterglow' of a dead person's brain activity through synaptic mapping. This is an interesting idea to explore, but how can anyone create even simulated experiences that the dead person *didn't* have, such as going into the conductor's office or a station and parking lot adjacent to the train? Second, how did the project scientists get this synaptic map, when the dead person was blown to bits by an massive explosion just 10 feet away from him, leaving nothing by splattered gray matter? (spoiler alert) Third, if only 'certain parts' of Stevens' brain were alive, they would have to be the parts involved in comprehension of speech, production of speech, seeing and complex thinking. Yet, in the scene where the audience sees where probes have been inserted into Stevens' brain, *none* of those areas were wired up. Not to mention that there were no visible signs for nutrients or other life support required for Stevens' body.If I could find these ridiculous flaws in 30 minutes after the film, the filmmakers should have thought of them months in advance of making the film. I hate 'syfy' whose core premises insults its viewers' intelligence.",2,21,44,3 April 2011
Argo," About as interesting as watching pasta boil
","Creating suspense when a movie's outcome is pre-ordained is a high art. 'Lincoln' (2012) did it. 'Flight 93' did it. 'Apollo 13' did it. 'Flags of Our Fathers' did it. What they shared in common what great characterization. 'Argo,' on the other hand, is almost solely about the narrative. What little characterization in the script is extremely pedestrian, and none of the hostage actors (except for Tate Donovan) has the chops to infuse it with credibility and empathy.The casting problem extends to Affleck himself. Always a piece of wood on camera, he again simply speaks his lines rather than embodies them (the scene where the CIA scuttles plan A excepted). Plus, since the movie went to great pains in the credits to show how physically similar the actors were to their real-life counterparts, why didn't Affleck get a portly, curly-haired Latino (Luiz Guzman comes to mind) to play Tony Mendez? The movie could have been more interesting if the story line had followed the actual events of the embassy workers being shuttled from the UK embassy to the Canadian embassy and receiving help from the New Zealand and Denmark embassy staffs. Then, I could have forgiven the hokey and completely fictitious climax. As it was, though, I nodded off a few times prior to the airport scene and simply didn't care at that point whether the hostages pulled off their caper.Like the pasta boiling, this movie needed some zesty sauce to be more than limp and bland.",3,12,17,19 February 2013
Hot Fuzz," Bloody, and Bloody Funny
","Hot Fuzz is a cheeky British parody of both the Agatha Christie murder mystery and the American violent cop (think Bad Boys I and II) genres. It starts out amusingly ridiculous, moves to snickeringly ludicrous, then takes it up a few notches to gigglingly over the top. Oddly enough, it's when the violence and gunplay got most extreme that I laughed the most. The hyper-violence, though cartoonish to adults, might be inappropriate for pre-teens, though.Simon Pegg, who also co-wrote the screenplay, stars as the nearly believably, over-virtuous constable Nicholas Angel of London's Metropolitan Police Service. Two years into the job, and Angel has 400% more arrests than the next best cop, making everyone else on the force look like a slacker by comparison. So, to eliminate this embarrassment, the chief ships him off to the countryside (the amusingly ridiculous part).Angel arrives in the sleepy hamlet of Sandford in Gloucestershire, where the town immediately seems a bit a Stepford-esquire. Angel swoops in and continues his incredible conscientiousness, pissing off townfolk and co-workers alike, except for the hero worship of his lazy, bumbling partner, Danny, the local police chief's son (and co-writer of the screenplay). Angel is bored out of his mind until there is a gory and apparently accidental death. Certain incongruities make him suspicious, although his coworkers can't believe that in their serene little town, this would be anything more than an accident. A few more of these, and Angel gets properly exercised, mostly at the police dept.'s comic unwillingness to believe that the deaths are connected. At this point, I was involved enough to share Angel's frustration, although the parody of the buddy cop relationship kept me chuckling.When Angel uncovers the truth behind the deaths and the town itself (the snickeringly ludicrous part), he takes it upon himself to take down all the bad guys himself. Of course, Danny rises to the occasion to help him. This is where the movie abandons all pretense of believability and goes gigglingly off the rails.To enjoy Hot Fuzz, you must not take anything in the movie seriously. The movie is not dumb, it's just a sharp and bloody variety of slapstick.",7,2,4,28 April 2007
Brokeback Mountain," Moving and beautiful
","By now, everyone who hasn't been on the run from the US law enforcement has heard Brokeback Mountain summarized as 'the gay cowboy movie.' Indeed, I think that the most interesting question about the film, and its themes, is whether it appeals to people other than gays, lesbians, and extremely open-minded people. Given the film's limited distribution, the film's distributor, Focus Features, didn't think so. Based on my thoroughly informal survey of half a dozen people, I was surprised to find that the three heterosexuals who had to be persuaded to see the movie were quite moved. I think what resonates for most people is summarized by Ennis DelMar (Heath Ledger), about the frustration of having to have a covert relationship with Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal): 'If you can't fix it, you've got to stand it.' These two have to live a lie in their marriages, enduring relationships that feel fundamentally wrong to them, with only brief breaks for the only relationship where they feel at ease on the most basic level. It's being trapped in a way most of us can sympathize with, but never really know. Amazingly, Ledger reveals his torment to the audience without saying much, and mumbling a lot of what he says. His body language, his lack of ambition, and his self-imposed isolation all scream that this is a guy who has never gotten the nurturing he needs and who believes he never can. Gyllenhaal conveys his agony more verbally, but less affectingly. He tells Ennis that he and his wife might as well have their marriage over the phone, he gets all huffy and stomps around when Ennis tells him he has to skip a seasonal rendezvous, but he doesn't convey the same level of inner agony with his body, in his vocal shadings, or in his other relationships with nearly the same skill and conviction that Ledger does. The cinematography turns the beautiful and rugged Wyoming backcountry (shot in the Canadian Rockies in Alberta) into another character, alternately echoing the beauty and the hardship of the two men's love. It feels perfect as the place to forge a bond between two men who work in nature, as a retreat from the outside world, and as a harsh challenge simply for the men to survive.The women in this film, although they get far less screen time than the men, put in wonderful, nuanced performances. Michelle Williams, as Alma DelMar, hits just the right notes of shock mixed with shame when she figures out Ennis' secret. You can almost hear her rationalize to herself, 'well, at least it's not another woman' as she tries to carry on with a regular family life. Her frustration with Ennis' 'fishing trips' has a believably sharp edge that leaks out from her control, as she struggles to reconcile her duties as wife and mother with her unhappiness. She's developed enough as a character that when she finally leaves Ennis for a reason other than his continuing affair, she makes it eminently believable.Twist's wife, Lureen (Anne Hathaway), on the other hand, doesn't react so kindly, turning harder and more bitter as the years go by without the love she has the right to expect. From a spunky teen rodeo princess, she transforms bit by bit, into a brittle ice princess. By the time she finally talks to Ennis, you get the clear sense that there's a seething anger barely hidden below her polite veneer.Although the theme of frustrated and forbidden love as a backbreaking burden has wide appeal, what ultimately makes Brokeback Mountain special is that it explores its theme in an unconventional relationship with great depth and tenderness during a period of great controversy about same-sex relationships in this country. I hope that in 10 years, I can watch this film again and be just as moved.",8,5,6,28 January 2006
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Visually handsome, cringe-worthy singing
","Take one musical with complex, non-rhyming lyrics, add two dramatic leads with voices fit only for a choir, and what you get is a visually handsome movie without entertainment value. Depp has the fierceness and snarl of a man hell-bent on bloody revenge down pat, and Rickman carries off the part of a covetous, imperious, manipulative tyrant with his usual aplomb. The only off-key performance was Carter, whose lack of energy is noticeable alongside even minor characters. The only truly affecting scene she has is with the street urchin, Toby, whom she's taken in to work in the shop. He sings beautifully of his fidelity to her and his wish to protect her from Todd, which makes her realize, with horror and sadness, that she will have to kill the boy to keep her and Todd's secrets.And while nobody really sings off key, none of the marquee names sings any better than to carry a tune. Since this is a musical, that's quite a serious flaw, made more obvious by the singing talent of each of the minor characters. Plus, Depp is a tenor, and the role originally called for a bass-baritone, the better to convey Todd's sinister and insane mind.If there's ever a traveling production of Sweeney Todd, I intend to see it to find what was lacking in the film.",3,4,9,20 January 2008
Capote," A Fascinating Character Study
","At first glance, Truman Capote is easy to caricature as an effete, liberal, New York snob of a writer. He had a soft, high voice. He lisped. His mannerisms were feminine. His first book, Breakfast at Tiffany's (based loosely on his relationship with Marilyn Monroe) is the sort of lightweight matter that would make you pigeonhole him as a minor author. But as Phillip Hoffman's masterful portrayal shows, Capote was much more complex. He was capable of being a warm, caring man and a manipulative careerist, frequently at the same time. His writing skills were first-rate, and he founded a literary genre than many have explored since his time.The scenes where Capote interviews and bonds with one of the killers, Perry Smith, are extraordinary in their subtlety and depth. The two men mesh like the negative and the print of the same photograph. Capote uses their common background both to give Smith genuine moral support and to extract the particulars of his life and heinous crime that made In Cold Blood a blockbuster. From Smith's end, he uses the relationship to get a better lawyer for an appeal and fill the desperate void of loneliness within him.Unfortunately for Smith, Capote holds the upper hand. To give his book a solid ending, he needs the specifics of the violence that took place that fateful night of the murder. He also needs Smith and his partner executed. He pushes Smith's buttons intuitively and expertly, alternately radiating warmth and professional hardness in order to crack Smith open for descriptions of the bloodletting. As the movie progresses, Hoffman's mounting anguish over the conflict between supporting Smith and pursuing his own agenda became both compelling and repellent. I wanted to shake Capote and tell him that gaining his objective would ultimately damage him. Evidently, it did. Capote never finished another full-length novel (although he twice won the O. Henry Memorial Short Story Prize), and he died from complications of substance abuse at age 59.The movie is not without flaws. Between the Capote-Smith interview scenes, the movie drags. The sub-plot involving Capote's relationship with his lover never gains traction. And his friendship with Lee Harper (author of To Kill a Mockingbird) serves only to provide another perspective on Capote himself. But these are forgivable flaws in light of two of the best performances of 2005.",7,0,0,25 November 2005
Gone Baby Gone," Gritty policier about the limits of policing
","The movies Gone Baby Gone and Mystic River are both adaptations of books by the same author. Gone Baby Gone was the author's earlier work, and it explores much of the same territory as the later book. Interestingly, the movie versions have a parallel workmanship. Gone Baby Gone was directed by a first-timer (Ben Affleck), with a young actor as the lead, while Mystic River was directed by a very experienced director (Clint Eastwood), with a mature actor in its lead role. One would expect that comparing the two movies would be like comparing a soup to a stew: The stew should be richer, with more texture, flavor, and subtlety.It's a surprise, then, that I liked Gone Baby Gone nearly as much Mystic River. The reason is that these movies are not really about their police investigation plots. They are about the choices people make when faced with the limits of police in providing justice. With the older characters in Mystic Rivers, one understands that they are at a time in their lives when they're acting largely on personal ethical codes that have been in place for decades. In Gone Baby Gone, one has the treat of seeing a young person thrust into situations that force him to make the decisions that will crystallize his ethical codes for decades to come, as well as the choices of older people fed up with the limits of the police.The vehicle for illustrating the choice of a young man is Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck), a young private investigator, aided by his girlfriend, Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan). Kenzie plies his trade in Boston's tough, working-class, Dorchester neighborhood. Based on his contacts in the neighborhood, Kenzie provides detectives with the first valuable leads in the case. This leads to the detectives confronting the girl's mother, Helene (Amy Ryan). Helene turns out to have been snorting coke for two hours when she first claimed to have left her daughter alone for just a few minutes. This is where the first of Casey's qualms starts. Helene is not only a coke addict, but predictably, a selfish, immature, and irresponsible woman, thoroughly unfit for motherhood. As the detectives grill Helene, Kenzie's face shows his struggle: If he finds the daughter, should he bring her back to her mother? If he shouldn't, should he lie to the mother about this in the meantime to keep her cooperation? This is just the first of many choices that Kenzie has to make as he follows the case down some very dark and dangerous paths. What's pleased me is that throughout the movie, Kenzie acted exactly as you'd expect an ethical, grounded, but *young* person to act when trying to do the right thing in morally murky situations. There were no heroics that were out of character, none of the deliberations a more experienced and jaded PI would have gone through, and even his questionable actions stem from a desire for a just outcome. The irony is that his investigation keeps getting covertly blocked by more experienced adults also trying to do what's right, but from a more world-weary perspective.There are some very good performances in this film. Affleck, in only his second major film, turns in solid work as Kenzie. He's believably street-wise, tenacious, stoic, and decent. Ed Harris, as Det. Remy Broussant, is the center of gravity in almost every scene he's in  without chewing up the scenery. But the real surprise is Amy Ryan as Helene. It's tough to play someone as unsympathetic as Helene and still make her believable, and she hits every note perfectly. There were times when I even found myself rooting for her to redeem herself, only to be disappointed when she failed.There are some problems with the film, as you'd expect with a first-time director. The character of Angie is given too little to do, which is a shame, since Monaghan's performance hinted that she's just as capable an actress as Affleck is an actor. There are a few sequences that needed to be trimmed or cut. In addition, the episodic structure of the film is jerky, looking like it was going to end several times during the film, rather than going smoothly to the next segment. The Dorchester accents get very thick, making a fair amount of the dialog impossible to understand in detail. Morgan Freeman, reliable when playing a straight-arrow character, is unconvincing as someone dealing in shades of gray. But the worst blunder is the speeches passed off as dialog, especially the ones in the movie's climactic scene. They are completely out of character for the people in the scene, and they could have been made into crisp dialog fairly easily, if the director had wanted.Overall, however, the film's strengths far outweigh its flaws. I look forward to seeing more from both Afflecks in the future.",7,2,5,10 November 2007
The Aviator," Soars above other biopics
","In the past month, I've learned just how hard it is to make a great biographical film. Movies can suffer from an unremarkable subject (Bob Crane, in Auto Focus), not delve deeply enough into a subject's character (Ray, about Ray Charles), and not hit all the right emotional notes (Kinsey). The Aviator soars on all these aspects as it captures the most glorious slice of the life of Howard Hughes, the filmmaker, aviation innovator, and mentally unstable billionaire.Granted, the movie has an easier time with its subject matter, because Hughes lived a flamboyant life. At age 21, he began filming Hollywood's then most expensive, Hell's Angels, and he was 25 and 4 million dollars poorer (that's 52 million in today's money) from his personal fortune before it was released, having assembled the world's largest private biplane feat, flying them to wherever he could find clouds to film (to increase the sense of the planes' speed), and re-shooting the movie from a silent film to a talkie. He produced a number of outlandish movies, including the original blood-spattering Scarface, and the provocative western The Outlaw, memorable mainly for its emphasis on Jane Russell's breasts. He wined, dined, and presumably bedded many leading ladies of the day, including Jean Harlow, Ava Gardner, and of course, Katherine Hepburn. Where Hughes took his real risks, though, was in aviation. He was a brilliant technical innovator and a business visionary. Whether designing and flying test planes for the Air Force, building the first coast-to-coast airlines, or challenging a congressionally-proposed monopoly on international flight, Hughes did everything in a huge way. Both Leonardo DiCaprio, as Hughes, and Martin Scorsese, the director, capture the dashing and erratic Hughes with the same boldness as Hughes lived the first part of his life. DiCaprio's intensity as a man driven by his obsessions drew me into the movie immediately. When he casually, but intently, calculates whether he can buy TWA to further his airplane dreams, I accepted that while the purchase might be a stretch, it was also a foregone conclusion. When he flies an experimental plane at 352 MPH, I was grinning as widely as Hughes. When he dates Katherine Hepburn (an outstanding performance by Cate Blanchette), there's no doubt that fiery 'Katie' has met her match. And when he publicly confronts a corrupt senator intent on humiliating and bankrupting the billionaire, all you see is Howard Hughes spitting fire in a verbal fight for his life.DiCaprio captures Hughes' growing mental illness just as well as his derring-do. Dicaprio spent some time with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder sufferers to study for the role, and it paid off  he captures the mannerisms perfectly, along with Hughes' horror at a disease that is engulfing him. When he began to obsess about cleanliness, I tensed, not wanting this great young man to begin the slide into insanity. Every time he washed his hands till they bled, recoiled at a speck of dirt on a suit, and opened a doorknob with a Kleenex, my jaw clenched as I silently urged him to pull out of the grip of his illness. The frustration and anguish Hughes experienced as went out of control and locked himself in his screening room to give his disorder full run twisted my stomach, aching for this classically tragic figure.Cate Blanchette will get an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress for her embodiment of Hepburn. At first, I giggled at the harsh reedy voice, distinctive speech cadence, and overbearing manner Blanchette presented (I giggled at Hepburn, too, when I saw her interviews). But pretty soon, especially as she and Hughes gelled as a couple, I believed Blanchette's performance completely, in her patrician act with her snobby Connecticut family, in her outrage at Hughes' frequent newspaper appearances with starlets, and especially in her tender scene where Hughes confesses his fear about his mental illness.Scorsese is nearly flawless, too. From the co-written screenplay, to the pacing, to the CGI aerial scenes, and the nuanced performance he gets from all the major and supporting characters, this film is the equal of his other great efforts. While it's not as hard-edged as Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, or Gangs of New York, it's a hell of a lot more fun. See this one in the theater, even if you have a big-screen TV. If you have one, see it again when the movie comes out on DVD and invite some friends.",10,7,11,11 November 2007
Judgment at Nuremberg," Important historically and today
","The films Judgment at Nuremburg and Inherit the Wind aren't so much artistic experiences as polemic ones. Although both movies hang their hat on historical events, neither film is actually about the surface events in the film. Directed by the same man and released within a year of each other, their purpose was to get audiences rooting for the forces of reason, and oppose the irrationality of the herd mentality Judgment at Nuremburg is about a fictional trial of German judges who let themselves be swept up in the ethnic hatred promoted by the Nazis, delivering verdicts that they had decided upon before the trials over violations of racial purity laws had even begun. The film was written as a reaction against McCarthyism, which had gripped America for a decade and burned out just five years before the film. The film intended to show the danger of movements of mass hysteria, and how easy it is for an entire society to commit atrocities in the name of defending their country. The movie's tactics are heavy-handed. You can almost see the defense attorney getting rabid as he uses the same vicious illogic to attack the prosecution's witnesses as he used to shred the defense's witnesses when he prosecuted defendants on behalf of the Third Reich. If that weren't obvious enough, the movie drives the point home with a monologue from one of the defendants about how the judges lied to themselves -- first to protect their country from the Russian threat, then to save themselves at the expense of innocent people. A modern American audience might be entitled shake their heads at the absurdity of Nazism and McCarthyism, if it weren't for the same phenomenon taking place today, with Muslim terrorists being the scapegoats and justification for a range of brutalities and civil rights restrictions.Inherit the Wind is, on the surface, about the famous Scopes evolution-teaching trial in Tennessee in the 1930's. The movie paints a stark portrait of those enlightened by science and the ability to think for themselves as oppressed by those caught in the mindless vise-grip of fundamental Christianity. There is some sparkling courtroom dialog between the two leads, but the point was clearly to portray the fundamentalists as idiotic buffoons. While I'm all in favor of putting facts ahead of faith, caricaturing opponents of your viewpoint may make good propaganda, but it's terrible drama. Despite this, the movie is instructive about the constancy of this particular struggle, since it continues today, using the same arguments on both sides. In fact, the divide between the rationalists and religionists is arguably worse today, as both camps diverge on a growing number of fundamental values.My reactions to these movies was not so much to like them or dislike them, but to despair over the fact that as a nation and as human beings, we continue the insanely destructive patterns depicted 45 years ago. It seems that we have learned nothing from our past, or perhaps, as human beings, we are simply locked into a limited set of behaviors that doom us.",6,2,6,11 November 2007
Ender's Game," A gorgeous adaptation of a classic of sci-fi
","If this movie had attempted to portray the entirety of the 384-page book on which it was based, it would have been a six-hour film. With a running length of 1:54, the writers and directors were forced to create a gorgeous highlights reel and depend on the audience's familiarity with and love for the book. Those fans, me among them, have been waiting nearly 30 years for a movie that the author approved of, and we can fill in the gaps.The visual effects were awesome, and I use that word in the traditional sense. The scenes in the battle room of the Battle School and the Command School simulation rooms were as finely wrought as any FX I've seen and took my breath away. The sense of fear, tumult, and finally horror in the final battle scene is something visceral that no description can truly convey.What time there was for emotionality at the end was well played by Asa Butterfield and Harrison Ford. For a newcomer, Butterfield nailed the impact that responsibility for genocide would have on an 11-year-old. Ender's Game may not win any converts to the sci-fi genre or to Card's quintet of books about Ender's universe, but it will win the hearts of those who've read his works and waited for a movie to do justice to the first one in the series.",8,2,6,31 October 2013
Dallas Buyers Club," Two shining performances
","Other reviewers have ably reviewed this film, so I'll just say that this small gem is the best film I've seen so far this year. Both lead actors give sparkling performances, and in scenes where they share the screen, you might need sunglasses to handle the sun-bright intensity.Of note is that this entire film was shot in only 23 days and Leto, in particular, said in an interview on the Daily Show, that he didn't have much time to rehearse, making the performance even more impressive. The only detraction was Jennifer Garner. She barely projects the authority of a nurse, let alone a doctor, even though female doctors in the 70's (and maybe today) were second-class citizens.",8,64,94,7 December 2013
No Country for Old Men," A dismal tide of nihilism
","To call this film an elegy to a simpler, more civilized society, would be, well, too civilized. If you want a good in-depth analysis of the nihilistic message of this film, read this review: http://tinyurl.com/33eer8 The time for this movie (and the recent book it was based on) was 30 years ago. Then, it would have been an insightful social commentary. Anyone paying attention to the world since that time has received the director's message loud and clear, over and over, just by watching or reading the news. It's clear that the world has become a more savage place, that individual efforts to resist the downward spiral are futile. To shoot at, stomp on, and rip up the bloody corpse of a civilized society is completely unnecessary and adds nothing to the conversation.As entertainment, the film fails, too. There are no real people in this film, only stock types: the naive, greedy, sap, the overmatched lawman, the unstoppable bad guy, the sensible western wife, the scummy Mexican jackals. There is no one to engage with, sympathize with, or be terrified of, because everyone in the movie is just a caricature. The CG character of Gollum in the Lord of the Rings had more substance than the hyperviolent hit man in this flick.As a result, crackerbarrel philosophy is passed off as sage insight, and cruel violence is passed off as a good time. At least Pulp Fiction, this movie's closest cousin, had wit and characterization. The fawning reception of this movie by critics and moviegoers angers and baffles me.",3,40,81,23 November 2007
The Incredibles," Another zany hit from Pixar
","By now, I've grown accustomed to mind-blowing CGI animation from Pixar Studios. But it's the blend of clever, funny, and zany storytelling and characterization made possible by the animation that has continually delighted me whenever I see a Pixar film. The studio continues this trend in The Incredibles.I'm probably the second-last person in the U.S. to see the film, so I won't bore you with the plot details of a retired superhero family in the Witness Protection Program coming back to save humanity. A lot of the comedic gags depend on you being surprised by them, so I won't spoil the tremendous fun you should have when you first see them. Well just a little  the super-powered sibling spat at dinner scene will have every parent wishing for Helen Parr's powers.Craig Nelson, who voices Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible, is the perfect choice for this character. His prior TV work (Coach and The District, in particular) have given him plenty of experience in conveying an engaging blend of bravado, sincere deadpan humor, and compassion. Likewise, Holly Hunter, who voices Helen Parr/Elastigirl, has plenty of range, conveying exasperated housewife, concerned wife, supportive and worried mother, and confident superhero with aplomb. The nice surprise is Spencer Fox, who voices, Dashiell 'Dash' Parr. His brash glee at finally being unleashed to use his super speed in ways he never imagined is thoroughly infectious. The script doesn't give Sarah Vowell, who voices Violet Parr, isn't given much to do, and doesn't even get a superhero name, so it's hard to say much of anything about her performance.The movie's pace is frantic, but you'll be happily out of breath trying to keep up.",8,0,1,11 November 2007
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Intelligent, timely, and heavy-handed
","To create a showdown drama, the movie keeps a laser-sharp focus on the public media duel between Murrow and McCarthy. Nearly all the scenes take place in the CBS building or the nearby bar where the CBS journalists hang out. There's no dealing with Murrow's or McCarthy's backgrounds or personal lives. There's just one related minor sub-plot about the 'Red Scare.' Focusing so tightly on a short period in time and very few places served to heighten the risks that Murrow and his support team took, and the courage they mustered to face them. The black-and-white cinematography was a good choice, both for period authenticity and reinforcing the starkness of the showdown. These elements, combined with Murrow's spartan personal manner, created a tension and claustrophobia that riveted me. As Murrow, Strathairn is terrific. According to what I've read about those knew Murrow, Strathairn captured Murrow's reserve, intensity, body language, and quiet anxiety exactly. When contrasted against McCarthy's flamboyance, blustering, and even charm, Murrow comes off like a sleek, deadly, truth-seeking missile. It was a bold stroke to have Mcarthy represent himself by showing him only in clips from archival news footage. There's no chance that anyone can criticize an actor, director, or producer for misrepresenting McCarthy, when scene after scene, the senator himself behaved like the Grand Inquisitor. Of course, one can make the charge that selective playing of the archival news footage demonstrates an obvious bias. But at least the filmmakers are upfront about it: When CBS CEO Bill Paley questions whether Murrow is presenting both sides of the McCarthy story, Murrow declares, ''I've searched my conscience, and I cannot accept that there are two equivalent sides to every story.' Murrow's dedication to the facts of the case and his declaration that not all sides of a story should carry equal weight are a clear slap at the 'fair and balanced' approach to network news reporting today.If this rebuke had remained largely implied, this would have been a thoughtful film that respected its audience's ability to draw its own conclusions. But the filmmakers clobbered the audience with their criticism of American news reporting and television usage in general. By bookending the movie with Murrow's retirement speech to his co-workers, the movie drove these points into the ground. Apparently, this heavy-handedness was intentional from the genesis of the movie. The film was produced by Participant Productions, a venture of Jeff Skoll, an Ebay founder. Each Participant picture tries to extend its themes through accompanying 'social-action campaigns.'' Said Participant's president, Ricky Strauss, 'It's a key part of our business to use the social-sector organizations. Jeff created the company with the idea that media can create social change, and we need to give audiences a chance to do that.'' Crossing the line between drama and advocacy significantly weakens the film dramatically.In addition, the movie is so tightly focused that the missing historical context lessens the film's credibility. More back-story on the communist fears of the McCarthy era and Murrow's career would have reduced the propagandistic subtext. Also, the sub-plot about the married co-workers who have to keep their marriage a secret seems out of place. If there was a connection to the main story, I missed it.There are many lessons one can draw from Good Night and Good Luck: Character assassination is wrong, and that we need, and need to support journalists who would speak truth to power, to name two. Myself, I came out of the movie remembering two famous sayings:  'Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.'  George Santayana 'Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel.'  Samuel Johnson",7,7,11,5 November 2005
The World's Fastest Indian," Speed, charm, and glee
","Few actors/actresses can consistently disappear into their characters. Anthony Hopkins, who plays Munro, is one of them. In fact, the only times I've been truly disappointed with Hopkins is when he plays someone normal, like an FBI agent (Bad Company) or a kindly old man (Hearts in Atlantis). Make him a psychotic ventriloquist (Magic), an eccentric painter (Surviving Picasso), a paranoid president (Nixon) or a cannibal (Silence of the Lambs), and he's riveting. It's on the strength of Hopkins' characterization of the quirky, obsessed, yet down-to-earth Munro that this film succeeds. This is a movie with heart and charm. It makes you feel good about our species without getting overly sentimental  a rare feat.Munro is the type of guy that Americans lionize: the entrepreneur, the engineer, the man who sticks with his vision, year after year, in the face of ridicule. Yet few Americans would put up with Munro's flip side: engine tests at the crack of dawn, any day of the week; an unkempt yard made of weeds and grass gone to seed; only a basic grasp of the social graces. Luckily for the audience, Munro's neighbors are fairly tolerant of Burt.In addition to being about Burt's mission, the movie is also about Burt's marvelous road trip to Bonneville. Funded by his community, Burt sets gamely off on his journey without a firm grasp of American import regulations, American culture, and the rules of Bonneville's 'Speed Week.' Unburdened by these constraints, Burt solves one challenge after another  mechanical, social, and financial  as they come, with resourcefulness and grace.The scenes at the Bonneville Salt Flats make this movie worth seeing in the theater. I can't imagine getting the same sensation of speed and accompanying adrenaline rush from even a 54-inch screen.Hopkins has said that this film is it's the best thing he's ever done, and while I could quibble, I couldn't argue with the grin on my face and euphoria inside as I left the theater.",8,1,1,4 March 2006
Invictus," Inspired playing
","I probably can't add anything insightful to the nearly-300 reviews. But what I can say is that I let tears of joy and delight course down my face frequently throughout the film, first at Mandela's fusion of shrewdness & nobility in promoting the national rugby team, second at getting the team to expect and give more of themselves and reaping the rewards, and lastly, at the effort paying off on a huge scale. We will not see Mandela's like again in our lifetime.",8,0,1,28 May 2019
The Da Vinci Code," Entertaining, but not engaging
","The plot line of the The DaVinci Code is fairly taut, without too many holes, contradictions or loose ends. I imagine that to many Christians, the explanation of the faux-religious root of the mystery will seem slow and pedantic. As a non-Christian, however, I appreciated the intellectual hand-holding, and recommend that you forgive this minor fault. There aren't too many surprising twists, however. Both my wife and I guessed the identity of the secret character far in advance of the movie's revelation.Part of what makes a murder/conspiracy mystery movie work for me is people's reactions to the mystery itself and the mayhem that affects them as they unravel the mystery. All throughout The DaVinci Code, I kept waiting for the two protagonists to react in a way that was consistent with (a) the continuing mortal danger they were in (b) the background of their characters. How many academics (Indiana Jones excepted) can you think of who wouldn't retch at the sight of a ritually murdered body, and who wouldn't freeze like a deer in the headlights with a gun pointed in their face? And isn't it reasonable to expect a veteran cop, even a desk-bound one, to have some degree of clear-headedness in a crisis? Instead, you get the opposite. Professor Langdon goes from befuddled to resourceful with a cool reserve that James Bond would admire in an instant, apparently immune to the effects of adrenaline. Conversely, Det. Neve spends most of her screen time looking frightened or confused, and occasionally disabling bad guys. And both of them seem strangely muted in their reactions, given the excitement of a grail quest combined with a constant effort to avoid being killed. Combined, this doesn't make for particularly sympathetic or interesting characters.The most interesting character is Sir Leigh Teabing, a friendly rival academic of Langdon's, and who joins Langdon and Neve in their adventure. To say more, unfortunately, would spoil the movie.",4,3,7,1 June 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Action, action, action!
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the longest book in the Harry Potter series: 734 pages. When the movie adaptation was first discussed, the plan was to make two movies out of the book, to give room for all the sub-plots and emotional development of the characters. The filmmakers should have stuck with plan A. Although the movie is visually spectacular and action-packed, the film suffers from the editing required to squeeze the massive book into a single movie.The special effects and CGI of the film are seamlessly integrated with the live action, making for stunning visual magic (and for a production budget of $150 million, you should expect nothing less). I couldn't help but hold my breath during the sequence where Harry battled a Hungarian horn-tailed dragon. I jumped a bit when the mer-people attacked Harry while he was underwater, rescuing his friends. And the scene of the evil Lord Voldemort's reincarnation made my skin crawl.But good visuals are only part of the movie. In the previous three installments of the HP saga, the emotional bond and development of the intrepid trio of Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger made for sympathetic characters. The compaction of the Goblet of Fire book squeezed most of the life out of the characters, despite the film's focus on issues of teenage romantic angst. Harry, in particular, came off as bland. Although this may be partly due to condensing the book, I wonder if Dan Radcliffe, who plays Harry, simply doesn't have the skills to both make Harry a wizardly action hero and a flesh-and-blood person with so much action demanded of him. Ron Weasley comes off the best, seeming the most like a real, male teenager: filled with conflicting emotions about his friends, fear and ignorance about girls, and grunting as a substitute for talking. Plus, Rupert Grint, who portrays Ron, shows a deft comic touch.Brendon Gleeson, who plays Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody, the Professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts, is also a hoot. Gleeson walks the tightrope between wanting to protect his students and coming completely unhinged from the accumulated trauma of fighting dark magic all his life. He can go from entertaining his students to scaring the living daylights out of them and back before they can catch their breaths. In his best scene, he is fiercely protective of Harry, inappropriate, and scandalously funny, all at the same time.The portrayal of Dumbledore, however, is completely inconsistent with the prior films. He's devolved from Richard Harris' calm, wise, benevolent, and subtle 2000-yr-old headmaster to Michael Gambon's moody, uncertain, and twitchy bundle of nerves -- like a robed Al Pacino on a bad day. In the first three Potter films, I could easily believe that Voldemort would fear Dumbledore's skill and cunning. Now, I'm equally certain that Voldemort could dispense with Dumbledore by paralyzing him with his own indecision.As a piece of teenage entertainment, the movie is several cuts about the pack of typical action flicks aimed as this age group. In addition to the great production values, I think teens will relate to the awkwardness in dating protocols and rituals. The loyalty that the three friends display despite their growing pains and Harry's moral fortitude under duress provide good role modeling. But as an adult, I wanted more meat on the bones of this part of the saga.",6,0,0,27 November 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Thank goodness its over
","There's probably nothing I could say to dissuade a Star Wars fan from seeing the concluding episode to this space opera, and nothing I could do to persuade a non-fan to see this movie. So, all I will say is that for fans, this is like attending your child's college graduation: you're proud of the kid, and you're relieved to be moving on to the next phase of your life. You'll love the guaranteed-spectacular CG effects, you'll tolerate dialog that your grandmother could have written better, and you'll be satisfied that the story cycle is complete. Those not inclined to see this movie to begin with may get a laugh out of the review posted at http://bleacheatingfreaks.com/.",5,4,7,11 November 2007
Donnie Darko," Winner of the 'mess with your head' category
","Watching a teenager appear to descend into the madness of paranoid schizophrenia is not a pleasant thing to watch, but Jake Gyllenhaal is completely convincing and very sympathetic. I sympathized with him and his parents, who, like most people, are not equipped to accept or cope with this mental illness, much less help their son. I was involved enough in the story and characters to be angry with the psychiatrist, who should have had the parents commit the boy for in-patient psychiatric treatment about mid-way through the film. After Donnie vandalized his school and committed arson, I steeled myself for the inevitability that he would use his father's gun.If the plot had played out to a conventional conclusion, it would have been merely notable. But the reason this film has achieved cult status is its deliberate attempt to mess with your head. After you've accepted the grim nature of the movie, the filmmakers throw in a crazy, pseudo-scientific twist at the end designed to make you say 'What the hell?' and spend the next 30 minutes discussing it with your viewing buddy. I could tell you not to try to make sense of it, but you won't be able to help yourself.If you decide to rent this movie, be sure to get the director's cut. There were 20 scenes deleted from the theatrical release, most of which needed to be put back in.",7,0,1,23 December 2007
Cinderella Man," A good man worth cheering for
","I'm not a fan of boxing as a sport or boxing movies in general. In fact, the only boxing movies I've seen before this one were Rocky and When We Were Kings, both of which had a large 'Cinderella' factor. Unsurprisingly, I was inclined to see this movie for the same factor. Cinderella Man did not disappoint, and it has appeal beyond the comeback story.The movie viscerally connects the audience with the desperation of many Depression-era families, mainly by contrasting Braddock's continuing simplicity and decency with the tragedy of the times. Americans have always preferred to believe that that individual effort is the key to success, and that adverse forces blocking one's progress are just a fact of life. Braddock fits squarely into this mold. As the first rumblings of unionization stirred in the '30s, it never occurs to Braddock that the capitalistic system is to blame for Depression. As one co-worker from the docks rails against the 'big guys,' insisting that workers have to organize, Braddock looks at him skeptically and asks, 'Organize against what -- bad luck? Greed? Drought?' While other couples send their kids they can no longer support to live with relatives, Braddock is fierce in his insistence on keeping his family together. Even though the family doesn't have enough to eat, Braddock makes his son return a salami that he stole to feed the family, and Braddock applies for public assistance only as a last resort. Crowe has perfected the portrayal of decency through several of his roles (The Insider, Gladiator, and even Master and Commander), and his humility always comes across as sincere and believable.The other great characterization is that of Joe Gould. Giammati plays him perfectly: motor-mouth charm, a marketer's brashness. He comes across as slightly larger than life, but never descending into caricature. In their interactions, the normally taciturn Braddock reflects Gould's looseness, rendering Braddock much more sympathetic. In fact, in their scenes together, it's Gould, and not Braddock who dominates. Giammati also believably conveys Gould's touches of humanity throughout, especially in relation to his concern for Braddock and his family. When Gould gets excited as Braddock stages his comeback, it's clear that he's truly happy for Braddock as well as for himself.Boxing matches, of course, form the centerpiece of the movie, and they're quite well done and graphic. If you're squeamish, hold someone's hand as the blows fly, heads snap back from impact, sweat drips, and blood dribbles out of noses and mouths. The images of wife and family that flash through Braddock's mind on screen, though, are heavy-handed reminders of why Braddock is fighting so ferociously.The only real disappointment is the lack of development of Braddock's wife, Mae. The script simply doesn't give her much to do, and Zellweiger doesn't squeeze out more than the script requires.Braddock's story is the real-life Rocky, and if you liked the latter, you'll like the former. The Depression was an era when people desperately needed heroes, and Braddock is still worth cheering for today.",8,0,1,23 December 2005
High Fidelity," A Tasty Ham on Wry Sandwich
","To derive maximum enjoyment from this film, you must (a) be male, (b) have gone through an extended period of trying to figure out why you couldn't keep a girlfriend (c) love a talky, monologous movie. Women who find John Cusack adorable will also like this film.There are three major selling points for High Fidelity. The first is the novel technique of mixing 1/3 traditional narrative with 2/3 talking directly to the audience (that's 'breaking the fourth wall' for you dramatists). Usually, I hate this technique, because it indicates a lazy/untalented scriptwriter who couldn't figure out how to get his points across skillfully. But the technique works here (for the most part), because the script is intelligent. It made me remember back to the dreadful period in my and my friend's lives where we experimented to reconcile our preconceptions of relationships with what we actually wanted, and what the women we dated seemed to want (they were doing the same thing, you know).But a good script needs good execution, and Cusack's believability and likability are the film's second selling point. By the time he'd made High Fidelity, Cusack had perfected the blending of being earnest and wry. In fact, I think Julliard has added a 'Ham on Wry' course just to study his technique. In this film, he adds the right amount of youthful, rebellious surliness required for his character. His skills as a monologist are impressive, and I'd like to see him take to the stage for a show.The third selling point is the performances of the supporting cast. Rob and his two record store employees (who show up twice as often as Rob hired them for) are pop music snobs who desperately need to develop their lives. Todd Louiso, plays Dick, the painfully shy and nerdy clerk, pitch perfect. Jack Black scores a bullseye with his obnoxious-funny characterization. (Several times, Joy or I looked at each other after one of his despicable bits and said 'justifiable homicide,' to which the other nodded.) And Iben Hjejle (no, I don't know how to pronounce this) plays a remarkably complex, level-headed, and unbitter girlfriend with the right amount of maturity and straightness necessary to convince us that Rob might want to grow up enough to be with her.The only nit I'll pick is the absence of rap and hip-hop from the musical vocabulary of the movie. Even if Rob and his buddies hated the genre, they couldn't deny its impact or sales figures. But the film ignores this musical and social category entirely, for reasons never explained.",8,0,1,23 December 2005
Atonement," Cliché-ridden and emotionally inauthentic
","I'm likely the worst person to write a review of this type of movie. Films about the upper class British set in the Victorian era, the pre-WWI period, or between WWI and WWII have always bored me to sleep. Emotions get reduced to clichéd glances and facial twitches. The same holds true for Atonement, but there's the cliché of young love interrupted laid on top of all that. Since the older sister's beau had been at Cambridge for four years, and she'd kept her distance until their last summer together, any love they had was largely a fantasy about the ideals of love. Knowing the low percentage of young love that survives, I didn't believe that a woman in her early 20's in the late 1930's would carry a torch for five years while separated from her similarly-aged lover. Conversely, I couldn't believe that she didn't beat her sister within an inch of her life to make her recant her false testimony.Even if I had believed it, there wasn't enough character development to make me care. If the movie had covered the fracturing of the family as the result of the elder sister's estrangement, then death, or if it had covered the wrongly-convicted young man's time in prison, then there would be the basis for investing myself in the fate of the two young lovebirds. But just seeing them pine in their minds for each other, holding on to the ideal of their lover to sustain them thousands of miles apart, didn't move me.The so-called 'atonement' of the younger sister rang false, striking me as a selfish, public catharsis rather than a true repentance. In fact, in modern parlance, the younger sister displayed traits of a borderline personality, not caring about the impact her actions have on others. Nearly drowning herself at the edge of a waterfall to see if the object of her crush would rescue her, without considering his safety, is not the sign of a caring child. She was old enough and smart enough to realize that her false testimony would wrongly send a man to jail, but she didn't recant. Her storytelling couldn't possibly heal any wounds at the late date she wrote it, and her life as a writer did nothing to make up for her self-serving actions as a young girl. I doubt such a person could realize that there was anything she did that required atonement.Further adding to the clichés is the score. I dislike movie music that overtly tries to tell me what to feel at any given moment, and the rat-a-tat-tat of the typewriter and surging strings at key moments were intrusively obvious.",4,4,9,4 January 2008
