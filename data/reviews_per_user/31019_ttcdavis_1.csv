Mission: Impossible III," I like action movies, and this one did not disappoint at all
","Grabs you right off and doesn't let go. Cruise is very intense, too, and does these roles so well. I also liked that this movie was different from the earlier ones, giving it a fresh look. Contemporary, too, in that it hints at things going on with the villain that match the current duplicity we have seen in elements of the executive branch of the government. Keeps things with the times. Another thing I like is the incredible speed of some of the scenes. Good grief! I had to red-line all my senses and my mind to keep up! I was glad to see Rhymes back. And I like Lawrence F. on any screen. I think the love interest was well cast and well placed, a bright and alive character who, when push comes to shove, gets just about as determined and tough as Ethan Hunt. And, interestingly, plays the part with a lot of the same kind of intensity and emotions on her sleeve as Cruise does his role. And with that and the way the ending was played, I see an easy MI IV (would love to see it).",10,1,3,28 May 2006
