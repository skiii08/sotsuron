The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Mockingjay Proves Fire is Catching as Fast as Ever
","It is always difficult to approach the first part of a two-part film, particularly when it is essentially a set-up for the climactic finale (I'm looking at you, Harry Potter, Twilight, and The Hobbit franchises). Yes, this is undoubtedly a Hollywood cash-grab scheme, but that is not to say these first-part films should be given any leeway in terms of mediocrity. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Pt. I, along with The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, have been solid proof that 'the end is near!' films can be both highly entertaining and successful. I am pleased to announce that the same can be said about Mockingjay Pt. I.Mockingjay is, without a doubt, my favorite film in The Hunger Games series so far. I suppose this came as no surprise to me, considering the final book is my favorite of the trilogy, and its bleak, despairing mood is captured impeccably in the film. The Hunger Games franchise is no longer about panicked children in an arena fighting to the death. The Games are over and the Rebellion against the Capitol has begun, with Katniss Everdeen (played with ravishing ferocity, once again, by the ever-lovable Jennifer Lawrence) as the Rebellion's poster girl—their 'Mockingjay.' The film makes profound statements about human injustices and the morality of governmental power rather than bloodshed and death, and therein lies the film's success. It has transcended from a violent tale of oppression to a deeply moving and masterful portrayal of fighting for what you believe in, despite the inevitably dire consequences.Mockingjay is melancholic and nerve-wracking from its first shot to its final one, and is therefore an incredibly difficult watch for those expecting a happy or satisfying ending. It becomes clear in Mockingjay Pt. 1 that this is an unlikely outcome, and yet, this by no means makes the film and the statements it is making any less important. It is a tale of anarchism for the sake of rebuilding democracy, which is a fascinating juxtaposition with the utilitarianism of the Capitol. While Mockingjay may not be as action-packed as its predecessors, it makes a much more crucial and relevant assertion through its powerful dialog and somber depictions of the aftermath of a civil war. Fear not, Mockingjay has enough heart-pounding action segments to keep you at the edge of your seat, yet this is notably not the point of the film. From the beginning of the series, The Hunger Games has focused on the sorrow and desperation of government brutality in a dystopian future. As we near the conclusion, Mockingjay delivers the perfect set-up for a satisfying ending. In many ways, Mockingjay Pt. I is simply just that: a set-up for the grand finale. However, it does so without ever losing touch with its vitality as a part of the story and is equally as (if not more than) immersive as all the previous Hunger Games films.You may have noticed I have keenly avoided discussing the plot of Mockingjay Pt. I. This is with good reason. The plot of this film is very keenly laid out and progresses with the perfect amount of subtlety and suspense. Every word spoken and every measure taken is of massive importance to the series as a whole, and giving anything away would feel like desecration. Yes, I have provided you with the basics: The Rebellion is in full swing, Katniss is as vivacious and unrelenting as ever, and the Capitol has initiated a murderous civil war. In all honesty, this is all one needs to know when entering Mockingjay Pt. I because there is truly nothing as satisfying as experiencing the film and contemplating its political and moral viewpoints afterwards. That goes without saying, many that have flooded (and will continue to flood) theaters to watch this film are avid fans of the previous films or the novels, and therefore know exactly what they are in for. I will admit that the film feels incomplete, but I believe that it should, because the best (or worst, depending on your viewpoint) is yet to come. Mockingjay Pt. I is undoubtedly the most profound film of The Hunger Games films as of yet, and I have no doubt Pt. II will surpass it next November—even if it does shred my heart into thousands of pieces. Stock up on your Kleenex, folks.This review is dedicated to Philip Seymour Hoffman, who was astounding in this film as he was in every role he ever played. May he rest in peace.",8,3,20,4 December 2014
Fury," History is Truly Darker than Fiction
","There has never been a WWII film in my generation that has impacted me as much as Fury. It is an intensely gory and horrific film, and allocates these aspects to depict the immoralities of history rather than mere shock value. It is emotively astounding and unrelentingly heartbreaking, showing that the realities of our history can be darker than any fiction. The men inside 'Fury'-- the tank they fight with as they enter Nazi Germany--are brave, wise, and humorous. Character development is executed with poignancy as we witness the atrocities of Hitler's armies and the unspeakable suffering of Jews during this time period. Fury is dark for all the right reasons--to evoke emotion and remind us of the horrors we have committed as a race. And a word of warning: this film will enrage you with a newfound hatred for Hitler, cringing at the sound of his voice.(for more of my film rants, follow me on twitter @calcium_waste)",10,10,24,10 November 2014
The Maze Runner," An Exhilarating and Convoluted Journey
","The Maze Runner begins in pitch-black, and the first thing we hear is a panicked gasp. We then see a young man in a fearful state as he cautiously observes a metal cage he is in, which is being thrust upward. He emerges from the cage onto land, filled with other boys. He is in a complete state of hysteria and is unsure of where he is or what is happening. He cannot even remember his own name. This atmosphere sets the suspense caliber high for the film, right from the start, and this tension is felt prominently as the plot progresses. (Unless you've read the book.) If any of your friends or family members were rushing to see The Maze Runner, it is likely they are devout fans of the young adult novels by James Dashner, who has completed two sequels and one prequel in the Maze Runner Series. As expected, the theaters have been filled with his literary fan base and the intrigued gapers of the film's trailers and TV spots (include me here).Not knowing what to expect is what makes The Maze Runner such a deliriously exciting movie- going experience. For the book-readers, it is a chance to see the book come to life in an entirely vivid way. The film is an agitating mindbender, and it is one that gives clues very rarely. Here is what is known: A large group of boys have been surviving on a circular land, surrounded by immense gray walls. There is no form of escape. The boys call the land The Glade, and there is a mysterious maze that lies in the center of the land. Our protagonist learns the rules and manners of The Glade while inquiring greatly about entering the maze. This eventually escalates to a physical dispute with a boy named Gally, who does not believe he should be promoted to the highly selective team of maze runners who explore the maze. It is then that our protagonist remembers his name as his head hits the floor during the fight—Thomas. His name is Thomas, and all of his memories are gone, as are those of the other boys. The only memory they are allowed to keep is their names. Who is doing this to them?Maze Runner is much more dense than simply 'who.' It is also a film about hierarchy in an area with what appears to be supernatural behavior. There are numerous plot twists and character backgrounds that eventually come into light, creating a complete piece of intellectually stimulating and action-packed cinema. Yes, the film has its faults. The dialog, at times, is quite atrocious. The lines may be worded horridly or too simple-mindedly, throwing the flow of the film off-balance. But that gets into the script blaming, then book blaming, and that is a literary road leading nowhere—because regardless, it is a fantastic film.The Maze Runner is an enchantingly grim tale of deceit, rebellion, and power. This is largely thanks to the execution of its artistic and profoundly imaginative style, with brilliantly action- packed sequences starring Dylan O'Brien, Kaya Scodelario, and an eclectic cast of testosterone- pumped young men. There is a sci-fi element in The Maze Runner as well, adding an entire dimension of lunacy and suspense to its already dystopian ambiance. It is a film that must be deciphered in terms of its supernatural aspects, sequential aspects, secretive aspects, and— okay, no more possible spoilers. Regardless of its faults, The Maze Runner is an impressive genre-bender that keeps you hooked from Thomas's first gasp in the dark at the film's beginning to its climactic and perilous finale.(for more of my film rants, follow me on twitter @calcium_waste)",7,2,5,10 November 2014
Interstellar," A Powerful Journey Out of Our Galaxy
","The much-anticipated Interstellar arrived and immediately created massive explosions, both on film and in the film's response. Many, like myself, found it to be an unprecedented masterpiece. Others have called the film too outlandish or ridiculous, due to its fictitious scientific perspectives.This, of course, also happened with last year's space thriller Gravity—and please take note, Interstellar is not Gravity. It is undeniable that both are true spectacles to watch, but Interstellar is a much more philosophical and emotional film. It is a surreal journey out of our galaxy and feels vividly alive, all while making you contemplate the realities of humanity and the spectrum of emotions we experience, such as love and how its manner of existence cannot be measured in scientific terms. That being said, Interstellar is a very scientific film, yet it is one that brilliantly manages to balance out with emotional character development and astounding space cinematography. It can feel stark or it can feel mind-bending, and its transitions are superbly executed. Spectacular cinematography and original storytelling come as no surprise when watching a film directed by Christopher Nolan, best known for Inception and the Dark Knight trilogy. His entire filmography is astounding and highly recommended (by me, of course), so those hyped for the film due to his involvement flocked to the theater—along with Matthew McConaughey's huge fan-base since what has been labeled the McConaissance. A ridiculous term, yes, but let's be thankful he's gone from bad rom-coms to the dramatic roles he's thrived in, from Mud to Dallas Buyers Club.The fact of the matter is, as a piece of cinema, Interstellar stands out. It has many odes to 2001: A Space Odyssey and even Star Wars, due to Nolan's love for sci-fi. However, much unlike these films, Interstellar remains grounded outside of alien life. Whether Interstellar dabbles into the supernatural is cause for debate, due to the film's scientific presentation mixed with fiction. This is precisely why Interstellar is an unprecedented experience. It presents real scientific facts and asks tough philosophical questions, yet remains a grippingly lucid sci-fi film.Discussing Interstellar feels much like presenting someone with a gift and not wanting to give any hints as to what it is. The film's layers are cleverly peeled off and its progression is so beautifully carried out that there is truly nothing like experiencing it and absorbing its concepts and theories after it is over. I suppose I've delayed discussing Interstellar's plot because it is a film in which every plot point is important and imaginative, and giving anything away would feel like giving away a meaningful piece. I will, nevertheless, present you with an introduction and very minor synopsis of the film.Interstellar follows Cooper, played by McConaughey, living with his father-in-law, son, and daughter, in a desolate Earth filled with extreme dust storms. Homes and human lungs are filled with dust as people struggle to survive with limited resources in a deteriorating, and depleting Earth. Cooper is a farmer who once flew for NASA before the Earth's descent, and his crops— along with crops around the entire globe—are dying due to the earth's excessive drought and dust plagues. Upon making entirely unexpected discoveries, Cooper is faced with making the difficult decision of leaving his family for the exploration of planets sustainable of human life in a galaxy outside of our own. With the spectacular Anne Hathaway at his side, not to mention a sarcastic clunky robot, Interstellar becomes a humorous experience as much as it is intellectually stimulating and incredibly moving. This is a film that simply cannot be missed due to its intricacy, beauty, and manner of evoking a response from all those who experience it.(for more of my film rants, follow me on twitter @calcium_waste)",10,3,7,10 November 2014
Nightcrawler," It Crawls Into Your Skin and Through Your Thoughts
","Attempting to gather my thoughts during the last few seconds of Nightcrawler was an entirely mind-boggling experience. The film is saturated with different moods and commentaries that letting it settle felt almost uneasy. It is, without a doubt, a hauntingly provocative film. Every layer of the film slowly unfolds with ominous and grippingly dark events, and it is a spectacle to watch. Nightcrawler is a success as a dark tale of greed, psychological disconnection, and the morally questionable state of our television news. Furthermore, it is masterfully filmed in the dark and foreboding Los Angeles nightlife, adding to the film's corrupt but honest themes.Nightcrawler follows the pale, long-haired Louis Bloom, played with chilling exquisiteness by Jake Gyllenhaal, as he struggles to live without a stable job. He is a highly intelligent yet morally depraved man, who can sell his positive demeanor along with the best business plans to anyone in under five minutes but could care less about anything but his own interests. We begin Nightcrawler by learning that Louis has been getting by as a thief, stealing and selling to make a living. One night, he happens upon a car crash, where he discovers a camera crew headed straight toward the accident to retrieve footage of the burning car and a severely injured individual. Louis is immediately drawn to this prospect, and after a brief discussion with a video journalist, Louis learns he can sell footage to the news—something he sees could potentially solve his monetary issues. He soon gets a hold of a camcorder and a police radio scanner (through theft, of course) and begins his journey into 'nightcrawling,' the act of catching the best and most gruesome footage of the nighttime for the local morning news channels. Louis evolves from an amateur to a professional videographer before our eyes, always doing his work with precision and never hesitating to air his sour yet intellectual thoughts. He hires an assistant, Rick, to aid him with navigation and additional camera footage. Louis becomes cocky and highly manipulative as he becomes the best in the business. He commits entirely immoral acts to further his career, and yet, everything he does is so expertly presented that it is impossible to look away. He represents a part of the social scale where dollar signs mean more than friendships and graphic deaths equate the value of television ratings.Nightcrawler is a film that feels as though it should not sit well with audiences, yet reviews have been raving, and with good reason. It is a film that forces one to contemplate the boundaries of morality, social media, and the fine line between sociability and manipulation. Jake Gyllenhaal is transcendental in his role as the keen and sociopathic Louis, who will overstep every boundary and break every law to further his own self-worth. Ultimately, Nightcrawler is a film that stays seeded in your thoughts long after it is over, which has been rare for films to accomplish as of late.(for more of my film rants, follow me on twitter @calcium_waste)",8,0,3,10 November 2014
Gone Girl," An Electrifying Thriller That Delivers Hard
","Adapted from Gillian Flynn's best-selling suspense novel, Gone Girl is a film sealed with dramatic intensity and highly intellectual storytelling. Its manner of plot development is highly intricate and always has a sense of morbidity lying underneath. Every plot twist is so well crafted that it is never seen coming. That is, of course, unless you've read the novel. Gillian Flynn wrote the screenplay herself and has made few changes to the big-screen adaptation, so fans of the novel won't be surprised by the story. However, they will undoubtedly enjoy watching this mind- consuming and grisly tale come to life.Directed by the iconic David Fincher, one can already expect broodingly dark undertones and gorgeously vivid cinematography. He has a taste for grim tales about death or deception, such as Se7en and The Game, and this extends to the book adaptations he's directed: Fight Club, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and Zodiac. Being the well-seasoned director that he is, it was inevitable for Gone Girl to be anything but gripping and cinematically exquisite both at once. Discussing Gone Girl feels like having to slowly peel a story apart without taking too much away. Even events that must be mentioned feel like spoilers in-and-of-themselves, and as any reader, you're only getting about half the story unless you've already seen the film. At any rate, Gone Girl is a fast-paced thriller that keeps you glued from the start and also manages to make a statement on gender roles, marriage, and psychological instability, all underlying the complexity and psychopathy of the tale.We first meet Nick Dunne on the morning of his fifth wedding anniversary. He starts his day off by going to a bar and drinking with the bartender, whom we soon learn is his twin sister, Margo, and the two co-own the bar—named The Bar. Oh, the meta-originality. Nick seems tense but keeps a mundane composure around his sister. He then receives a phone call from a neighbor warning him of an occurrence at Nick's home. He rushes home to find the door open—with his cat sitting patiently outside—and enters cautiously, calling out for his wife, Amy. She is nowhere to be found.Nick soon enters the living room in which a glass table is overturned and broken, alarming him as he immediately calls the cops. He cooperates with them as they arrive and is truthful about his morning and the events leading up to Amy's disappearance. After an interrogation in which he reveals that his wife has no friends and is a distant person, he advises her family of her disappearance. Vigils are held with large posters claiming 'MISSING' in boldface, with a smiling Amy underneath along with a hotline number. It is not long before the media becomes engrossed in the case, with one female news anchor in particular bashes Nick for his apathetic looks at the vigils, implying he is careless about Amy's disappearance and may have well murdered her.It is now important to discuss two details regarding the film. Firstly, as a tradition, Amy would leave three clues for Nick to find his gift on their anniversary—a treasure hunt. For investigative purposes, the police follow Nick through the treasure hunt to retrace Amy's steps before the attack took place. A riddle has to be solved at each location, where there are clues on clearly marked envelopes: Clue 1. Clue 2. Clue 3. The second aspect of the film is that it is told in two narratives. We follow Nick and the chaos that ensues from his inner demons as the media swoops in and tears him apart. However, from the start, we are also following Amy's recollection of her marriage to Nick in the form of a diary. We see her retell everything from the day they met, to their marriage troubles, to her eventual fear of Nick harming her. The cops, of course, find this diary as evidence.And alas, this is as much as I can give you of Gone Girl. At the end of it all, it is a stunning film that has easily made my top-5 list of 2014 favorites. There is never a shot wasted with its darkly beautiful scenery, and every detail is presented before you and knows exactly where it is taking you. Gone Girl is a disturbing yet effective film as a social commentary on commitment and how far we are willing to stretch our morals.(for more of my film rants, follow me on twitter @calcium_waste)",10,1,7,10 November 2014
