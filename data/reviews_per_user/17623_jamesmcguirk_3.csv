Scarface," mmm
","I'm pretty sure this will offend a lot of people but I actually think this film is terribly overrated. I always thought of it as a classic but I watched it again recently and found it disappointing. I think what bothers me is, first, that the film charts the very beginning of Montana's ascent through the ranks and his demise. His period of 'success' is played out in montage in a way that seems very cheesy and dated. My second objection concerns the character himself. Pacino's acting is fine but the character he plays is thoroughly unlikeable and hard to sympathies with. In other mob films such as Goodfellas, Casino, Carlito's Way and the Godfather the principal protagonist is also a gangster whose unravelling is self-inflicted. Take for example Carlito's Way. Carlito is killed as the result of a problem he caused, not anyone else which brings out the pathos of his situation so poignantly. In Scarface, by contrast, the protagonist is violent, angry and petty with no discernible traces of humanity. Even his relations with his family are nasty. The point is that I found it impossible to feel anything with Montana. The successful mob films challenge us by showing us real characters whose choices are motivated by love, loyalty, family etc. but who end up going down a path of violent excess from which it is difficult or impossible to escape. Thus, we meet characters that seem redeemable and so we are engaged and interested in their fate. Scarface simply tells the story of a thug who is a thug not because of circumstances but because he wants to be. As such, Montana's story is not one of tragic inevitability but just inevitability.",Null,2,5,26 November 2004
Troy," Bad, but not that bad
","I watched this movie for the second time last night and I must say, I actually enjoyed it. First of all, though, let me say that I accept most if not all of the negative critique that has been directed at this film. As one reviewer rightly points out, the film claims to be based on Homer's Iliad but then includes the story of the Trojan horse which is, of course, taken from the much later Aeneid of Virgil. Incidentally, the same reviewer wonders about Achilles' girlfriend in the film. In fact, the character of Briseis is present in the Iliad and she is the reason for the stand-off between Achilles and Agamemnon - though not really for the reasons presented here. The demise of Agamemnon is also inaccurate and seems to have been added to provide a tidy Hollywood ending. In fact, the character of Agamemnon generally is somewhat mistreated in this presentation. He comes across as a far less pleasant character than the Agamemnon we find in the epic itself. Then there's the issue of the gods. Not only are they omitted from the story here but the characters (especially Achilles and, to an extent, Hector too) are irreverent in a way that would be incomprehensible to the Greeks themselves. Having said this, I wonder how the film could have been made otherwise. For example, in the battle between Paris and Menelaus, the Iliad tells us that before Menelaus can kill Paris, Aphrodite descends in a cloud and rescues the Trojan prince and whisks him away to the safety of his chambers. Could this be included in the filmed version? Would it have resonance to a contemporary audience? Probably not. Of course, I accept that a film like this is dangerous insofar as it gives the non-reading audience the sense that they now know the story while what is found here is a significantly altered (butchered?) version. But the point is that the real story requires the kind of suspension of disbelief (gods appearing and disappearing in the midst of battle, changing sides and the fact that the outcome has been determined by Zeus before the whole thing starts) that would make it difficult for a contemporary audience. This is not an excuse but a reason. As far as the good aspects of the film are concerned, I actually think that in spite of the aforementioned modernising features of the film, we do sometimes get a sense of more genuinely Homeric notions such as 'philotimia' or the love of honour. This was a crucial aspect of the sensibilities of the Homeric age and it is well represented here even if somewhat disjoined from any concomitant theological implications. As far as the performances are concerned, Peter O'Toole and Brendan Gleeson do well with the characters of Priam and Menelaus respectively. Eric Bana isn't bad though Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom are weak. And Brian Cox, notwithstanding the characterisation of Agamemnon is always enjoyable to watch. Overall, then, a bad re-telling of the Iliad if that is what it is supposed to be but, if one can bracket that kind of purist demand, an enjoyable action film with some great action sequences and good performances.",5,0,4,6 May 2005
Event Horizon," creepy
","I haven't liked any of Andersen's other films but I like this. It's atmospheric and does well in balancing the claustrophobia and presence of the evil on the ship, on the one hand, with the infinity of space and the theme of absence on the other. I think any film that explores the theme of evil not of human agency has the possibility to be unsettling and terrifying. In most respects, this film works. The performances are mostly good although Sam Neill is a bit hammy and the Cooper character is something of a stereotype. As an aside, though, I was a little amused by the scene in which the crew listen to the recorded broadcast from the ship 'Event Horizon'. Sam Neill tells us that Nasa(?)'s finest scientists have been studying it for some time and 'have isolated what appears to be a human voice.' On the first listen, the crew's medic identifies that the voice is speaking Latin and on his second listen translates the majority of the message. Perhaps Weir's colleagues, when presented with the recording, decided 'let's not listen to it and say we did'.",Null,0,1,27 November 2004
