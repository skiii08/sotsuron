The King's Speech," Wonderful Characters/Actors
","I went to this film thinking I would be one of a very small group interested in it in my community. To my surprise, I had trouble finding a seat. The theatre was full! I was impressed by both the male actor leads. They conveyed so much without words. I was amazed when the very responsive audience laughed at humorous parts of the movie when just slight changes in expression by Geoffrey Rush or Colin Firth conveyed this. They didn't overact at all. It was subtle, but everyone in the audience 'got it.' I was also blown away by how luminously beautiful Helen Bonham Carter was in the movie. How old is she? Didn't she play an ape in the last movie I saw her in? She's gotten younger while I've gotten older! I'll look forward to the Oscars this year to see how many this movie takes. Should be a lot!",9,1,3,15 January 2011
Mystic River," Revenge Doesn't Work.
","I just returned from this movie and must say, I really didn't like it. It's dark, slow-moving, and graphic.  There are blood and guts all over the screen.  But they're not physical, they're psychological.  The characters absolutely wring their souls out in this movie and the tension was actually unpleasant.'Mystic River' reminds me of one of my favorite movies, 'Sleepers.'  That also was a movie about revenge.  And what I learned from it, or got out of it, is that revenge just does not work.  It's never enough.  It's sometimes against the wrong person.  And no one wins, feels better, or gets anything out of it.Clint Eastwood is great director, the actors were superb, and there will probably be a number of Oscar nominations for this movie.  But, please, I like a little sugar with my bitter gall.  This movie needed some lightening up.",Null,0,0,6 November 2003
