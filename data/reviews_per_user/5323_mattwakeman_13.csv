Requiem for a Dream," staggering
","quite simply this is one of the most amazing films that i have ever seen, it is astonishingly powerful and moving and its take on addiction of all kinds is so well handled that at the end of this film when the titles came up, nobody got up. i mean that nobody got up, we all just sat there stunned with what we have seen. credit must go to some simply stupendous performances but the editing of this film simply had to be seen to be believed.the final sequence made me remember why it is that i go and see films and why they can be as good and sometimes even better than the book from which they are based.it would be too easy to say that this is merely a film of drugs, it is not. it is about addiction and it is about dreams. it is what can happen if the dreams take the place of reality so much that people are unable to look around and judge their lives objectively. but more, it is about the death of dreams and the price that some pay to chase an illusory goal.if you are easily shocked then youre gonna struggle with this film but anybody who has seen trainspotting may think that they know what to expect. they dont, trainspotting was seen as some kind of breakthrough film. this destroys it. one of the greatest films that i have ever seen and i can give it no higher praise then by saying that when i was walking back from the cinema it made me look just a bit differently at not only the adverts screaming for my attention but all the other people walking on the streets.just breathtaking.",10,0,0,3 February 2001
Minority Report," confused mess of a film
","well lets be fair. the first hour and a half arent confused and messy. not that im saying that they are original either, but they are ok. but then...but then instead of having the courage to end the film on a bleak downward note george gives us more film...and more film...and more film.the end is simply horrific although at times it seems that spielberg just didnt know what type of film to give us (should it be all action? or maybe some comedy, hold on, now we need some suspense). the film should (IMHO) have been hard and bleak and fast and instead we are given a dribble ending that was just really so very poor.phil k dick must shudder at what is done to his works (even the very good blade runner is simply nothing when compared to 'do androids dream of electric sheep?') and in many ways this film said nothing that hadnt already been said by stanley kubrick (nee anthony burgess) in clockwork orange over 30 years ago.loads of reviews keep saying how this is the new 'dark' spielberg. to me, this was just the same cloying, sentimental, hamfisted spielberg.",2,1,2,8 July 2002
Citizen Kane," dazzling
","One of the definitions of great art is that it speaks to us without knowing of us, if this is indeed the case then 'Citizen Kane' is truly great art. As relevant today, if not more so, then when it was made this remains one of the greatest films of all time. It dares to be intelligent. And is.",10,0,1,18 February 2001
Memento," a great take on what makes us individuals
","sometimes we re-watch a film because it has a great twist, sometimes because its so complex that we need two viewings to get all that there was to get but mainly we re-watch films because we liked them an awful lot the first time that we see them. Memento is a film that can fall into all three of these categories. This is NOT a roll into the cinema or when it comes out on DVD/Video get the popcorn in and let the film just wash over you. On the contrary, this is a film that demands effort from its viewers and if you are prepared to give that effort then you get an awful lot back in return.Previous comments have detailed the story and all i would like to add is that this film is a great combination of good direction, great acting (especially Pierce), a good script and a GREAT idea. All great films have all of these attributes, so does Memento.I just have one request, when this film is released on DVD please make it have an option whereby you can watch the film sequentially in a chronological order. Would it improve the film? probably not, but it would allow you to see a) how clever the idea was in the first place  b) how good the editing was and c) how good the performances were.P.s. if anybody knows where i can get the soundtrack or the music used in the film please email me!",10,0,0,17 November 2000
My Neighbor Totoro," perfect family film
","well let me put it like this. im a 30 year old mature student and even my best friends criticise me for being too cynical. i hate disney and i prefer films and books that are more bleak and realistic. whilst i love films i hate 'movies' and i think that if the best thing that anybody can say about a film is that 'it is a mindless diversion' then to me that says that they are mindless.and yet, and yet i couldnt stop myself from loving this film. this is obviously a fact that i wont tell everyone about (i have my hardcore hate the world reputation to keep up). but this was just a great film. of course i kidded myself that i only liked it because it was by the legend 'miyazaki' but in reality it was because it was a great film. it was free of the cloying setimentality that obscures most (very nearly all) childrens films. it was also free from the grotesque stereotypes that disney perpetrates in its quest to turn children into consumers.if you have kids (not that i do) or if you are still a kid (erm...i'll think that i shall pass no comment here) then do yourself a favour and forget the weather and the bills and the demands and the news and all of that adult rubbish. sit back and be entertained. you know, i may even get this on dvd too...for my nephew and niece of course...",10,0,1,13 January 2002
The Beach," a faithful adaptation of the book...
","...which is a shame because the book is crap. it purports to tell us all what traveling is like and the wonderous things that happen to us and make us (deep breath for a wonderful americanism) 'grow'.so what we have is a collection of people who are travelers but have found somewhere lovely and have...ermm...stopped traveling and instead created a lovely little utopian world. with no strife. or worries. or interest. having gone traveling from my point of view this film is utter drek. you go traveling for two reasons 1) to go and see and do different things and 2) to go home again. cos you see, if you dont go home then in fact you are NOT a traveler. you have stopped traveling. you are a traveler no more.there was more sexual tension in the film then the book (not surprising since the book amazingly had no sexual enmity between all the young 20 somethings) but what the film did miss out on was the strife over the divisions of labour and who had to do what to contribute to the community.instead, what we get is a collection of badly underwritten annoying people preening and sunning themselves in nice locations. so many people had no characterisation that it just hurt...until you realised how bad some of the others characters were and wished that they were similarly underwritten. it goes nowhere and says nothing. dicapricorn is an horrific actor and does less with the material he is given but the whole film is a shambolic mess. at least the book had the decency to admit that when richard went back to the world that he looked back at his time at the beach as though he was a different person. but no, what we get is leonard looking at a lovely holiday snap...forgetting that two of the people in the picture are dead (and that he killed one of them) or that another one of them pointed a gun at his head. but dont worry, cos it was a life affirming event and richard has 'developed' and 'grown'. well, thats all right then.lord of the flies for the MTV generation who wouldnt recognise a film that has no minor things like a plot, or story or characterisation or anything really. buy it for someone you hate.",1,16,30,29 May 2001
Face_Off," worst film ever? i think so...
","Oh dear. F. Scott Fitzgerald once wrote that 'character IS action'. I wonder what he may have said on seeing this film? My suspicions were first aroused within the first 7 seconds of the film in which John Travolta is simpering on a fairground ride with a child with a haircut so bad that he simply had to be American. When the poor 'bowl cut' blighter was blown away by Nicholas Cage (with seemingly an enormous caterpillar on his upper lip), I began to think that I was in trouble. To say that these characters were one dimensional would be to insult, well, one dimension. They blunder around talking lines that truly no-one in the whole world would ever say outside of an action movie.To think that John Woo has come to this, he made superlative action movies in Hong Kong but the rubbish that he makes in the US is in danger of making us forget all that. There are many of the trademark Woo incidents, people leaping diagonally through the air with a gun in each hand (and always in each hand, I wonder if it is a John Woo fantasy for us to discover a species which has 3 arms, my my, we would have a veritable arms race then!), gunfights in churches etc etc. The subtleties that do appear in his HK films are simply lost here under a welter of bullets, bad acting and a simply woeful script. Yes, some of the stunts are very good, but how many times can you see a stunt and be amazed, by and large they are merely variations on the same theme. Remove them and what are you left with? Really, really bad acting by John Travolta and a performance by Nicholas Cage that makes me think that he felt like buying a new swimming pool when this script turned up. I was little surprised by Travolta ('Battlefield Earth' anyone?) but could this really be the same Cage from 'Leaving Las Vegas'?.Luckily the picture failed on my copy for the last 3 minutes so I was spared Travolta getting his own face back, re-uniting with his lovely (Doctor) wife, connecting with his once wild daughter and now taking over the upbringing of Cage's son (who incidentally also had a very bad, bowl type american brat haircut). If only i had lost the sound as well then maybe I wouldn't have been left wincing with utter agony as much as I did.I only wish that I could give this utter trash -1000000000000000 let alone only 1. A film for those who see Hollywood action films as the zenith, the apotheosis of entertainment.",1,9,18,18 March 2001
Dark City," less than the sum of it's parts
","now don't get me wrong, it's not that i don't this film, it's just that, well, it's just that it seemed to be a collection of quite a few films that have been put together. in some cases well, and in other cases badly...the direction is fine, the acting is fine (the exception, and only a slight exception is a rather insipid performance by jennifer connelly) and the story is, well, the story is really rather strange.to me this feels like this is somewhat a collection of ideas, rather on the lines of 'wouldn't it be good to get this in, but how about that. but hold on a second there is also that'. and instead of making the hard choices the director (and writer...and producer...and screenwriter) elected to keep them all. it's not bad, just a bit messy. why were the bad guys doing what they were? where are they from? where are the people in the city from? where are they going? why such an incomplete ending? why is that only one character (a good william hurt) asks any form of existential question and to sidestep that one not only is the question not answered but mr. hurt is 'removed' from the film? how is it that rufus sewell has the powers that he does? why is it that the bad guys look as though their costumes were thought up before the decision to see whether they would fit in with the rest of the design?now i don't believe that all fims have to be neat and precise, nor should they always answer all the questions that they ask but the problem that i have with this film is that on more than one occasion it is just inconsistent. not the characters as such but the story itself. as i said it's not awful but it could have been so much better. all the elements for a really good (albeit silly) film are present but they just don't hit it off and the film as a consequence just doesn't work. it is damning it with faint praise to say that i have seen better and i have seen worse.oh and incidentally, anybody who wants to see a great (and i mean great) film about memory should go and see memento. made on a fraction of the dark city budget but all of the money went on the right thing, the script!",6,1,1,26 March 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," epic in every sense of the word
","beautiful, tragic, dazzling fighting, mysticism, romance. if you want any of these in a film then do yourself a favour and see this. if you want more than one of these then you may have just been given a slice of heaven a little early.one of the best films i have ever seen.",10,0,0,14 January 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," staggering
","simply fantastic. one of, if not the, most visceral films that i have ever had the pleasure to sit through. enough has been said about the cgi effects of gollum or the battle at helm's deep but what greater praise can you give a film like this except to say that it was as good as the fellowship of the ring.unreal.",10,0,0,23 December 2002
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," wow, the stereotypes
","surely in the history of films there can never have been any greater collection of stereotypes in a single film. no opportunity has been missed to come up with characters such as 'Nick the Greek' and Hatchett Harry. In england we complained about what mel gibson chose to do in his awful awful films of braveheart and patriot but we seem to be quite happy to let someone british do the same thing. i suppose that i should feel grateful that noone from birmingham was in it, we would have been portrayed as having a broad accent and being thick no doubt.before anyone accuses me of having a humour bypass, yes i know that this is intentional. i know that they are cardboard cutout villains but that really is no excuse for having a cardboard cutout script. never before have i watched an entire film in which every line appeared to be written down before it was spoken. everything was delivered as though it was all some little in joke that we should all find funny. and i agree with one of the earlier reviewers, vinnie jones CANNOT act. he was in good company here however, since nobody in this film.it appears that this is no-more than a remake of the 'Italian Job' except without a few things, like the 60's style, noel coward, the script, the acting oh, but we were at least rewarded with not one person being michael caine, but at least 6 people trying to be him. only they all failed. badly.this really is the film that launched a thousand british gangster films, they have all been bad. but in that sense they have lived up to imitation being the most sincere form of flattery. for the british readers of this, to me this was like watching an extended episode of 'only fools and horses' with more guns and swearing. pitiful and grotesquely overhyped.",1,28,60,24 May 2001
Shrek," a real nice film for everyone
",sure the moral of the story is plastered at the end but this really doesnt matter as to not like this film you would have to be emotionally dead. this really does have something for everyone with a story that always manages to stay on the right side of being too sweet for its own good. great animation and really good voice overs (although i thought that mike myers at one point was doing an impersonation of ewen mcgregor!) plus a nice soundtrack.a great laugh and an uplifting film even for cinephile cynics like me..,9,0,0,28 September 2001
Gladiator," great on the eye, awful on the ear
","oooohhh it looks just lovely, Rome is awesome and the set pieces, the opening fight scene and the gladatorial combat are fantastic to look at. But then it is spoiled by people opening their mouths. Not because they all have really bad teeth, but because someone should have taken the time to come up with a good script for Ridly Scott to do something with.As ever Mr. Scott proves what a gifted director he is with great visual flair, but again he is poorly served with material that is all mouth and no trousers. And as for the performance by Joauqin Phoenix, well to say he was overacting his role as a madman would be to insult the undisputed title holder of overacting madmen, the one, the only Brad Pitt.It's not bad, but how anybody could say that this is a better film than the simply sublime 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' proves how little taste there is in the world and how unfortunately good guys so often don't get what they deserve.",4,0,1,30 March 2001
