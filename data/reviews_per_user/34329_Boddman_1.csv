Antz," WARNING TO PARENTS!
","I just returned home from watching ANTZ with my three- and five-year-olds. I think I was as excited as they were, to finally have a movie I could take the kids to that wasn't some of Disney's latest Politically Correct multinational drivel. In my excitement, I neglected to do the needed research and was shocked by the cuss words throughout the movie. b*tching, da**, what the he**, tighta**, 'I'm the princess, d*mmit!' - these are the kinds of terms I want to keep my kids away from at all costs. Sadly, the fun and charm of an otherwise good movie would not be affected by replacing these words with less offensive phrases. I have heard that they included these words to get a PG rating and hopefully draw more adult attention. The real money is made by a kids' movie in repeat viewings, tape rental/sales, and merchandising (toys). I am going to make sure that my kids never see this movie again in a theater, we will NOT buy the tape, and my kids will never own ANY Antz merchandise. Dreamworks gambled for more $$$ by including inappropriate language, but I think they will lose in the long term. Pay attention, Disney! If you have such language in your bug movie, it is not worth it!",5,4,10,3 October 1998
