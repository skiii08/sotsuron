The Avengers," Nothing new, just some other action flicks on steroids
","This movie is another typical US production: great FX, lame story, even lamer lines for the actors (espcially Hiddleston, whose character is completely wasted, even though he plays his (mad) part very good), only Downey has his usually funny highlights but this cannot save the movie. When I have figures like Thor and Loki I try to build a more mythical, special story and don't end up with the ever so boring same mankind vs. whoever fight, marking the enemy almost unbeatable at the beginning and then ending up with some metal monster that the Hulk can bring down. What more or less usual humans like Black Widow and Hawkeye can do to survive such a battlefield for super heroes is beyond my understanding, too. Not to mention the usual showcasing of US equipment (F-35 e.g.) and a 'skycarrier' which in some way made me think of 'Space Battleship Yamato'. And last but not least no one of the ones responsible seems to have read Marvel comics when they have been young; I did, and there's no way that Iron Boy and Miss America could hold up to Thor and Hulk. How did Iron Man put it correctly in the comics (with regard to Thor/Hulk): 'With enough energy I can keep up with those guys (on the Super Hero top list)...for two seconds.' The end with interviews and statements on the streets and of course before that the use of nukes to close the portal brought my till then five stars vote down to three. Why for whose sake ever is the enemy superior when we have nukes and they don't? How could nukes close a portal made of pure energy from the cube which is - because of this fact - impenetrable? Unbearable US simplicity and shallowness.",5,7,15,24 August 2012
Skyfall," This movie fulfills his own underlying issue, in a different way.
","What that is? It's the claim that agents and spies are no longer needed, and if you look at this version of Bond, you could honestly say that. Also, the super enemies can be trashed because this Bond has none.// spoiler // This enemy gets himself caught to be able to shoot M personally, planning everything in advance, even having planted a bomb in the subway as if he could have known what would happen there, but what's happening then? You wouldn't believe it, an ordinary shooting in a rehearsal room, where of course he kills all guards who are protected by protection vests with one shot and - belonging to the underlying theme: old style agents are still needed! - the somewhat older once agent Mallory can add his arguments that the MI6 is still needed by helping to defeat the bad ass. Also, there's no Bond girl. Bond has one assistant but the woman deemed to be the Bond girl dies after roughly ten minutes screen time. So no Bond style here, too. // end spoiler //There are more points to mention, but this is most important; Bond is no spy anymore, he's just an 'Apparatschik'. Don't misread me, I think Craig is a very good Bond very close to the Bond Fleming created, tougher and more cynically, but the stories are simply no Bond stories. Even the first Bond with Craig wasn't really, and it was a remake (sort of) an older story. After that, essentially two non-Bond stories have been made to Bond movies which they are not. The new action style is okay, less gimmicks than in the past, very much okay, but the stories are not, the style is not, and you really don't want to see a Bond running around with an earplug all the time to play M's executing agent on demand.The final nail to the coffin are the references to the original at the end, that left me speechless. First you ruin the franchise, then you claim for yourself to represent it; the other way round compared to Star Trek, but not an inch better.",3,4,10,30 August 2013
Passengers," The starship excels, everything else fails
","This movie is another one of these modern movies I'd like to call 'designed lifestyle movies'. Take a sci-fi story, enough CGI and two popular actors and go ahead. Unfortunately, there are some other things like good script, logic, atmosphere and so on. The last one is where most of such movies fail. It takes almost two hours but in this case I'd preferred the usual 1.5 hours many US mainstream movies have, would have been enough.But it's not a demanding, sophisticated movie, there is no real good acting (Martin Sheen being the exception), no real suspension, no real catastrophe (in the end the ship is just all fine, as at the beginning of the journey), a way too simple script and a lame ending. Basically, just some simple and cheap entertainment, packed in a nice form and featuring two actors who have to drag the audience in. Most of them might ending up being quite disappointed and rightfully so.Either you make a real disaster, a psychological or a philosophical movie, but trying to mix them all up in one thin soup doesn't work out, and that's what we got here.But: the starship is really cool and closer to a real one than most others; might have been inspired by Stanislaw Lems 'Fiasko' starship. And that's just about the best of the movie. So, enjoy the CGI views of the ship.",3,0,1,9 March 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Another death for a iconic comic figure/idea
","If you've seen this movie, you really see what is wrong with the world we live in: it destroys originality and creativity. In this movie, there is basically not an ounce of the original Spiderman, period. The same as happened to Star Trek and Star Wars after former commercial movie makers took over. There is simply nothing left of the original. I could go on and list all the drawbacks and dis-functionalities, but it simply makes no sense, cause there is nothing in there. So, my conclusion: nothing to be seen here of any importance, let alone Spiderman. Save your precious time and skip this movie!",1,20,30,12 October 2017
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Not too bad, but action too unbelievable and story a little far taken. A lost opportunity.
","Action wise, this is a good movie, but the problems start here when you have e.g. three heli carriers going down directly in the city or exactly where they lifted of, respectively. Or the very unbelievable falcon. On the other side, you have ordinary gunfights, so this is quite far stretched. Then we have the story around Hydra, which is completely implausible, added by Caps old friend Bucky. Btw, the title of the movie 'The Winter Soldier' is quite misleading, cause he is only a quite minor part of the story. So, regarding this, you get the usual Hollywood big style action and effects show, but way, way exaggerated, and a quite lame story. The interesting thing may be the underlying message, if there is really one. By this, I mean the fact that the whole Shield structure was undermined and by this doing the exact opposite of what if was intended to. If this is so, there could be hidden critics to US policy, but I wouldn't call this for sure. If so, Cap would have to fight the system itself in the next part. That would be something! Taken this aside, good, but predictable standard Hollywood action. Nothing to get too excited about. Which is sad, because in this Captain America incarnation Evans got better, the transition to the modern world worked out, the combination with Captain America has a lot of potential and you start to develop a relation to Cap because he is (almost) on his own, has to fight the odds and doesn't feel like a invincible guy, you can see that he is 'enhanced', but still human. Especially the fight in the elevator is great and good old style action. Instead they focus again on high tech and simply go to far with all this heli carrier, falcon and 'kill them all' thing. That's why it is a lost opportunity.",4,9,18,27 August 2014
Dunkirk," Nice try and good intentions, but a failure in the end
","The concept of the movie to tell the story in overlapping and in the end combining pieces is very good and the sound score supports the action, but that's about it. The pathos in the Spitfire pilots actions at the end when he still shots down a Stuka without fuel and then heroically, almost mystically flying his last meters on the beach and the wrong depiction of military actions are big downsides of the movie. No Heinkel attacks at such low altitude, no Messerschmitt wastes time to shoot on a small boat and ships don't sink so fast. What strikes me most is the poor out-fit of a movie with a 100 mill. Dollar budget. Not much to see on the beach, not much effort to make the ships look as they did back then (except for the smaller ones) and then they was some stuff to see which is by any means modern, e.g. the trains waggons inside was modern style. When you make a movie playing in 1940, you should be more careful with that. So, for me it looks like sort of an concept movie.",2,0,1,14 October 2019
The Amazing Spider-Man," Short and to the point: this is not Spiderman
","This movie is only based on the idea and the parts of Spiderman. The creators took Spiderman's concept and mixed it together to a new story, where everything of the Spiderman universe is completely mixed up, so far, that not much of the original idea remains. Almost every part of Spiderman's story and every character has been altered beyond recognition just to fit a new, unbelievable and lame story. Suddenly, you have a totally new background of Peters life, you have Peters mentor from high school as his opponent and Stacy father as chief of the NYPD. So, just everything mixed up to a new and not very tasteful Spiderman cocktail. The only character that improved compared to the old trilogy is Uncle Ben, Martin Sheen plays him very believable and not with that much pathos. But that's about it; after roughly half of playing time, when it comes to the showdown, it gets extremely boring. At least is has some enjoyable scenes in the first half. So, everybody who thinks that Reimi's Spiderman was too far away from the comic don't be surprised to get a shock when seeing this version, it has not much to do with the original. But apparently, today's movies are made for the new generation of movie-goers, which has no relation to the the origins of comics (or to any origin at all) and just look for some action. You see it every where, Star Trek e.g., and this is the same. Very simple popcorn cinema for the 'new generation'.",3,1,3,13 June 2013
Avengers: Endgame," Avengers ridiculing themselves...
","...only to - after almost 2.5 hours of boring preparation - end up in a happy ending and of course more CGI laden version of 'Avengers: Infinity war' with all the protagonists ever to have been in Marvel movies appearing on screen in a CGI festival which shows the true dilemma of modern movie making and the the Marvel world in special. They wanna pack it all in and in the end they get nothing, mixing it all up in a terrible way. We suddenly have Captain America to hold Mjölnir, Pepper Potts got a suit and fights (aargh!),Scarlet Witch seems to be the most dangerous opponent to Thanos, Thanos being apparently stronger without the stones (so don't go for them, dumb ass!) and among that all we have valkyrie riding her winged horse, just to mention a few. The only good scenes are the ones with Thor, and they are also the only ones where the emotional side is delivered in a believable way. Which is also a hint where the true magic of such movies _could_ be: telling stories of myths and magic, and not CGI overkill movies. Sadly, that's what we got once more, and the typical US approach anyway. So, this movie is nothing but 2.5 hours of time waste to end up in roughly 20 minutes of senseless CGI pseudo battle. If you watch it to be able to judge for yourself and get another idea of contemporary movie making, you can do that while making the dishes or doing something else useful in parallel.",1,200,348,11 August 2019
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," All mixed up in a terrible mess, but two airplanes have been saved!
","This is all you'd need to know about this terrible Spiderman melange! Who wrote this script? The one who did simply took different Spiderman enemies and contents and mixed this up to a terrible movie, of course including the usual difficult love story and parent/aunt relationships, both burdened by the suppressed past and thus, more or less sick. I can understand that Gwen died in this awful Spiderman incarnation, I guess because Emma Stone had enough being part of this s*** (what kind of words are 'prohibited words' here is more amazing than Spiderman, by the way). So, if you just go to the movies to see the ever same action sequences in slow motion, this is the one for you to go, but don't expect any real, consistent story, some sort of niveau or whatsoever. With this movie, they finally buried Spiderman; part one was bad enough, but part two really puts the nail into Spidermans coffin and messes up completely.",4,3,29,25 August 2014
Iron Man," More or less just the usual presentation
","of US Army technology (remember 'The Hulk'?). In some parts quite funny, but that's it, except for very good acting by Downey jr. and Bridges. If you consider the roots of the figure of Iron Man and look at the mess they created with this movie you could really cry because the figure itself has a lot of potential. In this movie it was only used as vehicle for something else. You just have to look at the 'symbols' used: Afghanistan, terrorists, USA as the usual stand for freedom, and so on and so on. Please, Hollywood-Military-complex, give us a break. If really wanted, one could also do this with another story, take something like 'Black Hawk down' and go for it, but don't convert a comic figure into a messenger of ever repeated US values and such. So: Four stars just because of Downey, without him only three or maybe even two.",4,0,3,9 October 2008
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Abrams did it again, killed Star Wars after Star Trek
","This movie is another example of modern cinema: no real story telling, no character development, mediocre acting at best, senseless lines, stealing ideas all the time and of course targeted at the widest possible audience. Instead a lot of action and XF, as we have been getting used to. Guys like Abrams are simply unable of making real good movies, period! I don't demand Hitchcock level of story telling and development of tension, but these modern director don't even meet the basics of movie making, they are just effect driven copycats.This movie is simply an awful repetition of episode IV without any new input and more often than not slips into lowest levels of ridiculousness, especially with the wannabe Darth Vader clone, whose name I forgot which is understandable, cause this guy is simply a bad joke. Seeing him getting into anger and destroying things with his light stick...oops, sorry, light saber, just drives you to tears cause of laughing.Compare that to the 'bad' old Vader (who has been 'reactivated' very good in 'Rogue One') and you see the difference.You just have to take this new bad guy compared to the old one, this is all it takes to see the difference to the old SW saga.The 'new' one or continuation if you want is a disaster.Having it rated that high tells a clear and sad message of the taste of our current generationabysmal as the movie itself.",1,26,30,23 December 2016
Godzilla," King of the Monsters, savior of our city? Or 9/11 as monster version with good outcome?
","That is the end line of the movie, and it's as ridiculous as the movie itself. Well, what happens? Some strange 'anomalies' in Japan some 15 years ago, climaxing in the rebirth of Muto(s), then Godzilla appearing on the scene fighting the Mutos, some US military efforts to stop them and the usual 'hero' who miraculously seems to be everywhere where it counts, but who is in fact a completely blood less guy. Ah, and two big movie stars in neglectable roles, Binoche with three minutes, Strathairn maybe with twice the screen time. This movie really seems like 9/11 as monster story with good outcome, Godzilla being the 'god' that saves the people. Of course, again tons of US military and the Mutos do appear in the USA, where else. This movie is Hollywood CGI trash with no real story, lacking characters (neither the main character nor anyone else is developing, Watanabe just looks shocked and curious, alternately), just packs (again for movies of such type) everything and every cliché in the story, be it every conceivable action or scenes like family reunion and lost little kids and has no chance against Godzilla from 1998. This version may not hold on to the original, but it's still better, with some funny moments and good actors. The 2014 version has nothing, I really mean nothing to offer.",2,3,6,1 September 2014
