Skyfall," Really????
","Spoilers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have seen most with the exception of a few Bond movies. I have to say I am more inclined to watch the newer movies due to the updated action sequences and the overall feel of the movies, however as much as I like Brosnan and Craig I have to say that the transition to Craig is starting to lose the original appeal of Bond. If you are looking for what the original Bond was please go back and watch movies like 'The man with the Golden Gun' 'Live and Let die'. The Bond Character Was far smoother and the one liners to the villains and the women were witty and just smooth! Craig was getting there, I was not a huge fan of Casino Royal but I have come around as Q Of S brought out more of Craig and showed he could hold his own and was bring more of a story and his acting background to the role....He was more layered and a story was forming.That being said Skyfall......this just destroyed CR and Q of S! I'm sorry I am a big Bond fan and the fact that the Marketing Campaign flagged this as the best Bond film ever.....what a joke. The first scene was great! It really set the movie up and then from there were so many holes. How did he survive the gun shot and drowning? Why did the therapist say skyfall, how would that word get integrated into a personality profile? Where did the villain come from? Just a quick visual synopsis of Silva would have done so much justice to the character. The bond girl, wow what character development there! She stared at Bond after he killed a spy, had a drink, Had a shower and got shot.....all the time with absolutely no expression on her face. She had the appeal of a Grapefruit. No offense to the actor but the character didn't have a chance.Why did Bond shoot every other Bad guy and leave Silva alive. He had the shot and Silva just killed the girl. Every other movie that guy would have been in a box before he had a chance to speak. So lets say he left the villain alive for an elaborate escape later......So the villain knew he would be in a cell, Q would do something stupid and then it would start a series of events that lead to his escape.....and we don't get to see that either! I expected so much more from Silva, he really did nothing but take his teeth out and flirt with Bond.The last half of the movie was uneventful and even the final action sequence left a lot to be desired. Since when does James Bond Walk up behind the Villain and stab him in the back????? Did Bond Fight the villain once? Bardem could have been one of the best Bond villains ever but fell way to short.Other areas with no explanation were: Silva's hacking ability was never explored it was just part of the story.Why are the writers going back to the old story line of 'Is Bond still useful in this world?' hence the court room scene where they are interrogating M.So I guess all the other agents are dead.....what happened to the agent list they lost? Did M not say she was going to finish the Job? If this comes out in the next movie than I guess I can take that one back as it would be a good intro and tie in to this movie like CR to Q of S.Some of the things I did like were brining back Q, Money Penny and the new M. I think the next Bond movie could be very good if done right. Bring back the Bond that has compassion for good, give a good actor like Craig better dialogue and for the respect of the franchise develop the storyline.",5,10,21,17 November 2012
