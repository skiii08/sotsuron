The Hangover," Disappointing, fell short of its potential
","The writers failed to tap into all the talent and potential of a star-studded cast, leaving viewers at the end wondering, 'Is that it?' Too many dumb gags that could have been hilarious ended only being dumb or duh. What should have been the high point of the movie, Ken Jeong, ended up only being a half-dimensional, stereotypical portrayal of a gangster speaking poorly written lines in broken, Asian-accented English. Scene after scene appeared to be ad-libbed or improvised by the actors and writers, who had run out of storyline and clever ideas before the movie even started. The movie's only funny scene (the Taser) was cruelishly humorous, which the movie desperately needed about 100 more minutes of. The baby and the baby's mom (and the convertible) were the only likeable characters in the whole movie. Surprisingly, the movie (up until the credits) was clean and not excessively vulgar.",5,1,3,22 July 2019
Black Hawk Down," Best Anti-War Movie
","As with any plan, the devil is in the details. And when a plan is based on faulty intelligence, cultural approximations and poorly calculated logistics, the devil is the only one pulling all the levers. One of saddest chapters in American warfare, portrayed with anguish, grit and long-suffering by a talented and very enormous cast.",8,4,6,3 February 2019
