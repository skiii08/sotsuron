The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Not the best... But still worth the watch for those who like the books.
","One thing I believe people should always do before they go see a movie is to go in there with not much expectation of a movie. Many of the reviewers here went to see this movie expecting it to be awesome and were disappointed or didn't expect it to be that great and thus saw all the faults rather than the strengths that still brought the movie to light. I am a huge fan of both the books and the movies and am always going to see plenty of movies when I can. My review isn't just my thoughts and opinions, but more of an influence on why you should give the movie a chance.First, we should focus on what a lot of movie goers want in a film and how you should approach this movie. If you haven't read the series, it may seem like Jennifer Lawrence is a terrible actor, when in reality that's just her role in the film. Pick up the book and read it and you will understand her part a lot better. The dialogue may come across as weak, but you need to understand what is going on a bit by reading the book. You won't get a full understanding until then, because the book is from Katniss' point of view and you are reading her thoughts and feelings the whole time. Also, a lot of you people may be all about the action, fighting, and explosions. If that's really all you look for in a movie, then you don't know what you're talking about this being a bad movie.When you look at it from the book's perspective, you get your typical book to film movie. Hollywood almost never takes a book word for word and screws something up that people don't like. I'll admit there were definitely parts that they cut out of the book that I think they shouldn't have, but they did add things in for some of you just movie goers so you will understand what's going on a little better. The one thing I liked about the movie when comparing it to the book is that it still grabs the main and general concept of the first half of the book. The book is by far the weakest of the 3 in the trilogy in a sense that it is drawn out a bit and may come across a as boring sometimes, but when you look down deep enough it does have a strong story. The story is definitely still being told in the movie.I enjoyed the movie for the most part, but like the book it had it moments when it was a little boring. All these other reviews are strongly exaggerated with how boring and how stupid and pointless the movie is, but they are all just opinions. Also, there are always trollers who just hate everything so you can't always trust what other people think. Watch the movie for yourself and develop your opinion on the movie.I give this title 7 stars for a decent movie of a decent book.",7,2,5,24 July 2015
Suicide Squad," Not anywhere near a perfect movie, but definitely worth seeing.
","(The spoilers I talk about will not ruin anything for you. They are just minor.)I would like to start off with about a year ago when I heard this movie was happening. I was already having bad thoughts about BvS and at the time I had no idea these movies were connected in the same universe. I was excited for this movie because Arrow gave me a brief and awesome look at what these guys are about. When I heard that Will Smith is playing Deadshot, I thought,'What the hell is wrong with these people? He's nowhere close to portraying Floyd Lawton/Deadshot.' Well, over time the thought of him doing so kind of grew on me as I was seeing more of him in the trailers.Now let's go back to about a week before the release. I'm super excited for the concept of the film and dying to see it to see how it turns out. At the same time starting to have doubts about DC's film making all because of the whole BvS travesty that we just don't talk about anymore. At this point, i just don't know what to think.Now we're at the day I get to see it, August 6 at 8:30 PM. I sit down in a fairly packed theater and I watch the movie with my best friend. Bot me and him walked out of there thinking that it was a pretty good movie. That's saying a lot since he is the 50% that didn't care for BvS and I was on the other half trying to shine some light on it.Now, the movie.There were a lot of good things about this movie. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was perfect and Will Smith, just wow! Much better than I thought. Just at times he was a little too Will Smithy. Those 2 characters summed up most of the movie. Everyone else did a fine job portraying their characters. Oh, and Viola Davis as Amanda Waller was exactly what this movie needed. She was exactly that bad ass bitch that she needed to be.The things that weren't as good about the movie is that it was maybe a little too fast paced at times and has a couple minor plot holes. Those can easily be bypassed though if you don't think too much of it.Now, I will talk about and argue about the things other people are complaining about and saying why the movie is terrible, which is false. 1. It feels like multiple movies trying to be one.I understand why people think this, but it just really doesn't feel that way. Yes, the Joker has a romantic background story with Harley Quinn and they want to show that in flashbacks a bit to show a bit of her origin to lead up to where she is now. People are saying that could easily be a whole other movie. Lie!! If DC tried to do such a thing it would be long, boring and dragged out a lot because there would have been a lot of filler scenes that just wouldn't make sense.2. The Joker doesn't get enough screen time.Well, no crap! This movie isn't about him. Its's about the Suicide Squad. Yes, Harley Quinn and him have their thing going on, but that is the sole purpose of him being in the movie. To acknowledge that he exists in this world and to help give Harley Quinn her background story even more.3. DC Sucks and should just quit trying.That's right people. Trolls exist. They just want to get people rattled up for no reason to a point where people will actually believe them. If you truly believe that you have a brain of your own, then don't let others persuade you you morons.Well, that's my review. My best suggestion is to just go in there and see the movie even if your slightly interested. If you truly believe that this movie looks completely stupid and waste of your time from the trailers, then superhero movies aren't for you and you probably won't enjoy it as well as others.",6,1,3,6 August 2016
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A clunky but fun and enjoyable mess.
","J.J. Abrahms had a lot to deal with after Ryan Johnson's audience flop, but kind of like me and many others this is and will be very mixed amongst fans. I feel that most fans will feel more favorable towards this movie in the end rather than against it.How do I feel though? Well, the first half is just so clunky that the direction is kind of mixed up. This is both JJ's and not his fault at the same time. JJ was supposed to only work on The Force Awakens, but because of Johnson's direction and complete turnaround of direction, Abrahms had to come back and try to fix it up as best as possible. The first half is doing it's best to mend these pieces together. It is clear where most of the major plot points of the first 40 minutes should have really taken place in a version of The Last Jedi where something actually happened. It's really sad to see that they had to do it the way they did for this movie, but it had to be done. Most of it lands, the rest you tend to forget about until after the movie.It's truly about 40-50 minutes in where this movie should have really picked up on. The rest of the film could nearly be flawless, at least with the general story. It's a pretty dang solid one as well. Truly does conclude the saga quite nicely and definitely left some great and memorable fight scenes that will definitely stick with me throughout the years.Some of the more specifics (without spoilers) that are quite good is the chemistry between the main characters. The best chemistry is definitely between Driver and Ridley. Their character arcs have definitely had the most development throughout this trilogy and that's a good thing because the are indeed the most important roles. I'm not hating on Po or Finn though. Their bromance is better than ever and I love every moment that the two of them are on screen. The last part that is clear, is that it is just a stunningly beautiful movie. The locations and cgi are just fantastic and just so clean shot that it definitely feels like the movie belongs in this franchise.My final words and conclusion is that the movie may have a bit of a messy and rushed set up, but still has the heart of Star Wars at it's roots. Don't be afraid to go see the movie for yourself and form your own opinion. It's not for everyone, but anyone can still have fun and enjoyment in this wonder conclusion to the Skywalker Saga.",8,3,11,20 December 2019
Now You See Me," There is no such thing as a terrible movie. Some are just better than others.
","When I first saw this movie advertised on television I thought to myself, 'Is it worth it? There aren't too many magician movies that are good.' The only reason why I watched it to begin with, was that Morgan Freeman is in it. I know that's a lame excuse to watch a movie, but if you think about it, Morgan Freeman has played many magnificent roles. He was God for crying out loud in Bruce Almighty and Evan Almighty. Bruce Almighty being better of course, but the point is Morgan Freeman is a magnificent actor and he always does a great job in all the movies he makes an appearance in.In Now You See Me, Morgan Freeman is different. He did do a good job, but so did all of the other actors (Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Isla Fisher, and Dave Franco). Everyone did a magnificent job putting this movie together and I saw a lot of teamwork make this movie 'blow my mind.' Yes, I just used that saying, 'blow my mind.' There were a lot of amazing magic tricks performed like the robbing of the bank. That involved a lot of work and it was complete amazement.I am not saying that this movie is amazing, but I am saying that this movie itself is a magic trick. It is to make you believe that the movie is indeed amazing because of all the amazing tricks that have been done. That is the cover of the whole movie to hide the fact that it lacked a good story line. They made you think there was something worth watching and kept you watching it with the magic tricks and the action. It did keep me interested and I did enjoy the movie because it pulled me in enough to watch all the way until the end.I did read through a lot of these reviews already and many stated that the ending isn't good and that you shouldn't watch the movie because the movie ends with no real ending. That is what the movie wants you to think. If you think about it the movie title is missing part of the classic saying. It is missing a, 'now you don't.' You may wonder, 'Why am I reading this review? What are you getting at?' I am saying, this isn't over. There is more to come. Does that mean there is going to be a sequel to this movie? Not necessarily. I sense that may be possible, but more probable of a children's television show with more adventures to come among the four great magicians.Like I said before. This isn't an amazing movie, but it is amazing at the same time. I rate it 10 stars because it did blow my mind and because it showed me what real amazement is. It's not about how good of a story line or how the acting is. Well, it sometime is about the acting, but everyone did do a great job, plus there is a surprising turn on Morgan Freeman in the movie that will blow your mind also. You should always remember to watch a movie with low expectations and be honest to yourself on how good it really is.",10,3,8,23 August 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Stop whining!
","You guys should really stop looking for the bad in every single superhero movie. This movie is by far THE BEST X-MEN MOVIE OF ALL TIME. Many of you guys may disagree. People who are comic book freaks will complain about Wolverine going back in time instead of Kitty like in the comics. Others will complain that the dialogue of the movie is terribly scripted and that there isn't enough action. Well, the only reasonable excuse is the first one the comic book freaks may have. The other ones are all completely false.Many people come here and write bad reviews purposely because they complain about everything and try to find the bad in everything because they themselves aren't happy with their lives. These are known as 'Haters' for those who don't already know. Do not trust these guys.X-Men:Days of Future Past is indeed a wonderful movie. I highly suggest you see it if you have not already. Great story, wonderful acting, great fighting scenes, amazing heroes (both old and new), and of course the great and sexy Jennifer Lawrence at it again. My favorite addition were the scenes with Quicksilver. Too bad he couldn't have stuck around for the whole movie, but I sense he will be back in future X-Men movies. I hope they will be just as good or possibly better than this one.Well, I hope you guys who haven't yet seen the movie will seriously consider seeing it. I saw it in 3D, which really isn't necessary but it put the movie in a whole new dimension! (Get it? Dimension?) The movie would have been just as amazing if I didn't see it in 3D. Well, stop reading this review and see the movie. NOW!",10,0,3,31 May 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Amazing? Indeed it is!
","Unlike a lot of people, I really enjoyed the The Amazing Spider-Man (first movie). I thought that the reboot was necessary for a couple reasons. One, the original series couldn't go anywhere and they were stuck in a rut with this amazing superhero, and two, the original series wasn't very good, at all. Face it, Toby Maguire was not meant to play Spider-Man. I'm not saying Andrew Garfield is the perfect Peter Parker/Spidey, but he definitely does a much better job. Like I said I really enjoyed the first movie. The only thing I questioned was, 'Is The Amazing Spider-Man 2 going to be just as 'amazing' as its predecessor.'I was worried about that question, and now I have a response to that question. It was even more 'amazing' than the first one! I love what they did with Jamie Fox and his Electro costume. It was funny when Spider-Man referred to him as 'sparkles.' I thought that the story was well planned out and was definitely paced out well. I look forward to seeing what they will do in the future of Spider-Man, and even in their spin-off plans with 'The Sinister 6' and 'Venom.' Spider-Man truly is amazing!",6,9,23,25 July 2014
The Dark Knight," Good movie, good Batman, not the Joker I was hoping for
","Yes, this review is a little late, but I don't care. I just wanted to get out my view on Heath Ledger's take on the Joker. First off, he did a good job at the part he was trying to portray. That role he was playing though just wasn't the Joker. It was a much scarier, creepy and super psychopathic version of the Joker that I have never seen in any versions of the Batman comics or any animated versions. When I want to see the Joker, I want to see the Joker. Not a Joker wanna be. This version of the so called Joker, I will admit is a much more darker version that fits the much darker setting that the trilogy was taking place in so, yes, that's why we don't see too many people complaining. I just wish Heath would have put a little more charisma into the character. Plus the whole story of his scars and smile, well that killed everything the Joker stands for and has never been stated anything like that in any comic book. Nolan did indeed put a good movie out there and Heath ledger definitely did a magnificent job playing a Joker wanna be.So,.. If you're looking for a Batman movie that has the Joker in it, then go back and watch Michael Keaton's Batman because you aren't getting the Joker here.",8,0,3,6 August 2016
