First Man," It's Flat!
","There's no outer space. There's water up there. No one can get out of the firmament. The earth is flat. And the movie was also flat, as in boring.",1,14,31,14 October 2018
12 Years a Slave," A Rare masterpiece
","I would have given this movie a 10 but because they saw it necessary to use the Lord's name in vain, I gave it an 8. Movies like this are so rare these days. Such a great film is becoming extinct. If it had not been for that one thing, It couldnt have been more perfect. Some scenes were hard to watch and i must admit i turned my head a few times and just felt sick in my heart but that is part of what makes a great film. It is supposed to make you feel emotional and as long as it has a good ending, it makes the whole thing worth watching.",8,0,1,16 October 2018
Mother!," disappointment ending
",the ending of this movie was stupid and didn't make any sense. the only reason i rated it 5 is because it was really good up until that point. It was a disappointment. I was expecting some ending that would explain the chaos and craziness going on throughout the movie but it didn't happen. the director of this film said a lot of people didn't like it because they have something against science but i didn't see anything scientific in the entire movie. and i didn't see that it had anything to do with science. it was just a stupid movie.,5,1,2,27 October 2017
