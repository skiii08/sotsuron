Ford v Ferrari," Absolutely gripping
","This movie is fantastic. It is so gripping, you can't help wonder what would happen next. Story is excellent, acting and cast is excellent.
I would not watch the last 5 minutes of the film because it was unnecessary and ruined a perfectly happy ending. BUT the rest of the movie was fantastic.",9,1,2,7 April 2020
The Theory of Everything," Amazing movie
","Eddie Redmayne was so so good. His acting alone makes this movie worth watching. The movie does justice to portray Stephen Hawking's life. We know the story, but it is made wonderfully.",9,0,0,7 April 2020
The Imitation Game," Wonderful movie!
","I did not know about Alan Turing before I saw this movie.
I absolutely loved it. Benedict Cumberbatch is an amazing actor. The story is gripping. Must watch.",9,0,0,7 April 2020
A Clockwork Orange," Starts weird but gets better
","In the beginning I was like WTF am I watching?
Then it gets better. Much better.
It's gripping. Not to mention the acting and the direction are excellent.",8,1,2,7 April 2020
