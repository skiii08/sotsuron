Skyfall," Trash
","This is possibly the worst bond movie ever. There are so many holes in this film you could not count. The acting from Naomie Harris was a disgrace utter trash. The ending well that's just another conversation. It was awful and so was everything about this film. The best part of this trash was leaving at the end, although seeing the Aston Martin from earlier films was good.Go see the other bond movies first except Diamonds are forever. This was such trash though the filmmakers should be shot by bond for this.Don't waste your time. Awful. Awful. Go see roger Moore films first silly but classic!!!",Null,6,12,9 April 2015
