United 93," The point is?
","This movie portrays the fact that something could have been done to save the original planes when actually they were caught with their pants down with the 1st 2 planes, the story of the united 93 however was quite well predicted. This over all however was a waste of just under 2 hours of my time since we all have seen the news footage of what happened and we don't need a story written about it, controversial or not.This was a waste of money and effort that could have been used a hell of a lot more imaginatively and productively.If you wish to see the events from an American Biased point of view and think of it as facts then feel free to watch it, as it seems as factual as braveheart to me ;)",1,12,40,26 May 2006
