Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Very Imperfect but has some decent points.
",Though this movie doesn't live up to the hype there are definitely some good parts.  The pod race was ruled (despite the announcer and pointless shots of Jar Jar) and the final battle was incredible (except Darth Maul's death). Thing is Jar Jar was just embarrassing and a lot of it just wasn't as fun as the original and has continuity errors (Didn't Obi Wan said he met Anakin as a great pilot and not before he became one?).  The main flaw was the fact that these catered to little kids while the other films were great for all ages.  So this is a 50/50 review for which is leaning into the area of a negative review.,Null,0,2,20 June 2000
Akira," Great movie but confusing
",This is a movie that you got to watch twice.  It's a great movie but it's really confusing and I just don't understand the end.  However the animation is brilliant and the animation is strong this film most definately is not for everyone.  You better have a strong stomach for the climax.  Very gross. Enjoy.,10,4,7,9 January 2000
Shakespeare in Love," Good movie, better if you've read Shakespeare
","I've read Romeo and Juliet for class and the time this came out was after I had done the class I had learned it from.  It helps quite a bit in my opinion.  And while I feel this wasn't the best film of '98 it was a very fine film.  The acting is good as is the directing and story telling.  Yeah, it's a chick flick but it's a good chick flick.  One without an 'All-men-are-satan' message and an ending that is good without being super-cheesy.  See this film on a date.",Null,0,1,9 March 2000
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Possibly the best musical ever!
","The story is smart, funny and sick and all of the songs are catchy and memorable (my favourites being 'Blame Canada' and 'What would Brian Boitano do?')  It's a very clever way to discuss the issue of censorship in society. Even though I liked the series this is much funnier and smarter than an already funny and smart series.  It's nice that Trey and Matt accomplished their goal of making a movie without it just being a long episode of the series.  And get the hilarious soundtrack.",9,0,1,4 September 2000
That Thing You Do!," Nice movie about breaking into the biz
","I was kinda surprised I liked this movie.  I thought it was going to be cheesy, seen it before crap but it was actually a nice little flick.  It shows how fame can be enjoyable, yet fleeting and it also shows the kind of evolution a band makes from one stage to another.  All and all a decent flick.  The best part was the soundtrack.  Like a previous review mentioned, it sounds like it came straight from the 60's.  The one thing that would have made this more interesting (perhaps) was if it was in quasi-documentary style, with the drama scenes acting as 'dramatizations'.",Null,0,0,20 June 2000
Sleepy Hollow," It doesn't live up to it's name: It's not sleepy or Hollow. It's Great
",This is Tim Burton's best film since Edward Scissorhands.  His characters are likable and his villains are sinister.  The headless Horseman kicks ass (even without a head Christopher Walken is creepy).  I can't wait to see Tim Burton's version of X: the Man with X-Ray Eyes.  But until then enjoy this action-packed thrill ride that proves Johnny Depp isn't just a pretty boy actor.,Null,0,0,21 November 1999
Alien," A first rate thriller in the vein of It! the Terror from Beyond Space and the Thing
",Styled after those 2 great 50's films the fear factor is doubled and the gore factor is a lot bigger.  Though the 'Alien Birth' scene wasn't as graphic as I expected it certainly was incredibly gross.  Ripley is a strong female character in this film.  I hear in the original cut she dies and the Alien contacts Earth using her voice.  Don't watch this alone in the dark. Great scare flick.,Null,0,1,1 January 2000
Being John Malkovich," One of the most wildest and wackiest trips of the year.
","What a highly original, brilliant, unusual comedy!  The actors, and dialogue are all brilliant.  If Terry Gilliam and Rod Serling did a film together this would be it.  This could be a movie classic if enough people see it. The puppetry, (both the wooden and Malkovich kind), are like nothing I've ever seen. Don't miss a second of this great wonderful, sometimes creepy film.  This film better not be snubbed at the Oscars!",10,0,0,1 February 2000
Aliens," Better than Alien and that one was great
","James Cameron out did himself with this one.  Who of thought that a horror movie and an action flick could combine so well.  Ass kicking action, loads of scares and some thrilling surprises.  Only one or 2 false scares and they're part of the plot, which is good.  Watch this back to back with the original and you won't be disappointed.  You'll be wetting yourself!",Null,0,0,1 January 2000
Man on the Moon," Good movie but not for everyone.
","This is definately a touching, powerful movie about comedy's magnificent bastard (that's both a complement and a complaint).  Carrey IS Kaufman. That can't be denied.  This movie and The Truman Show prove that Carrey has really cleaned up as an actor.  It's kinda like Robin Williams but Williams seems to go more for merely sentimental sappy scripts rather than emotional and smart (Williams movie's past the mid 90's are O.K. but that's it). Carrey does Andy Kaufman justice in a movie that makes you wonder what's a joke and what's true in the world of comedy.  This film isn't for everyone but it is a movie worth watching.  I like the final half hour of the film were Kaufman makes his comedy more positive.  I kinda would have liked to see his Saturday morning show he was planning.  Taken before his time.",Null,0,0,28 December 1999
Ghostbusters," 'Lets show this prehistoric bitch How we do things downtown'
","Best Supernatural Comedy EVER!!  Hilarious cast (Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson, Harold Ramis, Dan Ackroyd, Rick Moranis), very literate, smart and funny script, great special effects (for it's time), great soundtrack, great moments, likable characters, kick-ass moments and more.  And if you can get enough Ghostbusters get the DVD.  It has more of what you love. More I tell you. MORE!!!! Anyhoo if you have never seen this film see it right away. It'll chase away the blues.",Null,0,0,19 December 1999
Toy Story 2," This could be the best sequel ever: better than the original
","This was funny, heart-warming, clever and intelligent.  This could be one of the best films of the year.  The characters are very memorable and well-crafted, from the other Buzz Lightyear and Zurg (it's hilarious when they play ball) to Jessie and Wheezy.  Each character was put together realistically (except for Barbie but it was still funny) and it shows.  The plot is wonderful and makes us think about our relationships with others. The animaton is rich and filled with enough detail to make you aw.  The voice cast works well together and obviously know how to do a good movie. Some scene's just stand out as imaginative and fun (the second Buzz lightyear and Zurg battle, the who luggage rescue).  This is a movie to watch again and again.  A film for everyone.",9,0,1,8 January 2000
Psycho," The First Great Slasher
","A truly chilling and creepy film.  When I saw it, it wasn't as scary as I thought it was going to be but it was an incredibly great film.  If you haven't seen this movie and like horror flicks WATCH THIS.  And even if you don't like horror that much watch this anyway.  It's truly great film by the master of suspense.",Null,10,19,6 January 2000
Scream 2," Good sequel but yet another let down ending.
",This movie was good but the ending was as disappointing as the originals. It was a little to similar to that of the first Scream so it didn't sit well.  But horror movies endings are only REALLY good with a twisted joke or a Twilight Zone-esque ending (though there are probably exceptions).  Anywho this is a nice tongue in cheek (or wound) slasher flick that's better than most Wes Craven stuff.  The biggest problem: my favourite character dies. Plus I think that character should have been played by Seth Green (if you know who I'm talkin' about).,Null,0,1,6 May 2000
The Green Mile," Great movie, if you can stand the length.
","This is a great movie.  It's interesting to see the lives of the characters through their joys and hardships.  The characters are not always believable but they work well.  Great acting by Hansk.  The main problem (unfortunately) despite the fact that's it's a good movie it's a little to long (3 hours).  I could have been cut down by a half hour, I'm pretty sure. That and the cheezy fact that the main convicts initials are J. C. (it kind of bugged me).  But enjoy it anyway.",Null,0,0,12 December 1999
The Waterboy," Sandler: My guilty pleasure.
",Yeah his movies are dumb.  That's undeniable (though the Wedding Singer was of higher quality).  But it doesn't mean you can't enjoy watching them.  So what if the plot is dumb and been done many times before.  Sandler makes a likable character and Kathy Bates (whose an underrated actor) is great as Mama. Like an earlier reviewer said 'check your brain at the door and get ready to laugh.',Null,1,1,4 January 2000
The Iron Giant," The Gun who chose not to be
","One of the most brilliant animated films EVER.  I pray that WB makes more films like this and not like Quest for Camelot (ugh).  It's probably the only animated film in a long time in which I shed a tear.  Disney should make more films like this.  A good animated movie doesn't have to be musical.  This one is clever, beautifully animated and was pulled off quite well.  This should win an Academy award.  I just can't believe good films like this don't do well in the theater.  I hope it does well on video (like the Nightmare before Christmas).",10,0,1,28 November 1999
The Matrix," A plot in an action film for the first time in ages.
","This has a surprizingly good plot for an action flick.  And even better Keanu Reeves improves himself above a joke of an actor (although Devil's Advocate was a good movie).  A lot of cool action, inventive special effects and high tension of action scenes.  The characters were likable and though there are some Jesus parallels, you won't care cause you'll be wrapped up in the great story.  Can't wait for the next films (it's gonna be a trilogy. Hey, same with Blade.  How come action/sci-fi flicks are going trilogy these days.  Probably due to Star Wars.)",Null,0,0,2 January 2000
The Wedding Singer," Cool Sandler flick.
","This was a really great Adam Sandler film.  Sandler is funny as is the rest of the cast in this Hilarious retro style comedy.  And the 80's produced some great upbeat comedies (Ruthless People, Ghostbusters, Big) that make long for the 80's.  We can't live in the past but it's a great place to visit now and then and this flick proves it.  Harruh!",Null,0,1,21 November 1999
