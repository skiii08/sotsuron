Ford v Ferrari," History teached in a pleasure way
","I am no knowing that much about cars history ,but i find this movie to be quite entertaining ,tension of the races is sended to the viewer in form of emotions,adrenalyne,excitment,passion,perfection,work and last but not least the dedication.Americans should be proud of such movie productions ,because this movie teach you so many things ,beside the history parts of it , you can learn what engineers were struggling to work for back in those times ,how races evolvee cars aerodynamics,power,breaks and every single system of the cars.Now i knowed some parts about these from university ,since we learn more about cars construction history and we been told that the races made car producers to evolvee them products due to competivity ,etc.. . So i am glad this movie come out ,and that there can be people who can feel those things , who can understand further the work of an engineer , and how much work those car companies put into developing newer and better cars ,but also show the work behind a succesful company !! is them engineers/workers and dedication.You must not pass over this , is just so delightful to watch it ,even if i didn't had the luck to see races happening real life (in Romania).i still curse those days ,when a high speed circuit was planned to be builded and been canceled! by politics changes and coruption.. .So those who have acces to those things, appreciate the opportunity of taking part to such a race.",10,2,3,28 January 2020
Parasite," how sick/weird is this movie and still catch you in
","The only thing i would change on it ,is the end... , why the hell all that had to happen, the movie would be great with a different end.Overall this is quit intresting to watch... , to understand the culture , the limits between poverty and rich people , there is more but i don't want to spoiler it , so it worth to watch.The movie ended in hurry somehow ,not showing the life of Kim Ki-woo , i like that for the first time i see quality into this korean/chinese/japanese culture movies recorded .This movie is pure fiction , but is not feeling like it couldn't become a real thingh , because doesn't look that unrealistic to happen .I note it for 9 , because i would give it a different ending and a part 2 ! ,but maybe the director of the movie didn't had same vision as us tend to have .. , he wanted something sad to happen and the movie to don't end in just a happy end.",9,21,33,12 January 2020
