E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," ET = Amazing acting
","I want to be an actress when I grow up, I'm only 13, and I think that this movie is one of the best acted movies....ever!  Henry Thomas, Robert MacNaughton, and Drew Barrymore are so real and amazing.  Dee Wallace-Stone is always in the moment and is remarkable.ET is so lovable and I cannot believe that Pat Welsh made her voice that convincing to make the audience believe that ET was not human.",10,1,2,30 March 2002
