Requiem for a Dream," A great film
","I first watched this film with a friend but I didn't pay a great deal of attention. After remembering the title and reading reviews, I bought it. Jared Leto's and Ellen Burstyn's performances are both brilliant in portraying two completely different types of drug addiction. Quite a dull beginning with a lot of speech but the back story really heightens the dramatic ending. I love the directing specifically in Requiem for a dream. (Darren Aronofsky) The final scenes which show the main characters all distanced from one another, surrounded by their drug fuelled happiness/pain/'insanity' is a touching end to a well made, well acted, all round film.",9,0,1,28 March 2015
