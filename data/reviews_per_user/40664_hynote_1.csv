Catch Me If You Can," Spielberg Fails
","Steven Spielberg normally does a pretty good job with adapting books to movies, but this time he is way off! He has taken a fantastic story that could have been, in my opinion, shot directly from the book, and turned it into Fluff. While Leo DiCaprio does a fair job in a now bland part and Tom Hanks saves the film with his performance, people that have read the book will be sorely disappointed. The surprising thing is, Mr. Spielberg is usually so careful about getting things right, I have a hard time understanding how he got this one so wrong. The film takes way too long to get going, and when it does it's so slow it's hard to watch. Even if I wasn't a big fan of the book, this movie would be bad.Maybe he should call it Catch me in '1941'",Null,1,1,7 January 2003
