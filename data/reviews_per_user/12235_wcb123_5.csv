It," 1990 version was better
","The old TV movie from 1990 is better and portrays a bleaker derry that is truer to the book. It portrayed more mystery, suspense and in general was much more eerie.The new version isn't scary AT ALL and the costume design for IT himself reminds me more of Beetlejuice or someone out of Alice In Wonderland whilst the other mutations just make you laugh.The casting is excellent and the acting is pretty good, in parts, but most of the kids are really bad at acting genuinely scared which makes the 'supposed to be' scary moments essentially emotionless.The worst thing for me is the directors 'decision' to omit the adult portion of the story to make a... you guessed it... another separate movie. Quite ridiculous when one of the best bits about the book is how King interweaves the two timelines.Maybe worth a watch if you like Stranger Things (which imo is scarier), but if you like the book or want a truer portrayal of IT watch the 1990 version.",Null,4,9,7 October 2017
The Ottoman Lieutenant," Should have been much much better
","This is one of the most unexpectedly disappointing films i've seen in a long time especially given the people involved and the glowing reviews. I loved Joseph Ruben's previous films in the 90s and Ben Kingsley is in my top five actors of all time.Unfortunately the Casting is wrong and, although the acting is OK, the fake accents are horrific. The worst thing though is the pace of the shots / editing / scene changes etc because it's so rushed you couldn't care less about the characters or whatever is happening in the film, It's like watching something in fast forward.The composer ticks all the right boxes with the score but it feels futile because i have absolutely no interest in the characters.Watch this after watching something like Hacksaw Ridge, Braveheart, Titanic and you will understand what im saying.",Null,2,6,15 August 2017
Man of Steel," Not Inception.but Deception
","If ever there was a cash in....I can't believe i fell for the hype, i wondered why the trailers were more teasers than actual plot reveals, now i know why, there is literally no story.As many have said, it starts out with potential. Crowe and Shannon are awesome on screen together (somebody like Ridley Scott needs to cast these two together in a decent sci fi). You are for a minute fooled into thinking there is going to be an epic and complex re imagining of the Superman story.Oh boy no! 10 minutes in and we meet Clarke on earth. Alas it begins - Constant flicking between time periods. Humans hate Clarke but he loves to help people - you know the score. Dad dies after a whole two minutes of screen time. Superman saves Lois Lane. They are like long lost friends on their second meeting. Cue Zod appearing and from then on in its pure fighting and explosions. Then you think you are watching war of the worlds. Then the film ends.Its like those youtube videos that sum up a film in 10 seconds.THE CASTING IS GOOD (Cavill and Adams do make a good Clarke and Lois)... THE ACTING CANNOT BE FAULTED... CINEMATOGRAPHY IS VERY NICE... THE MUSIC IS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT... THE DIRECTING AND WRITING IS PURE GARBAGE AND AN INSULT TO THE COMPLEX STORY THAT SUPERMAN, ITS FANS AND THE GREAT ACTING ROSTER INVOLVED DESERVES.Watch Smallville or the Christopher Reeves versions instead. Whilst these are far from perfect they are leagues ahead and at least attempt to go into some detail.",Null,5,11,17 October 2013
Get Out," A Horror Classic
","There are some films which you never want to end. There are some films that have a lifetime lasting impact on you. There are some films that once the credits roll you gasp in awe and stop for a minute and think Holy Ssshhh that was a work of genius.If you can't tell I think Get Out is one such film. In fact I think it might be the best Horror film i've seen since the Shining. And i don't say that lightly.Massive respect to Jordan Peels for writing and directing this masterpiece. Please keep the Horrors coming, the genre needs you.The casting was spot on and the acting was top notch as was the MUSIC composition.Deserves a couple of Oscars for sure.",Null,9,16,27 April 2017
The Cabin in the Woods," Better score than Truman Show? IMDb is now a joke.
","Seriously, in the words of Public Enemy. Don't believe the hype. Especially don't believe the top reviews on IMDb calling this film 'stunning...magnificent....most original horror since scream'. These Marketing/PR firms are really spoiling what used to be a reliable catalogue for good films.For starters this is not a horror film, its not even a clich√© filled bad attempt to be a horror film like the trailer led me to believe. Its in no way original, a blatant rip off of the Truman Show.I really like Joss Whedon and most of his films, especially Serenity, but I agree with the other 1 star reviewers, this is quite possibly the worst film i have or will ever watch. To give it one star is being nice. Watch the Truman Show or Friday the 13th instead.",Null,15,32,23 April 2012
