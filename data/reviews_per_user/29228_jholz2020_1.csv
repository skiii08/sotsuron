Miracle," Great movie for all!
","You don't need to be a hockey fan to enjoy this movie. You just need to be an American!!The movie of course is based on a true story and it does a very good job of portraying the struggles these young men and coaches went through to win the gold medal when nobody thought that was possible. Great movie for adults, kids, and anyone who can appreciate a good story! I honestly wish there were more movies like this that show the struggles and the triumphs. And then follows thru with telling us what these men are doing these days.Excellent all the way around!",9,1,1,24 October 2013
