Despicable Me 2," Fantastic Visual Treat
","I got to watch the advance screening, and I have to say, it was one of the best I have seen. The movie nicely blended together fantastic imagery, distinctive music, hilarious comedy and an original plot line.The animation is crisp and clean. The 3D isn't overused and all 'in- your-face'. There are many stunning settings and locations; each one has obviously designed with great care to depict a particular mood or atmosphere. Combined with the various angles used (first and second person, bird's eye views), this movie is a delightful visual treat. Story-wise, Despicable Me 2 wasn't a great as the visuals, but formidable just the same. Yes, there was character development and an easy-to- follow plot-line, but it seemed just a little bit weak. The movie didn't tie up some loose ends, but they were trivial and seriously don't detract from the overall story.The music of Despicable Me 2 is very distinctive, both compared to other movies and between different scenes and environments. There is edgy, electronic music, upbeat spy music, rhythmic salsa music, and of course, the 'Despicable Me' theme song.Despicable Me 2 does a fantastic job appealing to both the kids and the adults. A rule of thumb is that anything the minions do, the kids will laugh at it. the adults get an impressive mix of pop songs in the 80s- 90s, however they are usually sung in the minion's gibberish.",10,1,4,29 June 2013
