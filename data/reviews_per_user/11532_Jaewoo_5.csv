Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Get real, it wasn't that good
","First, the awesome special effects and acting of Neeson, McGregor, and Portman saved the movie from being one of the greatest flops in history.The movie had that cheesy 70's feel; just check out the gun Queen Amidala uses, it is straight out of Flash Gordon. The Battle scenes (not the Sabre duel scenes) were a joke. Lucas should have consulted with combat experts. Only 7 year kids would have been excited. But even they, who are used to the great modern day movie action sequences, were probably bored.The pod race scene doesn't even come close to the horse race in Ben-Hur that Lucas obviously tried to emulate. Like all other scenes, the pod race is oblivious to the viewer's emotions, it tries to impress the audience only special effects, and not with special characters and drama.Jinsoo",Null,0,1,2 June 1999
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Action Sequences are too bland
","James Cameron is a GREAT director of action sequences. In T2, the action sequences were VERY meticulously done. For example, when John Connor (Edward Furlong) flees to the LA flood channels on a motorcycle to escape the T1000, James Cameron focuses his Camera on the obviously exhausted and perplexed John Connor, who FEELS he is safe, but James Cameron then performs his magic and let's the audience HEAR the semi truck squealing its wheels and then BAM!, BOTH the audience and John Connor are shocked to see the truck leaping off the bridge at a close proximity to John Connor. In effect, James Cameron creates DRAMA in his action sequences which makes the audience ENJOY the action despite its foregone conclusion.In the T3, there is no drama in all of its action. EVERYONE knows John Connor will live and T100 will prevail over the more sophisticated TX. The challenge is make it interesting to the audience despite the obvious. In this, the T3 fails.I saw this movie as a high budget action adventure with a nice plot, but nothing more. It certainly doesn't compare well against the T2.",Null,0,0,17 July 2003
The Mummy Returns," Patricia Valasquez stole the movie
","This movie is worthless except for Patricia Valsquez(Egyptian lover of the Mummy). She is absolutely stunning in this film and shows she has a very strong film 'presence' unlike any other actress I have ever seen except for Marilyn Monroe. Despite other weak characters, her character comes alive with magnetic film persona and draws in the audience from the weak plot which the movie is based upon. I hope this film really launches her career give her a momentum because I think she has a real bright future ahead as an actress.",6,0,0,5 May 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," The problem, of course, is choice
","The problem, of course, is choice, a choice to see this convoluted sequel to the great original. As if predestined, I was left with the question of 'why', because I had already made a choice to watch this movie.After watching this movie, I was left with more choice. Do I choose to watch it again because I had no idea what the hell NEO and the Architect was talking about? Again, I had already made the choice, but I was left with the question of 'why' do I want to watch this increasingly befuddling piece of philosophical movie with dialect straight out of 18th century philosophical text.During the second viewing, I was left with an another choice. Do I walk out of the movie theater door or do I fall asleep? Will Zion NOT be destroyed if I fell asleep? This time, I went against my predestined choices, and watched the movie to the end against my destiny.  Fate, as I would have it, is not always predetermined. Unfortunately, I had to again watch the horrible scene between NEO and the architect. And again, I had no idea what the hell they were talking about. But this did not stop myself from asking 'why'? Why did I spend total of $19.50 to watch it twice? Will watching it third time answer the question 'why'? So, as if predetermined, I watched it again. This time in iMax nonetheless. Then it struck me, I then understood 'Why'. I watched the movie for 3rd time because that's how many times it took me to understand what the hell NEO and the Architect was talking about. Then I had an epiphany, the movie had predestined viewers like me to watch it at least twice because they purposely made all dialect and plots impossibly difficult to understand with one viewing.",Null,0,0,30 July 2003
Gladiator," Hopelessly Overrated
","I cannot believe this picture won the Best Picture Oscar. Now I am completely convinced that the OSCAR is given for political/economic reasons than artistic/merit reasons.The film does a poor job of telling a dumb story. Yeah a slave gladiator takes over the greatest empire on earth by Killing Caesar in a duel front of spectators. How likely is that? The film tries its best to try to convince that it is plausible, but that's what makes this film hilariously bad.The fighting scenes were poorly choreographed. The Tigers lounges out, it seems, only when the director wants them to, not when the gladiator should be trounced by it.The special effects in this movie were not special. In fact, it has ALL been done before much BETTER in other films. What is so spectacular about developing a virtual colisum when we can create a virtual  dinosaurs, cities, creatures, etc etc???",3,0,2,10 July 2001
