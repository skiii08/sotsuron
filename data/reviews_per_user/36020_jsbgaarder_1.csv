Blade Runner 2049," Powerful and majestic science fiction!
","Just like the first movie, it discusses what it really means to be a human being and it comments on the state of humanity in a way that is uncomfortable near what is real and truthful.The Blade Runner 2049 is an adult sci-fi that caters for reflection while inviting us into a slightly foreseeable future universe that seems as perceptive and interesting as it is dark and dystopic.Stumbling over a dark secret Los Angeles anno 2049 is a chaotic, overpopulated and polluted monster of a city where Niander Wallace (Jared Leto) has bought the stumps of Tyrell Corporation and their technology and is king on the hill with its constructed androids, called 'replicants.'The LAPD Officer K (Ryan Gosling) is a 'blade runner' looking for replicas on the run, stumbling over a dark secret while on a mission. To get a response, he is looking for Deckard (Harrison Ford), a former 'blade runner' that disappeared 30 years ago.The story is much richer and comprehensive than a tiny record can convey. It is spoken through sparse, but precise dialogue, co- written by Hampton Fancher, who was also one of the authors of the original originals, based on Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.The movie's figures have different approaches to what it means to be human, such as Luv (Sylvia Hoeks), who is Wallace's right hand, Joi (Ana de Armas) who is K's companion, or the farmer Sapper Morton (Dave Bautista in one small but important role - be sure to bring you the Blade Runner card movie 2048: Nowhere to Run on YouTube, giving his figure a further depth).Everyone has their own ambitions, methods and instruments, but ultimately everyone is looking for a form of humanity and survival.Denis Villeneuve presents his own universe, full of visual ideas and magnificent views in Blade Runner 2049. Denis Villeneuve presents his own universe, full of visual ideas and magnificent views in the Blade Runner 2049. Villeneuve does not disappoint Denis Villeneuve has obviously studied the original Blade Runner because the new film's universe continues Ridley Scott's future vision and expands it on a scale that seems credible and probable, of course, with powerful instruments that Scott could only dream of in 1982.At the same time, he does not fall for the temptation to cultivate nostalgia to a significant extent. Just look at an explosive scene with Deckard's original Spinner vehicle and how K suspects the darkened ghost of Tyrell Corporation's former headquarters, now in the shadow of Niander Wallace's monstrous palace.But there are other and more subtle waves, such as the summons in Deckard's apartment, the whiskey he drinks, certain advertising signs in big city photos and some other reminder that you will experience yourself. Blade Runner 2049 has great respect for its predecessor, but presents its own universe, full of visual ideas and magnificent views, masterfully filmed by veteran Roger Deakins.Even the intense film music of Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer have their own identity, despite some moves that drag the lines back to Vangelis's moods from the first film.Ryan Gosling plays K with a restful calm, even in some extreme situations, and conveys the emotional range of the figure with small, precise eyes, signs and words. Harrisons Ford's role is a little less than one would expect from the trail, but he is good and efficient as a much older and distinguished Deckard.His continued destiny has been a mystery to Blade Runner fans for 35 years, and the answers you get in this movie are very satisfying. One also recognizes the outlines of a much larger universe, where there are clear opportunities for more stories, if it should be applicable. The potential is in any case present.Perhaps you should be glad that Ridley Scott did not have time to direct Blade Runner 2049, and to be one of the producers, because his legendary status is undeniable, Denis Villeneuve is one of the world's most sharpest filmmakers right now, with quality films such as Sicario and Arrival on the merit list.He does not disappoint now either, to say the least. This is dark, mysterious and thoughtful science fiction of the very highest quality!",10,4,14,15 October 2017
