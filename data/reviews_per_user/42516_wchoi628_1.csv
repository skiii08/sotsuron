The Avengers," Best All-Out Super Hero Movie of All Time
","As a fan of marvel, I have been waiting for a movie of this magnitude for years. I am relieved that this movie wasn't released years ago because it would have ruined the hype for this one. This movie in terms of visuals, directing, plot, acting, is all on point. I was a little skeptical with Mark Ruffalo as Edward Norton's replacement for the Bruce Banner character but he did not disappoint. There are comedic scenes that are appealing to people of all ages and some scenes are just so jaw-dropping that you can only hope for whats in store for Avengers 2/iron man 3. Paramount has found a director that can make a billion dollars several times over with the marvel franchise.",10,1,4,5 May 2012
