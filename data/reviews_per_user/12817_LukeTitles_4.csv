War Dogs," A good movie and a missed opportunity
","This movie is difficult to decipher. It is based on a true story and that story is absurd (in a good way). Therefore the ground material is very valuable, the story flows almost always very precisely from point A to point B, without messing around too much. Maybe a couple of small subplots were unnecessary and made the movie a little bit longer than it should be.The actors' performances are very convincing, Jonah Hill is confirming to be a great actor, pulling off a great performance yet again. What I didn't like about the movie is that it lacks in personality. It seems to me that they wanted to keep a bright tone while narrating very dark events. They are telling a very upsetting story about how the army is getting its weapons, but it looked to me that the movie doesn't take a stand on that matter. I can't really define it better than just saying: the narration is too flat. It looks like it is denouncing something, but it doesn't really do that. In other words, it is a movie of half measures.Probably they could have achieved a much better result by explaining better the transitions in the behavior of the characters, that are, instead, something that simply happens on the screen.",6,1,2,5 September 2016
Suicide Squad," Enjoyable, but poor story
","The first thought I had as soon as the movie was over was: a lot of flesh and no bones.The acting is great, Margot Robbie is perfect and way out of reach of all the others, Will Smith being Will Smith is good, and Leto had the guts of bringing to us a new Joker (not better than others, just different). The soundtrack is really good. There are some jokes that cracked the theater. I liked the action scenes.All of this is what I call 'Flesh'.What is missing (the 'bones') is a solid story, in a movie where the main characters are bad guys you need a really good antagonist and the movie fails in that. The movie spends the first part to introduce the characters and jumps directly to the main plot, that is so weak to be confused to a warm up mission. I didn't feel any tension, nor the movie made me care about what was happening on the screen. Yes, great characters, funny, but without a story to support them the risk to be a pointless movie, another expensive set up for the Justice League, is real.",6,2,9,4 August 2016
Sausage Party," Boring and not funny
","I expected a funny movie, it turned out to be a boring sequence of unjustified F-words. I think a 12 years old would enjoy this movie very much, but a 12 years old is not allowed to watch it.I heard funnier sex jokes in 5th grade. Since they want to stress out that is a movie for adults, they keep saying unnecessary profanities (I never heard an adult speaking like an 8-year-old boy that just discovered the F-word). The result is a complete loss of humor (that was present in the trailers). The plot is OK, I guess, it is just difficult to see it behind all that swearing.I can't believe how bad it is.",1,58,114,3 September 2016
Sully," A very well executed movie, high quality product
","Clint Eastwood comes back to our screens two years after American Sniper to tell us another American story. This time is the true story of the US Airways flight 1549, which, on February 15, 2009, was forced to land in the Hudson River after hitting several birds in the act of taking off from New York's LaGuardia Airport. The movie is centered on the figure of the captain, Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger, the hero that saved everyone on that plane by taking the decision and then executing a bold water landing. In the movie, we go through the investigation of the accident and the struggles that captain Sully faced during that period. The hero is then haunted by doubts about himself and by the perspective of losing his pension after 40 years of service. Telling a true story on screen is always tricky, but Sully delivers with power every emotion, overcoming the fact that the viewer already knows the outcome of the story. I've enjoyed the movie, I felt a wide spectrum of emotions and it feels authentic. The actors are amazing and very well directed, the dialogues are powerful, and Aaron Eckhart should be forced to keep that glorious mustache till the end of time. Moreover, the narration of the events is very well designed, not giving us the scenes of big visual impact right away, but rather delivered, one bit at a time, in different moments of the movie. The only flaw of the movie itself is a piece of dialogue that gave my nerves. It appears to me that the old Clint wants to remind the viewers that something else about planes crashing on New York happened in the recent past. Therefore, starting from the very first scene, we find images of how worse that accident could have been. At first, I tolerated the choice, since it is fitting with a PSTD of the pilot. Moreover, it could be the way of the director to say 'everyone will think about 9/11 anyway, just ride the elephant in the room' (although I'm not sure about the first part and we will never know now). I ran out of tolerance when the issue was explicitly addressed with a phrase like 'It has been a while since New York had good news, especially involving planes' (not a literal transposition). I found it inappropriate and it doesn't fit well in the movie.Besides that, it is a very well executed movie, I fully recommend it because it is a good way to spend a couple of hours.At last, I would like to address a message that the movie made me feel and to which I disagree with. The method used to represent the investigation, as well as the people whose duty is to establish what went wrong and who is responsible, made me take a stand against the investigation itself. This is simply a wrong message to deliver. In such accidents, the investigation is mandatory because you have also to decide if giving or not to the pilot (or the plane) the responsibilities for other human lives. It is true that the struggle and the self-analysis of the main character are saying that he trust the necessity of such investigation. However, from the choice of the actors (that always interpret annoying characters) to the dialogues, the feeling is that the investigators are the bad guys. I think this is simply the wrong message and I don't think that an expert director like Clint Eastwood did that by accident.",8,3,8,8 September 2016
