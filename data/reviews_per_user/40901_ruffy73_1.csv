The Blair Witch Project," No Joke, The Greatest movie ever created!!!
","It takes a lot of balls to do what those film makers did. And they showed that they could do it. As of today (3-31-05) i had never seen the movie. I knew what it was all about, a i knew what was gonna happen. But i never saw the whole thing. Once i saw those credits rolling at the end of the film i was in pure amazement of this great creation. This movie was so greatly put together. The acting in the film was incredible, and thats an understatement. It had me questioning whether this movie is really real. You just can't fake the emotion that those people had. But the reason i gave it a 9 was because of the only flaw, they just keep the camera rolling, if i were lost in the woods i wouldn't keep the camera rolling. I've heard mixed reviews from several people, but finally seeing it for myself was just worth it. The Blair Witch Project has just jumped above Forrest Gump as the best movie i've ever seen.",9,0,2,31 March 2005
