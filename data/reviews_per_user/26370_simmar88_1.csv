Hereditary," Slow-paced but multilayered
","SPOILERS -- WARNING -- Read only if you have seen the movieJust watched it for the first time, had a good time.What seems to be a classic horror movie with a dark entity really is a work treating mental illness, psychosis, multiple personalities and, as a kickstarter to it all, grief of course. Forget Paimon, the demon, or whatever spirit or entity it is, all of it really is just about fantasies of a person (Ellen) with a severe mental disorder triggered by the loss of a child that commited suicide (Charles). The pain led to a severe psychosis in which multiple non-existent protagonists interact (Peter, Steve, Joan, Charlie (which is a projection of the lost child Charles) and by extension everyone you see in the movie). Everything is just about madness and the abyss it could drag one in. Three generations are depicted as having hereditary mental disorder, when in fact there is only one. The title of the movie is a clue to what it is really about. In fact ''Annie'' is selling it in her meeting when she talks about her mentally ill mother.Watch it again with that in mind, and you'll like it even more.",8,2,4,7 January 2019
