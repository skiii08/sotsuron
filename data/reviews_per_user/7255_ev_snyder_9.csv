Kill Bill: Vol. 2," More story, less action, but still fun to watch (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)
","Kill Bill Vol. 1 got most of the action, while Vol. 2 got all of the story. Vol. 2 still has enough action to satisfy a normal person, but what makes Vol. 2 so fun to watch is not what made Vol. 1 just as fun last year.  It's fun to see in Vol. 2 how all of the different story points fit together so well with the facts from Vol. 1, even the little ones, like Elle Driver's eye.  This goes to show you how talented Quentin Tarantino is as a writer and director.  If you haven't seen either movie, it would be smart to rent Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 together and watch them together, instead of a year apart like everyone else did.  This way, if you watched them together, you'd probably miss fewer of the plot points and you'd get the most out of the story.  If you really like the films, you may even consider watching them more than once, until you understand everything.  Excellent acting from Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah, and, as always, Uma Thurman.  David Carradine, who I've never considered a good actor, gives his best performance in Kill Bill Vol. 2.  Good acting from the rest of the cast.  Good story and good directing, but not Tarantino's best.  Nine stars out of ten.",9,0,1,23 August 2004
Scarface," Pacino at his best
","Scarface is an excellent movie with excellent acting, a good story, and minimal flaws. This is likely Brian De Palma's best directing, and the story along with Pacino's exceptional acting make it one of the best films of the 80's, if not of all time. This is Pacino's finest effort seen, not soon to be matched, and he plays a Cuban superbly. Steven Bauer also does an outstanding job acting, and Michelle Pfeiffer played her role perfectly. The plot was excellent and the music very fitting for the film's setting and era. Scarface isn't a short movie, but it's never boring and the scenes flow perfectly. I applaud anyone who helped make this film and I recommend it to anyone who likes good movies. Five stars out of five.",10,1,2,5 August 2004
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not very good
","I never paid much attention to Star Wars and I was never a big fan of the films, but I did see the first three when I was a kid and again when I got older, and I still kind of liked them. But this addition to the series is nowhere near as good as the old films. First off, it's much more colorful, which I don't like, but maybe it's kind of fitting. Also, however, the acting, story, scene flow, and directing aren't near as well done as in the older films. There was hardly anything in the movie to keep me in my seat watching it. Most people hated the film, although it is impossible to rate this film without comparing it to the older films. Few people thought the film was okay, and even fewer loved it. The only people who did love this movie were small children and idiots who thought the androgynous Jar-Jar Binks character was clever, and die-hard Star Wars fans. Yet some big Star Wars fans hated it, because they didn't have to hypnotize themselves to convince their minds that this movie was actually good, and they actually liked it, because all Star Wars films are good, right? They just accepted the fact that this movie sucks.",2,0,1,23 July 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Fun to watch (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)
","Kill Bill was originally supposed to be one movie, but since the movie would have ended up being so lengthy, it was decided that two movies should be made.  Because of this, Kill Bill Vol. 1 got much less of the story and more of the action.  Vol. 1 doesn't play like a regular movie, since there's so little story and you feel there's something missing in the movie, even though you know it's all going to emerge in Vol. 2.  The movie is mostly made up of a few gruesome battles and a couple of scenes, which really make the movie fun to watch, and one dorky anim√© sequence, which doesn't.  Kill Bill Vol. 1 is pretty good, not Tarantino's best film, but better than Jackie Brown.  The best way to enjoy the film is probably to watch it and Vol. 2 back-to-back so that you're not left hanging at all and so that you don't forget all the stuff from Vol. 1 that is mentioned in Vol. 2.  Nine stars out of ten.",8,0,2,20 August 2004
Reservoir Dogs," Great Tarantino film
","I thought the movie Reservoir Dogs was very well made and had a good script and good directing.  But even better than that was the movie's excellent acting and great cast.  Every role was cast perfectly and acted very well, even Tarantino's bit, and, although Sam Jackson is an excellent actor, I respect and support Mr. Tarantino's decision not to use him in this film. Harvey Keitel was a special treat in this film, as was Steve Buscemi.  The story is in every way perfect and the setting, although very different from that of Pulp Fiction, is every bit as good.  Tim Roth didn't give as good of a performance in this as he did in Pulp Fiction, since he was playing an American in Reservoir Dogs, but he still did a good job.  Michael Madsen did an excellent job in this film, playing his role perfectly (probably just as writer/director Quentin Tarantino originally saw the character in his mind), and it's a shame we didn't see him in another Tarantino flick until Kill Bill Vol. 2.  Reservoir Dogs is second only to Tarantino's own Pulp Fiction, and the opening credits sequence is very cool and clever.  I recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it.  Five stars out of five.",10,0,1,24 August 2004
Pulp Fiction," Tarantino at his best! (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)
","I, like many others, consider Pulp Fiction to be Tarantino's best film. Pulp Fiction has an excellent story and good directing.  The acting is excellent all around and Travolta gives his finest performance.  What makes this movie really fun to watch, however, is how it's set up.  Pulp Fiction doesn't play like a regular movie; the scenes are all out of order.  There are a few stories going on that have little to do with each other and you get to see where all the stories meet.  At the end you see just how each story affected the other and where they all cross, and how each story point fits in with the next (similar to Kill Bill, in which Tarantino didn't mess up, but just didn't do as good of a job).  But the end of the movie isn't really the end, because you've already seen scenes that take place after the last scene.  The real end of the story is the end of Butch's story, after he already killed Vega, and you might not have realized this until fifteen minutes after the movie was over.  This movie isn't really artistic, but more so clever.  And Tarantino denies any truth about the whole band-aid thing and soul-redemption suitcase, for those of you who can't enjoy a good movie for what it is, or maybe just can't get enough out of this one.  Ving Rhames just has a big ugly scar on the back of his head.Pulp Fiction is easily Tarantino's best work, and possibly the best movie I've ever seen.  All of the acting was excellent, including Tarantino's bit, and Bruce Willis, as little of him as we saw, was a treat.  I recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it.  Five stars out of five.",10,1,3,23 August 2004
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Superb!
","This film is excellent and one of the best European films I have ever seen, with an excellent British cast and screenplay.  The story is very clever and the acting and directing are very good also.  All the scenes flow together very well and wrap up comfortably in the end.  Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is fun to watch and also very funny and clever, with amateur criminals trying to pull off the perfect crime.  Since this was a British film, and just got compared with a bunch of other British films, most people didn't notice that this movie was a lot like the movie Pulp Fiction.  Anyone who liked Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs ought to see Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.  I also recommend this movie to anyone who is into foreign films and to anyone who likes good movies.  Five stars out of five.",10,0,1,20 August 2004
Jackie Brown," Tarantino's worst film
","Jackie Brown was not a bad movie, but just a disappointment, since I was expecting so much more from a Quentin Tarantino movie.  The movie still had the same style to it as all of Tarantino's other films, but the movie was a lot different and not as enjoyable as Tarantino's other films.  Of course, this movie was based on a novel, so Tarantino didn't write it, he just wrote the script.  The story is too drawn out, but the acting and directing are excellent, and there are a few very cool scenes that make the movie worth while.  Sam Jackson plays a very funny part, and it was fun to see Robert De Niro in a Tarantino film.  Both actors, as always, played their roles very well.  It was a treat to see Michael Keaton in the film, as well as Chris Tucker.  I'd rate Jackie Brown right beneath Kill Bill Vol. 2 as far as Quentin Tarantino films go.  This was not a bad movie, just a little disappointing and too drawn out.  If you rented the movie, you might want to watch it half at a time so that you won't get bored out of your mind during certain scenes.  Seven stars out of ten.",7,2,4,26 August 2004
True Romance," Fun to watch (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)
","I like True Romance not for the story, but for the cool and funny scenes that make it so fun to watch. The story was okay, but not as good as the others Tarantino wrote, such as Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. I think the movie might have been better if Tarantino had directed it himself, but this is still a good movie and fun to watch. What makes it so fun to watch isn't the story, but certain scenes, like when Alabama's getting beat up but she just smiles and flips the guy off. Or any of the scenes with Brad Pitt, when he's high and acting like a moron. My favorite scene is when Dennis Hopper is being interrogated by Chris Walken and he's just making a fool of the guy, knowing, but not caring, that he's about to get killed for it. One thing I don't like about this film, however, is the ending; Clarence was originally supposed to stay dead, but they changed it in the movie so that he ends up living after all, and that ruins the ending of the movie. The casting and acting are excellent, however, and Dennis Hopper and Chris Walken were both a bonus to have in the movie. I recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of either of those actors and to anyone who likes cool movies. Four stars out of five.",9,1,3,23 August 2004
