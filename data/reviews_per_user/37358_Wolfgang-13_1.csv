Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," An entertaining movie, but for a die-hard fan maybe somewhat disappointing
","Regarding the negative US reviews (some of them where rather harsh) I went to the cinema with rather modest expectations - and got a positive surprise. It's definitely not the best Star Wars movie, but a solid one which doesn't deserve at all being punched THAT way. Both visuals and sound are stunning and you'll get two hours of non-stop fun and action. If you're a fanatic fan, maybe you'll be disappointed by the massive share of comic stuff you'll get and the somewhat missing true Star Wars atmosphere, but if you regard it as being just a movie and nothing more, you will face a solid piece of entertainment. I'd rate E1 8/10 points (E4: 9  E5: 8  E6: 8). By the way, it's the first movie ever where - in my insignificant opinion - the German dubbed version beats the original.In brief: definitely not Shakespeare, but far more entertaining.",Null,0,0,1 September 1999
