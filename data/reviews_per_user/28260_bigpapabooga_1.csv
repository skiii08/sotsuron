Sucker Punch," sucker punched my WALLET!
","very expensive action scenes (recycled ORKS LOTR series Recycled dragon Reign of Fire recycled Under Siege 2 with I robots) BLAH BLAH BAD! don't wast your money! lack of plot loses you and it MAKES NO SENSE other than EYE CANDY! my wife almost divorced me for taking her to see it! this is a a high tech story about a girl getting a lobotomy! we felt as though we got one after the ticket agent SUCKER PUNCHED me with the ticket price! OOOOOOUCH! BAD TO THE BONE (not in the good sense)the only good thing that came of it was that i got my money back! Prepare to get a visual labotomy to your head and wallet with a bunch of bad script and imagination from the director. he should of named it 'i stole parts from the matrix,Lord of The Rings, Reign of fire under siege 2 and MORTAL KOMBAT to SUCKER PUNCH you'",1,12,27,27 March 2011
