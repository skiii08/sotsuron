The Devil's Advocate," Masterful cinema with a kick
","A superb film and a joy bearing in mind it came from a major studio. the rest of Hollywood should aspire to make films like this. Keanu Reeves finally makes a successful break from the role of Ted Theodore Logan.Pacino is on fine form yet again as Milton. The locations are well chosen and the cinematography is first rate, not letting itself slip into anything too dark which could easily have reduced the tension.The direction is sound and the co-stars perform well to offset two wonderful lead roles. A magnificent film that all should see.",10,2,2,2 October 1998
