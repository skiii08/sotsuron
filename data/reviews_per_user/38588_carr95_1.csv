Walk the Line," A Fantastic Movie for all
","I saw this movie last night, I think Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon did a fantastic job. I think both of them should win Oscars for this movie. The fact that they sang themselves and did such a wonderful job was very impressive. I plan on buying the soundtrack today, and the moment the movie comes out on DVD I will be buying it. I think everyone whether you are a Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash fan or not, should go see this movie, it really is a wonderful love story that makes you smile.I highly recommend this movie to everyone.2 Thumbs up!!!!I am going to see it again, this is how much I loved this movie.It is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.The soundtrack is fantastic. I can't seem to get enough.This one impressed me as much as Coal Miner's Daughter, and it's funny that I love the actors singing the real persons songs as much if not more than when the actual person. I cannot wait to see it again!!!!",10,1,2,8 December 2005
