Deja Vu," Nothing about Deja Vu but 'Man on Fire in New Orleans'
","It's funny that this film made me believe a couple of scenes as experiencing Deja Vu, but later I've noticed that they actually were far different to what you know as Deja Vu. In the film, Doug(Denzel Washington) faces a few moments where he feels like 'I've seen this before...' that just looks like Deja Vu, but in fact those moments were his actual experiences that he'd gone through just a couple of days ago. It is not a kind of thing that you feel like you've seen but can never remember where, it is actually the thing that you have just experienced in real life. You would not call that a Deja Vu. If you could see what happened at certain places and you would time-travel back to that moment, you'll surely what you have already seen from the future. After all, it does not make any sense though. To me this film is more like 'Man on Fire II' but in New Orleans. Rather than saving a little girl, this ex-military tough but sole man goes for saving a girl that he meets via time machine. It is stylish, just like 'Man of Fire' but I'm a bit sick of hearing another time-traveling story and the love and sacrifice and all that. Another thing is that, Doug goes out in a van to chase the criminal but then he causes serious car accidents and a truck crash while chasing and don't really care. (a couple of innocent people must have died in the crashes but no need to care 'cause they are not playing any roles for this film? what a HOLY Hollywood!) Yeah, yeah, I get it, a couple of cars, explosions, 'must be in film' thing, a girl in the past must be saved but who cares about a couple of civilian's deaths. I'm giving 7 'cause Denzel Washington's done his job alright as usual.",7,0,1,14 April 2010
