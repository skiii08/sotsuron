Gremlins," One of the best monster movies ever made
","I was 13 years old when I first saw 'Gremlins' way back when it first came out in theaters during the summer of 1984. That summer 'Gremlins' played opposite several big hit movies such as 'Ghostbusters', 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom', and 'The Karate Kid.' All terrific movies. But 'Gremlins' was my favorite of the bunch, and it still is today. One of the first films to come from Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment, this horror/comedy directed by Joe Dante and written by Chris Columbus is great fun. It ranks up there with Spielberg's 'Jurassic Park' as one of the great monster movies ever made. Forget those monster ripoffs that followed after this film became a box office smash. If you want to see a movie about little creatures on the rampage, see 'Gremlins'. It's scary, and very, very funny.

Raiders of the Lost Ark," This is what excitement is all about!
","'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is what excitement is all about. Directed by Steven Spielberg, this film is a great adventure tale made in the tradition of those old Saturday matinee serials. Harrison Ford put on the fedora for the first of three appearances as Indiana Jones, the archaeologist who has taken us on three great adventures. Here, Dr. Jones goes after the mystical Ark of the Covenant. The action scenes and special effects are spectacular. The film plays like a rollercoaster ride and there's plenty of on-the-edge-of-your-seat excitement. Karen Allen, who plays Dr. Jones' love interest Marion, is a great heroine (easily the best of the series). The villains include a French archaelogist (Paul Freeman), who's kind of Dr. Jones' counterpart; and some really nasty Nazis. This movie is as good as it gets. Great direction by Spielberg, who collaborated with 'Star Wars' creator (and good friend) George Lucas to create a brilliant movie series. The second movie 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' followed in 1984, and that was followed by the third movie 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' in 1989. All three movies are excellent, but 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is the best. **** (out of four)",10,2,5,24 March 2002
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," An all-time classic
","When I went to see 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone', I saw a preview of 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'. This of course is Steven Spielberg's classic from 1982 that will be rereleased next year for its 20th anniversary complete with never before seen footage, enhanced special effects, and digitally remastered sound. Well last night I watched the original version, which I saw a couple of times when I was a kid. The movie still hasn't lost its magical touch. 'E.T.' is one of the best movies that I've ever seen, a movie with heart, humor, and excitement that will live with us forever. The story about an alien stranded on Earth and the boy who takes him in and becomes his friend went on to become the biggest blockbuster of all-time. It stayed on top of the foreign box office list until Spielberg's 'Jurassic Park' surpassed it worldwide in 1993. It stayed on top of the domestic box office list until George Lucas rereleased 'Star Wars' in 1997 (that was complete with the new stuff that 'E.T.' is getting for its rerelease). Will 'E.T.' get back on top of the box office after its rerelease next year? Stay tuned. Winner of four Academy Awards (including Visual Effects and John Williams rousing score), 'E.T.' is a movie like 'Star Wars' that stays with you forever. Great story, great characters (a very young Drew Barrymore steals all of her scenes), great special effects, and great atmosphere, 'E.T.' is an all-time classic and it always will be.**** (out of four)",10,1,2,18 November 2001
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," One of the 10 best films of the '80s
","'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is one of my favorite movies of the 1980's. This is a truly original movie which combines live action with animation, and the result looks incredible. Bob Hoskins gives what has got to be the funniest performance of his career as a private detective who gets involved with cartoon character Roger Rabbit when the hyperactive toon is framed for murder. Director Robert Zemeckis has repeatedly said that 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' was the most difficult movie he's ever made, and by the looks of it, I can easily see why. He did an excellent job with the live action part of the movie (like when a toon is holding a real gun; in reality it's a real gun hanging on a wire). He was unfairly overlooked by Oscar voters; he should have gotten an Oscar nomination for Best Director (six years later Zemeckis got revenge; he made 'Forrest Gump' which he got nominated for and won the Oscar as Best Director). The special effects (which did win the Best Visual Effects Oscar) are remarkable. The cartoon animation (by Richard Williams, who won a special Oscar for his work here) is spectacular. Everything about 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is perfect. It's a dazzling motion picture that will never be topped in the department of putting live action with animation together. A great movie.**** (out of four)",10,0,1,3 December 2000
Erin Brockovich," Excellent true-life story
","'Erin Brockovich' was a surprise to me. It surprised me of how much this movie pulled me into the story right from the beginning and kept my attention all the way to the end. But most importantly, it features a powerful, knockout performance by Julia Roberts in the title role. Oscar voters if you are reading this take note immediately: Roberts deserves to be nominated for Best Actress and deserves to win. This is probably the best work she's ever done. Roberts dominates this film by appearing in almost every scene. Erin Brockovich is a tough-as-nails mother of three who goes to work for a law firm run by an attorney (wonderfully played by Albert Finney) who represented her in a case at the beginning of the movie. She eventually stumbles upon a monumental law case against a giant corporation (PG&E). Erin decides to take on this company at any cost. She also gets plenty of help from her boss, and the two begin a memorable fight that ends up bringing a small town to its feet and a huge corporation to its knees. 'Erin Brockovich' not only has a great performance by Roberts, but an excellent supporting performance by Finney as her boss, who early on hilariously tells his new employee about rethinking her wardrobe (love those outfits she wears). He should get an Oscar nomination too. Oscar nominations should also go to director Steven Soderbergh and screenwriter Susannah Grant for bringing this movie to life and telling a compelling story (Soderbergh will definitely get a Best Director nomination but he'll probably be nominated for his current movie 'Traffic', which is also generating Oscar talk). There are a couple of moments in 'Erin Brockovich' that I could have done without, and if the movie had been about 15-20 minutes shorter, it would have been a great movie. Nevertheless, it comes close, and Roberts splendid acting here is the driving force behind the success of this movie. If she doesn't take home the Best Actress Oscar come this March and the award ends up going to someone else, I'm going to be very upset. SHE DESERVES IT!!!!! As for the rest of 'Erin Brockovich', right from its smashing opening to its hilarious conclusion, it's a pretty darn good movie.***1/2 (out of four)",9,1,1,22 December 2000
Meet the Parents," Very funny
","'Meet the Parents' is a sometimes silly, but very funny comedy from the director of the 'Austin Powers' comedies. Robert DeNiro shows once again that he can be a great comedic actor. He plays the father of a young woman who brings her boyfriend home with her to meet her parents. Ben Stiller plays the boyfriend with a most unusual name who becomes very uncomfortable in getting to know his girlfriend's father. There are many goofy moments in 'Meet the Parents' that I didn't believe, but the fact is I laughed alot while watching it. Only DeNiro and Stiller could pull it off and make it so funny. Blythe Danner (the mother), Teri Polo (the girlfriend), and Owen Wilson (the girlfriend's ex-boyfriend) join in on the fun. 'Meet the Parents' is not the best comedy ever made, but it'll do until the next very funny comedy comes along.*** (out of four)",8,1,1,29 October 2000
Unbreakable," Good movie
","'Unbreakable' is writer/director M. Night Shyamalan's follow-up to his surprise box office smash from last year 'The Sixth Sense'. It's not quite as good as 'The Sixth Sense', but 'Unbreakable' is an intriguing thriller nevertheless. Bruce Willis once again teamed up with Shyamalan and Samuel L. Jackson (who co-starred with Willis in 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Die Hard With A Vengeance') to tell the tale of a man who's the sole survivor of a deadly train wreck which leaves him completely injury free. During the course of the film he tries to find out why he walked away from that train crash without a scratch or a broken bone in his body (hence the title). Shyamalan provides another surprise ending for this film just like in 'The Sixth Sense'. However in my opinion there's a big difference. The ending of Shyamalan's Oscar-nominated blockbuster was very effective and shocking. But I thought the ending for 'Unbreakable' was kind of silly. Still, it's a good thriller.*** (out of four)",7,0,0,24 November 2000
As Good as It Gets," Wonderful comedy-drama
","'As Good As It Gets' is another terrific movie from writer-producer-director James L. Brooks, the creator of 'Terms of Endearment' and 'Broadcast News'. The great Jack Nicholson, who won his second Oscar as Best Supporting Actor for 'Terms', won his third Oscar as Best Actor for his hilarious performance here as Melvin Udall, a mean-spirited writer who is hated by everyone and has a tendency to act weird and unusual (for example, when he walks down a street he avoids stepping in cracks by stepping over them). Then he begins to show off a nice side of himself thanks in part to two other people: his favorite waitress Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt) and his gay neighbor Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear). He also becomes attached to Simon's adorable little dog Verdell when Simon's art dealer pal (Cuba Gooding Jr.) forces Melvin to watch the dog after Simon is injured in a beating and hospitalized. Most movies simply don't get as good as this. 'As Good As It Gets' is very well-written and directed by Brooks who sure knows how to make good movies. He's only directed four feature films in his career and three of them have been excellent (only his 1994 film 'I'll Do Anything' was a dud). 'As Good As It Gets' is also beautifully acted by the entire cast. Nicholson is perfect here and so are Hunt and Kinnear. Hunt has proven that she can be a great actress both on the small screen (as on her long-running TV show 'Mad About You' which won her four Emmys) and on the big screen (she deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actress for her performance here and she's very good in the current release 'Pay It Forward'). Kinnear is also very good in this movie too (he was nominated for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar). The rest of the supporting cast from Cuba Gooding Jr. to Shirley Knight to former 'Ghostbuster' Harold Ramis are cast to perfection in 'As Good As It Gets'. This is a terrific movie with only one minor problem: it runs just a little bit too long. Still, I loved it anyway.  ***1/2 (out of four)",9,0,0,28 October 2000
Home Alone," Terrific comedy
","'Home Alone' went on the become a box office sensation when first released in late 1990. It stayed at the top of the box office as the #1 film for its first 12 weeks of release. Quite impressive. Kids of all ages just loved this movie about a little 8-year-old boy who gets accidentally left home all by himself after his family rushes off to spend Christmas in France. Macaulay Culkin is terrific as Kevin, the boy left home alone. He pretty much is the whole show here. His charisma and presence help make 'Home Alone' as good as it is. However, this movie is not a classic. If it wasn't for the ridiculously crazy climax this movie would have been better. Of course the climax is the part that made everybody laugh out loud, when the kid takes on those inept burglars by setting up booby traps that are just too far-fetched to be believable. This part still makes me laugh, but I just can't believe that an 8-year-old could dream up of stuff like that. And writer-producer John Hughes would inject this style of slapstick humor into alot of his following movies (including 'Baby's Day Out', 'Curly Sue', and of course the two 'Home Alone' sequels). The slapstick violence is at times a bit too much, but it doesn't go too far (though the first sequel 'Home Alone 2: Lost in New York' did get more violent in its slapstick comedy). Director Chris Columbus had his first smash hit with 'Home Alone'. He followed this with 'Home Alone 2', 'Mrs. Doubtfire', and most recently 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'. Columbus knows that he can work beautifully with kids, and 'Home Alone' is where he got his start. He makes Culkin look as good as he is. The supporting cast is fine (Catherine O'Hara and John Heard are good as Culkin's parents; Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are wonderfully bumbling as the clumsy burglars), and Hughes script has some wonderfully heartfelt touches. 'Home Alone' may not be the best comedy movie ever made, but it's still a good one. I'll take 'Home Alone' over Hughes idiotic 'Baby's Day Out' anytime.*** (out of four)",8,1,1,2 December 2001
L.A. Confidential," One of the best films of the '90s
","'L.A. Confidential' is a great movie. This complex mystery-thriller set in 1950s Los Angeles has great acting, great directing, great writing, great just about everything. Here is one of those rare films that pulls you into the story and never lets go. I love it when a movie does that. The main storyline of 'L.A. Confidential' is about a gruesome mass murder in a nearby diner that has connections with the corrupt L.A. police department. One of the men killed in the slaughter was an L.A. cop. The movie follows two different detectives who try to find who committed the crime and who is connected to it. Russell Crowe, and Guy Pearce portray the two detectives, both very different from each other. Crowe is Bud White, the really serious tough cop who doesn't mess around; Pearce is Ed Exley, the self-righteous cop who thinks he can rise above the sleaze in the department. Kevin Spacey also stars as another detective who works with a publisher of a sleazy tabloid played by Danny DeVito. James Cromwell is on hand as the detectives' police captain, and Kim Basinger gives an Oscar-winning performance as Lynn Bracken, the Veronica Lake look-alike call girl who becomes attached to the Crowe character. All these actors are superb here. Director Curtis Hanson does an outstanding job with the way he put this movie together. I was able to follow where this movie was going, and the Oscar-winning adapted screenplay (by Hanson and Brian Helgeland based on James Ellroy's novel) is compelling and brilliantly detailed. The sets and production design is another plus. The movie really looks like 1950s L.A. The cinematography, editing, and music score (by the great Jerry Goldsmith) are all first-rate (not to mention some good old classic songs). I loved everything about 'L.A. Confidential'. I think it's one of the top 10 best films of the 1990s.

X-Men," Fun sci-fi/action picture
","The long awaited 'X-Men' movie has arrived, and it's a pretty entertaining film. However, it's not a great film. Most of the characters could have used a little more development because they're so interesting. One character in 'X-Men' is developed effectively and that's Wolverine, well played by Australian newcomer Hugh Jackman. We get to know him pretty well during the course of the film. Another character that has a good amount of screen time is Rogue, played by Oscar winner Anna Paquin. We get to know these two characters very well, but I would have liked to have seen Professor X (Patrick Stewart), Storm (Halle Berry), Cyclops (James Marsden), and Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) on screen a little more often. Same goes for the bad guys in 'X-Men'. I recently heard that this movie was originally 45 minutes longer. That might be the problem. Nevertheless, all the actors are perfectly cast, and if their is going to be sequel, I hope that we'll get to know them better in the next movie (and get more screen time). The action scenes, special effects, art direction, costume designs, and makeup are first-rate. And that helps to make 'X-Men' a whole lot of fun.*** (out of four)",8,0,0,16 July 2000
American Pie," Crude but sweet sex comedy
","I wasn't all that crazy about 'American Pie' the first time I saw it. I missed it when it played in theaters and when I caught it on home video, it was funny, but not as funny as I thought it would be. However I watched the movie a couple of more times and it started growing on me. It got better and better with each viewing. 'American Pie' is a movie that most people (including myself) can relate too. It's about four high school boys who make a pact: lose their virginity by senior prom. This movie was the 'There's Something About Mary' of 1999 with it's disgusting jokes and crude humor, but 'American Pie' is a much better film than that 1998 Cameron Diaz box office smash. Plus, in spite of it's lowbrow comedy, it has a heart. Eugene Levy (of SCTV) was the only familiar face in the cast when this first came out. The entire cast of young actors were basically unknowns, but gained popularity since the film went on to be a sleeper hit. Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, and Eddie Kaye Thomas play the four buddies who make that pact; Shannon Elizabeth, Alyson Hannigan, Natasha Lyonne, Tara Reid, and Mena Suvari play the girls in their lives; and Seann William Scott steals the show as Stifler, the one who knows everything about sex. But all the actors are good here. Plus, there are some big laughs throughout. The part of 'American Pie' that I liked best was the generally sweet relationship between Chris Klein and Mena Suvari. I'd follow them two anywhere. 'American Pie' isn't the best comedy ever made, but it's a very good one. But the thing that surprised me the most, the sequel would turn out to be even funnier.*** (out of four)",8,0,0,2 October 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Spectacular adventure
","'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring', the first movie in 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy, is a spectacular movie epic in every way. This film succeeds in all departments: acting, directing, writing, cinematography, editing, art direction, costume design, music score, sound, and special effects. You name it. The big name cast that takes part in this outstanding motion picture includes Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Cate Blanchett, Liv Tyler, Ian McKellen, and Christopher Lee. They (along with others) play characters that were originated by J.R.R. Tolkien, the author of 'The Lord of the Rings' books, and brought to life by director Peter Jackson (who shot this and the two 'Lord of the Rings' sequels simultaneously in his native New Zealand). This, along with 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone', stand head and shoulders above all the other 2001 movies. But I don't want to say that 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' is the best movie of 2001 yet. Right now it is (with 'Harry Potter' at #2), but there are still a few other 2001 releases that I want to see that I haven't seen yet (like 'Black Hawk Down' and 'Gosford Park'), so probably a month or two from now I will know for sure if this terrific fantasy/adventure will finish on top as my favorite movie of 2001. But what a fantastic movie this was.

Cast Away," Strong adventure saga
","'Cast Away' reteams the star and director of 'Forrest Gump' (Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis), and the final result: a terrific adventure film that's just a few notches down from 'Gump'. Hanks plays a FedEx employee who hitches a ride on a FedEx plane that's flying over the Pacific Ocean until disaster strikes. Flying through a severe storm, the plane suffers major damage and crashes in the ocean. The Hanks character survives the crash, and washes up on a deserted island. It is here where he does everything he can to stay alive, and it's not an easy task. 'Cast Away' was shot in two parts. When they finished filming the first part, they stopped making the movie for a while so Hanks could lose 40-50 pounds to make it look like his character had been stranded on the island for years. This will guarantee Hanks his fifth career Oscar nomination for sure. He's brilliant in 'Cast Away'. It took alot of guts to lose all that weight. The other familiar face in the cast is Helen Hunt, who has a nice small supporting role as Hanks' girlfriend. In between the two parts of making 'Cast Away', director Zemeckis went off and made this summer's hit film 'What Lies Beneath'. 'Cast Away' is much better than that film. It brings Zemeckis back to full form (in addition to 'Forrest Gump', some of Zemeckis' other great films include a trio from the '80s: 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit', 'Back to the Future', and my personal favorite, 'Romancing the Stone'). 'Cast Away' has just a few boring spots, but it moves at a brisk pace. It's an exciting adventure. Plus there are a few funny spots (the scenes where Hanks talks to the volleyball made me laugh a couple of times). A very good movie.***1/2 (out of four)",9,0,0,26 December 2000
North by Northwest," Spectacular thriller
","Alfred Hitchcock's 'North by Northwest' is a classic thriller. I think this is Hitchcock's second best movie (his best is 'Psycho'). It has everything. Thrills, action, suspense, comedy, and great performances. Cary Grant has never been better as Roger Thornhill, a man who gets in way over his head when he's framed for murder. James Mason is terrific as the head bad guy, Martin Landau (35 years before his Oscar-winning role in 'Ed Wood') is scary as one of Mason's henchmen, and Eva Marie Saint is wonderful as the mystery woman who helps Grant out and falls in love with him. 'North by Northwest' is a very exciting adventure that never gets boring for one minute. There are lots of great scenes in this film. From an intoxicated Grant driving a car to get away from the bad guys early on to the dust-cropping scene midway through to the Mount Rushmore scenes late, I was into this film from the fascinating opening credits to the thrilling climax. The Master of Suspense as made some classic movies. 'North by Northwest' is definitely one of them.

U-571," Entertaining submarine thriller
","'U-571' is an entertaining submarine thriller that takes place during World War II when an American submarine crew make an attempt to take over a German U-boat and recover a secret-code transmitter. Things don't exactly go as planned. 'U-571' has a good opening, then drags for about a half-an-hour before the real excitement begins. Matthew McConaughey gives a strong, effective performance as the leader of the American crew, and gets good support by the supporting cast. The action scenes are well done, and all-in-all I wasn't disappointed. 'U-571' kept me on the edge of my seat most of the time, which makes it a pretty good film. However, it's not quite as good as another submarine thriller, 1990's 'The Hunt for Red October'.

American Beauty," Brilliant dark comedy
","'American Beauty' was without question the best movie of 1999. Five well-deserved Oscars (including Best Picture) went to this brilliant dark comedy about a dysfunctional family and the lives that they live. Kevin Spacey stars as Lester Burnham, a man who is ignored by his wife, and hated by his daughter. Then he starts to have a mid-life crisis when he starts to lust after his teenage daughter's best friend. What Spacey goes through during the course of this movie is something else. Spacey has given lots of great movie performances in movies such as 'A Time to Kill', 'L.A. Confidential', and 'The Usual Suspects' for which we won his first Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. He very deservedly won his second Oscar (this time for Best Actor) for his performance here, the best of his career. Annette Bening also gives a great Oscar-nominated performance as Carolyn, Lester's real estate agent wife. In addition to Spacey and Bening, there are terrific performances turned in by Thora Birch as their daughter, Jane; Mena Suvari as Jane's best friend Angela; Wes Bentley as Ricky, the new boy-next-door to the Burnhams; Chris Cooper and Allison Janney as Bentley's parents; and Peter Gallagher as Bening's real estate rival who starts to have a little something with Bening. Even former 'Quantum Leap' actor Scott Bakula has a great bit part in the movie. Director Sam Mendes and writer Alan Ball made their feature debuts with this film and what a spectacular job they have done their first time out. I can't wait to see what feature films they're going to do next. Beautiful cinematography, terrific production design, and a memorable film score are also major factors in the film. 'American Beauty' is a movie that is sometimes very funny, and sometimes very sad. It ranks up there with 'Titanic', 'Forrest Gump', 'Schindler's List', 'Driving Miss Daisy', 'Terms of Endearment', and 'Kramer Vs. Kramer' as my favorite movies that went on to win the big Oscar for Best Picture. An outstanding movie.**** (out of four)",10,0,0,24 May 2000
The Patriot," Beautifully made war epic
","'The Patriot' is a sweeping war epic that takes place during the Revolutionary War in 1776. Beautifully directed by Roland Emmerich ('Independence Day') and well written by Robert Rodat ('Saving Private Ryan'), 'The Patriot' stars Mel Gibson in one of his best film roles as Benjamin Martin, a widowed farmer who's taking care of his seven children. Martin had fought in an earlier war, and doesn't want anything to do with the Revolutionary War. That is until a terrible incident happens to his family, and he is forced to fight against the British. Gibson gives a powerful performance here, and he should get an Oscar nomination. Also giving a good performance in 'The Patriot' is Australian newcomer Heath Ledger (who starred in last year's '10 Things I Hate About You') as Gibson's oldest son Gabriel, who joins his father in action. The other roles in the film are good, but the performances by Gibson and Ledger are the ones people will be talking about. The film also works on a technical level. The action scenes are brutal as you would expect from a war film, but very well done. The beautiful look of the film is also a plus. And there are some comic moments thrown in for good measure. I only had one minor complaint with 'The Patriot' and that it's overlong. The movie runs 2 hours and 40 minutes, and it drags a little here and there. If it had been 20 or 30 minutes shorter, it would have been better. But other than that, 'The Patriot' is for the most part a terrific war film, and far, far, far, far, far, far, far, far, far, far better than Al Pacino's 1985 disaster 'Revolution' which was also about the Revolutionary War. ***1/2 (out of four)",9,2,3,9 July 2000
Aliens," One of the best sequels ever made
","'Aliens' is the follow-up to the 1979 sci-fi/horror film 'Alien'. I think 'Aliens' is easily the best movie in the 'Alien' series, and its one of the best sequels ever made. I thought 'Alien' was a little slow at times (especially in the first half) which kept it from being a great film. 'Aliens' starts off slow too, but I was into this film right from its opening frame. Sigourney Weaver reprises her role as Ripley, the sole survivor from 'Alien'. Ripley returns to the planet where those yukky creatures are hiding out, and she, along with a group of Marine soldiers, plan to wipe them out. While on the planet they find a little girl who has been hiding out herself amongst the aliens. When the aliens come into the picture, it's all action, and special effects. The creatures are scary as hell just like in the first film, and the movie goes over the top to be gross and disgusting at times. The action and special effects (which won a well-deserved Oscar) are outstanding, and the performance by Weaver (who received her first Oscar nomination here) is powerfully spectacular. Director James Cameron knows how to make great special effects pictures, and 'Aliens' is up there as one of the best. **** (out of four)",10,0,0,10 July 2000
The Fast and the Furious," An unexpected surprise
","'The Fast and the Furious' is a movie that surprised me big time because I didn't think I would like it. It didn't look all that great when I saw the previews of it, and I was dreading that I would have a miserable time watching it when some friends talked me into seeing the film with them. By the end of it, I was incredibly surprised at how much I liked this movie. It's not one of the best movies ever made, but it kept me interested from start to finish. 'The Fast and the Furious' is about drag racing in L.A., and focuses on a young undercover cop who falls into a group of professional drag racers who just might be the same ones who've been participating in a series of truck hijackings. The young cop tries to get to the bottom of this by becoming close friends with the leader of this group. Here for once is a movie that features car races and chases with the use of real cars, not special effects. It's at its best when the action takes place behind the wheel, and these scenes keep you on the edge. Plus, it has a story that works because it's interesting. Paul Walker (as the cop) and Vin Diesel (as the group leader) are given good material to work with, and both actors play their characters well. You get to know these two guys, and you can't help but wonder what's going to happen to them in the end. That makes 'The Fast and the Furious' an even better film. Good acting, good story, and good action make this film a surprise winner.*** (out of four)",8,3,7,29 July 2001
The Exorcist," The greatest horror film ever made
","I never got a chance to see 'The Exorcist' when it first came out in 1973. But how could I. I was only 2 years old when the film first hit theaters and broke box office records. The first time I saw this movie was on cable about 10 years after its release and I found it to be one of the most terrifying movies that I've ever seen. I have seen it more times on video and I even went out and bought a copy of the film. 'The Exorcist' is one of my favorite movies of all time, and a couple of years ago I made a wish that someday the movie would get rereleased back in theaters so that I could go see it on the big screen. Well, my wish came true on September 22, 2000. This was the date that 'The Exorcist' returned to theaters. However this time the movie is being called in the ads 'The Version You've Never Seen'. The new additions to this version of 'The Exorcist' include 11 minutes of restored footage not seen in the original 1973 version, and new digitally restored sound and music. And the result, the movie is better than ever. 'The Exorcist' is without a doubt the best horror movie ever made. This movie is so powerful that I still keep thinking about it. But what makes the movie so memorable now is the experience of seeing it on the big screen in a packed movie theater. Yes, the theater I saw it in was filled. 'The Exorcist' will be adding several million dollars to its already $165 million gross and deservedly so. What is 'The Exorcist' about? I'm sure everybody knows this question by now. It's about a movie actress who goes through an absolute nightmare when her 12-year-old daughter becomes possessed by the Devil, and two priests who attempt to drive the demon out of the poor girl. Since I'm sure everybody knows what happens during the course of this film, I won't say anymore. But I'll comment on the new additions to the film. I don't think the new footage hurts the film at all. The much talked about 'spiderwalk' scene is especially creepy and to me was quite shocking. It reminded me of the first time I saw 'The Exorcist' and all the shocks and scares it gave me upon seeing it with all of its disturbing images. The sound effects have been upped a notch, and it's very effective. Plus, the additional music gives the movie more tension. I very much welcome the new additions to 'The Exorcist'. As for everything else in the movie, it's perfect. The performances by Ellen Burstyn as the actress Chris MacNeil, Linda Blair as her possessed daughter Regan, Jason Miller as the troubled Father Karras, Max Von Sydow as Father Merrin (the exorcist), Kitty Winn as Chris' secretary Sharon, Lee J. Cobb as Lt. Kinderman, and Jack McGowran as Burke (the ill-fated director of Chris' movie) give brilliant, outstanding performances. I've rarely seen a horror film with so many good roles. This is thanks in part to William Friedkin's direction and William Peter Blatty's Oscar-winning screenplay (based on his novel). WHAT A JOB! All the technical aspects of the film are splendid. From the excellent cinematography to the fast-paced editing to the eerie music score to the scary sound effects to the freaky special effects, everything about this movie is great. 'The Exorcist' is literally one scary ride of a motion picture that still has the power to frighten the hell out of us. A masterpiece of terror that's brilliantly told.**** (out of four)",10,1,2,23 September 2000
Pearl Harbor," Not as good as I expected
","'Pearl Harbor' comes off like 'Titanic' meets 'Tora! Tora! Tora!'. It's a three hour epic that has shades of those two movies, and in the end I was kind of disappointed. This film should have been better than it turned out to be. The big problem with this film is the director, Michael Bay. Bay directed this film pretty much the same way he directed his last film 'Armageddon', sloppy and inconsistent. With the exception of the Pearl Harbor attack sequence which is excellently done, most of the scenes before that attack come off as corny and ridiculous. And the love triangle between Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, and Kate Beckinsale doesn't even stand up to the love story between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in 'Titanic'. However, the big scene when Pearl Harbor comes under attack is a tour-de-force sequence. The special effects are superb and horrifying. But just think at how much better this film could have been. If Steven Spielberg or James Cameron had directed this, 'Pearl Harbor' would have been a much better film. Spielberg and Cameron are directing geniuses compared to Bay, who foolishly tries to integrate comic relief in the first part of the film which comes off ineptly silly. But he's got the special effects in the right place. So all-in-all, I was kind of disappointed with 'Pearl Harbor', the film that was predicted to be the biggest hit of summer 2001, but ended up being a slight box office disappointment (at the time of this review the movies' gross was at $197 million, still below $200 million). It's not an awful film, but it could have been better.**1/2 (out of four)",7,3,4,7 October 2001
Die Hard 2," Almost as good as the original
","'Die Hard 2' is the excellent first sequel to my all-time favorite action film 'Die Hard'. This one doesn't quite top the original film but it comes very close. A few predictable moments keeps this from topping the first film. But hey, why quarrel? Bruce Willis returns as John McClane, now part of the L.A.P.D. instead of the N.Y.P.D. as he was in the first film. As the movie opens McClane is at Dulles International Airport in Washington D.C. waiting for his wife's plane to land. But he soon finds out that a terrorist plot is developing. Before you know it, he's right. The terrorists (through unusual circumstances) take over the airport in different fashion as these bad guys try to free the world's biggest drug dealer who's on his way to the nation's capital. Willis is in fine form here as are the action scenes. Giving 'Die Hard 2' a new setting, a somewhat different plot, and new characters is a major plus. Some of the other characters from the original are back: Bonnie Bedelia as Holly, McClane's wife, who spends almost the entire movie on an airplane; Reginald VelJohnson (briefly) as Powell, the L.A.P.D. cop who helped McClane in the first film; and William Atherton as Thornberg, the sleazy TV reporter who just happens to be on the same plane as Mrs. McClane. New characters this time around include William Sadler as Col. Stuart, the lead terrorist; John Amos as Grant, the hard-headed commander of an army's anti-terrorist squad that takes on Stuart and his men; Franco Nero as Esperanza, the drug lord; Dennis Franz in a stupidly hilarious performance as the incompetent airport police chief (to match the incompetent police chief of the first film); Sheila McCarthy as a local TV reporter; and Fred Dalton Thompson as the man in charge of the airport tower. 'Die Hard 2' is exciting, funny, and very entertaining. An exceptional sequel.***1/2 (out of four)",9,3,7,18 October 2000
Gone with the Wind," Great classic
",There isn't much I need to say about 'Gone with the Wind'. This nearly four hour film adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's novel (set during the Civil War) is one of the greatest movies ever made.

Remember the Titans," Feel good movie from Disney
","'Remember the Titans' is a movie that by the end of seeing it makes you feel good. And why shouldn't it? You would figure that it'll be a nice little picture since it comes from the Walt Disney Company, and I think it's perfect for the whole family. 'Remember the Titans' is a comedy-drama based on the true story of a high school in Virginia that is integrated with white and black students, white and black teachers, and white and black athletic coaches. Oscar winner Denzel Washington gives another one of his fine performances as the new head coach of the high school football team, and Will Patton is equally good as the current head coach who is now demoted to assistant coach under Washington. Together they try to get their players of both races to get along and put on a winning team. In addition to Washington and Patton, there are some other terrific performances by the young actors who portray the football players. I see some future stars here. The movie has plenty of dramatic moments with some delightful comedy thrown in the middle of it. It obviously gets a little predictable towards the end which keeps 'Remember the Titans' from being a perfect movie. But so what? This is a sports movie and usually sports movies almost always ends with 'the big game'. Who's going to win that big game? I won't say who wins the big game in 'Remember the Titans', but in the end you'll be rooting for the Titans to win, win, win! And that's all that matters. Bottom line: 'Remember the Titans' is an excellent film, very well made and very well acted by everyone involved.***1/2 (out of four)",9,61,81,1 October 2000
Liar Liar," The best comedy of 1997!
","'Liar, Liar' was easily the best comedy of 1997. When I saw this when it first came out in theaters I was literally laughing my head off. Jim Carrey gives the best comic performance of his career here as Fletcher Reede, a fast-talking lawyer who's always lying. His son Max doesn't like this one bit. Fletcher promises Max that he'll be at his 5th birthday party. But Fletcher calls and tells his ex-wife Audrey that he can't make it because at the moment he's being seduced by a female partner. Max has had enough. His birthday wish: for one day his father can't tell a lie. And it miraculously comes true! And this is where the movie gets explosively funny. This is the beginning of a long and crazy day for Fletcher. He gets in trouble left and right. Everyone around him thinks he's going crazy. And the habitual liar continuously makes a complete fool of himself. Carrey is the whole show here in what has got to be the craziest, nuttiest, silliest, goofiest, and downright best comic performance of his career. And he's got a terrific cast of actors to support him. Maura Tierney and Justin Cooper shine in the main supporting roles as Audrey and Max, respectably. Swoosie Kurtz, Jennifer Tilly, Amanda Donohoe, Anne Haney, Cary Elwes, Mitchell Ryan, and the late Jason Bernard also generate laughs amongst the craziness. 'Liar, Liar' is one extremely funny comedy directed by Tom Shadyac who directed another crazy comedy, the aptly titled remake 'The Nutty Professor'. 'Liar, Liar' has lots of big laughs and I enjoyed it alot. One of the best comedies of all-time.**** (out of four)",10,22,26,5 December 2000
Saving Private Ryan," Brilliant war epic
","Five years after 'Schindler's List', director Steven Spielberg delivered another powerful motion picture drama, 'Saving Private Ryan'. This movie (set during WWII) tells the story of a group of soldiers (led by Army captain Tom Hanks) who go into France to find a private who's three brothers were killed in action, and send him home. The opening 30 minute D-Day sequence is one of the most harrowing movie scenes ever filmed. The story is exceptional, the directing is brilliant, and the acting is excellent. Tom Hanks is terrific as usual, and is supported by an outstanding cast which includes Matt Damon ('Good Will Hunting'), Tom Sizemore ('Black Hawk Down'), Edward Burns ('She's the One'), Vin Diesel ('The Fast and the Furious'), Adam Goldberg ('A Beautiful Mind'), Jeremy Davies ('Twister'), Barry Pepper ('61*'), Giovanni Ribisi ('subUrbia'), and Ryan Hurst ('Remember the Titans'). Some of these actors have gone on to bigger things since this movie but they're all good here. Popular TV star Ted Danson (TV's 'Cheers' and 'Becker') and veteran character actor Dennis Farina ('Midnight Run' and 'Get Shorty') even turn up in cameos. 'Saving Private Ryan' should have won the Best Picture Oscar for 1998 because it's a war movie that's harrowing and powerful. It did go on to win 5 Oscars including Spielberg's Best Director win. It's one of the best war movies ever made.**** (out of four)",10,1,2,27 January 2002
1941," Spielberg's worst
","'1941' was Steven Spielberg's first comedic film. It's also the Oscar-winning director's first really bad movie, and today it still stands as his worst film. Although I didn't hate '1941' as much as most people, I still don't think this is a very good movie. I always ask myself 'Steven Spielberg made this?' It's hard to believe that he made this film. '1941' is a slapstick comedy of inept proportions that takes place at the time Pearl Harbor was attacked by the Japanese on Dec. 7, 1941. A big all-star cast is featured here (Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi are two of the big stars, appearing in this right before 'The Blues Brothers') and are all pretty much wasted. The action scenes and special effects are this film's only virtue. That should come as no surprise since Spielberg is an expert at action and special effects pictures. But his attempt at comedy falls flat on its face. The comedy here is just too clumsy for it to all work. '1941' isn't awful, just not good. I'd love to know what Spielberg was thinking of when he made this. ** (out of four)",4,5,11,27 January 2002
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Exciting sequel
","A lot of people may not have liked 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park', but I'm not one of them. This is Steven Spielberg's very exciting sequel to his 1993 box office smash. It doesn't quite top the original, but it comes close. 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' is a much darker adventure. This time the action takes place on a different island 80 miles from where the first movie took place. Dinosaurs are roaming around and about on this island with no electric fences to block their way like on Jurassic Park. Jeff Goldblum returns as Dr. Ian Malcolm, who goes to this place when he finds out from Dr. John Hammon (Sir Richard Attenborough) that his girlfriend Dr. Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) is already there. Once Dr. Malcolm gets there, along with a photographer (Vince Vaughn), a field equipment expert (Richard Schiff), and his daughter (Vanessa Lee Chester), he reunites with his woman and tries to warn her of the dangers that lurk around. Then more trouble comes. A second expedition steps foot on the island and what they plan to do is take the dinosaurs off the island to a theme park on the U.S. mainland. Things don't go as planned for either expedition when the dinosaurs begin to wreck havoc. The special effects are just as impressive as they were in the first film, with some new dinosaurs that weren't featured in 'Jurassic Park'. The sound effects are loud and scary as you would expect. But then again you would expect 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' to be a triumph in the technical departments. If there is one weakness here its with the human characters. The characters are a bit weaker than the characters from the first movie. The cast here is a good one though not as good as the cast in the original. One might expect Sam Neill or Laura Dern to drop in. Nevertheless, 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' is a lot of fun, and I enjoyed my time with it. ***1/2 (out of four)",9,29,52,7 June 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Beautifully made foreign film
","'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is a movie that I had been hearing about for months. It's turning up on almost every film critics' 10 best lists all over the world, with just about every one of them saying how beautifully made and well done it is. I was hesitant about seeing it because it's a Chinese-Taiwanese film spoken in Mandarin language with English subtitles. I've never seen a foreign language film in my life (not in it's entirety), but I've heard so much about it, I decided to take a chance and see it. I'm glad I did. 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is a breathtaking moviegoing experience that I'll never forget. One of the main reasons why I wanted to see this movie is because I'm a big fan of Michelle Yeoh. After seeing her in the James Bond movie 'Tomorrow Never Dies' I've become fascinated by her presence. I watched her in some of her earlier work in martial arts movies (I saw the dubbed versions of those films) and she's something else. She's remarkable in this movie, as well as the great Chow Yun-Fat, and the real scene stealer in 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, newcomer Zhang Ziyi. These actors literally kick butt in this movie. The martial arts sequences are incredible, the cinematography is beautiful, and the story captavating. This was a one-time moviegoing experience for me. I don't think a foreign language film can top this one. I'd like to see this film dubbed into English and see how it plays without the subtitles. But as it plays now (with subtitles), 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is a wonderful film. Congratulations to director Ang Lee ('Sense and Sensibility') for putting together a truly awesome experience. One word of warning: I really wouldn't recommend this movie for kids. In the theater were I saw it, there were (to my astonishing surprise) alot of kids present. After the movie ended I overheard one young boy saying 'oh this movie was so stupid.' Another said 'I didn't understand that movie.' I believe they thought they were seeing something out of the Power Rangers school of filmmaking because that show and the movies feature lots of martial arts and many kids like martial arts. Let's get one thing straight here: 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is more adult oriented. I'm not sure if most kids will understand it. It took me a while in getting used to the English subtitles, but some kids may not. If kids want to see this movie, I would recommend their parents in telling them that it's a foreign film and that it's not like Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. This is a whole different experience. Plus, it's not as cheesy as the Power Rangers. It's really well made.**** (out of four)",10,0,0,4 February 2001
Schindler's List," Spielberg's best
","Steven Spielberg have made movie masterpieces left and right. His movie classics include 'E.T.', 'Jaws', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'Close Encounter's of the Third Kind', 'Jurassic Park', 'Saving Private Ryan', and 'The Color Purple'. I love all of those films. However, 'Schindler's List' is his #1 masterpiece. The movie that would finally win him the Best Director Oscar after losing and being snubbed by the Academy for years, 'Schindler's List' takes place during the Holocaust and tells the story of Oscar Schindler, the real-life German war profiteer who saved the lives of more than 1,000 Polish Jews. This is one of the most powerful movies ever made, lasting over 3 hours long and shot in beautiful black-and-white. Winner of 7 Academy Awards (including Best Picture), 'Schindler's List' features spectacular performances by Liam Neeson as Oscar Schindler, Ben Kingsley as Schindler's Jewish accountant, and Ralph Fiennes in one of the scariest movie performances of all time as an evil Nazi commandant. A harrowing, powerful film that will live on forever, 'Schindler's List' is an outstanding movie that I'll never forget.**** (out of four)",10,9,13,27 January 2002
Driven," One of Sly's better ones
","'Driven' reteams Sylvester Stallone with director Renny Harlin since their excellent 1993 action flick 'Cliffhanger'. Even though 'Driven' can't quite top the tandem's earlier effort, it's still a pretty good movie. Plus, I give them credit for trying something a little different. Instead of an R-rated romp filled with violence, blood, and gruesome deaths (which Stallone and Harlin are noted for), they've made a PG-13 picture with none of those aspects. The action and special effects are still intact, though they're different this time out. 'Driven' centers on two race car drivers: one who's the current champ (Til Schweiger), and the other who's a rookie phenom (Kip Pardue). Burt Reynolds is on hand as a team owner who's representing the rookie. Then the kid starts to have a few bad outings, and that's when Reynolds asks Stallone (as a former race car champ) to come on and help the kid out. 'Driven' does have it's flaws. Parts of the movie tend to go over-the-top, and is marred by some stupid supporting characters (especially Reynolds, who's O.K. here; but I'm just getting a little sick and tired of a certain character who will go to any lengths to win at all costs). The screenplay, by Stallone (writing solo for the first time since 'Rocky V') isn't great, but it's better than most of Stallone's scripts to some of his earlier movies. Still, I liked most of what I saw in 'Driven'. The race car scenes deliver punch and are exciting (thanks to good directing by Harlin). Stallone gives a good performance too. This is one of his better efforts, and he hasn't made too many good movies in the last 10 years or so. Another very good performance is turned in by young Pardue, as the rookie. I remember first seeing him in last year's Disney hit 'Remember the Titans'. He played 'Sunshine' the quarterback, and was excellent in that film. He's got a bigger role here in 'Driven', and plays his part exceptionally well. I believe we'll be seeing alot of this actor in years to come. 'Driven' is no masterpiece to be sure, but it'll do for now. As far as Stallone's sports movies go, it's not as good as the original 'Rocky', but it sure is far better than his awful 1987 arm wrestling flop 'Over The Top'. I'll take 'Driven' over that one any day.*** (out of four)",8,1,2,29 April 2001
Ghostbusters," Who you gonna call?
","I was 13 years old when my older sister took me to the theater to see 'Ghostbusters' back in June 1984. I had just gotten out of school for summer vacation and we went an saw a movie that had us laughing our heads off. This movie has lost a little of its comic edge a decade-and-a-half later, but today its still a very funny special effects comedy. The Ghostbusters about a trio of paranormal scientists who go into business catching ghosts when they discover supernatural phenomenon plaguing New York City. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis are hilarious as the Ghostbusters, who spend lots of time flushing out spirits while making wise-cracks in between. Sigourney Weaver also stars in her first comedy as the Ghostbusters' first client, a musician who one day finds nasty spirits in her apartment and in the process falls in love with nutty Murray. Rick Moranis has some delightful comic moments as Weaver's nerdy neighbor, and Annie Potts (from TV's 'Designing Women') is good too as the Ghostbusters' receptionist. Everybody is terrific in 'Ghostbusters' with the exception of William Atherton as the villain who doesn't like the trio he refers to as 'snowball artists'. But the best performance comes from Bill Murray as Dr. Peter Venkman. This is one of his best film roles of his career. He's naturally funny every time he's on screen. One other major asset in 'Ghostbusters' are the special visual effects by Richard Edlund, the maestro who worked on the 'Star Wars' trilogy, the first two 'Poltergeist' films, and the first Indiana Jones movie 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. The effects in this movie help to make it not only funny but exciting too. This film should have won the Oscar for visual effects because there were far more special effects shots here then there was in 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom', the movie that beat out 'Ghostbusters' for the visual effects Oscar for 1984. Also, I love the title song by Ray Parker Jr. (which also was Oscar nominated). The song was a smash hit on the radio during the summer of 1984 just as the movie was a smash hit in theaters. 'Ghostbusters' helped to make the summer of 1984 memorable. If you can remember back then, this was the summer 'Ghostbusters', 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom', 'Gremlins', and 'The Karate Kid' dominated the box office. It also was the summer the PG-13 rating was created (thanks to the violence in 'Temple of Doom' and 'Gremlins', PG rated movies). And it also was the summer the Summer Olympics were held in Los Angeles and the U.S. Team dominated big time. The summer vacation of 1984 for me was absolutely one of my favorite summers of my life when I was a kid, and 'Ghostbusters' was a big part of it. Even though I didn't laugh quite as hard at it after seeing it again recently, it's still a very funny movie. ***1/2 (out of four)",9,0,0,16 December 2000
Mission: Impossible II," Much better than the first
","I was not a big fan of the first 'Mission: Impossible' movie from 1996. Even though it had its share of good action and special effects sequences, the movie was bogged down by a confusing plot. Also, it dragged slowly at times. However, you won't see that in 'Mission: Impossible II', which is a vast improvement over part 1. Thank goodness. Just about everything in 'MI2' is better than in 'MI1'. The action. The special effects. The locations. Tom Cruise is also much better here than he was in the first film. And it has better supporting characters this time out. Director John Woo is obviously a far better director at directing action movies than 'MI1's' Brian De Palma. 'MI2' is much faster paced, exciting, and exhilirating. This will be a blockbuster. I hope it outgrosses the first film.***1/2 (out of four)",9,0,2,30 May 2000
Black Hawk Down," The best movie of 2001!
","Here's the movie that I'll be rooting for at Oscar time (that's only if it gets a Best Picture nomination which it should). 'Black Hawk Down' is my choice for the #1 film of 2001. This may be the best war movie that I've ever seen. There have been great war movies made in the past like 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Platoon', but 'Black Hawk Down' got to me like no other war movie ever made. Maybe the fact that our country is at war right now made me think about our U.S. soldiers and the fight that were in because of the horrible September 11 tragedy. So you can see that this is an important film to see right now. 'Black Hawk Down' is a powerful motion picture about the true story of a U.S. military raid that went disastrously wrong in Somalia in 1993. Director Ridley Scott shows us the horrors of being in a war and how bloody it can get. It's heartbreaking. 'Black Hawk Down' has an impressive cast of actors playing the soldiers. Josh Hartnett comes off much better here than he did in 'Pearl Harbor' as the leader of a squad which includes Ewan McGregor ('Moulin Rouge'), Tom Sizemore ('Saving Private Ryan'), and William Fichtner ('The Perfect Storm'). Sam Shepard also stars as the major who gives order to the soldiers. 'Black Hawk Down' has plenty of action but this movie is not about action. It's about war and the soldiers who fight in it. This is Ridley Scott's best film to date. It's better than his Oscar winner from 2000, 'Gladiator'. Though he didn't win the Best Director Oscar for that film (which went to Steven Soderbergh for 'Traffic'), if nominated for Best Director this year, Scott would be my personal choice for the Best Director Oscar for 'Black Hawk Down', because he did an outstanding job on this film. However, that will be tough to come by (Ron Howard of 'A Beautiful Mind' and Robert Altman of 'Gosford Park' are currently the front-runners for the Best Director Oscar). Scott produced the film with Jerry Bruckheimer, and what an amazing turnaround for the long-time producer after the disappointing 'Pearl Harbor'. Remember in my review of that film, I complained that the film was ruined by the directing job of Michael Bay. I had said that Steven Spielberg or James Cameron would have done a better job if one of those guys had directed that movie. Ridley Scott is another one. He could have made that film better too, and his direction on 'Black Hawk Down' is proof of that. Bruckheimer redeemed himself by choosing Scott to direct this film and he did himself some good in that department. Good job by all. 'Black Hawk Down' is a great movie that's powerful and emotional. It's my favorite movie of 2001.**** (out of four)",10,0,0,27 January 2002
Total Recall," One of the best sci-fi movies ever made
","'Total Recall' is one of my all-time favorite science fiction movies. It has everything: action, humor, good performances by its cast, and spectacular special effects. Arnold Schwarzenegger stars in one of his best films as a man who finds out that something's not right. He's a construction worker named Quaid, who lives on Earth and keeps having dreams about the planet Mars. He goes to a place called Rekall, where the doctors there implant their clients with memories of the most unusual but exciting sort. Quaid wants to have memories implanted that have to do with Mars. But just as he's about to take his trip, he goes berserk, and finds out that he's a victim of mind-tampering. A couple of sociopathic killers under orders from the dictator of Mars try to do him in. Quaid escapes, however, and travels to Mars to confront the evil Martian dictator as well as his hencemen. 'Total Recall' is one amazing thrill ride that is spectacular to look at. The special effects are incredibly awesome. The movie deservedly won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects as a special achievement award, but I would have let it compete in the category with two other movies. If it had, I think 'Total Recall' would have still won the Oscar. Schwarzenegger is terrific in one of his best roles; Ronny Cox and Michael Ironside are effective as the main bad guys (the dictator of Mars and his right-hand man); Rachel Ticotin and Sharon Stone are fetching as the women of Quaid's life (one good, the other bad). Director Paul Verhoeven knows how to direct great action, and he also knows how to work with great special effects teams. He's done a good job with sci-fi material as he has proven with two other science fiction movies that were very good: 'RoboCop' and 'Starship Troopers'. 'Total Recall' is an outstanding science fiction movie. If you like great action and great special effects along with good performances, this is a must-see.**** (out of four)",10,0,1,21 October 2000
Titanic," A masterpiece
","James Cameron's 'Titanic' is a masterpiece. This is a brilliant film from start to finish. It's exciting, romantic, and never boring. I'm usually not a fan of movies that run over 3 hours long, but this is arguably my favorite 3 hour plus movie because it goes by fast. A year before this movie came out, CBS aired their two-part movie based on the 1912 sinking of the ship that was dubbed 'unsinkable'. It was O.K., but the 1997 theatrical film made the TV version look real flat by comparison. I've always had a fascination with the Titanic disaster, and this movie presents its depiction of the doomed ship in a frightening way. When I saw this movie the first time, at times I felt like I was on the Titanic. It's that good. Splendid acting, remarkable special effects, and masterful storytelling, this is a movie that I'll never forget.**** (out of four)",10,2,6,5 April 2000
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Magical masterpiece
","Here is the magical surprise of 2001. 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is the best movie that I've seen all year (so far). This I totally did not expect. This is a film that works not only on the level of special effects. It has a terrific story, wonderful characters, and a beautiful atmosphere. This was quite refreshing since so many of the movies today that feature special effects are weak on story and characterization. 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is the first movie in what is going to be a big movie series based on 'Harry Potter' novels written by J.K. Rowling. So far four novels have been written with three more on the way. This movie has created so much hype that the second movie is already in the works. I think this is going to be a blockbuster franchise. The movie opens with the title character living with relatives that are cruel and heartless. Then Harry gets a letter from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and learns that he's a wizard. So he gets away from his despicable uncle, aunt, and cousin, and journeys to this special school to learn the tricks of his trade. Along the way he meets two young aspiring magicians who will become his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. He also makes an enemy in Draco Malfoy, who is kind of like the evil version of Harry. The faculty of Hogwarts include wise headmaster Albus Dumbledore; huge groundskeeper Hagrid; Prof. McGonagall, who can transform into a cat and back to human form in a flash; Prof. Snape, who's sinister looks create fear in the students; Prof. Hooch, the broomstick instructor; and Prof. Quirrell, who wears what looks like a turban all the time and studders alot. There are alot of visual elements that work wonderfully in 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'. My favorite scene is the one where the students play the game of Quidditch. That is a fascinating special effects sequence that is kind of hard to describe but is fulfilling to watch. It kind of reminded me of the pod race in 'Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace' with its effects going across the screen at a rapid pace. Another great scene in the movie is the one where the three kids play an unusual high stakes game of chess, where the huge game pieces come to life. 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' works on every level. In addition to the excellent special effects, it works on the direction and screenplay. The director here is Chris Columbus, who's worked in this territory before as the director of the popular kids- oriented 1990 comedy 'Home Alone' and its first sequel, 1992's 'Home Alone 2: Lost in New York'. He worked with kids again in the little more adult oriented 1993 Robin Williams blockbuster 'Mrs. Doubtfire'. These three hit movies directed by Columbus were more lighthearted in its tone, but Columbus has been in more darker territory before. His directorial debut came with 'Adventures in Babysitting', the black comedy from 1987 that was filmed in Chicago and starred Elisabeth Shue. Before stepping into the director's chair, Columbus wrote a couple of screenplay's for a trio of Steven Spielberg productions: 'Gremlins', 'The Goonies', and 'Young Sherlock Holmes'. 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' bares a resemblance to each one of those movies in some way. Those virtuoso special effects scenes when those big chess pieces comes to life was very much like some of the special effects scenes in 'Young Sherlock Holmes'. This movie is like an 'Indiana Jones' for kids; so was 'The Goonies'. This movie is scary and darker in tone; so was 'Gremlins'. Though unlike 'Gremlins', 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' isn't violent. It's scary, but not over-the-line scary. Columbus was a good choice as director of this movie (Steven Spielberg had a chance to direct this, but passed on it to make 'A.I.'), and it's his best film as director to date. He's brought this movie to life in exhilarating fashion. The screenplay is by Oscar nominee Steve Kloves ('Wonder Boys'), who did a superb job in adapting the movie from the book. The cinematography, editing, production design, and costume design are all first-rate and deserve Oscar attention, along with the visual effects. The performances are picture perfect. The three kids who play Harry, Ron, and Hermione are all acting newcomers and they were all perfect choices to play these characters. I think we'll be seeing alot of Daniel Radcliffe in the future. Radcliffe portrays Harry Potter to absolute perfection. He holds the movie together in every scene, and was a natural choice to play this character. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are very exceptional as Ron and Hermione. Like Radcliffe, we'll be seeing alot of Grint and Watson for years to come. They're all terrific young British actors (and they've all been signed on to star in the next 'Harry Potter' movie). You couldn't have asked for a better supporting cast than the one that's featured in this movie, all a who's who of veteran British actors. Richard Harris (as headmaster Dumbledore), Maggie Smith (Prof. McGonagall), Alan Rickman (Prof. Snape), Robbie Coltrane (groudskeeper Hagrid), Zoe Wanamaker (Prof. Hooch), and Ian Hart (Prof. Quirrell) are all perfectly cast; with John Cleese, Warwick Davis, Richard Griffiths, John Hurt, Fiona Shaw, and Julie Walters featured in smaller roles. What a cast! I loved everything about 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'. This is not just a movie for kids, but for the whole family. I've never read any of the 'Harry Potter' books, but on the basis of this first 'Harry Potter' movie, I think I'm going to go out and purchase the books. Or maybe ask to receive them as a Christmas gift. Speaking of Christmas, I think 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' will be the smash hit of the Christmas season 2001. If it doesn't surpass last year's Christmas hit, 'Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas' (which opened at exactly the same time a year ago), then the American moviegoing public has completely lost it. 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' has gotten far better reviews that 'The Grinch' movie did last year, and critically acclaimed movies deserve to be blockbuster hits alot more than critically hated movies like 'The Grinch'. From what I saw this weekend (a packed moviehouse and an opening day gross of $29.5 million), 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' will be a blockbuster smash. BET ON IT!!!!!**** (out of four)",10,0,0,18 November 2001
A Beautiful Mind," A Beautiful Film
","After critics' came down hard on his last film ('How the Grinch Stole Christmas'), director Ron Howard comes back with a bang with 'A Beautiful Mind'. Academy voters out there reading this review, listen up! You unfairly snubbed Howard of a Best Director Oscar nomination 6 years ago for his brilliant 'Apollo 13', and if you decide to snub him of a Best Director nomination this year for 'A Beautiful Mind', you will be sorry. Howard should be nominated for his directing job on this film because he did a great job. Let me say that again. A GREAT JOB! The film should also get a nod for Best Picture too. It's one of the very best movies of 2001. 'A Beautiful Mind' tells the true story of John Forbes Nash Jr., a man who is one of the world's greatest mathematicians, and a victim of schizophrenia. From undergraduate days at Princeton to his winning of the Nobel Prize, we follow Nash on a journey that takes him into the far reaches of mathematical discovery, and into a bewildering labyrinth of hallucinations and madness. Russell Crowe brilliantly portrays Nash in what I think is the best performance of his career. He's sure to win another Oscar nomination this year (we'll see if he can duplicate what Tom Hanks did several years ago and that is win back-to-back Best Actor Oscars; Crowe has a very good chance of doing that). A great supporting performance is turned in by Jennifer Connelly as Nash's wife Alicia; she'll get a Best Supporting Actress nomination. These two key performances by Crowe and Connelly make 'A Beautiful Mind' the great film it is thanks primarily to Howard's direction and Akiva Goldsmith's wonderful screenplay (based on Sylvia Nasar's book). 'A Beautiful Mind' might give 'Lord of the Rings' a run for the Oscars come this March. It's a great movie. **** (out of four)",10,0,2,21 January 2002
Die Hard," This one can't be topped!!!
","'Die Hard' is the best action film I've ever seen. It's a spectacularly exciting, thrilling, and exhilarating adventure that I don't think can be topped as far as action pictures go. Bruce Willis' movie career took off with this film, which I think is his best yet. Willis is John McClane, a New York cop who comes to Los Angeles at Christmastime to be with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia). Shortly after arriving in L.A. he goes to Holly's place of employment, a high rise building in the Nakatomi Plaza where a big Christmas party is taking place. Minutes after he gets there and greets his wife, a dozen terrorists (most of whom are German) take control of the building, crash the party, and hold all the party guests hostage. But our good friend Mr. McClane manages to escape from the bad guys. He proceeds to hide out on several of the floors in the building. Then he decides to take matters into his own hands, and face off against the villains all by himself. 'Die Hard' is one thrill ride of a movie that you won't want to miss. Willis is terrific as the good guy who does his best to try and save the day. British actor Alan Rickman is equally good in a standout performance as lead terrorist Hans Gruber, who Willis plays cat-and-mouse with. These two actors make 'Die Hard' click, and they're a pleasure to watch. There are other good performances turned in by Bedelia as the career-oriented Holly; Reginald VelJohnson as Sgt. Al Powell, the cop Willis communicates to through a walkie-talkie; and Alexander Godunov as Karl, Rickman's leading henceman. A couple of other supporting performances are ho-hum (especially the one by Paul Gleason as the incredibly stupid Chief of Police), but they're only a minor quarrel in the film. The #1 reason why 'Die Hard' works so well are, you guessed it, the action scenes and special effects. They're some of the best that I've ever seen. Seeing this movie on the big screen when I was a teenager was awesome. I hope that this movie will someday get re-released back in theaters because 'Die Hard' is most definitely a movie that should be seen on a big screen. If that happens, this movie's sound and sound effects would also get the digital treatment. 'Die Hard' is a great action flick from the slightly slow-paced beginning to the smashing fast-paced finale. This movie had my heart pounding and my jaws dropping the first time I saw it, especially during the spectacular climax. What a movie!!!**** (out of four)",10,0,1,14 October 2000
Psycho," Hitchcock's best
","'Psycho' is Alfred Hitchcock's best film. The Master of Suspense directed a lot of great films throughout his astonishing career such as 'North by Northwest', 'Vertigo', 'Rear Window', and 'The Birds'. But 'Psycho' is my all-time favorite Hitchcock movie. Everything about this movie is great in every way. From the splendid performances by the entire cast (especially Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh in their most famous roles) to Bernard Herrmann's eerie and famous music score to Hitchcock's use of unusual camera angles to the site of the Bates Motel and the creepy house that sits above it to the dark humor that is presented and to that unforgettable shower scene, 'Psycho' is a brilliant horror film that will live on for years to come. Now just forget about that stupid shot-by-shot remake from 1998. The original 1960 picture is definitely the one to see. **** (out of four)",10,5,9,17 June 2000
Scream 2," Very good horror sequel
","While its not as good as the original, 'Scream 2' is for the most part a very entertaining horror-comedy. Director Wes Craven, writer Kevin Williamson, and stars Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, and David Arquette came back for this sequel. This time Campbell's character Sidney Prescott is away at college when murders start happening again. Cox (as Gale Weathers) and Arquette (as Dewey) arrive at the campus to find out what's going on and to try to find the killer (since the cops are no good in these movies). 'Scream 2' isn't as good as the original because it's a little slow-moving at times which wasn't the case with the first film. Still, I was entertained for the most part, and the supporting cast of new actors do a good job. The only other actors to return from the original are Jamie Kennedy as nerdy Randy (the horror movie expert) and Liev Schreiber as Cotton Weary, the man Campbell had put in jail for the murder of her mother but found out at the end of the first movie that he was innocent (Schreiber's part in the first movie was very brief; here he has a major supporting role). New cast members include Sarah Michelle Gellar (TV's 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer'), Jerry O'Connell (TV's 'Sliders'), Jada Pinkett (Mrs. Will Smith), and Laurie Metcalf (TV's 'Roseanne'). 'Scream 2' is violent like the original and also like the first film has a sharp sense of humor. Worth a look.*** (out of four)",8,1,2,22 June 2000
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Very good second sequel
","'Die Hard With A Vengeance' is the third movie in the 'Die Hard' series. I found this to be the weakest movie in the series, but that doesn't make it a bad film. It's still a very good movie. I just like the first two films better. Bruce Willis returns for a third-go-around as John McClane, the tough cop who's always in trouble with something. In the first film he faced terrorists in a skyscraper in Los Angeles on Christmas Eve. In the second film he faced terrorists at an airport in snowy Washington D.C. approximately one year after his L.A. adventure. In the third film he's back in New York and back with the N.Y.P.D. Bombs have been setup all over the city by a German maniac named Simon. This bad guy (played by Jeremy Irons) just happens to be the brother of the lead terrorist from the original film, and tries to exact revenge against McClane by playing 'Simon Says'. Simon orders McClane, along with his new partner Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson), to go to certain areas of the city where bombs have been placed, and it's their job to disarm the bombs or try to prevent utter disaster. I didn't find 'Die Hard With A Vengeance' quite as spectacularly exciting as the previous two movies, but there is plenty of action which makes in very entertaining nevertheless. One thing that worked so well in the first two installments was the sense of humor. There's alot more of that in 'Die Hard With A Vengeance' which makes it the funniest film in the 'Die Hard' series. Willis is fine, but the real star here is Jackson, who's hilarious as Zeus. The heated exchanges between Willis and Jackson throughout are very funny. The action scenes are top-notch as you would expect. I would rank this as the best action movie series to date (yes, I like the 'Die Hard' movies better than the 'Lethal Weapon' pictures which are good too). If 'Die Hard With A Vengeance' was the final film in this series, at least the series went out a winner.*** (out of four)",8,1,2,20 October 2000
Jaws," Superb horror movie classic
","'Jaws' is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. Steven Spielberg's first blockbuster hit is a thrilling entertainment from beginning to end. Now 25 years old, this movie still has the power to shock you as it did when first released in 1975. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss give excellent performances in the first of four movies about a great white shark. Forget about the three sequels, none of them match the intensity and scariness of this the original. **** (out of four)",10,1,2,15 May 2000
The Waterboy," Hilarious
","'The Waterboy' was a big surprise for me. When I went to see this on the big screen with my best friend from Pennsylvania in November 1998, I didn't think it was going to be a laugh riot. As it turned out, it was. This movie had me laughing my head off. It had my buddy laughing his head off. It had everybody else in the theater laughing their heads off. It was a packed house when I first saw this, and the theater was exploding in laughter throughout. This happened when I went to see 'The Naked Gun' movies. I love to go see laugh riot comedies in a filled-up theater. It's a great movie going experience. Anyway, Adam Sandler stars as Bobby Boucher, a waterboy for college football teams who has an unusual gift when it comes down to playing the sport. Sandler is funny; Henry Winkler is funny as Sandler's coach; Fairuza Balk is funny as Sandler's girlfriend; but the real scene stealer in the movie is the great Oscar-winning actress Kathy Bates as Sandler's mama. Bates gives a side-splittingly funny performance in this movie. What Bates does to that man at the end of this movie is a classic comedy scene. So what if critics hated this. Sit back and have a great laugh.**** (out of four)",10,0,2,24 May 2000
The Cannonball Run," Wildly entertaining comedy
","'The Cannonball Run' is a wild and crazy ride of a comedy about an illegal cross-country auto race. This movie was the third time star Burt Reynolds teamed up with director Hal Needham. Before 'Cannonball Run' they made the first two 'Smokey and the Bandit' pictures, and afterwards they made 'Stroker Ace' and 'Cannonball Run II'. 'The Cannonball Run' and the original 'Smokey and the Bandit' are my favorites. Made back when Reynolds was hitting box office gold, 'The Cannonball Run' auto race begins in Connecticut and features the goofy all-star cast passing each other up until they get to their final destination, California. In addition to Burt Reynolds, the movie also stars Dom DeLuise as Reynolds partner, Roger Moore pretending to be himself, Farrah Fawcett as the woman Reynolds and DeLuise pick up at the beginning of the race, and two late great entertainers: Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. as two phony priests driving a red Ferrari. All are involved in the race, and its a wild ride all the way to the finish. Adrienne Barbeau, Jackie Chan, Jamie Farr, Mel Tillis, and former Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw also star. Great fun.*** (out of four)",8,24,31,10 April 2000
Scream," Frightfully witty
","'Scream' is an outstanding horror film with a sharp sense of humor. Director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson conjured up this very entertaining movie that pokes fun at the slasher movie genre. Neve Campbell's film career took off with her role here as Sidney Prescott, the young high school girl who's a target of the killer that does practically the same thing Michael Myers did in 'Halloween'. In the midst of all the gory murders, there's delightful bits of comedy. David Arquette  (Dewey) and Courtney Cox (Gale Weathers) provide alot of the humor, as do Matthew Lillard (Stu), Jamie Kennedy (Randy), and Rose McGowan (Tatum). Even Henry Winkler has a funny bit part as the principal. Williamson (his first screenplay) became such a hot item after the success of 'Scream', he followed this with 'I Know What You Did Last Summer', 'Scream 2', and 'The Faculty'. All these movies were either big or modest box office hits. And as for Wes Craven, this is probably his best film to date. I liked 'Scream' better than his earlier hit, the original 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' (which was good). Craven would eventually follow 'Scream' up with two sequels, but neither one could top the original. Still, a pretty good trilogy that starts with a bang with the first one. This one is the best.**** (out of four)",10,0,0,28 May 2000
Halloween," The best slasher film ever made
","Here is the ultimate slasher movie. 'Halloween' is argubly the best slasher picture ever made. It's also the scariest movie I've ever seen. This film sends chills down my spine every time I see it. John Carpenter's first big hit is about a troubled little boy named Michael Myers who kills his sister in a small Illinois town on Halloween night in 1963. 15 years later, he escapes the mental institution that he'd been staying at and returns home to pick up where he left off. Jamie Lee Curtis shot to stardom after this film, and she would become known as the 'scream queen'. She's terrific as Laurie Strode. Donald Pleasence is also effective as the doctor who treated the killer when he was in the insane asylum, and now tries to stop him before he starts killing again. Nancy Loomis and P.J. Soles provide most of the comic relief as Curtis' best friends. You get to know these characters and you hope they survive the nightmare. That's aspect makes the film even more effective. Also on the plus side: the camera work by cinematographer Dean Cundey is scary especially when the camera comes from the point of view of the killer (Cundey would go on to do the cinematography for big blockbuster hits such as 'Jurassic Park', 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit', and the 'Back to the Future' trilogy). This technique comes in the opening shot of the film, and it's very effective. The film score by Carpenter is one of the most chilling music scores I've ever heard for a motion picture. Even the mask that Michael Myers wears freaks me out. As far as the sequels go in this series, the second and seventh movies in the 'Halloween' series (which feature Jamie Lee) are good, the third (which had nothing to do with Michael Myers), fourth, fifth, and sixth movies (which do not feature Jamie Lee) are bad. But none of the six sequels top this one. This is a definite must-see for people who love horror movies. Don't miss it!**** (out of four)",10,0,2,6 June 2000
Carrie," Very good horror/drama
","'Carrie' is a movie that launched alot of careers. The movie is based on a novel written by a then unknown horror writer named Stephen King (I believe 'Carrie' was his first novel). Director Brian DePalma became famous for directing movies with a Hitchcock-style theme (he'd go on to direct 'Dressed to Kill', 'Blow Out', and 'Body Double'). Sissy Spacek, who plays the title role, received her first Best Actress Oscar nomination for her performance as an unpopular girl who's teased continuously by her classmates but then turns the tables on them by using her telekinetic powers as a source for revenge. John Travolta, Amy Irving, and Nancy Allen would go on to bigger projects (Travolta and Allen both teamed up with DePalma for 'Blow Out', and Allen also starred in 'Dressed to Kill'). And Piper Laurie returned to the big screen as Carrie's religious fanatic mother (she received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress). 'Carrie' is one of the better movies based on Stephen King material. It starts off as a strightforward drama, has a few darkly comic moments in between, and ends as a disturbing horror film. Celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, 'Carrie' is still effective, thanks in part to the good performances by the entire cast, good screenplay adaptation, and good direction. *** (out of four)",8,0,0,18 November 2001
The Silence of the Lambs," Brilliantly acted thriller
","Even though it's been 10 years since this film came out, 'The Silence of the Lambs' is a movie that I still can't believe won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1991. This is the kind of movie that Academy voters usually don't go for, and it was released in February of that year. Movies released very early in the year hardly ever win Oscar's top prize. But in another way I can see why this film went on the become the third movie in Oscar history to win the top 5 Oscars (the other two were 1934's 'It Happened One Night' and 1975's 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'). It's a very well made and brilliantly acted suspense-thriller. Jodie Foster has never been better in her second Best Actress Oscar-winning performance of her great career (following her first, 1988's 'The Accused') as Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee who goes to visit Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Best Actor Anthony Hopkins), a very smart man who has a nasty habit of eating human flesh (Yuck!). Starling hopes that Dr. Lecter can provide information for her and her FBI team in catching a serial killer who likes to skin his victims, and at the moment has kidnapped the daughter of a senator. 'The Silence of the Lambs' is a movie that is quite disturbing to watch at times. Some of the images are ugly and downright horrifying. But those two performances by Foster and Hopkins make this movie as good as it is. I couldn't take my eyes off of them everytime they were on screen. 'The Silence of the Lambs' certainly held my attention, and I would have to say of all the five movies nominated for Best Picture of 1991 (the other nominees were 'Beauty and the Beast', 'Bugsy', 'JFK', and 'The Prince of Tides'), this one is definitely the best.***1/2 (out of four)",9,1,2,24 February 2001
Space Jam," #23's feature film debut
","'Space Jam' marked the feature film debut of His Airness, Michael Jordan. I, being a Chicago native, have enjoyed watching #23 over the years as a member of the Chicago Bulls. Nobody played the game of basketball better than he did. And I thought he did a good job acting in 'Space Jam'. You have to admit, Jordan did a much better job acting in a major motion picture than Shaquille O'Neal did in 'Kazaam'. Here, Jordan's main co-stars are the Bugs Bunny characters. Also, you get cameo appearances from some of Jordan's friends which include Bill Murray, and former and present NBA stars. 'Space Jam' isn't a great film, but it's good, silly fun.

The Sixth Sense," Good thriller
","I've got an unusual story to tell you about 'The Sixth Sense'. When I first saw this movie when it first came out last August, I didn't care for it that much. Then the movie continued to make tons of money at the box office. I kept asking myself 'did I see this movie the wrong way?' I didn't find it all that scary. When I go to see a horror film, I expect some scares and shocks and this movie didn't seem to provide that. Then this past February it got 6 Oscar nominations including Best Picture. So on the basis of that, I went back to see it a second time. And you know what? It turns out that this movie is pretty good after all. The second time I saw 'The Sixth Sense' I saw the movie as a drama instead of a horror film and on that basis it works. The one thing I do agree on (even when I saw it the first time) is the outstanding performance by eleven-year-old Haley Joel Osment as Cole Sear, the boy who 'see's dead people'. He's terrific in this film. I hope we'll see lots of him in years to come. Also terrific, Australian actress Toni Collette as Lynn, Cole's mother. I didn't even know see was from Down Under since she's playing an American. I was very happy that Osment and Collette received Oscar nominations for their performances here (I think they both should have won). Bruce Willis, who was not recognized by the Academy (unfairly), gives one of the best performances of his career as Dr. Malcolm Crowe, the child psychologist who tries to help the boy. 'The Sixth Sense' is a well made thriller from an unknown writer-director, M. Night Shyamalan, who received Oscar nominations for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay. Too bad he had to lose both (if 'The Sixth Sense' had been based on a novel and Shyamalan had adapted the novel to the big screen, he would have won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay; the movie didn't have a chance against 'American Beauty'). 'The Sixth Sense' is definitely one of the biggest sleeper hits ever. Good job by all.*** (out of four)",8,0,0,30 April 2000
A Nightmare on Elm Street," The original!
","I didn't particularly care all that much for Wes Craven's 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' when I first saw it. But then came all the sequels. Parts 2-6 (unless you count 1994's 'A New Nightmare', which was really a different kind of movie compared to the first six films in the series) made the original look better with each passing movie. Now this stands out as a cult classic. 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' is the scary story which introduced the world to Freddy Krueger, the killer with knives for fingers who can enter the dreams of teenagers and kill them via their dreams. This is the movie in the series that scares me the most because it's also the most serious movie of the bunch. Freddy Krueger became more wisecracking in the sequels and therefore were less interesting. 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' has alot of thrills and scares, and some good performances (Johnny Depp made his film debut here). But the real star here is Craven, who not only directed 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' but also wrote the script. He created a monster that ranks right up there with earlier classic slasher killers such as Michael Myers ('Halloween'), Jason Voorhees ('Friday the 13th'), and Leatherface ('Texas Chainsaw Massacre'). While 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' isn't as effective as 'Halloween' or Craven's own '90s smash 'Scream', it's still an effective little horror thriller.*** (out of four)",8,0,0,18 November 2001

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," My all-time favorite movie
","'Star Wars' is the best movie that I've ever seen. It's been my favorite ever since I saw it when I was a kid. And it still is today. This is the ultimate sci-fi classic that takes place 'a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.' I love everything about 'Star Wars'. It has some of the most memorable characters for a motion picture. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), Darth Vader (David Prowse, with the voice of James Earl Jones), and my personal favorites: C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2D2 (Kenny Baker) are characters in the grand tradition of great movies. I'll never forget these characters for as long as I live. The story is excellent, which focuses primarily on a young man (Luke Skywalker) who becomes an interplanetary hero with the help of a wise old man (Obi-Wan Kenobi), a beautiful princess (Princess Leia), a cocky spaceship pilot (Han Solo) along with his wookie sidekick (Chewbacca), and a pair of robot friends (C-3PO and R2D2) as they do outer space battle against a powerful force (and a powerful villain in Darth Vader). The action scenes and special effects are outstanding. This movie features some of the most astonishing special effects that I've ever seen. 'Star Wars' broke new grounds in special effects technology when it was made back in the mid-1970s, and the effects got an advancement 20 years later when new footage turned up in the 1997 re-release of the film. The new special effects featured in the 20th anniversary 'special edition' could not be done in the 1970s because the effects technology wasn't as advanced back then as it is now.Writer-Director George Lucas thought that the effects would be more advanced in the future so he shot some extra scenes, then he would put the new effects into the mix as soon as the special effects technology became more advanced. The 'special edition' was more brilliant than ever. And the sound was more improved. This movie won 7 Oscars and to my knowledge it deserved every one of them. I think this is the greatest movie of all-time. It's sequels ('The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi') and prequels ('The Phantom Menace' and the upcoming Episodes II and III), as good as they are, can never top this one. No other motion picture can top it. 'Star Wars' will always be hands down my favorite movie.**** (out of four)",10,0,0,3 February 2001
The Replacements," Hysterical football comedy
","'The Replacements' is a very funny, very entertaining comedy which is loosely based on the real-life NFL strike during the 1987 season where the real players went on strike and replacement players were brought in to take their place. Keanu Reeves took a break from action movies to do comedy here and in 'The Replacements' he stars as Shane Falco, the replacement quarterback for the fictional Washington Sentinels. Oscar winner Gene Hackman also gets to show off some of his comic side as the Sentinels coach Jimmy McGinty who recruits these mostly off-the-wall players, and it's great to see long-time veteran character actor Jack Warden still around as he portrays the Sentinels owner Edward O'Neil. The other replacements players are an assorted bunch of oddball characters: a store security guard who's very fast but has butterfingers for hands; a Japanese sumo wrestler; a soccer player from Wales who becomes the field goal kicker and who's usually smoking (even on the field); a cop who's turns into a absolute tackling nut on the field; a wide-receiver who's deaf; and a rapper bodyguard duo. There's also focus on the cheerleaders, where two of them are exotic dancers. Not to mention the head cheerleader takes an interest in Falco. 'The Replacements' is a silly and predictable movie, but I didn't mind because it did make me laugh and I laughed alot while watching it. Plus, the entire cast does a pretty good job. It's nice to see Reeves and Hackman get a chance to do comedy again (Reeves starred in the two 'Bill & Ted' comedies; Hackman did the nutty 1996 film 'The Birdcage'). Old pro Warden has a few good moments as the team owner, and the actors who play the other replacement players are a riot. I didn't find 'The Replacements' all that original but since it's so funny most of the time I didn't care. It's the funniest football comedy since 'The Waterboy'. ***1/2 (out of four)",9,0,1,12 August 2000
Gladiator," Good movie, but a great one?
","'Gladiator', the movie favored to win the Oscar for Best Picture this coming March 25, is an epic movie that I found to be just good. I didn't think it was a great one like most people thought it was. Certainly not as great as 'Ben-Hur' and 'Spartacus', which 'Gladiator' is no doubt inspired from. The good things about this movie are the two main performances by Russell Crowe (Maximus) and Joaquin Phoenix (Commodus), the action scenes in the Roman Colosseum, and the beautiful film score. All those elements get high marks. The cinematography, editing, and production design are very good as well. But if there's one element that keeps this movie from being a great film is the lackluster special effects. The effects aren't all that great here. Even though they're not bad at all times, there were some effect shots that looked obviously phony. That shouldn't happen in a film like this. Nevertheless, if you like historical epic movies, then you'll probably like 'Gladiator'. I was just a little disappointed that it wasn't the great film I thought it would be.*** (out of four)",7,0,1,16 March 2001
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Outstanding finale (or is it the finale?)
","'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' was supposed to be the final movie in the 'Indiana Jones' series. At least that's what director Steven Spielberg and producer George Lucas said at the time this film hit theaters. But now they've said there will be a fourth 'Indiana Jones' film. I really don't know if that's a good idea, because the 'Last Crusade' was a fitting end to a great movie series. Harrison Ford returns for his third go around as swashbuckling hero Indiana Jones, this time accompanied by Sean Connery as Indy's father, Dr. Henry Jones. These two actors work beautifully together as they fight off the Nazis in search for the Holy Grail. Two actors from 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' reprise their roles to great effect in 'Last Crusade': Denholm Elliott as Marcus Brody and John Rhys-Davies as Sallah. Alison Doody is the heroine (good or bad?); Julian Glover is the villain; River Phoenix portrays a young Indy at the beginning to see how this character really got his start. 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' not only has great characters, it also has a decent story (taking place in 1938), plus exciting action scenes and special effects. It's better than the second film 'Temple of Doom' and comes very close to topping the first film 'Raiders'. The 'Indiana Jones' series should stay right where it is with the 'Last Crusade' as the finale. Unless Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford can prove us wrong and make a really good fourth film in the series, we shall see. I loved all three movies in the 'Indiana Jones' series. If the fourth film does gets made, I hope it'll be equally as good as the first three.**** (out of four)",10,48,60,24 March 2002
Back to the Future," One of my all-time favorites
","'Back to the Future' was one of my all-time favorite movies when I was a teenager. It's a funny, exciting sci-fi/fantasy/comedy that today is still perfect for all ages. Michael J. Fox stars in his best film role as a teenager in 1985 who goes back in time 30 years earlier to 1955 in a DeLorean time machine and in the process meets his parents (Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover) while they're teenagers. He also catches up with his mad scientist friend (Christopher Lloyd) who built the time machine and tries to help Fox find a way to get him back to the present day. Director Robert Zemeckis made 'Back to the Future' a winning film all the way around. Fox is terrific here. So are Lloyd, Thompson, and Glover. The writing (by Zemeckis and Bob Gale) is fresh and original, the directing outstanding, and the technical elements (ranging from the terrific production design to the rousing music score to the superb special effects) are dazzling. 'Back to the Future' was a great '80s movie, and one of the decades biggest smash hits. Also a big asset, an awesome soundtrack featuring two great songs sung by Huey Lewis just for this movie ('Back in Time' and the Oscar-nominated 'Power of Love'). The two sequels that followed simultaneously in 1989 and 1990 failed to live up to this one. In this trilogy, the original 'Back to the Future' is the only one worth seeing.**** (out of four)",10,1,2,29 December 2000
The Birds," 'They're coming! They're coming!'
","'They're coming! They're coming!' were the words said by Tippi Hedren at the end of the coming attractions trailer for Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 film 'The Birds'. And boy did they come when the movie opened. This is a terrifying story about what could happen if our fine feathered friends turned on man. 'The Birds', like the Master of Suspense's 1960 masterpiece 'Psycho', has the ability to give people the chills. I found 'The Birds' to be just a tad below 'Psycho' (it starts a little slow), but it's still a pretty scary movie. It features good acting by Tippi Hedren (in her most famous role), Rod Taylor, Jessica Tandy (26 years before 'Driving Miss Daisy'), Suzanne Pleshette, and Veronica Cartwright (16 years before 'Alien'). Plus it has impressive special visual effects, and probably the scariest sound effects that I've ever heard. The sound effects alone give me the creeps. And it has its share of humorous moments throughout. 'The Birds' is classic Hitchcock. If you like horror movies that are well made with a well told story, then you'll like this one.***1/2 (out of four)",9,52,103,17 June 2000
Jurassic Park," 'Jaws' with feet!
","WOW!!! 'Jurassic Park' is a spectacular special effects extravaganza. Steven Spielberg's 'Jaws' of the 90s has action, adventure, thrills, excitement, everything you would expect from a special effects picture. 'Jurassic Park' is about a theme park on an island in the Pacific Ocean that features much different attractions than your usual amusement park. Genetically created dinosaurs are the main attraction here, and a group of scientists, a lawyer, and two kids are invited to view the park. The park is owned by Dr. John Hammond, portrayed by Oscar-winning 'Gandhi' director Sir Richard Attenborough. He invites paleontologists Sam Neill and Laura Dern; mathematician Jeff Goldblum; lawyer Martin Ferrero; and grandchildren Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards to Jurassic Park and they go on the ride of their lives! If only they can survive after things start breaking down over the park and the dinosaurs begin to run amok. This movie features probably the best special effects ever created for a feature film. The dinosaurs look incredibly real, and they're awesome to watch. The sound effects are scary, especially if you saw this in a theater. The visual effects, sound, and sound effects editing won well-deserved Oscars. Some people said that the performances here come off flat. Well there's no doubt the dinosaurs upstage the humans in the film, but I think the performances are terrific too. Neill, Dern, Attenborough, Mazzello, Richards, and especially Goldblum are very good in this movie. And there are two other familiar faces in the cast in smaller parts: Samuel L. Jackson and Wayne Knight as computer technicians who work on the island. 'Jurassic Park' is one of Steven Spielberg's best movies. It's great fun from start to finish. Followed by the excellent second movie 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park'.**** (out of four)",10,3,6,7 June 2000
