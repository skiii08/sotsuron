Requiem for a Dream," 20 out of ten!
","what can i say about a movie of this height in experimentation,innovation,editing,background score,uniqueness,narration,urge for excellence,cinematography,performances and direction?i saw 'the fountain' before requiem and i was expecting some mind blowing time watching requiem.and i got more than i asked for!i just fell in love with his cut-shots kinda depiction of a few things like drug-consumption and using the remote and all.and the background score of this 'killer' flick is one of the best according to me!i would recommend this movie to every person i meet hereafter.there is no wonder i gave it a 20 out of 10!",10,2,4,10 December 2007
