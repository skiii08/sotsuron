The Ring," Beware strange video tapes
","Not creepy scary at all. At least not until towards the end, when Samara comes out of the television and kills Noah. Until then, it seemed to be more psychological terror than live terror. I wouldn't recommend young children to see it for the simple fact that seeing Samara thrown down the well would probably scare them, not to mention the aforementioned television scene. It was also dark and dreary throughout the entire movie. That in itself prevented me from enjoying this movie to its full extent. Of course, Seattle is a dreary place. But, I would have enjoyed it more if It hadn't been so dark. It's a good movie in it's own right. Like I said before, it's a psychological horror movie, not a live horror movie until the end. Although, most people I know who have seen this movie won't watch a video tape now. Unless it's clearly labeled.",3,0,6,24 April 2006
