Alien 3," near-brilliant use of tone
","Alien3 has a great many detractors for a great many reasons.  But let me offer just one example of how thoroughly effective this film is in terms of tone and atmosphere: the funeral sequence where the bodies of Newt and Hicks are thrown into the molten steel and the new alien is born from the dog. Look at all the layers Fincher successfully employs in the space of two minutes.  The use of irony (Dutton's eulogy) and contrast (alien ripping its way out of the dog's chest), blending beauty and horror, together with an impending sense of doom (Riply's bloody nose) and loss (the death of loved ones), taking place in a physical environment of bitter cold and scorching heat.  The scene is both cathartic and devastating, visually-stunning and unrelentingly morbid.  To me, it's a near-perfect hybrid of Ridley Scott and James Cameron.  And Fincher deserves a place right next to them.  What other director, apart from the true masters, can evoke so many seamless transitions so efficiently?",7,2,6,28 August 2003
Silent Hill," Silent Pill
","So disappointed. Had high hopes. Great production design, great creature effects, shoddy CG and a story that manages to be both flimsy and bloated with exposition at the same time. Rhada runs around looking concerned and makes some truly bad decisions regarding her 'daughter' whom she apparently 'cares' about (yeah, I'm gonna to tell my kid to make sure her seatbelt's fastened while I floor it to escape a cop who pulled me over -- then I'm going to crash the car and look shocked at the fact that my kid ran off without me). But whatever, it's a horror movie and I'd be willing to accept a few gaps in logic if it was in the service of an exhilarating experience. The issue here is that there's no tension. The movie's like walking through a nicely decorated haunted house while knowing with absolute certainty that nothing bad will happen. It's infuriating because there's some great creature work here and Gans films it really well -- but then he cuts away to Sean Bean trying to grapple with an American accent. And as far as being faithful to the game...whatever...the game relies on player interaction as much as it does atmosphere. The movie ONLY relies on atmosphere and it's just not enough to carry an audience for two hours.Oh and try counting how many times the line 'It's going to be okay, baby' is spoken throughout the film -- even when the kid's tied to a ladder over a freakin' bonfire by a cult of Addam's Family throwbacks! Somebody please get Ridley Scott back in the genre game.",3,2,7,23 April 2006
