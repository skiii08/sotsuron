Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Don't Mention Pulp Fiction...
","So we come at last, to Tarantino's cinematic fantasy, His parody of Classic films has reached new heights. The amount of Homages in this film is incredible - Daryl Hannah's Character must be a wink to the 1974 revenge flick 'They call her one eye'. Kill Bill itself is rumoured to become a trilogy in a 'dollars' style. The one thing that really shows the brilliance of this film is the face-off with Bill, okay so the dialog is a bit Hammy by Tarantino standards (see - Superman anecdote) while not bad is slightly out of place.*SPOILER* Anyway just as you wait for the huge showdown the death of Bill. It ends, The bride wins and its over. Just like that. B+Uma Thurman: ***+ slightly inhuman, but a good performance Daryl Hannah:*** dosen't say/do that much but suitably evil David Carradine:**** Perfect Tarantino Character, A 'Baddie' but very likable Michael Madsen:**** Again Perfect Tarantino, very dark not at his best but hey, it's Madsen for *&^% sake!",7,1,3,13 August 2004
