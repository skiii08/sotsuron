The King's Speech," He spoke.
","I did bring a lot of baggage to this movie, not least a conviction that another movie is way too good not to win the Best Picture Oscar, as well as a couple of savage takedowns by Christopher Hitchens for being an ahistorical, monarchist fairy tale. Of course, historical accuracy is not the greatest contributor to the quality of a film, and in fact, that _other_ film stapled some rather fanciful extrapolations on the bare skeleton of known facts, and came out pretty well for it.So does The King's Speech, but less as a historical epic and more as something akin to a sports movie. The whole story is about how the future George VI overcomes a show-stopping stutter and manages to deliver a rousing speech at the outset of World War II that inspires the underfed British masses to fight Hitler on the beaches, and in the fields, and no, wait, that was a different guy. The King's own big speech came across as remarkably less memorable, unhelpfully pushed to the background by the man's straining features and the music, as it swelled with pride in the logopedic conquest. In fact, I barely caught a word of it.But back to the sports movie analogy. Colin Firth sweats, gasps and bulges in various directions no worse than Sylvester Stallone, and in all seriousness, does deserve shiny trophies for his performance. So does Helena Bonham Carter, as a heart-breakingly supportive Elizabeth, Geoffrey Rush, as the wise but unorthodox speech therapist, and Michael Gambon as the inflexible, old George V. The costumes, sets and scenery are beautiful, with a couple of scenes coddled in impenetrable British fog looking especially good. The particulars are well-handled, the movie is touching and amusing and sad in the right places.The achievement is somewhat diminished by the fact that from the first 5 minutes, it's possible to predict the entire thing. The football template is immutable: a protagonist who thinks he's destined to be a secondary character due to a lack of Faith In Himself. The woman by his side who will support him through his defeats. The genial mentor with an offbeat training routine. Sibling rivalry and a history of bullying as a child. Several setbacks on the way to the Big Game er, speech.You will know when George will bungle his non-essential speeches. You'll see it coming when he initially refuses the 'one last treatment,' and what will happen to change his mind. You will hardly be surprised when he has a falling out with his therapist, or when the latter makes an attempt to reconcile that fails, or that a second attempt will succeed. You will positively yawn through the intrigue with his elder brother Edward VIII, Hitler's odious lickspittle. If you're going to stand history on its head and involve real people in imagined situations, why not make the plot a little less implacably canonical? Anyway, the king aces his big speech, and everything ends on a note of inspiring and hard-won triumph. Followed, off-screen, by a genocidal war that leaves two continents in ruins, countless millions dead and entire nations rendered mad with horror.This movie is splendidly put together, but in five years, it will join the somewhat dusty procession of mannered tales of self-triumph and not really be thought about very much. The Social Network has all the energy this season. Every line spoken in that movie is on fire. Every scene is sharp and unpredictable. The King's Speech seems to be the favorite to win, but if there's any justice, it will be the more modern film that carries Best Picture.",8,0,0,26 February 2011
Terminator Salvation," It could have been good.
","Remember when terminators used to be terrifying? The first two films had just one robotic villain apiece - the second one didn't even use firearms! - but both films were soaked in a feeling of panic and dread. The rules were established early on and were stuck to: if a terminator catches you, you're as good as dead. And the characters spent most of the time barely getting away.But that was 20 years ago. Terminator: Salvation is full of lovely hardware - giant VTOL prisoner transports, 40-foot-tall mega-terminators, assorted hovercraft, and even snakelike marine robots. But here's the thing - if one lone terminator managed to ravage entire SWAT teams point blank in T2, then how do you pit all this deadly new force against a few hardscrabble resistance fighters and end up with a movie that isn't over in 5 minutes? The answer is sadly predictable. The old terminators were frighteningly fast and intelligent. In T:S, they helpfully clang around and land slow, non-lethal blows until the heroes can get away. It's like watching the notorious slow-mo fistfight between Captain Kirk and the Gorn lizard man. The amateurs in charge of T:S were so in love with their toys that they failed to think about making the match-up between man and machine realistic and interesting.Here's a quiz: if you're an evil, all-powerful AI, and you have the number one person on your global kill list locked up in a cell, do you a) fill the cell with poison gas and kill him in an instant, or b) send a slow, rumbling robot to open the cell door and spend several minutes throwing him around the facility until he lands near something he can use to defeat you? Yeah, you guessed it.The whole second half of the movie is a run down the list of villain clichés. The slow and overly-elaborate killing methods. The Talking Killer. The plan that gets explained in detail to the character who's going to stop it in the nick of time. They even included the ultimate, sad cliché of action film - the lone hero who goes into the lion's den to rescue the love interest/dog/cute supporting character, and inevitably succeeds. Remember, this is the heart of Skynet, ostensibly filled with robots that could take on a battalion of soldiers. What suspense could we possibly be talking about at this point? It gets even dumber in the parts involving Moon Bloodgood's character. There's the hair that doesn't get ruffled after gun battles and mud-slogging escapes; there's the rescue by a strong male companion. There's the blue-white American smile so shiny that instead of storming the Skynet citadel, the Resistance could have just lined their female pilots on the perimeter and burnt the whole place to the ground like Archimedes. Finally, there's the obligatory undressing scene with the obligatory flimsy excuse. Actually, let me correct that. There was no excuse. Bloodgood takes her jacket and bra off and stands there with her breasts solemnly covered, for absolutely no reason! I would be OK with that if they had given us a good close look, but this is a PG-13 movie, so they don't. So that's that.There was just one good idea in this flat rehash: Sam Worthington's character, who starts out human and is transformed into an unwitting robot slave for the machines. This is shockingly revealed in the middle of the movie - or, if you watch TV, in the trailers for the movie. This is a marketing decision that defies explanation. Why did they think it was a good idea to spoil the only major plot twist in the ads? A special mention goes to Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose likeness makes a cameo in the form of a terminator specially personalized to kill John Connor. He attempts to do so, again, by grabbing him by the front of his jacket and flinging him in various directions, which, surprisingly, doesn't work. This makes Arnold's terminator officially less dangerous than the cassowary bird of New Guinea, which, despite not having a metallic skeleton, can kill people by disembowelling them with its sharp claws.There's so much more, but you get the idea. This movie officially completes the parallel between the Terminator, Alien and Batman film series. All three started out as classics, before being euthanized by an atrociously bad fourth installment. So far, only Batman has managed to shake the curse. We wait, patiently.",4,1,2,14 November 2009
The Town," Sure, why not?
","Yesterday, I saw the South Korean crime film 'The Chaser.' I spent 2 hours staring pale-faced at the screen. After it ended, I stood up with my head in my hands, drew a ragged breath and stumbled out into the hallway.'The Town' won't have that effect on you. The standard Hollywood grammar signals you from behind every frame, so even as cars slam into each other and crates of bullets sink into brick and metal, none of the russle and tussle on screen catches you particularly off guard. The people you expect to live - live, the people you expect to die get offed in genre-appropriate ways. The character that was going to hang it all up gets pulled into 'one last job,' the feds are tipped off by the person you expect to cave under questioning, and so on.That being said, there's nothing wrong with a formula movie done well, and Affleck delivers. The movie is well-shot, well-written, well-directed and well-acted, with individual nods to everyone's new favorite trigger-finger Jeremy Renner, and Pete Postlethwaite, reduced in body, who makes up for the lost volume with concentrated Kobayashi malevolence. This was Postlethwaite's last film credit to see release before his death, and he plays it like Slayer's farewell concert.Bostonites would be in a better position to comment on its authenticity, but the movie does give a good sense of location and flavor. Between 'Mystic River,' 'The Departed' and now this offering, Boston has been working up a somewhat gritty reputation in the movies, though Detroit and Baltimore are laughing and shaking their heads.All told, this is a perfectly fine formula caper movie with an almost-authentic blue collar burnish. You could do worse on a snow day.",7,1,3,16 January 2011
Watchmen," Watchmeh
","I missed the theatrical release of Watchmen in 2009, and just saw the Ultimate Cut on video. It is 3 1/2 hours long. It wouldn't have run a minute over 2 if all the slo-mo played at normal speed.By the way, don't watch the Ultimate Cut. It's worse than the Director's Cut, because it includes Tales of the Black Freighter in the film's runtime instead of as an extra. The Tales in the graphic novel were a nice parallel narrative of gathering darkness and insanity. In the movie, they're badly animated, badly integrated, break the flow and lack all sense of visual style, dread and foreboding. The comic uses greens, reds and yellows to convey a look of runaway putrefaction, and shows the protagonist's mental degradation by always playing with the color scheme. The movie version has flat sand, flat blue water, flat green corpses, flat shadows. The protagonist looks like Nathan Explosion, and voiceovers everything he does in a mildly distressed monotone. In the comic, the Tales end simply, with hands stretching out to grab a rope, and yet the horror is suffocating. In the movie, they end with grinning demon pirates with glowing red eyes, straight out of second-rate 80s Disney.So, what about the live action film? Well... It's faithful. It tracks the source material like a dachshund tied behind a bicycle. The only major change has been the ending  and, mirabile dictu, it's better (well, the concept is better – they ruined it with song, but more on that later).Jackie Earle Haley is about as good a Rorschach as we could hope for. Danny Woodburn has a sweet scene or two. Patrick Wilson is a sad nerdy lump in tweed. That's the performances.Visually, the movie is a treat for aficionados of glowing blue penises. Credit where it's due, Zack Snyder doesn't tend to soft-pedal violence, nor did he nerf Dr. Manhattan's nudity. It's good to see a major motion picture that doesn't think seeing a dong will destroy my mind forever.Unfortunately, that's about all that can be said about the visuals. The idea of special effects is to make the impossible or nonexistent look real. Snyder has kind of a reverse Midas touch, where even his real sets end up looking phony. Every surface in the whole movie looks like it was rendered with the Doom 3 engine. The worst is the glass clockwork thingamabob on Mars – I almost want to donate some CPU time on my video card, so they can add some radiosity to it or something.On top, they added a green Matrix tint to almost every scene, except for a flashback to green Vietnamese rice paddies, which are tinted orange.The music. How can you take so much good music and make such trite and horrible use of it? The opening montage –the only good use of slow-motion in the movie – is set to 'The Times They Are A-Changin'.' Flying to an Antarctic fortress? 'All Along the Watchtower.' Not obvious enough? How about a burial set to 'The Sound of Silence.' The solemn, dark ending? Mozart's 'Requiem,' bringing you schmaltz since Bunny Lebowski's kidnapping.The worst was the Vietnam flashback. Quick, what music do you think they picked for that one? That's right. It was 'Ride of the Valkyries.' God, did I hate this movie at that moment! About the only good use of music was Philip Glass's sublime 'Prophecies,' during Dr. Manhattan's transformation.Sound effects... It's the Hollywood thing, where every object visible on screen needs to make some sort of a clank or a clink or a shwing, otherwise the stupids won't notice that it's there. Snyder seems intent on doubling even the usual excessive sound environment, just to make absolutely sure that people notice that THERE'S A HAT TUMBLING THROUGH THE AIR!! When a character flicks a smiley-face badge into an open grave, it's the only thing happening on screen. There's no way to miss it. But just in case, they'll make it sound like a Russian helicopter as it falls: 'PLINK!... whoosh-whoosh-whoosh-whoosh-WHOOSH-WHOOSH.' The action is just as subtle. Everything is in slow motion. Fight sequences are in slow motion. Punches are in slow motion. Rorschach's improvised flamethrower is in slow motion; the Comedian's Army-issued flamethrower is also in slow motion. Silk Spectre walks down a flight of stairs in slow motion. Twice. Getting into a car – slow motion. Getting out of a car? Slow motion. Elevator doors open in slow motion. A blue energy weapon explodes in slow motion. An assassin aims his gun in slow motion, fires it in slow motion, misses in slow motion, and gets his ass kicked in slow motion.What if we still don't get it? Break the action down even more! Remember the hallway fight in Oldboy, how fluid and awesome it was? Here's the Watchmen version: a bad guy runs towards the good guys. Cut to his face, centered in the frame for a second. It gets punched (with a whoosh before and after). Cut to another static bad guy. He gets kicked. Cut to static body part. It gets broken/blown off/whatever. There is no flow, no sense of motion.It's like Snyder thinks the only way to make people actually notice what's happening on screen is to center and pause on the action, and maybe also shake people by the lapels. It's like a four-year-old trying to get an adult's attention. 'Mom look. Mom, look what I got. MOM, LOOK. Mom, you aren't looking. LOOK MOM!!!' Yeah. Watchmen is Ambitious, Personal and Faithful to the source, for all that's worth. It's just not really all that good.Too bad, because the money people probably looked at the numbers and decided that mature, uncomfortable science fiction doesn't sell, and they shouldn't make any more. The real lesson is that they should; just put it in the hands of Alfonso Cuaron.",4,3,7,29 May 2012
Man of Steel," A loud, brutal slugfest
","Man of Steel is a merciless bludgeoning, and nothing more. Superman keeps getting told that he's conflicted and torn between two worlds, but the plot provides no moral dilemmas for him other than 'bash things.' He is humanity's Jesus of punching.The action is staged beautifully and looks great, and this from someone who hated Watchmen for every reason there is. Zack Snyder came through! If you haven't seen Man of Steel, you've never seen someone throw a person through a skyscraper and believed it. There are some moments that approach awe, such as the austere architecture and landscape of Krypton (where we spend about half an hour but which we never see not blowing up) and the famous shot of Superman breaking the sound barrier. The only problem is that it's followed by 5 more shots of Superman breaking the sound barrier. This applies to every stunt and action set-piece in the movie.Production design is outstanding, my favorite being the Pinscreen-inspired alien computer interface. Sounds silly, but the history of Krypton told in gunmetal and graphite pixels is an inventive and lovely visual.Unfortunately, the things that aren't alien ships, fistfights or explosions aren't interesting or good.The music is standard Zimmerklang: brass and drums. It's monotonous and obnoxious.The writing is... You know how trailers chop in snippets of dialogue between the cool music? 'Welcome to the FBI. - His methods are... a little unconventional. - Bank of Luxembourg - twenty million dollars - stolen. - He hasn't been the same since - killed his wife.' Imagine a whole movie done this way. I can barely think of an actual conversation in this movie - everything is either an order, an instruction or a threat.The plot is easy to follow and hard to get invested in. The Badass General Zod comes to Earth from Krypton because the phantom dimension gate was disrupted by the codex DNA which became unstable when the planet core was mined for energy that was transcribed in the cellular matrix of the genesis probe that the supreme council rejected after the coup attempt which caused the distress beacon to go off in the consciousness hologram - basically, to give Superman something to chew on. Zod has henchpeople, and they all get into loud, massive fights with Superman while Earth soldiers surround them and shoot impotent blanks.That's the common problem to watching godlike aliens fight - humanity comes off as totally useless. Lois Lane is briefly relevant once, when she plugs in an alien flash drive. And in the end, the movie gets humans to deliver a thing to a place, like a mother letting her idiot child carry a bag of chips so he can feel like he's helping.Naturally, aside from crouching victims, the Superman canon has use for earthlings as teachers, parents, colleagues and love interests, none of which comes through in this movie. Clark Kent's entire earthly backstory comes down to: being told how historic he is by Ma and Pa, and saving people from disasters in flashbacks. All this happens in short, out-of-order clips that play like a badly-organized family slideshow. The romance with Lois Lane is non-existent, since about the only time they're on screen together is when he's catching her in mid-air.Positive characters who die do it with such serenity that they almost look bored.A huge battle takes place in Metropolis and results in several dozen 9/11s. Nobody dies on screen, because PG-13.General Zod and his people could probably achieve their goals on Mars or Venus with equal success and don't have to try and kill everybody, but they can't be reasoned with because they're genetically like that.So there it is. See this movie if you want to see Superman and his enemies punch things, punch through things, punch people, punch things through people, punch people through things and punch things through other things. But who punches the punchmen?",6,12,24,19 June 2013
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Pinnacle of movie-making
","This is quite simply the best action movie of all time. Not because of the action, although it is stellar even 14 years later, but because the movie pauses to explore its characters, and includes quiet contemplative moments in between all the action, so that by the movie's end, I really felt that I just concluded a long and difficult journey with the characters, instead of having watched them make their way through a few action scenes.Bravo, Cameron!",10,2,3,11 May 2004
Elysium," The difference between what you think you did and what you actually did.
","Elysium is the movie District 9 would have been if it had sucked.Imagine the Tea Party's worst stereotype of a 'Hollywood liberal': a phony, sanctimonious poverty tourist who gets his picture taken trying to teach Amazon tribesmen how to do yoga. Now, imagine the movie this person would make as penance for the fact that he doesn't get what it's like to be disadvantaged, doesn't care, and does nothing to help anyone. You'd get something like Elysium.150 years in the future, the Earth is a wasted working-class barrio, the rich have decamped to a luxurious orbital station that's essentially Beverly Hills in space. No, really. The people that funded and starred in this movie cast themselves and their own lifestyles as the villains, and it's anyone's guess if they even knew that they did it.In this future, there are Health Care Pods that can fix any disease, but the Space Rich are hogging them all for their own facelifts; during the setup we see shiploads of illegal aliens (illegal earthlings?) trying to dodge missiles in order to get to one of the pods and heal the proverbial Little Girl - the first of a bunch, since that's how you zap the sympathy circuit for cheap.It's not like you can't make a powerful and authentic message movie about class or immigration - take 'El Norte' from 1983, or 'Dirty Pretty Things,' or hey, even 'Gran Torino.' But that takes a bit of patience and writing. In Elysium, they must have had an alarm go off on set when the camera stopped shaking for five seconds. It feels like a movie shot by people whose biggest fear was that they weren't making enough noise.It's a shame, because it's a very nice-looking action movie. Neill Blomkamp is great at making futuristic action visually believable.Unfortunately, all the action leaves no room for anything like dialogue or plot, both of which come across like a school project where the student copies a textbook sample with his name switched in, and flat-out doesn't get why that's wrong.The protagonist: boy like girl, dream space station, grow up steal car, work bad job. Get radiation, must heal in Pod. Run, punch, shoot gun. This is the entirety of Matt Damon's character.The 'mini-boss': played by William Fichtner, which is enough to prove he's evil. In case it's not, he's made to say the phrase: 'Is his skin going to fall off? Then get him off the sheets.' The audience groans before they can ask themselves why the owner of a Bugatti space shuttle is making decisions about sick-bay sheets.The main antagonist: played by Jodie Foster; proves she's evil by having sharp hair and blowing up immigrant ships first thing on-screen. Gets involved in absurd coup plot against the president of the evil space station, which makes her... evil-squared? The mad-dog muscle bad guy: Sharlto Copley under a dozen layers of beard. Is evil because he always talks about how much he's going to enjoy killing Matt Damon.Almost forgot: the Little Girl that Matt Damon liked as a kid grows up and has a Little Girl of her own (that's 3 distinct Little Girls so far, if anyone's counting); she's deathly ill and needs some space health care.The gravest of this movie's crimes is the ham-fisted condescension. You can only be so blunt and manipulative before the viewer checks out, and Elysium contains a moment like this for every one of its characters. The bed-sheet episode for the Fichtner miniboss is as good an illustration as any. We meet him in an evil-boss glass office above the factory floor; he's wearing an evil power-suit, has slicked-back evil hair, is looking at evil capitalist charts on a screen; and, just in case you still don't get which stereotype he represents, comes down personally to the medical bay to have an injured worker thrown off the bed before he messes it up with his hurt-fluids.He doesn't have flunkie shift supervisors to handle petty cruelty for him, such as the manager who put Matt Damon's life in jeopardy in the first place? How does it make sense for a millionaire to do hands-on bed sheet management? It does if you're trying to mark a check-box and can't spare the time to do it well.Last year, Jezebel published a compilation of horrible boss tales; one memorable story told of an Applebee's manager who made one of his workers finish a shift while she was having a miscarriage, because it was 'too late anyway.' We live in a world where this sort of thing happens for real, and the makers of Elysium couldn't even pull off 'abusive workplace' with any authenticity? They wouldn't need to go far to find the real thing - read up on Hollywood employment practices if you want to know how to sweat people.If you want to do a major movie on class disparity and exploitation - go for it. Do one decent scene that shows me how the system perpetuates itself. Show me how money creates a power imbalance in employment. Show me how the working classes are recruited into their own oppression. Show me how management and labor are played against each other. Show me how a climate of unspoken expectations causes low-level managers to take initiative in mistreating workers without explicit orders from above. Show me false hopes of social mobility.You don't have to be subtle or coy - just don't be so damn lazy.",4,0,1,14 January 2014
Prometheus," Broken promise
","In hindsight, the promotional videos ended up as an excellent predictor. The short 'viral' film about David the Fassbender was brilliant, and his parts in the movie were great. Guy Pearce in the 'TED talk' video came off as Eldon Tyrell's phony, pompous kid brother - and that's just how his whole plot line played. The trailer was visually spectacular, but sounded pretentious without much to back it up. We hoped it wouldn't be so, but it is.First things first, Scott knows how to direct, and Prometheus may be the best-looking movie of the decade. Just for that, I don't regret putting down $15 for a 3D screening. After all the weak CG and derivative action we've been watching for years (orcs on jet-skis in Avengers, anything by Bay or Snyder), it's good to see amazing practical sets, tasteful computer graphics, and effects that FEEL REAL.It's just too bad that the screenplay is murky, overwrought twaddle without a single memorable line or character. Fassbender is good. Noomi Rapace is good in distress, although, after a certain point, one has to wonder how she could run and jump without massive bleeding and hemorrhages. Almost everyone is flat, disposable, irrational and stupid.The biggest bubble of them all is when people praise the movie for 'raising questions.' We're science fiction fans. We've read Wells, Asimov and Clarke. All these questions have already been raised long ago, we've been thinking about them for decades. Clarke did panspermia in 'Cradle,' Sagan did theology in 'Contact,' and Scott himself did gooshy monsters, evil androids and space ruins in 'Alien.' What Prometheus should have done was explore these questions, and it didn't.There are dozens of reviews here right now from furious Brits who list the flaws, the plot holes, the perfunctory theology, the pointless twists, the stupidity of every character. There's not much I can add to that, but I would like to tie the awful science of it together. Man, the biology was bad. For a movie about genetic engineering, holy Christ was the biology bad.So check this out. In the beginning, Earth appears barren. Giant, pale alien humanoids seed it with life. In the first inexplicable move, one of them has to drink some goop and disintegrate into a waterfall. But why?? If they can travel through the galaxy and create biospheres from scratch, surely they'd have found a way to do it without killing off one of their own guys.OK, now DNA is in the water. Now what? Do we start out with microorganisms that diversify and organize themselves into multicellular life? Do they radiate into plants & animals, fungi, extremophiles, occupy every niche on Earth and and go through the evolutionary history that we know and love? Does this process take 3.8 billion years, and leave fossils in every geological strata? In that case, the DNA that ended up in the water must have been chopped down into really small, basic chunks. After all, if humans and holothurians have a common ancestor, it must have been pretty simple. Then how, after billions of years of mutation, did Earth produce bipedal humanoids that look incredibly similar to the ones who seeded it in the first place, down to six-pack abs and everything? Wouldn't that be vanishingly unlikely? But wait. In the movie, they run a DNA scan on one of the aliens... and it matches human DNA exactly! But how? Didn't we evolve from goop on planet Earth? How in the world did we end up with the exact same genetic code as the beings that poured some DNA into a river billions of years ago? Even two populations of the same species, if they are split up, will begin to lose their similarities due to genetic drift.Maybe, somehow, the Engineers programmed Earth's biosphere to produce, among millions of species in every conceivable environment and niche, with every conceivable body plan, chemistry and life cycle, something that had their exact DNA. However, those guys are nine feet tall, completely hairless, and pale like cave slugs. Wouldn't there be some differences between their DNA and ours? How come we aren't nine feet tall? How is there a genetic match with so many phenotypic differences?You can either bash nitpickers and use the generic IMDb response, 'But it's just a movie! It's entertainment!' Or, you can try to defend Prometheus as intelligent science fiction. But intelligent science fiction can't have dismal junk science. You can't break biology, then try to ride out on 'raising questions.' Sometimes, it feels like we've entered the Age of People Losing their Touch. Indiana Jones 4... The Star Wars prequels... Now this. Ridley Scott... you sure know how to shoot movies, but please, get a decent writer next time...",6,4,9,10 June 2012
The Social Network," The Internet is forever
","Two people are sitting on a park bench, her head leans on his shoulder. She thinks he's cute and funny after he spent a week flicking her sweet nothings with his thumbs; she hides a screen under the counter at her workplace.Neither of them have ever given a minute's thought to who invented the cell phone, but things are going to work out for them because of it. 'The Social Network' is a movie about the inventors and the programmers, and the things that make them bother to program and invent.Margaret Atwood put interesting words in the mouth of her protagonist in 'Oryx and Crake.' 'The male frog in mating season makes as much noise as it can. ... Small male frogs -- it's been documented -- discover if they position themselves in empty drainpipes, the pipe acts as a voice amplifier and the small frog appears much larger than it really is. So that's what art is for the artist, an empty drainpipe. An amplifier. A stab at getting laid.' Mark Zuckerberg, brilliantly played as a borderline Asperger's case by Jesse Eisenberg, is the very incarnation of this energy. His art is programming. He uses it to get back at the people - women - he feels have given him short shrift. He uses it to gain attention, and perhaps secretly hopes to be loved for it. His frustrations lead him to build the road that half a billion people travel along, on their way to each other. For him, it may be a dead end.The movie gets everything right. The screenplay has been exalted in many words; I'll only say that if you enjoy hearing intelligent conversation, the first scene is all the encouragement you need. As a place where people could plausibly have these kinds of conversations in real life, Harvard is the perfect setting - and justice is finally done to an Ivy League school, after years of nerf visions like 'The Skulls.' The pacing of the movie is relentless - no slow second act, and a big exhale after two hours. Fincher's direction and cinematography are good because they're never not good, with the rowing race scene one of the most memorable and outstanding moments in a career that has included 'Seven' and 'Fight Club.' Actors - fantastic. Score - wonderful.You really should see this movie.",10,1,2,23 January 2011
