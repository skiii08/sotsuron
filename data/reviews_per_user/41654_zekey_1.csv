Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Jar Jar must die
","I must say I attended the film with much anticipation. Every thing was going along fine, the Jedi were battle ready with Samurai like intensity, the Force was flowing, and Darth Sidious was speaking in his familiar nasty rasp embracing the Dark Side. I found Carrie Fisher has nothing on the lovely Natalie Portman (every moment with her on the screen was absolutely wondrous). Getting used to a pint sized Darth-Vader-To-Be was a stretch, but I overcame even that.  All was right with the world. Enter Jar Jar Binks.  I must draw the line at Jar Jar.  This insipid garbage absolutely ruined the movie.  I don't care if Lucas was aiming at the kiddy demographic, and if he was, shame on him.  A plague on him actually.I lived for the light saber duels, the starship battles, Ewan McGregor's homage to the cultered dialect of Sir Alec Guiness, the beautiful Queen Amidala, and the struggle of good and evil.  But Jar Jar ruined this movie more than any tribe of Ewoks ever could.  Obi Wan should take a Light Saber and carve him up in Episode II.  I am very disappointed.  George, kill Jar Jar, and kill him soon.",Null,0,1,22 May 1999
