Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Insultingly bad
","I love the original Star Wars Trilogy (the ORIGINAL - not the abominable special editions). I know nearly every line by heart. That being said, let's move on.In my reviews, I usually like to point out the flaws of movies, but in this case, it would take too long, so I'm going to list the good bits instead: <ul><li>Darth Maul.</li></ul><ul><li>The soundtrack.</li></ul>That's it. The script is depth-less, amateurish and boring, the characters uninteresting, their qualities inconsistent and their combined amount of personality less than that of my hairbrush. It is quite clear that the combination of George Lucas and an unlimited supply of special effects will turn any idea to utter crap. Every scene in this movie is crammed with details, and yet manages to convey absolutely nothing. Appearantly the movie was made for kids, yet it's mostly about a political debate concerning taxes - a subject close to heart to children world-wide...?The only interesting action sequence is the fight between Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon and Darth Maul - during which I was actually hoping for Darth Maul to win, because the two Jedi... Boring! The only other tension came from the vein in my forehead constantly about to pop from irritation with Jar Jar Binks - the most irritating creature since... possibly ever - and the only thing that kept me awake during the last half of the movie, was trying to figure out why shield generators are seemingly never covered by the generated shield...If you're wondering what the movie is about, it's mostly about Jack and his good friend sh*t. I honestly can't find a story in this mess. A nothing-special-about-him-at-all Obi-Wan, the 9-year-old dumb kid Anakin and the 14-year-old queen (child labor, anyone?) Padmé meet each other, and that's more or less all there is. The rest of the very long 2,5 hours can be divided up into various degrees of redundant.I gave it a 2/10, simply because I have seen worse. Not much worse, but still...",2,4,9,24 December 2009
Terminator Salvation," I like it, but I can't help noticing
","This fourth installment in the 'Terminator' series tells the tale of how John Connor meets Kyle Reese, as well as the story of accidental (?) murderer Marcus Wright, who is executed in 2003, but somehow wakes up in 2018, unknowing of why, how or of what has happened to him. In the ruins of Los Angeles, he is saved from a T-600 by Kyle Reese and the mute girl Star, and after that joins them. By accident they overhear a radio broadcast from John Connor, and decide to find him, to join the resistance.They find a filthy gas station filled with cowards, and while there, the Terminator answer to the Iron Giant finds them. Mysteriously, no one hears it coming, leading to it being lovingly nick-named 'the Sneak-o-bot' among my friends. Once it's broken through the roof, it starts making one hell of a lot of noise, though. The robots have that going for them: They only make a sound when they're on-screen.Some action later, Kyle and Star are taken by Sneaky, and Marcus joins resistance pilot Blaire, heading back to HQ and Connor. He earns her trust by taking out a gang of rapists threatening her. However, HQ is surrounded by magnetic mines, and when they cross the minefield, a mine goes bang. *gasp* Turns out, Marcus is a Terminator, too. Only he didn't know he was.The rest of the movie is to no surprise about Connor and Marcus working together to free Kyle from Skynet.Now, to what I can't help noticing: It seems Marcus is only absurdly strong when he knows that he's a robot. Remember the firefighter that couldn't even budge the T-800 in 'Terminator 3'? Marcus throws a T-800 around like a beach ball, but somehow manages not to maul the rapist gang to bits during their fight.Every terminator in the movie is explicitly trying NOT to kill Connor and Kyle. Every robot Connor encounters seems fully satisfied with throwing him around a bit. It is made clear in the movie that the order is to kill both of them, so how hard could it actually be to just grab their necks and squeeze? The robots have so many chances of killing them both that it's ridiculous, but none of them do. Well, except for the last one, who runs a metal bar through one of Connor's lungs, so that Marcus can nobly offer up his own heart and die. (What, you think there's another reason? Do tell.) I thought a heart transplant required finding a perfect match regarding blood and tissue types and then post surgery going through a special diet and eating medicine to prevent the body from rejecting the new heart, but I guess Marcus is the organ donor equivalent of the one-size-fits-all garment. Otherwise, putting his heart into John Connor would be about as effective as shoving a T-800 fuel cell in there.By now, I guess you think I pretty much loathe this film, but I actually like it. I can watch it over and over again, even if I can't put my finger on the reason why. It's predictable, and the script leaves a few things to be desired, but it's pretty well made, rather well cast, the action is okay and the scenery and special effects are good. The often ominous score is very much fitting, and composed by one of my personal favorites, Danny Elfman.All in all, entertaining.",6,2,3,29 October 2010
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The best part was the THX logo
","'The Final Sacrifice' has been called the movie that is 100% deus ex machina. Well, here's the TRILOGY that is 100% deus ex machina. Words cannot describe how terribly bad this movie is, but an easy summary, is that every single thing in the movie, is the exact opposite of what would make sense. It is also another perfect example of what happens when movie-related merchandise becomes the goal of movie-making, instead of a bi-product.First of all, Anakin is all grown up, Amidala is a senator, Palpatine is chancellor, we're told that Anakin is Obi-Wan's apprentice and C-3PO and R2-D2 are around, so the first movie didn't need to be made at all. This is practically an all together new story, and everything worth mentioning from episode one could be squeezed into the first five minutes of it.Second of all well, everything. Amidala knows that someone's trying to kill her, but does nothing to hide. She constantly resides near the biggest windows she can find. A shape-shifter assassin shows up, but tries to kill Amidala using bugs. The Jedi meant to protect Amidala both chase after the assassin, but instead of just shifting shape and going back to finish the job, she tries to kill the Jedi instead.To protect her, they send Amidala back home, with Anakin, who's obviously in love with her, but is forbidden to love anyone. (Does anyone know why that is? When Yoda said that the Force was 'strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned' to Luke, I got the impression that the ability to use the Force was somewhat hereditary. But since the Jedi can't have families, according to the new trilogy, this ability is completely random. It doesn't at all explain why it would be strong in an entire family, or why Anakin's or Luke's children would automatically get it.) She takes him to the most romantic place imaginable and walks around in practically no clothes at all, while telling him how impossible his love is. Now, I may have used my looks to get some free drinks, but hell, I've never been THAT cruel. But she falls for him anyway, because he talks about sand. And kills an entire village. And whines about Obi-Wan pretty much non-stop. And he acts like a 10-year-old. And he constantly stares at her creepily as hell. Know what, Mr. Lucas? This is the kind of guy women usually get restraining orders against. Meanwhile, Obi-Wan goes to a town that looks almost exactly like Cloud City. Were they built by the same contractor? They end up on some bug-planet, where they fight bugs, useless robots and Count Dooku. This is probably meant to be a big, spectacular Colosseum-like arena scene, but it's so cluttered you can't even see what goes on in it. There are so many light-sabers in it, though, that had it been darker, I'd have guessed rave party. The idiotic things relieve each other in this movie, and so do the game-hype sequences. There are high-speed chases that are ironically at least 20 minutes too long, then some crap in a factory that reminds me of 80's platform games, and there are light-sabers EVERYwhere, all the time. I'm willing to bet they use them as reading lamps too. I won't count, but the light-saber shots probably make up more than half of the movie. Apparently, people can hardly even get dressed without using a light-saber. In the original trilogy, this was the coolest weapon ever. In this movie, it's so over-used it's about as exciting as a flash-light.The fact that this is what's spat out of the computer when George Lucas can bring to the screen everything he can imagine, makes me start wondering exactly how awful a film-maker he really is. After all, it's now more than clear that everything amazing about the original trilogy must have been thanks to other people. In fact, the only other name that comes to mind when watching crap of this magnitude is Uwe Boll. I could have said Ed Wood, but I won't, because while Ed Wood was god awful at nearly everything cinematic, at least he had heart and cared about his stories.",1,16,30,10 October 2011
Twilight," Not okay
","If I say that I read the novel 'Twilight' 3 times the first 2 days I held it in my hands, I probably don't need to say anything more on how much I like it.I really wanted to like the movie at least half as much, but I almost felt like crying from disappointment when I saw it. ALL my favorite moments from the novel have been cut short or cut out; I found myself trying to fill out the gaps in my mind, while the movie moved forward so fast it made my head spin, never more than flickering past, hardly touching the surfaces, of most characters.There is really so much to all the Cullens. They each have a background story that explains who they are, why they do what they do, and feel the way they feel - like Rosalie's dislike for Bella. The movie shows none of them. Nor do we get to see the inhuman beauty of their entire appearances, or how they dazzle any human that looks at them. These roles are excellently cast, which just makes it more frustrating that they're so underdeveloped.I love the personality of the novel's Bella; she's very kind-hearted, mostly unintentionally funny, slightly cynical and somewhat older than her years. Her clumsiness and awkwardness is endearing next to the vampires' nearly god-like grace. The movie's Bella, to me, came across as vacant, indifferent, arrogant, cold, and sort of bitchy. (And though she says she's clumsy, I must say she hides it really well...) In addition, most of her lines sound like she's reading them for the first time, right off a teleprompter.But of course, like most other girls and/or women, I have Edward Cullen as my dear favorite - and I guess that's why what they did to this character bugged me the most. Robert Pattinson looks absolutely gorgeous, and I love his voice. He has the makings of a perfect Edward Cullen, I'll give them that, and I understand that it must be difficult to find a 20-something-year-old with the certainty of a 90-year-old, but to me, he was acting too young, with all the insecurity and self-consciousness of a teenager. Edward is supposed to be strong and mature, with authority and integrity; a person that'll make you feel like nothing in the world could ever hurt you as long as he's around. Brooding and serious, yes, but not self-hating. I wanted him to be intimidating and cold, growing warmer as the movie progressed. After all, in the novel, when he finally admits that he can't stay away from Bella any longer, he has actually been trying. In the movie, he constantly follows her like a shadow, more than any other guy, and Bella is nowhere near as shy and insecure as she should be. Instead, she pushes him around, making him seem even more insecure. I am, however, not going to blame Stewart (Bella) or Pattinson (Edward), since the director was the one who obviously thought the characters should be that way, while I'm wondering if she's even read the book;I mean... What was up with Edward's horribly exaggerated reaction to Bella in biology? He was just supposed to glare. Why did Bella look insultingly bored when meeting Edwards family in their home (in fact, insultingly bored, period)? Why was she paler than the vampires? How dared they turn the warm, genuine love between Edward and Bella into a teen crush, and the entire breath-taking meadow section into a Polaroid? Where was the growing friendship between Alice and Bella? Why, oh why was there a sparkling sound whenever the sun hit Edward's skin, when I had actually managed to choke back any unfitting laughter up until those moments? I guess they were meant to enhance the visual effects, but instead do a wonderful job at highlighting their failure. And finally: Why is too big a part of the movie spent in trees, and why would anyone wear sunglasses in a constantly clouded town?Despite loving the book with all my heart, for most of the movie I sat wishing that it could have been a manga, so that a decent director for the genre could have made an OVA (using the actual novel as screenplay).I'll give this 8/10 for the casting and scenery, 2/10 for the screenplay, direction and special effects, and 0/10 just for the movie completely missing the soul, essence, warmth and humor of the book.It wouldn't surprise me if this movie is given a Riff Trax commentary in the future, because the absolutely worst part of it was that I didn't cry - I laughed, as did the rest of the theater. It came every now and then; the horrible sound of an audience feeling embarrassed for the cast.I probably won't see the sequels. I'll just watch the stills of Robert Pattinson and read the books again, since it's clear that the movies - at least with Hardwicke in the director's chair - will never measure up to the visions in my head.",1,7,141,17 December 2008
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," I want the money (I didn't pay) back
","I disliked the movie 'Twilight', so I saw this one against my better judgment, and with quite a bit of skepticism. Ten minutes in, it was clear that 'New Moon' would be better than it's prequel. Sadly, this doesn't say a lot. Throughout the movie, I found myself being either annoyed, bored or utterly amused, and all for the wrong reasons.The story does indeed stay somewhat true to the book this time, but I think I would have had trouble following what goes on, if I hadn't read the book. Most key moments from the novel have been given focus here, but there's not much to fill out the in-betweens, so this movie impressively succeeds in being both boringly slow AND fast-paced. The fast pace is because of the same thing that made 'Twilight' fast-paced; the would-be romance between two people who go from just meeting, to not being able to live without each other in all of 5 days, more or less. It wasn't believable then, and it isn't now. So why boringly slow? Because of these: 1. THE DIALOG. When you write a book, it's okay to use fancier words, and to give your characters long speeches, to let them get descriptive; it's sometimes necessary, because since we can't see either their body-language or facial expressions, their words will to some extent have to make up for them. However, you should never forget that real life people don't talk like that! This movie sadly utilizes lines directly from the book, and as in most such cases, it ends up sounding wooden and insecure, not to mention ridiculous.2. THE ACTORS. Robert Pattinson looks like he's in immense pain, from beginning to end. He sounds like he tries to put some seriousness into his lines, but without backing them up with any kind of conviction or real feeling. Kristen Stewart once again gasps her way through too many lines, and still hasn't learned to master any facial expressions beyond bored and vacant. Never once did I see 'Bella' during the 2 hours this movie progressed - I saw an actress trying hard. She appears to be struggling with every scene, and failing. Her interaction with Pattinson looks they were forced into it, and his attempt at seriousness clashes almost spectacularly with her monotone indifference. After a while, it became amusing to watch her incompetently stumble and stutter through scenes. Towards the ending, I found myself wondering if the director and the screenwriter intentionally left out the more emotional moments, because they realized she wouldn't be able to act them out anyway. Finally, we have: 3. THE CHARACTERS. Can't say much about them, because there's really nothing to say. If you would ask me to describe any of them without using looks, profession or race, I wouldn't be able to give you an answer. I'm not demanding someone to relate to, but I at least want someone to care about, and here, there's just nothing. The actors could have been replaced with mannequins in some places, and I wouldn't have noticed the difference. I can't call any of the characters particularly memorable, but if any of them were, they would all be found among he minor ones.",2,6,7,11 June 2010
Transformers," Everything I expected and more
","I'm 26 - one of the lucky people who got to grow up with the animated series, and once upon a time used to drive a plastic Optimus Prime around, and as a fan of the original, I must say I love this movie. It's everything I expected and some more.'Transformers' is probably the best cartoon-to-movie adaption I've seen so far. It's funny, with underlying seriousness, and honors the old animés. The actors work for me, and I won't say anything more about them, 'cause lets face it - this is not the movie to watch for the sake of human actors. (A regal curtsy to Shia LeBeouf, though, for his great interacting with the robots.) The robots, on the other hand, I could go on and on about. (Don't worry, I won't.) They look simply awesome. This is CG at its best; balanced and believable. From the moment Blackout started shooting things up and on, I sat with a happy grin on my face, that only got wider towards the end.The voices are better than I imagined. Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime will forever stand alongside sir Alec Guinness' Obi-Wan Kenobi in my memory, as two actors who managed to pull off some, at times, very difficult, bordering ridiculous dialog. Hugo Weaving is superb as Megatron, and makes the Decepticon leader the menacing madman he is. His 'You've failed me yet again, Starscream' was music to my ears. As a hardcore fan of the animés, perhaps I haven't been very critical about this movie, but I don't want to be either, because this IS Transformers.",8,6,10,24 July 2007
The Dark Knight," No words will do this justice
","This is... dark, horrifying, frightening... It is nothing short of a masterpiece.The story and script are magnificent. While leaving the movies, a friend said: 'I thought the first movie (note: Meaning Batman Begins) was dark, but it was nothing like this. There was no happy ending anywhere.' Well, is there ever? The darkest, most horrible thing about this movie, is that it's truthful: Good stands frustrated in the face of an evil that cannot be understood. Terrible things happen and we have few other choices but to endure them. We want someone to step up and end it, but few will add 'and that someone is me', because we know too well the cost. So we place our hope in the few who are willing to take the risks and make the sacrifices.'The Dark Knights' cast is wonderful all around, but one must be mentioned in particular, and it is the late Heath Ledger - may he rest in peace. His performance as a villain has no equal. In 'The Shining' Jack Nicholson gave me nightmares and in 'The Silence of the Lambs' Anthony Hopkins made my skin crawl, but Ledger's Joker surpasses them both. He is simply on a level of his own.Since I can't find the words to describe what I felt while watching this movie, I'll just give it the 10 out of 10 it deserves.",10,8,17,16 August 2008
Dark Shadows," Finally a love story worse than Twilight
","I never thought I'd write that, and it pains me to write this about a Tim Burton movie, but it was just bloody awful. The intro fast-forwards over events in the 18th century that transform the rich and successful fish business owner Barnabus Collins into a vampire, and shows us how he was sealed in a coffin and buried by an angry mob. When he wakes up about 200 years later, we are introduced to the 1970's Collins family: A charming bunch of quirky people, from the weird daughter to the alcoholic psychiatrist.It was set up for comedy to come, but there the fun sadly ended, and was replaced by endless, brain-numbing dialogs and colorful montages, followed by a deus ex machina ending.Most jokes are forced and the pacing erratic, but the biggest flaw of this movie is that it's absolutely impossible to find any kind of cohesive plot in it. Is it about restoring the family business? No, wait, maybe it's about the struggle between Barnabus and the witch that turned him into a vampire. Might be about Barnabus trying to become human again with the help of some unexplained procedure done by the alcoholic. No, apparently it's about the love story between two people we don't even hear talking to each other until 1,25 hours into the movie, but who 20 minutes later can't live without each other.Honestly, it's so nondescript that I can't even write a coherent review about it. It's not funny (apart from some scenes you see in the trailer), it's not dramatic, not scary, not romantic, and the characters sure aren't going to captivate anyone. I don't know what it's supposed to be, but the end result is a boring mess; more of a patch-work of desultory scenes than a movie.",2,12,21,18 September 2012
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The least bad of the worst
","After suffering through episode I and II, this movie sadly holds no surprises for me. I start watching, and after the nowadays apparently mandatory game hype sequence, once again I'm thrown straight into a scene I know nearly squat about. Before I've even had a chance to let my own fantasy make up for the missing bits, the screen starts filling up with all kinds of crap and before I know it, I'm suddenly in the middle of some sort of action. Don't really know why – don't really know what these people have done to get to where they are, but everything's moving fast and the not-so-special-anymore effects and comic relief count have already hit a six digit number, so there's really no time to try to figure it out either. Then there are some fights, count Dooku dies and a big space ship crashes, and after that, the story finally reconnects to one of the threads left hanging at the end of episode II. Although that just means that Anakin Skywalker meets up with wife Padmé Amidala and finds out that she's pregnant.Senator Palpatine, a.k.a. Darth Sidious, starts really working hard to manipulate Anakin (in a way so obvious they could probably see it from space) and Anakin's just the kind of gullible idiot to fall for it – despite being a very intuitive Jedi. The rest of the Jedi order however seem to be really suspicious of their young colleague, so they decide to monitor him and look into why he's so popular with senator Palpatine. Only they don't; they do absolutely nothing. In the meantime, the biggest evil conspiracy in history is taking place right under their hundreds of Force guided, future-seeing noses. (One Sith is able to fool hundreds of Jedi, but the dark side isn't stronger, huh?)After that, everything goes downhill, with the slaughter of Jedi, the rise of the Empire and the rapidly growing insanity, I guess of Anakin. Darth Sidious is exposed for what he is, and Yoda sets out to destroy him. During their fight, he falls down a couple of meters, but since the Jedi can jump very high, very fast he gets back up again and finishes what he started, since Jedi know no fear (path to the dark side, remember?). No, wait he gives up and runs for it. And here I thought killing the Sith should be a very good reason to risk your life In the mean time, Obi-Wan is busy fighting Anakin during an endless, passionless, but very well choreographed encounter, that anti-climatically ends with him chopping off his pupil's legs and remaining arm.'You were supposed to bring balance to the Force, not leave it in darkness!' he cries, before leaving his old friend burning and melting on a gravelly hillside.I might be wrong, but if you were to hand me one Sith and a whole bunch of Jedi, and then tell me to balance them up, logically I'd have to add a whole bunch of Sith, or decimate the number of Jedi to one. Balance is when the dark side and the good side are equally strong, right – or mutually powerful forces? Well, now we have two remaining Jedi, and two remaining Sith. I'd say it's nicely balanced. Was I really the only one who came to this conclusion when Qui-Gon started talking about 'bringing balance to the Force'? Guess the Jedi training didn't include math or logic If I'm wrong, then please explain in what way the Force was NOT in balance. Don't reference any kind of book, though, because if you have to write books to give sense to a movie, the movie is fundamentally lacking.And the ending: Luke and Leia are born, Darth Vader enters the stage, Padmé dies, Yoda hides, and the ground is laid for the only three Star Wars movies actually worthy of remembrance. I might even go so far as to say: The only three Star Wars movies worthy of watching.",3,1,5,12 March 2010
Prometheus," It's bad, plain and simple
","Meet the crew that must have been assembled by the lowest bidder, with a captain who's a crap pilot in need of 'all the help (he) can get' to take them across some thousand billion kilometers of space to find what some woman chooses to believe is the creator of the human race. By the time they get to the designated planet, they find some remarkable structure at first glance, and when they get to it, they remove their helmets, since the carbon dioxide level looks okay. Never mind all kinds of airborne stuff there could be.They find a stone panel full of goo, play a bit with the goo, and then go on to randomly press buttons until something happens. After a while, they encounter an alien corpse, by which time the biologist is too bored to do anything, and the geologist, although standing in a rocky tunnel on a foreign planet, concludes that there's nothing there for him to do since he likes rocks. They are now standing on dirt and gravel with worms crawling in it, but they do not take any samples of these. Instead, they take a severed alien head back to the ship and start poking it until it explodes, on the thesis that electricity can trick a presumed nervous system, in a life-form they know squat about, that's been dead for 2,000 years, into thinking it's alive again - whatever that would do for a severed head.Back in the tunnels the biologist, who couldn't be bothered with a well preserved corpse, discovers an alien cobra-like creature that simply pops up out of black ooze. He gets incredibly happy about this and attempts to play with it. It's okay, he's a biologist who knows about these things. Oh wait, it's an alien and it breaks his arm and melts the face of the geologist. It's a bit different from your average little snake then. Who could have guessed? The soulless robot on board has now started experimenting on his own, by mixing some alien goo into a crew-mate's drink. Said crew-mate soon starts noticing worms in his eyes. If it was me, I would have run screaming to the nearest doctor, but this guy doesn't say a word until he collapses while looking for the snake victims. Although he looks like a zombie and is clearly infested with something strange, the doctor in charge of the 'fail-safe' quarantine procedures insists on bringing him back on board the ship since 'he's sick'. No sh*t, Sherlock - he's changing color! A more cautious crew-member has to torch the guy, since no-one else seems to care about safety. Not until then the doctor starts thinking along the lines of 'hey, maybe someone else has been infected too'.The doctor (and by now I'm thinking that 'doctor' must be her first name, 'cause it sure as hell can't be a title) has actually been impregnated with an alien squid thingy by her infected now-dead boyfriend, but will not hear of being frozen until some actual surgeons can remove it from her body. (Who takes on a quadrillion mile journey without any kind of medical personnel, by the way?) Instead she finds some sort of automated surgery machine, presses some state-your-problem-buttons and voilà! The machine cuts her open, lifts out the squid and staples the skin (never mind all other tissue) on her stomach back together, and she's ready to go again. In fact, she's ready to run a marathon and jump hurdles. The thought of telling anyone she's had an alien squid-baby doesn't cross her mind, and no-one is interested in knowing why in the hell she's covered in blood and has a fresh surgical cut across her abdomen. Instead, they're going to go say hello to the one surviving member of the alien creator race left on the planet, so that the old fart who funded the expedition can hopefully cheat death.For no apparent reason, the crap pilot/captain is convinced that the creator race came to the planet to create a biological weapon, and a closer (probably first too) look at the scans of the tunnel shows the outlines of an alien space ship. After this actually, f**k it. It just keeps on being stupid, and everything in the ending just happens to make sure this movie can be connected to Alien in some way.All in all, it's so bad that I'm wondering if Ridley Scott actually made this himself, or if he just gave the project to some interns.",2,3,4,5 February 2013
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," ONE good movie in this saga, is that too much to ask?
","This is by far the best of the three Twilight-movies yet released. It's more amusing and nicer shot than it's prequels. But is it good? Nah. The Twilight movies are actually something as unusual as book adaptions so bad, they've made me dislike the books. And I used to LIKE the books.But regarding 'Eclipse': It depicts Victoria's attempt at getting revenge on the Cullens, by creating her own personal vampire army (or at least platoon), but the main focus is on Jacob and Edward, trying to out-do and outplay each other like hormonal little teenagers, all in the quest for Bella's love. Don't ask me why, 'cause I honestly can't fathom why anyone would like this girl. It's funny, but fact is, Jacob acts like a brat, and don't expect movie-Edward to be anything like novel-Edward. This is not the strong, secure 100+-year-old vampire from the books, but a mopey, uncertain tween, that has me wondering just what about him is supposed to be attracting to us. I can't help thinking that a guy who still hasn't gotten over the self-consciousness issues at 100+ years, probably won't ever. He's supposedly telepathic and very fast, but has now managed to get his ass somewhat to completely handed to him in 3 out of 3 movies, so this guy is clearly not fit to protect anyone either. If he was all standing between me and danger, I'd arm myself to my teeth or run like hell.Our female protagonist (also my main issue with this franchise) – though she does a better job in this movie than in the prequels - is still pretty much a hollow, emotionless shell, with less of a personality than my laptop. I can't see 'Bella' anywhere, just Kristen Stewart failing to act. This is an 'actress' with a range of 2-3 facial expressions; I prefer to describe them as bored and vacant, while my male friends consider her to look perpetually stupid and horny. Maybe that's why they like her...The rest of the cast do a decent enough job, we're given some new insights to some of the Cullen family members, but the action is quite boring, and the decision to make the vampires fully mobile while whole, but made of stone when broken, is rather incomprehensible, and makes them seem like porcelain dolls; fragile and very, very breakable. The first movie states that the only way to kill them is to rip them apart and burn the pieces, but in this movie, they just break into a heap of stone shards. How they manage to burn is beyond me. Heck, how they manage to MOVE is beyond me.As a tween sort of high school-comedy, Eclipse works. It'll even have you laughing at some points. But it doesn't really work as anything else.",3,7,11,29 October 2010
