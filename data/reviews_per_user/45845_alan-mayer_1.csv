Kill Bill: Vol. 2," What a masterpiece! Such a brilliant turn for Tarantino to make!
","I would like to say that I have read some comments already made of the film, one that gave a dissatisfied review. His comments made of the film were that it did not have a very clear love story shown between Bill and the Bride, and that the fight scenes were not of the caliber of Vol. 1. In reply, I would like to state that the love story was one of the most poignant touches in the whole film. You feel Uma's anguish in this piece, and you sense a very heartfelt love between the two when they share the screen together. The fight scenes were not that of the House of Blue Leaves sequence in Vol. 1, nor were they meant to be. This movie is a Spaghetti Western and Kung-fu epic at heart; it's ferocity and wit is astounding to see, and the writing is, above all, compelling. In fact, there is not a single piece of dialogue that lost me, and the flashbacks tie in to important sections of Uma's survival that I cannot reveal to you until you have seen it (wow, what a shock and surprise!). The dialogue may not be blunt and frank, but its depth speaks for itself. The story about the fish on the ground, or Superman's masked identity is probably one of the most awe-inspiring pieces of dialogue that I have ever heard. This is a film that brings back some of the things that have brought aboard fans of Tarantino. Granted, Vol. 1 is just as pleasing to Tarantino fans, but this one reminds us of the genius of Tarantino's writing, and what he brought back to cinema with Reservoir Dogs. This is a tour de force or massive cinematic power, it is Tarantino using his budget to the best of his ability, and is his ability exceptional! Prepare yourself for a classic!",10,0,1,19 April 2004
