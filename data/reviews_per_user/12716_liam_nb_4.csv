Source Code," The perfect simple SciFi movie
","It doesn't get much better than this for small scale SciFi movies.
Fantastic fantastic acting and performances from most of the cast.
An incredible plot based on a simple premise that continually gets more complex over time unraveling two mysteries over a short 90 minute movie and then developing an incredible surprising ending that sticks with you.
This film sticks out as a brilliant film in the SciFi Mystery genre maybe the best.",10,1,3,1 October 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Probably the best of star wars movie outside the clones wars and empire strikes back
","This captures everything star wars should be a star war it has a cast of well acted and good but flawed characters who are put up against a superior force and pull off the impossible but unlike the original trilogy it doesn't end well for our heroes which is a great twist on the normal formula where you expect all the good guys to live.
On to the truly great bits the action scenes fast paced and incredible visuals and sound make them very effective unlike a lot in the sequels and prequels and even some in the original trilogy they have a lot of weight to them you feel the harshness of the rebel struggle like in the battle of both, also a rebel ship Rams a star destroy into another one and Darth Vader cuts up a bunch of rebels at the end it's absolutely class.
There are notable bad parts like the underuse of Mads Mikkleson or Forest Whitaker and the weird grand moff tarkin CGI also Diego Luna is a bit bland in it compared to Donnie Yen and Felicity Jones Eve Alan Tudyk as the cool Droid does a damn sight better job than him the pilot guy I can't remember his name is also good got some fun lines nothing to special, overall great acting brings a lot to the star wars brand more than the sequels and prequels do it's no clone wars but it's probably better than return of the Jedi definitely worth watching even if you don't like star wars it doesn't rely on nostalgia to be good like force awakens clearly does.",10,1,1,14 May 2020
Predator," A classic for a reason
","This along with recall, commando and the running man have remarkably low review and meta scores they are brilliant classic action movies pure brilliant no holds barred cheesy SciFi with incredible one liners and dumb bad guy plots but this one stands out beyond the rest.
Predator starts off great with an attack on a village featuring The best line in the movie not from Schwarzenegger unfortunately 'I ain't got time to bleed' but he has a good one in the firefight throwing a sword at someone proclaiming 'stick around' it's the 80s at its best.
The movie slows down a bit but it introduces the only thing tough enough to take on Schwarzenegger and his band of muscle bound gun toting Soldiers the predator the coolest alien hunter in scifi toting plasma castor's and invisibity both of which he uses to decimate the special forces team leading to a brilliant climax with man vs alien that man being Arnold Schwarzenegger screaming like a mad man.
This movie has great action and is a permanent staple on pop culture it also brings the table an incredible soundtrack and a pretty groundbreaking story in the SciFi genre.",10,0,1,5 October 2019
Black Panther," Overrated, overhyped, bad CGI and poorly written
","This movie is really bad not because it's the worst movie ever no not even close it's just people say it's the best movie ever and it's not at all it's not even the best movie with black panther in it.
Stop the overhyping.",2,17,27,30 April 2019
