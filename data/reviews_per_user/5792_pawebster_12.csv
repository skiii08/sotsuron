United 93," Not as good as Flight 93
","This is a very well-meaning and honestly-made film, and I would no doubt of thought very highly of it, had I not first seen the TV movie Flight 93.Some people seem to think that a TV movie cannot on principle be as good as a cinema film, but, at least in this case, it isn't so.United 93 fails to make the passengers into real, living individuals. The families did not want them to be named or singled out, out of respect for the rest, but this is to the detriment of film-making. It means that we cannot empathize with them very much.A very interesting and moving feature of the real-life tragedy was the fact that the passengers were able to phone home during the crisis - something new in the history of hijacking. Flight 93 makes the most of that. This film, though, pares it right down to repeated brief shots of people saying 'I love you' and 'Just tell them I love them'. Here again, I suspect that the families, understandably, had a lot of influence.The upshot is: see the other film instead.",6,0,3,10 September 2009
Elizabeth," Elizabeth the Great -- pity about the story
","Contains minor spoiler(s) Cate Blanchett is wonderful in this film. The title is simply Elizabeth, she IS Elizabeth and she carries the whole thing with great assurance and skill. It is very believable that Elizabeth was like this.The Elizabethan era is a fascinating one, with wonderful stories and also great visual appeal. What I can't understand is why the film makers cast all that aside -- seemingly in the belief that they could do better.Visually, the film seems to be set in the deepest Middle Ages and not in Tudor Times. Tudor aristocrats did not live among bare stone walls, or in Queen Mary's case, what looks rather like the Batcave. I suppose Tudor colourfulness had been 'done' too often before, and the urge to be original and different took over.It's a shame that the story is mainly nonsense and events and personalities from Elizabeth's long reign are just jumbled together and scandalously travestied in some cases. There would be plenty to go on in the real events, e.g. the mysterious death of Dudley's wife (whom Elizabeth knew about all along, having been a guest at the wedding).It's true there was plenty of fornication in Tudor times, but this particular fornication is more than doubtful. It seems quite likely that Elizabeth really was the Virgin Queen. However, this would never do for a modern version, where sex scenes are a must. The Zeitgeist of the 1990s was clearly far more powerful in the film makers' imaginations than the 16th century. Pity.",7,0,1,31 October 2005
Full Metal Jacket," At the gas works
","I enjoyed this the most of the Vietnam films I've seen. It's a weird film in many ways. Many have commented on the fact that it is actually two films rather flimsily stuck together. The first half, on the training, is rightly famous as the most extreme of its genre, but let's face it, it was not exactly a new idea, even in the mid 80s. An Officer and a Gentleman had visited the area not many years before. The way that that sequence ends is overdone in my view. It's certainly not subtle.What makes FMJ better than other films, such as Platoon or Hamburger Hill, is that it has some humanity about it. The end sequence with the sniper is touching. In contrast, Platoon goes so far in showing that War Is Hell and Life Is Meaningless that one starts to lose interest. Meaninglessness is actually uninteresting.It shares with other Vietnam films the problem that we don't really get to know the characters enough and cannot sufficiently follow or empathise with their motivation and actions. Matthew Modine's character can be summarised as 'nice guy with a sense of irony' and that's about all. This is not really enough to carry the film.For a British viewer like me, it's hard to forget that this was almost entirely filmed in England, a country not exactly famous for its similarity in geography and climate to the jungles of S.E. Asia. The use of the old Beckton gasworks as Hue City is weird. It's very obvious that no one is sweating and no one is fighting off mosquitoes, etc. They were probably wishing they could wear overcoats at the time!",7,1,3,25 July 2006
Dunkirk," Unconvincing
","I expected to love this. But I didn't. I'm no expert, but even I could see a lot of obvious faults. I'm not just talking about things like modern buildings (which are very evident), but the lack of atmosphere. At the start of the film, the beach is crowded, quite rightly - but after that, it's pretty empty when we see it. Where are the heaps of ruined vehicles, etc? All dead bodies are completely intact. There's no blood at all. The Germans are never called the Germans ('the enemy'). How are we supposed to believe that over 300,000 got back to England? Apart from the near empty beaches, we almost only see people NOT making it home. As for the 'little ships', apart from the Mark Rylance once, thirty or so of them arrive all together as a neat flotilla to cheer up Kenneth Branagh. And how long does a Spitfire take to come down after it runs out of fuel?",4,0,2,16 January 2018
The Lives of Others," Moving
","Since about 2004, Germany has been producing some interesting films looking at and reworking its history (Sophie Scholl, The Downfall, Napola). This is one of the first 'serious' films to go into the dark aspects of the old East Germany. It's all about the Stasi (secret police) undermining and ruining people's lives, in this case the lives of prominent writers and actors. In the process -- and this is one of the unbelievable parts with no known historical precedent, as far as I'm aware -- the main surveillance person (Ulrich MÃ¼he) warms somewhat to his victims and sees the emptiness of his own life.Unfortunately, the film muddies the waters by making sex a major motive. This is unnecessary, irrelevant and also without much historical foundation.It is very well acted by all concerned and successfully conjures up the required atmosphere.It is one of those very 'small', low-budget German films (like Sophie Scholl) that in Britain would be a TV film and would never make it into a cinema. Presumably for financial and prestige reasons, films like this are shown on general release in cinemas in Germany.In fact, it does not require a cinema at all, since there is nothing that calls for a big screen. My tip would be to wait for it to come out on DVD.",7,11,43,28 March 2006
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Worthy, but a bit smug
","The word 'worthy' definitely suggests itself. This is a high-minded film made by people committed to the values of freedom and civil liberties. Goodness knows we need such people.One problem is, though, that we know the story before we start. It is an essentially simple one and does not take long to tell.Another, bigger one, is that the film is self-congratulatory: The idea is that we right-thinking people (or our predecessors) win out over our nasty opponents, and we are very pleased with ourselves for being so right. Don't get me wrong: I support the values promoted in the film, but it's like reading a newspaper that exactly reflects your own views. There is something a bit arid about it.Nevertheless, it is well made and very well acted by all concerned.",5,1,2,30 January 2009
Black Hawk Down," Who's who?
","OK, it's gritty, it's realistic and it shows us like many, many, many other films before it that war is hell, but American soldiers are buddies and heroes.What it adds is to document a true incident and its ensemble playing (that we also see in films like Band of Brothers, made around the same time). As in BOB, it's hard to follow who's who. One man in a scruffy uniform and covered in grime looks much like another. It was only when I looked at the cast list that I realised some of the well-known actors who were in it. I'd completely failed to spot a few of them while watching the film.The story goes on for a long time on the same note of non-stop action. This may be true to life, but in a film it's wearing.Others have well noted the racism implied in the film.",6,0,1,5 July 2006
The Great Raid," Dull throwback to old war films
","They might have got away with this if we had never seen Private Ryan or (especially) Band of Brothers. This is a war film as they made them in the fifties - handsome film actors wearing uniforms, but not seeming like soldiers, people being shot dead without any blood appearing (see especially the scene when white-clad hospital staff are gunned down) and virtually no swearing.It is desperately badly written, especially at the start: long periods of dull exposition, including the fatal use of dialogue in which characters, for the sake of the audience, tell each other things they already know.The PoWs are not nearly skinny enough. I know this is a tough one to get even nearly right, but the photos of the time show men who were walking skeletons.James Franco is terrible. He seems to have the idea that to act a tough guy he has to speak in a droning monotone. He sounds as if he is on a heavy dose of diazepam.Give this a miss.",3,1,7,2 February 2009
Titanic," Over-hyped commercialism
","This is a bad film. When I say 'bad', I mean it in a whole range of senses. Just a few of them: The fictitious love story is anachronistic, exploitative and implausible (he gets a monkey suit and gatecrashes the First Class?). The way a modern-movie-style sex scene is fitted into the film just stinks.Even the special effects -- so highly praised -- are suspect in my book. The ship gliding through the water does not look real. It is somehow 'flat'.The scene where Jack dies in the water is nearly as laughable as the unforgettable death scene in 'Love Story'.Even calling the ship 'Titanic' instead of 'The Titanic' is wrong.It just goes to show what hype, hype and yet more hype can achieve.",4,3,7,29 January 2006
The Good Shepherd," Zombies run CIA
","What was Matt Damon on? What was he being paid for? A waxwork puppet could have taken his place and we wouldn't have noticed. (Perhaps that did in fact happen.) As others have noted, he doesn't even age convincingly.I can't judge all of the details, but some things I do know about and they were got wrong. How can film companies spend millions on a production and not bother to get one line of German text correct, printed in large type at the top of a list of the members of the German American Cultural Committee? It was presumably done by an early version of Google Translator. Yes, it's that bad.In wartime London Michael Gambon and Matt Damon meet outdoors at night. Streetlights are blazing all around. Er, what about the blackout? Were they in fact traitors trying to help the Luftwaffe aim better? And who let Billy Crudup get away with that accent? Crud's the word. He sounded like a well-educated German speaking English. I briefly wondered if that were part of the plot.Sheesh!",5,2,3,3 January 2010
Valkyrie," Good, but Tom Cruise?
","It's a good film and fairly accurate historically. Very commendably for a Hollywood film, it is designed for adults and not popcorn munching adolescents. It doesn't dumb the subject down and is not afraid to be rather talky.A lot of money was clearly spent on it, on special effects and period detail. It is packed with top class actors (most of them British, with a scattering of Germans). One snag: Tom Cruise. Is he anyone's idea of a cultured Prussian aristocrat of seventy years ago? He's certainly not mine. His demeanour, his body language and his accent all shout 'modern American film star'. Basically, he plays a slightly modified version of himself. Was this really necessary to pull in the audience? I hope it wasn't.",8,0,5,15 November 2012
V for Vendetta," Like Dr Who but more pretentious
","It looks quite good, but where the content should be there is just pretentious nonsense. It's all rather like an extended version of Dr Who but with less humour and with added swearing and violence.I thought Natalie Portman was good, and her English accent was convincing. Hugo Weaving was badly handicapped by the mask, and he basically sounded as if he were narrating a children's story to be sold on CD.There were some Americanisms that jarred in the British setting, such as 'protest something' for 'protest AGAINST something' and the pronunciation 'levver' for 'lever' (which is pronounced like 'leaver' in British English).It would be suitable for children and young teenagers if it weren't for some of the content and language. For adults it is a bit too childish in my opinion -- so it ends up as suitable for nobody.",4,3,10,13 November 2007
