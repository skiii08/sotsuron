Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I am in the Star Wars-heaven again!
","I have just seen 'Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace' here in Sweden (it had its opening tonight) and I am in the 'Star Wars-heaven' again!! I love the new movie because it is so thrilling (is that the right word?), beautiful, AMAZINGLY beautiful, mystic, breathtaking, GREAT, wonderfully written and told, lightbringing and I feel once again like I did as a child when 'Star Wars:Episode IV' enchanted the world! Thank you, George, for your incredible wonderful story that takes place in a galaxy far, far away but that still feels so close in my heart and soul. Thank you!! You are a lightbringer in a dark world! I can not almost wait for the next two coming Star Wars-movies, but I guess that I do not have another choice... :) Now I am going to sleep and decide on which day I will go and see 'Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace' again!!! Take care! 'Let the force be with you! Always...'",9,7,9,19 August 1999
