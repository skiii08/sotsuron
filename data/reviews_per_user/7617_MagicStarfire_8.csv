The New World," I thought it was rotten eggs - but no - it was this movie!
","3 stars During the film, Pochontas says: 'We are grass.' Whatever the heck that means. I think it meant whoever authored this mess smoked way too much grass while writing it.The film is filled with this kind of babbling, pseudo-poetic nonsense by all the characters - that is - what time they bother to speak to each other at all. Frequently questions are asked by one character to another, but never answered.Pochontas is especially mute. Even after she learns English, Pochontas rarely says more than the occasional word or two, preferring apparently to spend most of her time looking expressionlessly at the ground.By the way, the young actress playing Pochontas had such a fat upper lip I could only conclude she'd had a collagen injection for it. I don't know why she didn't have the bottom lip done, perhaps she ran out of money. Now that she's made this film, maybe she'll have the funds to finish distorting both of her lips.The handsome Irish actor, Colin Farrell plays Capt. John Smith. What time he isn't rambling like a degenerate in need of a brain transplant, he just looks nervous, worried, or scared. Come to think of it - that's the only three expressions I've ever seen Colin portray in any film I've ever seen him in. Fortunately, in 'Phone Booth' these 3 expressions did him well. In 'The New World', he could have done with a bit more diversity.Throughout the film, John Smith remains looking as if his hair is greasy and like he needs a thorough scrubbing, even when he isn't in the wilderness, but in England.Now my history books always led me to believe there was never any romance between Pochontas and Capt. John Smith, but bear in mind folks, this is Hollywood, and Hollywood films invariably write history to suit themselves. So, of course, we have to have a romance between John Smith and Pochontas, even though, as we all know, she marries a man named Rolfe.I can't imagine who would find any interest in this draggy film beyond either fans of the actors/actresses in it, or an avid history buff.I had looked forward to seeing this film. It should have been interesting. The way it was done - it was not.",3,3,8,20 June 2006
Walk the Line," Not much to do with how his life really was, but very entertaining film
","I gave this 10 stars because the film is well done and highly entertaining, although upon reading a biography about Johnny Cash, I discovered the film is not very true to it.The film leads one to believe that Johnny Cash had no particular ambitions to be a performer when he first married Vivian. The facts are, he was not only writing his own songs by age twelve, but while in high school he performed on a radio station and he continued doing this after meeting and marrying Vivian.I don't know if Johnny ever tried to sell things door to door, but he did work in Detroit for awhile. He also attended college, something you'd never guess from watching 'Walk the Line.' He also went to New York in real life and completely left Vivian and his children behind when he did so. Again - not reflected in the film.Why Hollywood can't just tell the story the way it was really lived I've never understood. The man's real life was a highly interesting story and did not need to be fictionalized.There are, of course, some accuracies in the film. I do believe he and June Carter were each other's greatest loves.There is also lots of fine music in the film, which I greatly enjoyed. Both Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon do absolutely bang-up jobs in their portrayals of Johnny and June.I was particularly impressed with Joaquin Phoenix, he is a very handsome man and gives off a sexual intensity that is almost palpable. I found him completely riveting.So don't go into this film expecting to see Johnny and June's real life stories, but if you just want to be entertained this film surely does that.",10,0,0,20 June 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Well Done Fantasy Film
","9 stars out 10 This film contains quite a lot of violence and dark scenes that are very threatening in nature. I would not recommend a very young child viewing this. I think it is too frightening and intense. A mature eight year old might could handle it, ten would be better.There were things I most definitely liked about this story/film, and a few things I didn't.They seemed to have a little problem with the way the wolves walked/moved, but over all, the special effects were brilliant.I enjoy films that feature mystical creatures and beasts such as the minotaur, centaurs, fauns, unicorns and the like, as well as all the animals talking.The story revolves around 4 English siblings during WWII, who accidentally discover the wonderful world of Narnia.Narnia is in deep trouble, however, and therein lies both the source of an interesting tale and some clichés that we really need to move past.I was pleased that a little girl (it's always a little boy) is the first to discover Narnia, even though the actress who played her was mud ugly, poor thing.And I was completely delighted with the faun who comes into the picture early, along with the magnificent lion and all the other creatures.However, I noted Mr. Beaver could have been a little nicer to his wife, there are some put-downs by him I could have done without.We also have the old tired cliché of the wolves being the vicious bad guys, and the only powerful adult female in the film is, as so frequently happens, depicted as mean and evil. The fact two girls (sisters) are in the film, as well as their brothers, does off-set this some, I will admit.Another gripe I have is the old cliché of the outsiders come to this troubled world and they are, of course, the only ones who can fix the problem. Then after they fix the problem, they are promptly fawned over as heroes by the entire population and raised to a very high social level.WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD: While I assume Edmund learned his lesson, it would have been nice to have actually heard him apologize to the lion and to his siblings.The lion sacrificing himself for worthless Edmund set very poorly with me, even though it turns out all right for the lion. I just didn't like that it happened at all.I also felt the lion should have been the king of Narnia not a bunch of outside kids, and if there needed to be more than one throne occupied then make them be the lion, the faun, and the two beavers. Maybe they should make that five thrones, and include the brave fox. Although the fox is killed I would assume he could be brought back since everybody else good that got killed or frozen could.",9,1,1,24 June 2006
The Notebook," Beautiful, Beautiful Love Story
","Films seldom make me cry, but this one sure did.This has to be one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever seen on film.The photography is also quite beautiful with the lakes and the moonlight on the water and the birds flying.I wish men really did love women this much, but I've never seen any evidence that they do. Nonetheless the characters, and their story grabbed me from the start.The film opens with an older man, James Garner, reading a story to an older woman, the still beautiful, Gena Rowlands, at a nursing home.We then move back into the 1940's and meet Noah and Allie, the young couple in the story, who first encounter one another at a carnival. Noah is instantly and completely smitten with Allie, but she takes a bit more convincing regarding him.Eventually, however, they are both wildly in love with one another - but there are complications. Allie comes from upper crust people, Noah does not.It seems they are destined to be parted. Allie meets another wonderful young man, Lon, while she does some nursing during WWII, while Noah loses himself in the renovation of a beautiful, old, ruined plantation house. I fell in love with that house almost as much as I did with the characters and the story.Will they cross one another's paths again, and what might be the consequences if they do? The answer to this plays out in a highly interesting way and ties in with the two older people we meet at the beginning of the film, in an unexpected and heartbreaking way.Allie is fetchingly played by the very pretty Rachel McAdams, and Noah is portrayed quite sensitively by Ryan Gosling. Ryan Gosling, whom I had never seen before, as far as I know, reminded me quite a lot of Adrian Brody - another fine actor who is excellent at playing sensitive types.This is an exceptional film of depth and beauty.10 stars out of 10 stars.",10,0,1,14 March 2006
Brokeback Mountain," This film frustrates me on many levels
","I gave it 7 stars because, as a lesbian, I do want to see more film stories of gay and lesbian people, but the reason it did not rate a higher score with me was because I felt so angry and frustrated, both by the characters and by the story itself and how it is presented.I know what it was like in the 60's, I lived in the era in which this film was set.While we did not have the tolerance we have now--it was not impossible for two unmarried men to live together. Many did. Some were gay, some were not. Gays did have to stay in the closet then, but these characters, don't even have the guts to do that! I think their lack of backbone aggravated me about as much as anything in this film.They never do anything to make things better between them.The other highly unsatisfactory thing about this film is that the men are portrayed as if being homosexual is just a choice. They have no obvious problems in being with women.Nor do we get any backstory on them regarding sexual orientation when they were growing up.The sex between them is very sudden, with no lead-in, no hint whatsoever that homosexuality has ever even crossed either of them's minds.Jack is made to be the 'gayer' of the two, in that he does eventually get it on with a couple of other guys. Ennis never does. Yet even Jack marries, fathers a child, and remains married. He and his wife drift apart somewhat, but no more so than a straight couple might.Both Jack and Ennis are portrayed as losers. Ennis never makes a decent wage. Jack marries into money, but his father in law barely manages to tolerate him.The two lead actors do their parts well, and there's beautiful Wyoming scenery, but this film really did no great service to the gay community as far as I am concerned.",7,2,28,18 May 2006
Crash," One of the most honest films you will ever see
","This film was certainly deserving of the Oscar it won. It is excellent in every regard - writing, photography, directing, acting, storyline and character development. It just simply doesn't fail anywhere.The film is well paced and highly interesting - showing very versatile people in ways that make them seem completely three dimensional and real - so that the viewer should never fail to see where each character is coming from, why he or she thinks, feels, and behaves as they do and what their motivation is.The characters themselves, however, frequently fail to truly see themselves or the other person or persons with whom they are interacting.While racism and preconceived beliefs are at the heart of this story, I think it also has something to say about how the fact common courtesy has fallen by the wayside contributes to the friction in society. Almost every time one of these characters is frustrated in some way, they react with immediate anger, insults, and sometimes violence.The other problem these characters have, to use an old quote of Strother Martin from Cool Hand Luke: 'What we have here is a failure to communicate.' If only people could learn from this film how wonderful that would be, but I know that's too much to hope for.I gave this film 10 stars - and it deserved every one of them.",10,2,8,13 April 2006
The Machinist," Inside the Dark Places of the Mind
","Christian Bale's appearance in this film is startling to say the least. He lost approximately 80 lbs. to portray Trevor Reznik, a character on the verge of a nervous breakdown, and he does an absolutely brilliant job of it. This is as close I ever want to get to witnessing someone having a nervous breakdown. Christian's portrayal is extremely realistic.Trevor Reznik is a nice guy, quiet, and kind of shy, and definitely the type that would bring out the maternal side in a woman, with his gaunt features and haunted eyes.Trevor works as a machinist. The machines there can be dangerous, men sometimes lose fingers, a hand, occasionally even an arm.Trevor's only friend is Stevie, a prostitute, but he begins to make friends as well with a very kind and beautiful waitress named Maria, who is divorced and has a little boy, Nicholas.Trevor is having problems, however. He can't sleep. In the film, he tells Stevie he has not slept for a year. Actually, a person could not go a year without sleeping, so perhaps it only seems that way to Trevor.We do not know until almost the end of the film, the reason for Trevor's sleeplessness, weight loss and other problems. On our journey to the answers, we are kept in a state of high tension by Trevor's growing suspicion of a plot by his co-workers and the mysterious and sinister Ivan, who keeps inserting himself into Trevor's life.I would call this film psychological horror. It is very well done, and certainly held my interest throughout.9 stars.",9,2,2,1 June 2006
War of the Worlds," Tom and 2 tedious kids vs the aliens
","It's one of those movies where the main characters are so unlikeable I almost wanted the aliens to get them--at least maybe then Dakota Fanning could stop screaming. Those screeches of hers were like fingernails on a blackboard.Dakota Fanning spends 90% of this movie screaming shrilly. I'm surprised the child had any voice left by the end of the film. Tom, who plays her Daddy and spends quite a bit of his time holding the kid, probably completely lost his hearing from her shrill screams.Tom Cruise plays Ray Ferrier, a rather irresponsible, divorced Dad with a smart-mouthed son, an older teenager named Robbie (Justin Chatwin--who actually kind of resembles Tom enough to look like he could be his son), and a blond-haired daughter, Rachel (Dakota Fanning)who looked be about six years old and her behavior would have certainly put her at around that age--but we learn she is ten.It's Ray's turn to have the kids for the week-end when all hell breaks loose in the form of an attack by outer-space aliens. The rest of the film consists of action, running here, there and yon to try to escape from the encroaching aliens.The film is overly long at two hours, and could have easily been told in an hour, or an hour and a half at best.As usual with this type of film, the special effects are the real stars, and they are well done.5 stars out of 10 - as I considered it only an average film.",5,0,0,23 May 2006
