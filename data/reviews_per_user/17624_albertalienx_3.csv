Sucker Punch," A massive mess
","Mr.Snyder previous films -300 and Watchmen- were eye candy gems, even thought the narrative was weak and simple, their comic-cool visual style compensate it. 'Sucker Punch' is a pure mess of random ideas thrown without absolute no sense one scene after another. There is no sense of danger, the characters have no depth, and everything indeed looks like a cool 2 hours video clip featuring pretty young ladies without no brain cells. If you enjoy a well written film with intriguing plot and twist, with rich and well developed characters, please avoid this film at all cost. If you don't mind watching a 2 hour non-sense video clip, well then maybe this is your film.",3,10,24,27 March 2011
Dark Shadows," Actually quite good!
","Just saw the film, and contrary to most the of critics, I found the film entertaining, meaningful and quite hilarious. Some people seems to complain Mr. Tim Barton lost his magic compared to Beetlejuice, Batman, etc., but instead I find Mr. Barton has moved to somewhat more emotional film. I like the films was about family bounds, and at the end how everything is tide up altogether.The pace of the film is rather slow, but I like it that way, instead of making it super fast like a video clip. I did enjoy Mr. Deep as always, he brings his classical witty caricature on scene. I also appreciated the rather quiet, minimalistic sense of humor of the film.",8,2,4,5 October 2012
Prometheus," The answer to the question...
","Sometimes, more than the answer to the question, it is more relevant to analyze the nature of the question itself, and that is what this film is all about. 'Where do we came from?', 'Why they made us?' ask the mains characters of this film, and the answer may lie between the powerful imaginary of the film and the horror that the characters have to go through. If you have followed Mr. Ridly Scott filmography, chances are you are gonna pretty much love this film. Beautiful landscape, strong characters (funny thing, the robot is the most interesting character of all), strong visuals, what else can you ask for? A strong, beautiful and yet terrifying film.",9,8,14,18 August 2012
