","Gets even a six because of the concept. Ending is a huge let down. It's like you expect a fitting dessert to a great meal, and you are given chocolate bars in bright wrappers which only a child would crave.don't be fooled by people who compare it with Inception when saying 'the ending left more questions than answers'. Not even close to raising any question worth the story.The trailers were where people used the most brains - to make it seem worth the money. Sure, acting is good, albeit cheesy at times. Jake Gyllenhall was good in Donnie Darko, he's good in Source Code.Even though it was a total waste of my money and time, you still have to watch it to make sure you did not miss out on anything. That's the trick of the industry!",6,1,3,2 May 2011
Cloud Atlas," nice!!!
","If you are reading this, you either just watched the movie and looking for another guy's take at it, or you wanted to know what all this hullabaloo is, about the film being confusing, and if you should watch it.For those who watched the movie: Yes, I loved the movie, and will watch it another time for sure ...No, I am not discussing the message conveyed ... it's a movie ... it's not 'GOD' talking to you ... it's just a story with many stories seemingly interwoven ...For those trying to see if it's worth watching: 1. It's one of those movies which, if you are a dreamer, will linger in your head for quite sometime, and make you want to watch the movie again and again just to be a part of all those different situations so grandly, cinematography-wise, depicted.2. If you are one of those whodunit fans, you would also like to watch it again, and again, so that you can discuss it with your friends over your social lubricant of choice. Of course, you'll say something like 'yeah, it's nice, but not clever like Inception' ...3. If you do not like giving people the credit for doing something different just for the sake of it, you will probably love to hate the movie for creating so much 'hype' among lesser mortals.4. It's not the best movie ever...5. The credits portion after the movie has something interesting ...6. If you were able to read this review till here, you have the patience to watch this movie ... :)",9,4,15,27 October 2012
