The Blair Witch Project," Over hyped crap
","When people mention over hyped crap this movie should be included at the top of the list.  Before I went to see this movie I had heard and read many reviews saying that it was a very good movie and the scariest movie of all time.  the Blair witch Project was neither of these.  The movie was boring and was not scary in the least.  But, if you want a good movie to sleep through i highly recommend The Blair Witch Project.",2,0,2,7 September 1999
