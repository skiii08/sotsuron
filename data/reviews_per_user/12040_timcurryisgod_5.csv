Frost_Nixon," Entertaining performances
","Great performances from Langella as Nixon, and Sheen as David Frost. For fans of 1970's movies or political lore/ history, after viewing this you might enjoy All The President's Men with Hoffman and Redford. Really a pleasure to watch the performances of Sheen and Langella; it's amazing how convincing Langella is as Nixon because he doesn't really favor him physically (Langella is very handsome), but the voice and delivery are done so well one suspends any disbelief. Of course Michael Sheen looks like everyone he's ever portrayed, most notably Tony Blair.This film, say unlike 'The Final Days' overall, shows context and footage of the damage done to civilians and their lives and land in Vietnam and Cambodia.",8,0,0,21 July 2019
The Babadook," Don't watch unless you WANT to b scared!
","Let me explain how scary this is: I've seen this movie in its entirety before. Been a couple years since I've seen it. Was looking for a good scary movie, disappointed with current finds. I started watching this one again, and had to turn it off halfway through. Nope; don't need to be that scared r/n thanks.",9,0,2,19 November 2019
The Shining," All time classic horror film
","This film is simply beautiful. Shelley Duvall is indefatigable and subtle in her role as Wendy Torrance, wife of Jack Torrance (played by Nicholson). I believe this film is a part of Jack Nicholson; there is a craziness to him that is compelling but frightful. The actors are perfectly cast. I was really unprepared for the stunning visual beauty of this film. I had expected it to be somehow 'corny,' or 'jump- scare' predictable. It is amazing to watch Nicholson's character transform....don't want to give too much away for subsequent readers of IMDb who may not yet have viewed this classic. The interior scenes are almost an allegory to the writer's (Jack Torrance, played by Nicholson) empty pages, waiting to be filled; the interior shots are striking; huge, vast expanses of the hotel which stretch out for what seems scores of yards, yet lending a menacing, fearful feel to the writer's doubt and apprehension that he will ever be able to complete his task. One the one hand, a huge, beautiful empty, quiet hotel in the dead of winter seems the idyllic atmosphere for a visiting muse, but on the other hand, something is underneath the exterior calm; something distressing. Truly visually beautiful and suspenseful throughout. I hadn't realized that the interiors of the hotel in the film were based on Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park (per Wiki) and that a sound stage *as big as* the exterior of the real life hotel was built for production. It's fascinating to read about the production of this film, and how it compares to the book (by Stephen King). A true horror classic, and yet surely a groundbreaking film in so many ways. This film cements Nicholson's acting brilliance, and is another Kubrick classic.",9,0,1,22 August 2017
The Machinist," Watch this film alone, then watch it again
","If you like thrillers/ mysteries esp. psychological thrillers or dramas, this movie is one of the best ever. Even without regard to genre, this is just a superb movie. If possible (albeit you're reading reviews right now) watch this movie knowing as little about it beforehand as possible. Watch it alone (so you can really observe it), and then watch it again. Freaking fantastic movie; such a human story. Unforgettable...If you are a lover of classic horror, you will adore this film. Just as 'The Shining' is one of the most visually beautiful and ominous horror film classics, 'The Machinist' is a dark, riveting, crescendo of suspense, and so much more than that; it is so purely human...Here's how good this film is: it is as if O. Henry made a psychological thriller/ horror film. Sheer brilliance. So beautiful, so poignant. You will cry. I love this film.",10,1,3,22 August 2017
Climax," France, who hurt you?
","Hoping for an updated 'Blue Sunshine,' meets 'Suspiria,' but this was literally trash. What a shame to waste dancing on this excrement.",2,1,3,30 December 2019
