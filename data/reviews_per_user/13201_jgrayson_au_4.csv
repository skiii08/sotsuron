National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Decent, but less than the first one.
","This review contains potential spoilers to both National Treasure movies.The first National Treasure had a quite precise plot line. We knew who was the good guy, who was the bad guy, and who laid the treasure hunt out in the first place (that is, the Masons).With Book of Secrets, this is where it comes unstuck. Gone are many of the puzzles, and a cohesive plot. We have a bad guy (Ed Harris) who switches between wanting to kill the heroes, and saving their lives, within scenes. And we don't truly even understand who laid all the hard work for the treasure hunt in the first place.With all that said, it's still decent. It's still got much of the same charm and characteristics of the first movie. If you liked the first one, you'll more than likely like this one too, but it probably won't be as good as you hope.The movie suffers mostly from a lack good script consistency. However due to the success of this movie, and other things that happen within this film, there is a potential set up for another National Treasure. If they do make a third, a clearer defined script will bring the series back on track.All round, it was decent. 6/10",4,1,1,6 January 2008
Watchmen," Simply Brilliant
","First up, an acknowledgment. I've never read the graphic novel. So my review is entirely based on the movie. Short version, 10/10, and simply brilliant.For a starters, this movie --is not kid friendly--. This is a story for the adults, and it is well worth it. I've taken my nephew to see Ironman, The Incredible Hulk etc, this is not a movie in the same league, not even really in the same genre.To describe the movie's plot, I feel, is to subtract from the whole. There are many things going on at once, and when talking to a friend I described it as 'Pulp Fiction' in a comic book universe. On reflection, this really seems to me an accurate description. Whilst there are some 'comic book' moments of action and fighting etc, this movie is all about the story. There are a handful of stories going on at the same time and, honestly, each and every one was great.Do not be fooled by the 'comic book' nature of the movie. The story line is one of the greatest I have seen in a while, where, at the end of the movie, I left wondering which 'side' I would choose. There is virtually no 'good guys and bad guys' situation, each character is a 3 dimensional person with flaws, good points, and bad.Will be seeing again two or three times. Simply brilliant.",9,2,5,15 March 2009
Captain America: Civil War," It's really good, but still flawed.
","As I write this, I think Captain America Civil War is still to release in the USA. It's sitting at #89 on IMDb and it's been universally loved. I really love the MCU as a collected whole, and Captain America Civil War is one of the best, but if I'm going to review it honestly, it's still flawed.Flaw 1: Action scenes in shaky cam. Was Paul Greengrass a cameo director? The first couple of fight scenes were very hard to see with camera movement. And after ironically seen the trailer for Jason Bourne I was looking forward to dolly shot action sequences. Nope. They were very 'Bournesque.' The now famous airport battle was thankfully rather still (I'd imagine due to the heavy CGI), but the earlier fight sequences would have been far better shot if we could have seen the action.Flaw 2: Minor Spoiler. The character motives. The motives for the fight with Civil War, especially at the end, was very personal. For all 3 of the main characters - Bucky, Stark and Rogers - it became a personal battle. I think this was a flaw of the Civil War issue. The reason Civil War was so brilliant a story arc in the comics was that it was ideological. The movie had tones and set up the reasons, but by the end it became a personal grudge match. And worse, the characters behaved in ways that seemed to contradict their own actions earlier within the movie. Stark was especially guilty of this by the end of the movie. Overall it was an 'acceptable' plot, but it would have been nicer to keep closer to the ideological battle of Civil War.Flaw 3: Major spoiler. The ending of the film. In the comic, the end of Civil War sees Captain America die. Crossbones and Agent 13 (Sharon Carter) kill Rogers. I am highly surprised this didn't happen in Civil War, and I thought it would have been a tie into the MCU to allow for Mystic / Time powers to be introduced to 'resurrect' Rogers pre-Thanos. So as the movie starts with Crossbones and then Agent 13 is in place soon after, I felt the movie was building up to it. And then nothing. Why? If Captain America's death wasn't the end of Civil War (as it was in the comics), why were those scenes needed in the movie. Crossbone's battle made some plot sense, but Agent 13's place in the movie was superfluous. In fact, it would have been more interesting without her, as her only role was to return the equipment to Falcon and Rogers. They instead could have used Ant-Man to steal them, since he is a criminal. Good setup wasted.Final Thoughts: And here then is the rub. It's not a perfect movie if you try to be critical, especially if you know the source. But it's also really good, with great action scenes, especially that airport scene. The fighting felt heavy. The punches really felt like they were hurting because the emotions were there. It wasn't just some random alien, but it was our Avengers we've spent the last few movies getting to know. I did enjoy it, I'll go back and watch it again.",7,8,18,30 April 2016
Black Hawk Down," GREAT! Watch it with commentary on if you can.
","OK up front, I am going to review this in 2 ways, as a movie, and than as a 'war movie'. As they are somewhat different in a sense.As a movie: A great, damn near non stop action movie. Very realistic, often brutal, violence. If you're an action movie junkie you'll love it. Whilst I cannot watch this just as a movie, if you are looking for an action flick, this is incredible credits to credits.CONS: Alas, the only downside, for me, is Eric Bana. Perhaps it's because I am an Australian, but between his dialogue, script, and accent I found him to be distracting and annoying. Luckily, he's not in it very much.As a war movie: Having said that, you HAVE to remember this is real events and real lives. Whilst I'm sure some people can watch war movies as a movie, I cannot divorce myself of the real events and the knowledge or real lives lost. In that regard, the 'realistic' violence I mentioned before does not boost my adrenaline, but scares me silly.I own the 3 disc DVD. And as great as the movie alone is, the ability of the movie to move the soul when you see the struggle of the soldiers is amazing. About the only movie I can compare it too is the Shawshank Redemption. What I am talking about here, is mostly with the audio commentary of the returned Veterans. The real men (women?) that were there on the day and risked everything to save their fellow soldiers and finish their mission. I cannot hope to give the full details on the commentary, but you learn an infinite amount more than the movie, and their struggles are sheer mind blowing.I urge you, if you can, to watch the movie with the commentary. To at least begin to learn what the brave, amazing, troops do for their country and their fellow soldiers. It truly moves the heart.Incidentally, it's perhaps poignant to note I'm NOT an American. I believe if I were the effect would be greater still.",9,1,3,24 November 2007
