Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I was hoping that chewbacca would eat jar jar binks
","I found this movie to have many many  possibilities, but did not meet my expectations. This movie could not hold a candle to the original 3. I found the accents to be insipid, and culturally insulting. I found Jar Jar Binks to be annoying and an insult to the entire movie. Where  in the original 3 movies dialects were brilliantly created and much thought and time went into them, I found a lack of creativity, and depth in this movie.  It almost seemed that Lucas sold out to meet the needs of the 'norm' instead of doing what he had such a gift for, creativity, and fresh ideas to push our imaginations to the absolute limits. How sad. On a lighter note, I found the characters of the queen, obi-wan, and Qui-Gon to be interesting and well thought out.I saw much potential in their characters. I think if Lucas had put more time into depth of story, and less time into flashy effects, the movie would have been much more successful. It is sad that in this day in age we have to find movie enjoyment in big showy spectacles, instead of using the best vehicle for that... our imaginations.",2,0,1,1 July 2001
