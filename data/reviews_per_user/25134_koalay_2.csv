10 Cloverfield Lane," Rich mystery box that is much better than the first one
","To be honest, I quite like the first one. It does very good in keeping audience wonder 'what the f___ is going on'. The main issue is that the whole movie was pushed by a single mysterious event that it never fully explained. It was kind of a linear ride.10 Cloverfield Lane is a much richer experience. The chemistry between characters are constantly changing during the major part of the movie. Audience constantly changes their emotional perspective with the main protagonist (Michelle, by Mary Elizabeth Winstead). And the plot is not driven by the singular mystery disaster, but much more.No doubt director Dan Trachtenberg did a great job in multiple levels. With much less CG in the movie, the tension is greatly contributed by the 3 main actors in it. Luckily for audience, they all did a great job.I'd really like to see a 3rd movie in the Cloverfield franchise. I know it would be hard to not be a cheesy disaster movie (like Independence Day). But after I watched 10 Cloverfield Lane, I somehow believe that those who associate with Abram could pull it off and make a great one.",8,0,2,14 April 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Not a complete disaster
","First about the things that are not sucks:1. Ben Affleck did a great job in portraiting the Batman. It is different from the Nolan version, but it catches the dark tone and seriousness of the character. Both the writings and the actor deserve some credit. 2. Gal Gadot also did a great job Wonder Woman. Although the appearance is brief, it really gives you the impression on a powerful, charming and clever female character. 3. Henry Cavill pulled off some hard work in being the Superman. Given the limitation of the given plot, it is a wonderful job for him to have given you a character that you may sympathize. 4. Visually stunning and action packed. You may still hear the 'war drum' music after you come out of cinema.Now the stink parts:1. Same sickness as MOS, Louis Lane pop out of nowhere and appears in critical scene purely for dramatic needs. Not the fault of Amy Adams. The writing stinks here. 2. Some critical decisions are hard to follow. Especially concerning Batman on Superman. 3. Alien ships of high technology and low security. Come on!Baseline. If you want to see an action movie with good fighting between CGI heroes and monsters, this is a nice movie for you. Nice sound effect, visual effect and music.If you wants logic in a film, you'd get you brain burn. Don't take it too serious.",7,0,3,25 March 2016
