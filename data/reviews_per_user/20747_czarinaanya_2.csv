Saturday Night Fever," Trash...pointless trash
","So I figured for this movie to be so famous it had to be good. I finally watched it. As a child of the 80's, I've been nostalgic for 80's movies and though this was a 70's movie, I thought I'd watch it because I LOVE dancing. But my knowledge of this movie was minimal.. Mostly all I knew of the movie is what I saw in 'Short Circuit' when Number 5 is watching the movie and dancing along. Anyway I am actually sorry I watched it. I felt like I needed a bath and new brain afterward. It's complete trash. At least the rated R version is.. Maybe I'd like it better if I saw the PG version. There didn't really seem to be any storyline or point to the movie besides to be a vehicle for the dancing scenes (which were good) and the music (which was awesome). The rest was an endless stream of profanity, sex, and stupidity. Travolta's character wasn't even likable. I mean, the main character of a movie can have flaws... but he/she has to at least be likable on some level. Travolta's character was shallow, a jerk, and didn't really 'grow' that much through the movie. The fact that the gives the trophy to the couple who really deserved it, and wanted to try being friends with Stephanie, wasn't really that much of a 'redemption' for me. He was still almost as much of a jerk as he was claiming his friends were. Just be warned before you watch this...the 'F' word is non-stop, nudity and graphic sex scenes abound, It's disgusting.. And there's not even really any 'plot' or 'story-line' that really has a point.",1,14,32,25 August 2008
Dead Poets Society," I may be crazy, but the story-line was a big disappointment.
","Well, I finally watched this. I was enjoying it until near the end, with the plot twist (STOP READING NOW IF YOU DON'T WANT SPOILERS) that, if you have seen the movie, you know what I mean. I think that this movie had the potential to be a very inspirational film, but, I'm sorry, suicide doesn't inspire me. Basically, what the teacher was trying to do was great.. but the suicide was the ultimate failure.. basically the boy was admitting that he could not 'sieze the day' and stand up to his father and live his own life. I mean.. if you wanted tear-jerking, you can have the death of someone (I read that William's character was originally supposed to die of leukemia.. MUCH better plot idea than the suicide one, IMO).. you could even have a tragic death of one of the kids.. but not suicide.. doesn't work for an 'inspirational' movie.. as I said.. it was a FAILURE of everything that the teacher was teaching the students.. I dunno.. it just left a bad taste in my mouth.. True, it was emotional, true, it was well- acted.. but I felt it slapped us in the face and ruined what could have been a great story.. And I didn't find it believable that anyone (even a stuffy school) would 'Blame' a teacher for his student's suicide under those circumstances. Investigate and fire?? No.. not for what that teacher did..doesn't make sense.. not believable.. as I saidBasically after the suicide everything went sour...the plot fell apart.. LOL.. maybe part of it is I'm a real House addict, and had been enjoying Robert Sean Leanoard (looking VERY young and almost 'yummy' LOL) and well.. I thought his suicide was the worst plot twist I'd ever seen.. It just went against everything the movie was about.. So there you have my opinion.. COuld have been great, but a shocking suicide just doesn't fit with an 'inspirational' story like this. If I want to go be inspired, I'll go watch Apollo 13, October Sky, Mr. Holland's Opus,",Null,0,1,30 June 2008
