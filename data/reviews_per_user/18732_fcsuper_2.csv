First Man," This movie could've been many things, but it was only one
","Raw (in several ways) biopic of Neil Armstrong. The movie could've more artsy. The movie could've been more dramatic. The movie could've been produced on a larger scale with incredible views of ships rocketing out of the atmosphere and flying through space. The movie could've glamorized and romanticized the grand achievements and loses. But if the movie where any of that, it wouldn't have been Armstrong's story.",9,2,2,26 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Lazy crypto-reboot
","The story is very small in scope, juxtaposed with a massive film budget. Rian Johnson turned the whole story into a simple and linear McGuffin chase scene. Beyond that, the whole idea of the entire Republic being wiped out with just a few planets being destroyed is just lazy. Also lazy is the fact that this minor power (New Order) somehow magically makes and mans endless ships from the region of space that didn't have whole lot of humans and very limited trade (according to canon). All the while, the main industrial centers of the Galaxy with well-established and large economies suddenly just collapse. Whether anyone realizes it or not, this is a super lazy attempt to reboot the franchise while hoping no one notices. I noticed. I appreciate the Joseph Campbell philosophy being applied here. Yes, you do need to recreate stories for each generation. But, execution in this movie is horribly lacking.",4,0,0,18 December 2017
