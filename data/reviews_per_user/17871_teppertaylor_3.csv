Kill Bill: Vol. 2," For those who think this movie is too violent...
","Go back to your suburban pc world where things make sense for you. Let those who operate in the real world watch and discuss movies. This movie was not excessively violent, nor was it really all that violent. There is violence in the movie, but its about a professional killer taking her revenge on other professional killers, so grow up. The dialogue was amazing; it was funny, clever, witty and simply brilliant. The bit about Superman is vintage Tarantino (i.e.  Tipping in Reservoir Dogs and Foot Messages in Pulp Fiction). If you didn't like the dialogue, plot, premise, or direction thats one thing, but do not dismiss this movie as being too violent. Tarantino is an artist, and it is about time people start appreciating his art.",10,0,1,19 April 2004
Kagemusha," 2/10
","This is one of the most overrated films I have ever seen. The only reason anyone thinks this is a good movie, is because its foreign. One person gave it a 9/10, even though, in their own words, it lack content and the plot was hard to follow. THEN HOW THE HELL IS IT A 9. There were a couple of engaging shots, but most of the camera angles were the same, and lacking creativity. So, lets be honest with ourselves and give this movie the rating it deserves. 2/10.",Null,2,9,5 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," not better than Godfather II
","Come on people, relax. This was a visually stunning movie, which beautifully portrayed middle earth. But please, #3 all time. The acting is average at best. Orlando Bloom and Elijah Wood make me shutter every time they open their mouths. The best actor in this movie was Sean Astin, who thus far has gone unrecognized. This is a very good movie, I agree, but not the third best, and certainly not better than godfather II. Lets all take a deep breath, relax, and then rank it where it belongs.",8,1,6,27 December 2003
