Scarface," Scarface an urban American classic
","How this movie is not in the top 250 is crazy!!! It is a classic example of just how corrupt the world was then and even now, as drugs continue to run rampant throughout our country!! Pacino was a semi-star and this movie made him a hero in the urban community!! (although a hero of the wrong nature) After 20+ years this movie is not getting the respect it deserves on this site!! 'Is this it Mannie, is this what it's all about!!' There are so many lines and phrases from that movie that are used in the Hip-Hop community that it is a shame. DePalma did an excellent job of directing Tony's rise to greatness as well as showing his downfall. Michelle did a great job as a closet coke head as well. 'Chi-Chi get the ya-yo!!' 'Who do I trust?... Me that's who!!' 'Bubblehead'. Classic",10,0,1,25 May 2005
