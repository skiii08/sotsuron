The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," The worst Twilight movie
","I've read the books; although they are sexist and were clearly written for the immature female reader, I still enjoyed them. It was just so easy and fun to re-live the first-crush-drama and all the hormonal feelings through Bella. This have said, the books still have some interesting details and plot twists that could satisfy even a more demanding reader.And than came the movies...First of all, I don't know why they had to make a movie (or even two!) for every book?! There just isn't enough material to do so. Hell, the whole story of the first part could be summed up in one sentence. The characters just aren't deep and real enough to carry the movie. They aren't supposed to be, they need to be interchangeable with any teenage movie viewer who fantasizes about some unreachable love story.And the plot is just dragged on and on...It's like the director has given up of making a good movie. What's the point anyway? The emo-teenage-girl the franchise is supposed to speak to will go to see the movie either way. It will earn money whether you put in the work or not.And the last book was so film-able; I was already imagining the movie in my mind. It had enough action, enough new elements that weren't already shown in the past parts. But again, it was more important to milk the audience for just one more time, then to make a half-way decent movie.I still like the story, and will go to see the second part, but I'm just disappointed; this movie is just a reminder of today's capitalist society with no interest than money and financial gain.",2,160,260,20 November 2011
The Prestige," poor cinema
","Why is this described as a thriller, a mystery? It had neither thrill, nor mystery, nor intelligence for that matter. When I look for movies to watch I always mention my favorites (Memento, The Game etc.) hoping for similar kind of cinematic entertainment, and eventually this movie came up. It was supposed to be as intense, interesting and intelligent as the mentioned ones. But, it was just one big disappointment. Maybe, if I had no expectations, the experience of watching it would have been better...I suppose this might be thrilling and suspenseful for someone who usually doesn't prefer that genre and is used to the 'lighter' movies you don't have to put much thought in. But even for that person this wouldn't be the first pick for an evening at the cinema, so I really don't understand the amount of attention this movie got.",4,1,3,21 November 2011
Warrior," Best martial arts movie/sports drama ever seen
","This is one of the best movies I've seen past few years. Storyline, acting, visual images, fighting scenes, everything is just perfect. Usually, when I see a movie get awesome, over the top critics, mostly it ends up being pretentious crap. But not this one, this is a really entertaining movie and is a must see this year. It is great cinema, but also a quality movie. The only thing I'm really wondering about is, why the heck did they have to put in the Russian guy?? Come on, wasn't that a bit obvious and unnecessary? It just reminded me; yep, still a commercial Hollywood movie. All in all, you should see it, and you will enjoy it; so will I seeing it the second time with my husband; so good is it!",9,2,9,18 November 2011
Donnie Darko," stupid movie for stupid people who think they aren't
","This movie gave me nothing; no entertainment, no new ideas, nothing to think about. It just waisted my time.But the most disturbing fact about this movie are the fans; I just don't get them. It's adorable when they say - 'you have to watch it more than once' or 'you didn't get it', because I did get it and I did understand it, but the things you had to 'get' and understand were so obvious and boring, they could've just given me a memo and spared me of this insult for anyone capable of thinking.Donnie Darko is a movie for teenagers who THINK that they are smart and artistic; no one understands them (bu-hu) and they are oh so special and unlike any other teen out there. No one likes me, my parents are stupid... OMG",1,2,8,21 November 2011
