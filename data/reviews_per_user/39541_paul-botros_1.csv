Deja Vu," this movie is so bad i, i could not finish it.
","The movie starts off well but as soon as the time travel aspect of the movies appears, it completely falls apart. Not only is it confusing, its so unrealistic that it makes the movie utterly ridiculous to watch.I love Denzel Washington, but he could not save this movie from its many many flaws. To all the people who thought this move was good, you must be easily pleased with fancy effects and no substance. The movie made no sense at all. All this trouble to save one girl. Half the time all Denzel seemed to do was look at her in a sexual manner. If this girl was not attractive i doubt Denzel would have gone to such great lengths to save this girl.Please don't waste your time watching this movie. Its truly awful.",2,3,7,7 October 2007
