First Man," a giant leap...
","From a story of a promising young drummer trying to achieve greatness, to a bold contemporary musical harking back to the golden age, and now a journey to the moon, Damien Chazelle has brought us innovative projects that have struck a cord in the film industry, and his latest feature, First Man, is a giant leap forward, no pun intended.This is a story the world knows all too well about the man who takes the first steps on the moon. Neil Armstrong has become an icon ever since that pivotal moment in human history, but this personal look at his life is what leads the audience into a dramatic journey most, I'm sure, weren't quite expecting.Ryan Gosling's thoughtfully internalised portrayal of Armstrong further solidifies his place amongst the greatest's of screen performers, this being his best work to date in my humble opinion. The subtleties and nuances his eyes alone express give simultaneously so little and so much that the movies emotional core lies with Ryan's performance. The loss, the sacrifice and the greatness, Neil Armstrong is no mundane character and Ryan Gosling peels away the platitudes of layers this man holds on his journey to that historic walk. Accompanying Gosling is the equally impressive Claire Foy, who doesn't lose herself in this male centred world, instead heightening the already elevated drama and feeding the emotionality of a final scene that is sure to have a few tears.Damien Chazelle expertly handles some of the more suspenseful sequences with incredible ingenuity. One of which serves as a claustrophobic nightmare where the entirety of the scene is shot in the astronauts cockpit, giving you a first person perspective of a launch that will immerse you in the most frightening way. Combined with a cacophony of sounds meticulously engineered and jaw-dropping shots, First Man is a technical marvel that will leave you emotionally strained and visually bewildered.",10,0,2,22 October 2018
The Death of Stalin," a satirical triumph
","Writer, director Armando Iannucci is quickly becoming a staple in political satire comedies, with a line of successful titles already attached to his name like British comedy In The Loop and HBO's Veep. With The Death of Stalin, he further cements his stature, bringing us a sharp political satire in a very sombre period of Russia's history. The Death of Stalin follows the power struggle between the council of ministers of the Soviet Union, giving us an insight of the regime's turmoil after Stalin's death. With an impressively intelligent script that balances the comedy and drama of the current affairs, Armando Iannucci makes us laugh, somewhat outrageously, in the midst of incredible violence, never presenting it as a foreground, but rather, a background painting, letting you decide what is depicted on off screen. 
 A stellar ensemble cast, which includes Steve Buscemi, Simon Russel Beale, Jeffrey Tambor, Jason Isaacs, just to a name a few, deliver, in near-perfect note, an outstanding array characters to full realisation. Impeccably casted and thoroughly well acted, the film breathes palpable life in every scene as the drama becomes increasingly apparent, providing a rousing third act that fully kills, literally, the beat from which the film started with. The Death of Stalin can be regarded as the best comedies to hit the screens in 2017.",10,4,7,19 September 2018
No Country for Old Men," catch me if you can
","The Coen Brothers are highly regarded as pioneers of modern movie making, with there own signature style of genre that is easily recognisable and always unforgettable. They've been writing, directing and producing their own projects since the 90s, creating some of cinema's most iconic characters and most compelling, original narratives. It's safe to say, that whenever they release something new, it's an event more than just a viewing. With No Country for Old Men, Joel and Ethan Coen are on top form, spewing cinematic gold on screen that leaves the audience in pure awe. The story centers around Josh Brolin's Llewelyn Moss, who stumbles upon a drug deal gone wrong and a stash of money in a suit case, the perfect start to any narrative I say? This leads him to take said cash for himself and from there, violence and mayhem ensue in the from of Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh, with Tommy Lee Jones' Ed Tom Bell right behind as the town's sheriff. The leads deliver indelible performances that drive the movie forward as they chase one another with only a thin gap between them. Javier Bardem completely embodies the personification of a psychopath, leaving us with one of the most classic villains to date and a one-liner to follow suit 'what's the most you ever loss on a coin toss?' The tension is palpable and almost unbearable, with trademark sequences that will be studied, viewed and enjoyed for the years to come. Featuring the deserted, blazing landscapes of Texas with its peculiar locals, No Country of Old Men is beautifully shot, creating an emphatic world for it's characters to live and breath in. To put it mildly, No Country for Old Men is a near-masterpiece, serving as a template of the highest calibre of modern American Cinema.",10,0,0,19 September 2018
The Witch," 'who be the witch of the wood?'
","A triumphant debut for director Robert Eggers who crafts a terrifying exercise in slow-building horror with The Witch, perhaps the year's most daunting watch.The story centers around a family in 1630s New England as they are haunted by supernatural forces such as witchcraft, black magic and possession. The first thing Robert Eggers successfully establishes is the setting from which this takes place. An unbelievable achievement in what can only seem like the 17th century, the filmmaker captures not only the tone of such a life but incorporates a script that breathes a Shakespearean essence which further elevates the drama and heightens the horror. The Witch invitingly creates such a dreary and desolate mood that often times feels suffocatingly unbearable and yet remarkably compelling, it is as if the film itself uses supernatural forces to allure you, but that's just great filmmaking don't worry. The cast here are impeccable, consisting of only 6 actors, they immediately set an emotionality that will secure your investment for the rest of the running time. Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie are veterans who never miss a beat, even with terrific child actors lead by a superb newcomer, Anya Taylor-Joy, who perfectly seizes the accent and blend moments of drama with horror.The Witch is immaculately constructed, with exquisite performances and a haunting tale about the decay of a family corrupted by the witches of the woods, no pointy noses or crooked hats in this one however.",9,4,6,5 November 2018
Looper," closing your loop
","Riian Johnson's Looper is 2012's most original sci-fi film that boasts strong performances, old-school action, a distinctive style and a compelling story. It's certainly refreshing to find a movie that subverts our expectation, especially in the realm of sci-fi, a genre that can so easily flounder. The year is 2079, time travel hasn't yet been invented but in the near future it will be, becoming highly illegal and only used by the mob, who send men from the future to be killed in the past by Loopers. In order for the mob to receive no loose ends, Loopers are tasked with eliminating their future selves, without question. This is where we are presented with Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Joe, who fails to kill Bruce Willis, Joe from the future. Time-travel is put to the side to present a character piece between the dualities of this personage. Instead of lamenting on the intricacies on the frustrating concept of time-travel, Riian Johnson offers a brilliant script serving as both a Neo-noir and a classic western narrative, hiding behind the mask of sci-fi. Both Willis and Gordon-Levitt bring fantastic performances, especially on Gordon-Levitt's part, who so uncannily impersonates Willis that the prosthetic nose was ridiculously unnecessary. They are supported by an equally fantastic Emily Blunt, portraying both the strong and vulnerable side of a mother not in control of her son (that kid is going places) and a scene-stealing Jeff Daniels. Riian Johnson has crafted a wildly creative, utterly original and bold film with Looper, despite a few shortcomings with the time-travel concept, establishing himself as a director to be sought after. Oh, that's right, Star Wars!",10,0,4,19 September 2018
