Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A few things come to mind ..
","SPOILERS !!!!!!After watching The Last Jedi a few things come to mind :1) A vast improvement on 'The Force Awakens'
2) Your girlfriend will love this movie just for the porgs 
3) Daisy Ridley's acting is now on the same level as that of a coffee table 
4) With all the money in the world, you would think Disney would have chosen a better protagonist than Daisy Ridley
5) probably the best opening 10 mins of any Star Wars movie 
6) Mark Hammal was the best thing about this movie 
7) Luke's send off was just terrible and heartless 
8 ) The biggest thing missing from the new trilogy , is that you just don't give a s&£t about these characters
9) Adam Driver is amazing as always 
10) Still lacks allot of heart , can't be compared to the original trilogy 
11) very original story
11) the light saber scenes have got nothing on the prequels
13)the best scene in the entire movie was the return of practical effect Yoda 
14) Laura Dern was terrible 
15) Princess Leia was awesome
16) the Snoke, Rey and Kyla Ren chamber scene had the best dialogue
17) Fin was str8 up sidelined , even though he's the most likable of the new cast 
18) they wasted Oscar Isaacs once again ... Btw his side plot leads to nowhere and they make him seem like an a&£hole 
19) Can't wait for the last part in this trilogy 
20) Benicio Del Toro was such a class act
21) Benicio Del Toro looks so damn good for his age ... Dude be like a vampire or some s&£t",7,1,4,25 January 2018

4) Poor Peta , dude be taking so much shit for Katniss ... He gets cut , electrocuted , almost drowns , attacked by killer monkeys , gets kidnapped .... WTF else is he supposed to do for her ?
