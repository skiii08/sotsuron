Hereditary," Watch it again!
",I watched this film again and I liked even more the second time. The storyline becomes more clear and you pick up so many things. Ari Aster is a genius!!,10,3,6,28 August 2018
Hereditary," Grilling horror
","I can see why this has such a high rating for a horror film. This film was great! The acting from Toni collete deserves an Oscar. The horror really comes into play in the last 20 minutes, terrifying ending. One of the best horror movies I have ever seen!",10,1,3,28 August 2018
