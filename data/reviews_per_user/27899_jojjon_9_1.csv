Sucker Punch," A surprisingly great movie, but why so many haters?
","I wasn't even interested in watching this movie first, a friend said he had a movie he wanted to see so I went to the cinema with him and another friend, knowing nothing at all about the movie except there would be some action and an asylum, in other words, I were not expecting much. Roughly two hours later I walked out of the cinema a happy man ready to die with no regrets.What I don't understand is why so many people hate the movie, it's totally beyond me. I can see why some would dislike it, I mean, there are boring middle-aged people with a total lack of any sense of humor and self-satisfaction that spend their entire life talking negatively about everything as a means of going through their distasteful and disgusting everyday life. Sure, I can accept that, but hey! What are your arguments? Bad acting? Bad story? Story not making sense? To much special effects? Characters never in any real danger? Over the top? And the list just goes on like that song that doesn't end. COME ON PEOPLE! Is it that hard to just enjoy a movie without constantly being on the lookout for every single flaw in someone else's work? I for one never thought any of the acting was bad, on the contrary I thought it was really good, it really felt like normal people. And the story was according to me a lot like it's title, a bloody sucker punch, I mean, your mom gets murdered, you accidentally kill your sister and your greedy stepfather puts you in an asylum to get you lobotomized and that way inherit everything that would've been yours! And about nothing making sense? Hellooooo, if you failed to notice it at the beginning, they are mental patients at a mental hospital and for all we know, she could've been mental for real. And things that happen in a mental patients mind is according to me okay to be a little distorted and messed up. Yeah sure, some things were left unexplained but simple cause of that I wouldn't bash it since I really really enjoyed it overall. Would you say inception sucked because in the end some things were left unexplained?And to much special effects? Pffft... go home, swallow a whole bottle of pills, go to bed and wake up in the new world or not at all. Whilst I can appreciate movies without many special effects, I'm also very able to appreciate, and love, movies with special effects. The scenes with special effects are made to be really really 'special effected', what did you expect?The filming was great and the soundtrack was really mind blowing, and just because they made a bad cover on one of your 'oh so favorite Queen songs' you don't have to hate the movie! I also found the cover quite bad but it still fit the scene! And all the others songs were just awesome!All in all, the movie is one of the best I've seen in a really long time and easily should be somewhere between 7-8 but I'm going to rate it 10 in a desperate attempt to raise it's rating from the clutches of the people who should really be in an asylum who down-rates it horribly. I really feel sorry for you, maybe you should consider getting lobotomized, you'd be in paradise then already and wouldn't need to bash on good movies, you'd have a wall to bash your head on instead.",9,5,9,26 April 2011
