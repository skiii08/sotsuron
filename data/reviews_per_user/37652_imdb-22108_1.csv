Source Code," It's Deja-Vu All Over Again!
","Considering the strength of Zowie Bowie (AKA Duncan Jones)'s previous endeavours, this movie was something of a disappointment.The plot struck me as something of a patchwork knitted together from the ideas of other (better) movies. I'm quite surprised by how much material is rehashed here, most notably from the Tony Scott film 'Deja-Vu', which features an almost identical plot device.There are also elements lifted from features like 'Twelve Monkeys' and 'The Jacket' and 2008's 'Vantage Point' which, while not necessarily better movies, can at least hold their heads high in the non-plagiarism stakes.At any rate, if you can get over the sheer lack of inventiveness in the script, the movie has some mildly entertaining action scenes (well, a single action scene shown repeatedly), and some decent acting.All in all I didn't hate this movie, but it's quite depressing to see someone who was briefly shaping up to be a unique talent and a fresh voice in the Hollywood movie scene, simply decide to churn out a quite lazy and above all safe piece of movie making. Not a patch on 'Moon' to be sure!",5,2,3,10 August 2011
