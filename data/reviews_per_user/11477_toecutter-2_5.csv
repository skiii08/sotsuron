The Devil's Advocate," Pacino shines ... again!
","Al Pacino, as usual does not disappoint; in particular the monologues in Chinatown and the climax stand out. I dont think anyone else could have saved this movie, essentially comprised of a mediocre plot, a half-assed cast, (someone tell me how this clown Keanu Reeves manages to get himself cast with stellar performers like Gary Oldman, Lawrence Fishburne et al?) Pitiful performances from Charlize Theron and Reeves aside, only Pacino's on-screen magnetism saves this movie from being a box-office bust it would have been!",Null,0,1,5 April 2000
The Blair Witch Project," What a dog!
","Witness the amazing power of suggestion! A few well placed internet ads generated enough hype to attract throngs of people to this over-rated, under-achieving disaster. Guess everybody was suffering from the 'emperor's new clothes' syndrome! How else could one possibly sit through this drivel and claim its a great horror movie? From the foul mouthed female lead to the ridiculous dialogues, the movie was a pile of bull from the word go. I'm sure the producers are falling all over the floor laughing as to how they fooled the collective public with this low budget home movie!! Kinda reminds you of how the toy companies create a near frenzy for new silly toys every year by surreptiously introducing them in schools, doesn't it?",Null,0,1,29 February 2000
American Beauty," Its time to be honest!
","'Ah, American Beauty', the phrase we hear so often these days said with the same pretentious longing heard when people say 'Ah, Venice' when they have not even stepped out of their hometowns! I saw the movie after all the hype and my wife's insistence. Granted, there is some pretty good acting by Spacey and Benning, but I didn't see anything extraordinary. My personal theory: Anything Spacey stars in gets this kind of rave reviews due to his links to the Theatre. We Americans have a penchant to appear cerebral and intellectual and pretend to appreciate anything dished out in the name of 'art'. Its time we stopped raving about the emperor's new clothes and started being less afraid to call a spade a spade. Enough said!",Null,0,0,7 April 2000
Now You See Me," Two hours of my life I won't get back .....
","I suppose all the flash, glitter and the over-the-top music at the beginning should have warned me that this was going to be a turd. The plot twists are beyond implausible, and stink of lazy screenplay writing or plain lack of imagination. Characters and the plot have holes large enough to drive a bus through. The ending will make you mad that you refused to stop watching this ridiculous travesty of a movie 5 minutes into it. I kept hoping it'd get better but it only gets worse. There is even a brief hint at supernatural forces but that plot line is left hanging. What I don't get is why Freeman and Caine agreed to work on this turkey. They are the only reason I kept watching despite the logical side of my brain kept telling me that this was just an awful waste of time. Padding their retirement portfolios, perhaps?",1,10,18,22 February 2014
Event Horizon," Intriguing premise, poor execution
","This movie epitomizes all that has gone wrong with a gore-crazed Hollywood. An interesting premise, where the concept of Hell and Evil have to be completely re-evaluated and re-analyzed for their depth of horrors leads the viewer's imagination to really open up to terrifying possibilities, and to expect a well made movie exploring this concept. However in the latter half, the plot just collapses and resorts to cheap and ridiculous gore as a scare, found more frequently in movies of the Wes Craven calibre. When will Hollywood realize that true horror is something you imagine and not actually see? Perhaps they worry that they would lose the mainstream audience if they didn't throw in some standard horror film blood and guts? A complete disappointment, considering Sam Neill's otherwise illustrious career. I would give it an 8 for the first half and about 2 for the second. Perhaps this movie should have been released with a PG13 rating and spared us all the anticipation and the eventual anti-climax!",Null,0,1,8 March 2000
