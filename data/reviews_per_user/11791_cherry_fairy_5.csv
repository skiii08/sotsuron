The Ring," A scary movie not to miss
","When this movie was playing in the theaters, I was too chickened out to go and see it. All of my friends had nightmares for days! But a few months ago, when it came out on HBO (or Starz, I forget which) I grabbed a bowl of popcorn and decided to watch. I personally loved it!! It's really such a scary movie but you can't get yourself to leave. Sometimes, I'd been grabbing onto my pillow and crying a little because I was so scared but there was no way I could go away and not watch it anymore. The acting is amazing and totally believable. And the story is very creative and is realistic and not at the same time. I mean, it's very unlikely for such a thing to happen, but at the same time...it could. There's no magic or monsters but rather videotapes and phone calls, which, when you're watching the movie, makes it all the more scary. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good time, but be warned, you'll definitely have nightmares for a few days afterwards!",Null,1,2,10 September 2004
Shrek 2," Outshines the original...
","First of all, let me say that I just LUV the first Shrek movie. It's just so smart and funny, I can watch it over and over again!! When I heard about Shrek 2, I was super excited, but I have to admit that I wasn't too impressed with the trailers. It didn't seem like there was much of a plot. But now I'm glad that they didn't expose too much. Nowadays, you know the beginning, middle, and end of a movie from the trailers. But in the theater, I was totally not expecting the Fairy Godmother or Shrek and Donkey taking the *sexy potion* which is a big part of the story. And I was glad for the pleasant surprises. All I can say is that this movie ROCKS!!!!!! It kept everyone in the theater laughing the whole time. I love the references to modern pop culture and some of the lines are hilarious...totally classic stuff! And of course, Accidentally in Love is an awesome way to start off any movie. I would totally recommend it!!!",Null,0,0,15 September 2004
The Terminal," Great fun and with a good message
","I loved this movie sooo much when we went to see it in the theaters! Most of the movies out were funny, but full of bad words and crude humor. Now I just love 'gross movies' (think Austin Powers) but The Terminal was a very refreshing change. Tom Hanks always seems to pick the best roles and he makes every movie such a pleasure to watch, but this character was probably the most lovable of them all. The humor is innocent and simple, but it made the whole crowd laugh uncontrollably throughout the whole movie. Catherine Zeta-Jones doesn't make as many appearances as we would have liked but in the small parts that she has, she manages to completely nail her character. I think that the chemistry that all the characters have together, added to the general concept of this movie, makes it so enjoyable to watch and gives it a great message. It's a movie that you can go to just to relax in and enjoy yourself, and is a movie that no one should go without seeing again and again.",Null,0,1,14 September 2004
A Walk to Remember," My most absolute favorite movie!!
","When I first heard that Mandy Moore was going to be in a movie based on a novel by Nicholas Sparks, I immediately ran out to buy the book. And I just couldn't put it down! It's a love story so much like the others, but so simple and real and sad that it somehow surpasses the rest. The movie gave me the exact same feeling. It's so simple, yet filled with so much emotion that you just have to watch it over and over again. Mandy Moore gives an unbelievable breakout performance as Jamie Sullivan and is so genuine and pure that you just can't help but love her. Shane West did a brilliant, totally believable job as a rebel whose life is turned around completely by this love that he has for Jamie. This movie makes me cry every time I watch it and not only because its sad, but because of the pure love in it. These two characters have such a chemistry that jumps right off the screen and into your heart. And seeing Shane West, one of the bad boys in Hollywood, cry uncontrollably in the arms of his father will get to you every time. I honestly recommend this movie to everyone and guarantee that everyone will come out with this wonderful feeling AND...about a box worth of wadded Kleenex!!!",Null,0,0,4 September 2004
Shark Tale," Don't listen to the critics...
","...because I did! I had the opportunity to see Shark Tale on Friday, the day it opened, but I had been checking out the bad reviews and decided that I should pass. After all, I don't want to waste my money on a bad movie!! But as the weekend passed, everyone told me that the movie was great, and that I should go and see it. So on Sunday, I caved and took my family to the 11:30 showing. The crowd was full of young families and we had to sit in the second row because of the parties of little kids all over the place. But it turned out not to be a kid's movie. It's not up to Shrek caliber, but it's definitely a smart, funny film meant for both kids and adults. The little ones were constantly in giggles but there were a few one-liners that went right over their heads and directly hit the adults, so everyone was happy.The movie is about a fish named Oscar (Will Smith) who wants to do something with his life to become a 'somebody' and live at the top of the reef instead of in the ocean ghettos. Already, you can tell that this concept has been covered before and this only leads to more predictability. When the brother of a misfit shark (Jack Black) is killed, Oscar is at the scene of the crime and becomes an instant hero. In a matter of hours, Oscar is whisked to the top of the reef and living a totally different life. He also meets Lola (Angelina Jolie), a fish who suddenly is attracted to this new 'somebody'. I don't want to give away much more than this, but I can pretty much guarantee that you can guess the outcome of this movie.Bottom line, although this story has been explored in MANY other movies before, it's given new life with this all-star cast and witty humor that is guaranteed to make you smile. 7/10",Null,0,2,4 October 2004
