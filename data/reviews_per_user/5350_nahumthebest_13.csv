Despicable Me 2," as good as the prequel; a little boring at times; excellent ending; after the end I felt I cared and cherished the characters; very meaningful and rewarding ending
","100% spoiler-free.What is more important than family, right?This sequel is 'more of the same,' meaning that it offers everything the first film offered and has the same strengths. However, this sequel is was a little boring for me and it did not get interesting until the villain and his plot was revealed and it got even better when I saw the ending. This movie had a very strong ending and such ending made me love the characters and made me have an emotional connection with the characters. Finally, I CARED about the characters. The ending was great, although it could have also been 'sweet' (i.e., family-heart-warming-sweet). Still, great ending.Once again, the terminal goal of the plot is VERY meaningful and the ending was very rewarding for the three kids and for us the audience who definitely appreciate family.Conclusion: this movie is a good watch and definitely worth watching. What is more important than family, right? I will now go watch the sequel.8/10",8,0,0,6 July 2020
Spider-Man 3," this movie made me feel the emotional connection between Peter, Mary Jane, and Harry; great movie overall
","I just re-watched Venom (2018) and then I decided to re-watch Spiderman 3 so I did. I enjoyed the movie from start to finish. It was nice to see Spiderman become dark and evil for a little bit. I was not happy with the main villain Sandman - I mean, that is just a childish idea for a villain; what was Stan Lee thinking in 1963?Venom was cool in this movie but of course nowhere as cool as his own movie in 2018.The ending was tragic, which I had completely forgotten about. I felt the emotional connection shared by Peter, his girl, and his best friend.Tobey Maguire, James Franco, Kirsten Dunst, J. K. Simmons, Bryce Dallas Howard, Rosemary Harris, and Thomas Haden Church did a good job.Topher Grace (Eddie Brock) aka venom - not such a great job.Conclusion: great movie. Worth a re-watch.",8,0,0,8 July 2020
Justice League," plot is better; great cinematography and fights; great ending
",I cannot wait for the 2021 Snyder's cut.Just re-watched it since I had just watched the prequel's extended cut.The movie is great. Got to see five cool superheroes join forces to stop a strong villain.The plot was a lot more coherent than its prequel and the cinematography and fights were very enjoyable as expected. Ending was great.Conclusion: a great movie; as expected from Snyder and his team.9/10,9,0,0,7 July 2020

Budge $35M; box office $160MI think the story was good and was well-written and fully plausible. I would not be surprised if it was based on a true story. When you analyze its parts you realize that each part fits well the next part and the next part, and together they make a well-built whole that makes sense. There is an initial start with mystery, then a steady rise to the climax, then a decent climax, a downfall, and then rise again, then a twist, and then another twist, and then we get a really good ending. Well done! This movie was an 8/10 until it got to the end and then it got bumped up to 10/10.Laurence Fishburne (the 'antagonist') - excellent work. Perfect for the role!Kevin Spacey (the professor) - as usual, his acting was great.Jim Sturgess (the protagonist) - I think he did 'decent' work, but nowhere close to the level of Fishburne and Spacey who performed at a high level.Kate Bosworth - I felt her acting was weak; too stoic? I know Kevin does the same, but that is his trademark. She had her good moments, but in general I thought she was weak for this movie.Aaron Yoo - he barely spoke, but his acting was great and funny. He was a good supporting cast.Jack Gilpin (Harvard employee) - he had a very tiny role, but he did good.Supporting cast - the rest of the supporting cast I thought had a weak and forgettable performance.Director Robert Luketic, writers Peter Steinfeld and Allan Loeb, cinematographer Russell Carpenter, and editor Elliot Graham, as well as everyone else who worked on this film, great job!Conclusion: this was a well-written story. It had a good story, it was entertaining, it was never boring, and had a great ending. I am glad I re-watched it. I think this movie is recommendable and definitely worth a shot.10/10",10,0,0,29 June 2020
Dunkirk," Boring; badly scripted; slow
","I like war movies. I'm a big fan. I think this is the first and only war movie I have not liked.This movie was slow and the script felt badly scripted, e.g. two soldiers taking a soldier on a stretcher onto a ship, while there are hundreds more on the ground that nobody was taking to the ship on a stretcher. If that didn't make sense to you, then we agree this was badly scripted. The protagonist barely said a word in this movie. Talk about ZERO character development.I won't even bother writing more. This movie isn't worth it.",2,1,3,11 January 2018

Hotel Transylvania," Well-written simple story; good ending; sometimes funny; enjoyable; recommendable
","Just finished it.
-Well-written story about a father who loves his daughter more than anything in the world. Good premise and good back story. Had a happy and satisfying ending.
-Funny at times. Maybe more comedy would have been nice.Conclusion: very enjoyable movie. Had the artwork been stronger I might have given it a 10/10. Highly recommend it. I will immediately watch the sequel now.",9,0,0,23 June 2020
Beauty and the Beast," Emma failed to cry and failed to look in-love with the beast; the witch = terrible acting
","I enjoyed the movie until it reached the climax at the end. Everything else about the movie was excellent, but the climax.I took 2 stars away because Emma did NOT CRY during the climax when you know what happens. She also failed completely to 'look' in-love with the beast. She failed big time here.During the climax her, 'I love you' was horribly fake. She completely failed to get into character, that is, of a woman in-love with a beast. She failed miserably to capture the true essence of this beautiful story - that of LOVE.And the witch - her acting was the WORST and she only showed up for a few seconds, but at the MOST CRITICAL moment in the story, and her acting was so bad I took away 1 more star.When the climax occurs, any NORMAL PERSON IN-LOVE would cry incessantly, and so bad it would make the audience cry, but not Emma. She failed to cry. She failed to convince anyone of being in-love with the beast. And that terrible actress portraying the witch, what a disservice at such a critical time; I cannot believe that witch got casted for such a critical role. The climax should have been prolonged and made more dramatic and sad, but instead it was too sudden.Also, the Beast's sadness and loneliness and anger should have been explored further.Emma failed big time at the most critical time.What a disappointment.7/10 stars.",7,2,5,15 June 2017
Man on Fire," Seen it 3x so far; still love it; still a 10/10; a movie about love, friendship, pain, loss, self-sacrifice, despair, death, life, family, and finding a reason to live

7.7 on iMDB.
47% on Metacritic.
93% of google users liked this movie.This movie is amazing. The story has themes like love, friendship, pain, loss, self-sacrifice, despair, death, life, family, and finding a reason to live. So many themes.I mean you got Denzel Washington who is great at what he does and Dakota Fanning who as a kid could expertly cry (e.g. War of the Worlds 2005) and can easily make you believe she is in serious distress. Radha Mitchell (the mom) did pretty good too. Giancarlo Giannini (director of the AFI) also did good, as did Rachel Ticotin (the reporter). Christopher Walken (Denzel's friend) did ok. Jes√∫s Ochoa (a very bad guy) did good. Gero Camilo (someone's brother) did really good acting too. Overall, good American and Mexican cast.The plot is great from start to finish. As the movie progressed, more and more layers to the plot are revealed with the addition of some nice amount of 'action' as well. I really liked the fact that the movie took place in Mexico and that a couple pieces of their culture were showcased, which were corruption and impunity. The ending was bittersweet and might make one tear up a bit. The ending song was very sad.Memorable songs:'Una Palabra' - Carlos Varela
'The End' - Harry Gregson-Williams
'Blue Bayou' - Linda RonstadtConclusion: well-made movie that should have won some awards. This movie offers many strong themes. The protagonists did really well. The story has some nice twists. There is some nice action too. Basing the setting in Mexico made the movie very authentically different. Overall, the events of the movie felt very believable. This movie is worth at least one watch and I highly recommend it.10/10",10,0,0,3 July 2020

3 Oscar wins (Editing, Original music score, sound mixing); nominated for Best Picture.This movie was made 45 years ago and I just watched it for the first time. I have known about it for many years and finally decided to watch it since it is regarded as an excellent shark movie.I LOVE shark movies and I have ever since I watched Deep Blue sea in theaters in 1999 as a kid, which I have re-watched twice.Anyway, I think this was a good movie, but nowhere as good as Deep Blue Sea (1999). But this film was actually a very solid work and overall well-made. Steven Spielberg (my favorite director) did a great job. The CGI people did an amazing job with the shark - it was so real and it looked absolutely amazing.The plot was simple and yet effective. The plot was written in a realistic manner, which I appreciated. A realistic shark plot worked.The cast was fine. Richard Dreyfuss (Hopper) I think had the best performance.Roy Scheider (Chief Brody) had some decent performances but later only gave very flat scenes, especially at the end. Very flat and mediocre acting at the end.Robert Shaw (Quint) had a pretty average performance.The supporting cast did acceptable, although completely forgettable.Moreover, this movie had more flaws, aside from the acting issues.The triumphant orchestra music when the protagonists were haunting the shark was extremely inappropriate. The orchestra in general was so bad it knocked down 1 Star from my review. I cannot believe the orchestra music won an Oscar.Also, there were scenes in the last quarter of the film that did not have dialogue when something would happen and I thought that that was inappropriate and unrealistic. Any normal person would be swearing and verbally reacting to anything that goes wrong and talking to themselves in such a bad situation. Instead there is no dialogue. What is even worst, the acting at the end was totally inappropriate and unbelievable - I mean if you are in the water alone with a 25-foot long 6,000 lb. great white shark, it does not make sense for you to have a fearless face and not say a word? These two things cost the movie two stars. This was completely unrealistic. It is common sense. You would naturally be absolutely HORRIFIED of such a shark and mumble things to yourself, but definitely you would not be completely fearless! The actor Roy Scheider failed and the Steven Spielberg failed too. How can you forget common sense?Another issue is with the last scene - there was a missed opportunity to create absolute horror for the audience, which a shark is supposed to make anyone feel The fight should have been taken into the water - there is nothing more horrifying than knowing you are in the water with a 25-foot 6,000 lb. great white shark under you. But instead, the character is in a safe spot and to make things worst, with a completely fearless face. I, the viewer, never felt the horror that I should have felt, that the director should have made me feel. This is a failure from the director and the actor. Extremely disappointed.Conclusion: it is a good movie, but I do not think it deserves such a high reputation. Maybe it was the first shark movie done right, but it is nowhere near as good as Deep Blue Sea (1999). Nevertheless, it is still a good movie that deserves a watch since it was mostly properly made from start to finish, although with some flaws.7/10",7,0,1,2 July 2020
Arrival," Watched it twice - amazing storytelling

Second time I watched it I gave it 10/10.It seems watching it a second time helped me catch things I missed the first time.This movie is excellent. You should not watch trailers, nor read any summaries, or refieres. Just dive in.10/10 - deeply recommend it.",10,1,1,11 May 2020
Marriage Story," a very disturbing, depressing, and difficult to watch eye-opener movie; learned a lesson or two from it
","This was a very disturbing, depressing, and difficult to watch eye-opener movie from Noah Baumbach. So this was what divorce in real life looks like and FEELS like? I felt HORRIBLE by just watching it; I cannot imagine what it must feel like to be the people going through a divorce. Thank these parents for sparing the kid's feelings and psychological well-being because if they had not they would have traumatized him for life.After the movie ended and the credits were rolling and 'Shouting and Shopping' by Randy Newman was playing, I was just in a daze. It is never claimed in the movie, but this film must definitely be based on real life events, maybe on the director/writer's own divorce.My own thoughts on the plot: this marriage was never meant to last because each party wanted a different line of work in a different coast of the U.S. from years before they ever even met. One party got their way meaning that the other party gave in. One party was completely selfish and self-centered and focused only on their career goals, and completely failed to see and allow the other party to pursue their career goals. One party was very patient for as long as humanely possible until it was no longer humanely possible to forget their career goals. They should have never fallen in love with each other, but unfortunately they did. Both parties wanted completely different lines of work in completely opposite parts of the U.S. and unfortunately for them they made a third party that tied them together.At first I sided with one party thinking they had been patient and selfless and felt disgusted by the other party who had been so selfish and self-centered from day one and not only that but completely failed to see the other party's wishes and desires even after such party explicitly spelled it out for them. But then I realized that this marriage was never supposed to work in the first place since both wanted completely different lines of work in completely opposite sides of the country. They should have not married and made a third party.Moral of this story: do not fall in love with someone that wants to work in something completely different on the other side of the country.I watched this movie knowing absolutely NOTHING about it. I knew it was a Netflix movie and that it got an Oscar, but that is it. So the whole plot was a complete shock to me.Conclusion: very difficult film to watch; it surely is based on real life events and it portrayed well how horrible a divorce is. But I learned a valuable lesson or two.10/10",10,1,1,6 July 2020
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," almost 3 hrs long; very imperfect plot; great cinematography and fights
","Just watched the Ultimate Edition; it was almost three hours long I have been a Snyder fan for a long time, maybe since 300 (2006) which was his second film ever.I did watch the original but it has been such a long time that I could not tell the different with this extended cut.I enjoyed this movie despite its very imperfect plot. Love Snyder's style and the cinematographer Larry Fong who has helped make many of his films that I like.Conclusion: the plot is kind of not coherent, but the cinematography and fighting scenes made up for it. I enjoyed the film.9/10",9,0,1,7 July 2020
