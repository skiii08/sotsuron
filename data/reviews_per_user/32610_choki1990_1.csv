The Monuments Men," not that bad.. cliché all in all .. .
","First of all, when you check out the acting crew you'll go WOW! But honestly don't that fool you.. Movie is in same rhythm from beginning ti'll the end. There is no drama even when characters die.. i personally think they should have used deaths more, some dramatic scenes.. to mention it in greater manner.. that was just about all of the dramatic scenes that they could use.. It's old cliché where Americas have greater values then anyone else.. for example French chick (Blanchett) wants to sleep with American (Damon) .. he's too good for that.. Germans are of course demons.. Russians are not that behind them... Americans are returning all the art from high ground while Germans burn it, Russians are taking it home etc.. I'm not saying that there wasn't such situations of course there was but it was war everyone took something for sure.. All in all it's one sided movie. Oh yeah, i forgot when Damon steps on a mine.. they all stand by him while he's trying to step off it like screw it let's all die.. Cliché.. Now i said not that bad.. There are good scenes that make you laugh.. and... that's about it..",5,5,7,13 February 2014
