Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Great fun, but....
","I thought the movie was excellent in its own right. People who were never introduced to the character of Borat on Da Ali G Show will find originality like none other. Sure, it's basically a hidden camera gag show.. but with offensive, vulgar, and repugnant interviewing.That said... the film is hilarious. I'm quite familiar with Cohen's humor from watching most anything I can ever find on the fellow, but instead of complete laugh out loud moments, I just had a great smile and a chuckle inside. (Save for one scene that had me elbowing my buddy next to me and covering my mouth to prevent the Pepsi from dribbling out) The humor can and will be deemed offensive by people of all race, religion, or creed. All it takes is a sense of humor and the ability to laugh at one's own faults to see that Borat is not only making us slap our knees but also should force some to reach inside and maybe exorcise some sleeping demons of their own.Also, I was interested in how Larry Charles and Sacha Baron Cohen were going to make a 7 minute segment of a TV show into a feature length film, and was very pleased with the outcome. Interjected with reality, the scripted scenes were fun and added to the 'plot' of Borat seeking California.",8,2,10,3 November 2006

The Godfather," Impressive, most impressive...
","All of my 21 years of living, I had never had the desire to see The Godfather movies.  I didn't care much about the Mafia or anything related to it.  Then one day, I was a little bored (I do live in Lubbock ya know) and I started watching this movie.  Wow.  Great acting, great mood, great everything.  This is basically a perfect picture.  Francis Ford Coppola brought together everything and made the film very realistic.  And let's not forget Al Pacino's stirring performance as Michael Corleone.  Great flick. Too bad George Kennedy's not in it.",10,0,1,7 September 2002
