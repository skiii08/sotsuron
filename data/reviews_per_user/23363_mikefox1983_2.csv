Sucker Punch," Beautiful in every way
","I normally do not write reviews for movies, however, when a movie has left an impression on me I feel compelled to do so. I actually had high expectations for Sucker Punch and this movie exceeded those expectations. It's not just a bunch of hot girls in skimpy outfits kicking trash and an overabundant amount of CGI. The story is fantastic, easy to follow, and downright original. I can guarantee that the people who do not like this movie are stuck up, and have no imagination, and are probably the kind of people I wouldn't want to hang out with. If you aren't one of these people, then I promise you will love it from start to finish. I can only wish more movies brought such entertainment and originality.",10,10,20,27 March 2011
The Woman in Black," Really?
","I saw this movie tonight and was kind of disappointed. There was nothing really new about it. It was filled with all the same old parlor tricks you've seen in every other horror film. The only thing i liked was the atmosphere. The acting was fine but there was no attachment to the characters. I couldn't care less what happened to them. I did feel that it had potential but it was wasted with overdone and over the top 'jumpy' scare tactics. When i watch a good movie, it usually inspires me or somehow changes the way I feel when its over. This film didn't do anything like that. I felt it hit a plateau early on and it just couldn't get any better.Not really sure how this movie received such high ratings. My guess is that they will drop in the next couple of weeks.",5,11,20,4 February 2012
