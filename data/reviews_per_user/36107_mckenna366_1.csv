The Avengers," It's amazing how much eye candy now influences the film industry.
","I shall start this review by mentioning the fact that The Avengers is one of the most overrated movies of all time. It's simply awful. If you agree with the large fanbase of idiots who enjoyed this film listen carefully. Joss Wheadon is an autistic oversized 5 year old who crammed his dreams and aspirations of being a superhero into a big budget, eye pleasing blockbuster with less than mediocre acting and terrible green screen. The storyline is so tedious (I don't even care if it's based on a popular comic series) that i wouldn't be surprised if a 5 year old wrote this movie. There is an incredible amount of bad acting (which deserves to be in a junior school play) displayed by Chris Hemsworth and Tom Huddlestone (despite being the only credited actor I respect on this film. Now you may argue that Robert-Downey Jr. is an amazing actor, but I disagree. His ego flourishes as Tony Stark which displays his incapicity to act in various roles. SUMMARY: The Avengers is an extremely overrated film which is no where near on the level as Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight'. It contains poor script writing, cheesy effects, acting and directing. I can already tell what Marvel's 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is going to be like, and I have no doubt that the eye candy and cheesy jokes will brainwash 90% of the general public to like it.",3,3,7,11 July 2014
