Ghost," A Film That Has Stuck With Me
","Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) and Molly Jenson (Demi Moore) are a young couple living in a studio apartment in the city.  But when Sam is accidentally shot while defending Molly from some thug, his desire to stay with her is so strong that his ghost remains on Earth.  He tracks down the man who killed him, but can do nothing to manipulate the world around him.  That is, until he meets Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg), a con-artist/seer who can hear him speak.  Sam now must enlist the help of a reluctant Oda Mae to warn Molly that the killer may come back for her as a potential witness against him.This isn't one of the greatest films of all time, but every aspect of the film is somewhat above average.  For 1990, the effects are very good, especially the shadow monsters.  Bruce Joel Rubin writes an excellent and original script that manages to capture female audiences early one with the two people in love and male audiences with the murder mystery/thriller aspect.  Oda Mae is also thrown in for some good comic relief.And I like seeing Demi Moore before she became all plastic and lost that innocence she seemed to have.  The cast is uniformly good, and the cameo from Vincent Schiavelli as the 'Subway Lord' is one of the best parts of the movie.  It may not be for everybody, but you must give it a chance if you've never seen it.",Null,1,2,10 February 2003
Unbreakable," Good Jobs by Shyamalan, Jackson
","When David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is the sole survivor in a train wreck that killed 132 people, he begins to realize that he is not the average person. He seems to never get sick, and is stronger than a man his size should be. Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), an eccentric comic book collector, is wheelchair bound after a series of injuries due to his unnatural fragile body.  He believes that Dunn could hold the secret to a cure for his condition.  Dunn brushes Price off as a nut at first, but as events in David's life start getting more and more odd, he starts to wonder...This is a crime thriller with a sci-fi twist, but it is certainly more original than 99% of the other blockbusters coming out of Hollywood.  M. Night Shyamalan does a great directorial job here.  I wish I checked the names of the D. of photography and cintemotographer, too, because they certainly pulled their own weight.And I must mention Samuel L. Jackson's performance, the man is just amazing. If he wasn't so publicly visible, he could be considered a character actor. He definetly steals the show whenever he's on the screen in Unbreakable. Willis, however, was somewhat dissapointing.  I think he's a good example of what happens to a character actor when they start to get too comfortable with being in the public eye.  He did some amazing work before Die Hard, so hopefully he will win my heart again with Tears of the Sun.",Null,0,0,10 February 2003
Fight Club," Overrated and trite.
","I do not understand why people seem to like this film.  To me, it really just looks like a shallow whupass movie made for trendy fruits.  Most of it focuses in illogical sex and violence which really don't seem to have much of a purpose.  I'm glad this didn't sell too well here in the states; it's good to know that most of America isn't like people in Hollywood.  Brad Pitt, as usual, seems to just be reading off his lines and Ed Norton has lost all the flame he had in American History X.  Just a pointless, brainless mess of a movie.  One of the most overrated I have ever seen, *ever*.",6,0,2,30 July 2003
Memento," Stunning Work, Nolan is Amazing
","Memento is about Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), a man who lost his short term memory after being jumped from behind while attacking his wife's rapists/murderers.  He spends his life as a drifter, trying to hunt down the man responsible (I'm pretty sure he shot the first of the two rapists - I can't remember now).  Because of his condition, he must carry a series of sticky notes and photos to remind himself of where he is and what he's doing; his life is heavily based on routine.Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) is apparently Leonard's somewhat annoying friend.  He tries to help Leonard track this man down, while simultaneously looking out for him, warning him to stay away from Natalie (Carrie-Ann Moss), who he says is only trouble.  She says the exact opposite.The trick to this movie is, aside from black-and-white interludes of Leonard on the phone with a stranger, the whole thing goes backwards; i.e., the beginning of each scene coincides with the end of the scene which you will see next.  Chris Nolan wrote and directed this little gem; I don't think anyone but the guy who wrote it could grasp it enough to bring it to life.As far as the plot and dialogue goes, it is actually original enough to where it could be good without the backwards progression - i've never seen such a crime-thriller with a character with such a condition.  But the fact that Nolan shot this backwards, and made it work, makes this not good, but great.  This is a thinking movie - if you just got off Friday from a long week at work and want to relax with a movie, don't rent this.  Memento would be best on weekends when you and preferably a group of people have time to watch it over and try to figure it out.Added bonus on the DVD - there's a second version of the movie that plays forward, so you can see the scenes in chronological order.And kudos to the cast, especially Pantoliano.  He tends to steal the show in his scenes.",9,0,2,29 January 2003
12 Monkeys," Nah.
","A convict (Bruce Willis) goes back in time (to the present day) to stop a virus from wiping out 99% of humanity.  Because, you see, this story is in the future, and in the past (present), a disease was released that forced survivors to live underground.  Willis is from the present (future), where they know how to do time travel.  But when he gets to our present (past), they think he's crazy and Brad Pitt must examine him.This was like most sci-fi/action movies.  It has a moderately interesting, completely impossible storyline that gets made into a cheesy movie that's indistinguishible (don't nag about my spelling) from all the other sci-fi/actions movies out there.  Madeline Stowe was pretty good, though.",Null,0,1,1 July 2003

Ed Wood," Great!
","In this film, Tim Burton pays homage to the legendary bad director, Ed Wood. Never in my life did I think someone could make such a good movie about such a bad director.  The film follows Ed Wood through some of his early years as a director and ends after his disastrous film, Plan 9 From Outer Space.I would gush about how good Johnny Depp is, but he's always good.  And i'm not just saying this in passing; i've never seen the man turn in a bad performance, even when he's in a bad movie.  He really becomes Ed Wood in this.  Martin Landau is also wonderful as Bela Lugosi; I had no idea the man was so tortured.  And definate kudos to George 'The Animal' Steele.  I met George through my stepfather a few months back, and he's a great guy.  Also, watch for the man playing Orson Welles near the end.  You should recognize him.",Null,0,0,29 May 2003
Insomnia," Totally Radical
","And no, that summary isn't mean to be sarcastic, either.  That's just how I talk.As it says, this film is totally rad.  If you're here, you should know the general plot line, so i'll save you the recap.  Chris Nolan had some good angles here, and also a good editor; the cuts they do at certain points move so fast that they cause agitation, which works well considering the subject of the film.  The three main performers are also very good.  An all around swell film.",Null,0,0,20 May 2003
X-Men," It was ok.
","There have been a lot of comments here from people who loved the comic books.  Well, I used to read comic books, but actually, I never liked X-Men. I don't know why; it's nothing I could put my finger on.  I just didn't like the general plotline.Likewise, I can't really point out why I didn't like this movie.  I'm never impressed by fancy expensive effects, so those didn't save it for me.  I just didn't like it.  But most people did, so if you haven't seen it yet, give it a try.",5,1,2,20 May 2003
Malcolm X," Biggest Oscar snub of the 90's.
","In this film, Spike Lee tells the story of Malcolm X (Denzel Washington), touching lightly on his younger years, and detailing the change going to prison brought on in him, and the change leaving Elijah Muhammad's (Al Freeman Jr.) Nation of Islam to become orthodox.  We also get to see X's private life away from the camera's, from the influence Baines (Albert Hall) had on him to the life he lived with his wife Betty (Angela Basset).I was already familiar with Spike Lee's work before this film, but this is the movie that turned me into a Denzel Washington fan.  Before I saw this, I brushed him off as another star gliding by on his looks - not because of his choice of roles or anything, but because I had never seen him in any films and tend to be skeptical about everything.  When I saw this, I realized what a powerful presence he has.  The glimpse we get of Malcolm X's transformation has Washington virtually portraying three completely different people.  The scene where he breaks down when he meets Elijah Muhammad for the first time is one of the most powerful moments on film.  I suppose the soundtrack helped that scene, but both Washington and Freeman Jr. were breathtaking there.Basset was great, but she always is.  Not to diminish her talent, but to be honest, I haven't seen her give a merely average performance yet, much less a poor one.  So, I wasn't expecting any less of her.  Lee was very unbiased in his portrayal of X, showing the audience how angry he was, and how when he first converted to Islam, he didn't do it because of religion - he did it almost as a means of channeling his anger.  I also like how Lee shows him eating with white Muslims in Mecca at the end.  Some of my family adhere to the Nation of Islam, and they seem to forget that Malcolm quit hating white people near the end of his life.  It is just too bad that his life was ended by other black nationalists.  In Islam we have something called maktoub - you cannot escape fate.  So, I suppose he was meant to go down for taking a stand.  Very sad, yes, but out of all the ways to die, it's probably the most honorable.Both Lee and Washington were amazing here.  I used to keep up to date with Oscar nominations (until films like Titanic and Saving Private Ryan started sweeping the awards - they were good, but not the best), and out of the 1991-2000 decade, Washington's nomination for Best Male Actor was probably the biggest snub.  But, who cares.  It's a good film on it's own, one all people should see.",Null,3,10,14 February 2003
Full Metal Jacket," Excellent View of Dehumanization
","Full Metal Jacket, directed by Stanley Kubrick, is usually thought of as being two segments, although I have read here on IMDb (from the trivia section and other reviewers) that it is a three-part movie: boot camp, the Tet Offensive, and a struggle against an unseen sniper.  The first segment focuses on the conflict between the troops' drill instructor, Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) and the tall and overweight Private Leonard 'Gomer Pyle' Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio), with Private J.T. 'Joker' Davis (Matthew Modine, the film's lead) as a bystander to this.  We then see Joker in a new troop covering the Tet Offensive for Stars & Stripes, and see how he doesn't quite fit in.  The third part follows the troops as they struggle against a sniper, ending the film with a rather intense scene.Stanley Kubrick is one of those directors who make a career out of making movies which are 'different'; this is not the typical Vietnam film.  The focus of the movie is not action, and consequently, the average idiot moviegoer will probably find this film 'boring', because they are forced to think.  There are three main plot points for each section: dehumanization, the duality of man, and the physical conflict of war.  Much like Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line, Full Metal Jacket lacks the fake non-stop action of other war films because, as most veterans will tell you, war isn't like Saving Private Ryan.  It's subdued; an entire battle may go on for two hours and only a few shots are fired.  Most of the time is spent in trenches, flat on your stomach trying to not get shot.  The battle with the sniper is dead-on to the gritty, drawn out, plodding nature of most battles, and done quite well.The performances are all around good.  Matthew Modine is adequate in his breakthrough role, although I must say, he looked pretty scrawny here compared to how he is now; he must have just been a kid.  R. Lee Ermey gives by far the best performance ever of a drill instructor, although that could be because he wasn't performing; he was a Marine drill instructor for years, and was not allowed to fraternize with the other actors during the filming of this movie, probably so they would still be afraid of him.  A definite honorable mention goes to Adam Baldwin as Animal Mother; although playing a moronic dunderhead may seem easy, there are many examples of actors trying and going way off the mark.  And, of course, we all remember Vincent D'Onofrio's scary performance as the recruit driven to insanity.  He gained 75 pounds for this role, which could distract some from his excellent performance.'I AM...in a world...of sh*t.'",10,0,0,24 February 2003

The Battle of Algiers," Surprisingly Unbiased
","As a second generation Algerian immigrant to the states, I am familiar with Algeria's history.  So, when I heard this way made by the Algerian government, I was expecting a typically biased propaganda film.  I was wrong - very wrong.This is one of the most realistic war films I have ever seen.  It is made even more impressive by the fact that it was made in the 60's, before big budget Hollywood effects, and it was made in what was, at the time, a third world country.  It is also realistic in the fact that there is not set 'good' or 'bad'.  It shows that in war, everyone must go to extreme measures, trying constantly to top the enemy's gruesome acts.  The scene when the suicide bombers know they are about to kill some of their own people along with the French is stunning.The characters are very well acted as well.  This could be due to that fact that the film was made right after the revolution, so it was still fresh in their memories.  I suppose I am probably biased, because this film tells the story of my ancestors country, but I'm sure most non-Algerians could agree that it is a very important film in this new world we live in.  I rank it with Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line and Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket as the best war films I have ever seen.  And I have seen a LOT of war films.",10,4,8,24 January 2003
Flashdance," It's kind of cheesy, but fun to watch.
","Flashdance follows the story of a welder by day, exotic dancer by night super-girl.  She wants to be a ballet dancer, but seems to lack confidence at the beginning.  It is, for the most part, a trendy story about perseverance.This was the start of fluffy MTV movies.  As much as I hate those types of movies now, I can't help but smile at this one.  The scenes are cheesy and akward, and the story is rather implausible, but it's still a cute film. It's also nice to see Jennifer Beals before she became the indie goddess she is today.",Null,2,4,1 July 2003
Saving Private Ryan," Both Great and Overrated, at the Same Time
","Three brothers in the Ryan family, who have enlisted to fight in the US military in WWII, have been killed in various theaters of war.  As the military prepares to notify the mother of the deaths of her three sons, they discover that there's a fourth brother - Private James Ryan (Matt Damon).  A group of soldiers led by Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) is sent to Northern Europe to find him, if he is still alive, and send him home.  The film follows there long, hard trek to find this man, and then get him out.This is a great film, like many of Spielberg's are, but I have to say, it is a bit overrated.  There are many great war films, and I wouldn't quite but this one in the top five.  Definetly the top ten, better than most war films, but not quite the top five.The action scenes are groundbreaking; this was a first in what was considered acceptable in cinema.  Spielberg only focuses on this, though. We see what the troops go through physically, but not mentally; every now and then, we get some strained expressions on their faces, but Spielberg never uses his proven film making skills to put you in these guys shoes, to let you know what they're thinking.Consequently, we only get half the story.  How can I put this in the top ten, then?  Because the other half is just done so well.  There are also good performances here - this is the only time I liked Vin Diesel. Remember, i'm not knocking this film - I put it in the top ten best war films ever made.  Definetly a classic.  I just think it's stretching it when people rave that this is the best war film ever.  Don't let this fool you - buy a copy of this on DVD.",4,3,5,29 January 2003
Men in Black II," Ok Film As Long As You Don't Compare It To The First
","As we find out, Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) has had his memory wiped to accomodate his return to civilian life.  But when an alien menace (Lara Flynn Boyle) comes looking for some sort of light thingie, Agent J (Will Smith) must find Agent K, the only one who knows where it is, to help save the planet.  But when a civilian (Rosario Dawson) becomes involved, Agent J may end up letting personal feelings get involved with his work, something Agent K already let happen, with bad results.This is an alright film if you judge it by the beauty of it's simplicity. Films like this, when analyzed at a peice of art, just don't measure up, but that's really not their aim.  However, this isn't a good as the first one. It seems more like a TV movie than a real feature film.Lara Flynn Boyle and Johnny Knoxville should never have been cast.  I have a feeling they got the parts for ther 'image', but Uma Thurman and John Leguizamo (sp?) would have been better in those parts.Smith and Jones were still great in their scenes together, and I loved seeing much of the original supporting cast back; Tony Shalhoub, Rip Torn, and David Cross all rocked the house.  Fiorentino and D'Onofrio were gone, but their characters couldn't have been worked back into the plot anyway. An alright film.",Null,0,0,24 March 2003
Black Hawk Down," Good Acting & SPX Can't Save This Racist Piece of Propaganda
","In short, Ridley Scott attempts to summarize what exactly went down with the US soldiers in Somalia in 1993.  I would be more inclined to forgive this film's propaganda motive if it weren't for the fact that it was poorly directed at times.There are definetly too many characters.  There is no development, and the only way an audience could feel a connection with these characters is if they wanted to, and forced the feelings out for some ideological reason or another.  Tom Sizemore was good as always, as was the rest of the cast considering the material they were working with, but they just can't save this.I won't go into the many reasons as to why this film is such a racist and factually inaccurate piece of work, but I do have an interesting side note. Brendan Sexton, who played the role of Alphabet, was very publicly critical of this film after they edited it.  Apparently, his character had a monologue near the end about how the US shouldn't have been there in the first place, but in the wake of the Sept. 11th attacks, it was cut out to give this film just another piece of brainless insta-patriot spin.On the upside, Ridley Scott did wonders visually.  Like Speilberg in Saving Private Ryan, another lackluster and unrealistic war film, Scott pushed the boundaries of what is considered acceptable in the violence department. He has guts, and knows how to show the physical aspect of war very accurately. I've seen things similar to Somalia before (seriously, don't ask), and that is really what it's like.When looking at this film from a critical standpoint, it's full of extremes in the areas of battle direction and story/developement, which still tend to balance out to a somewhat poor film.  This is one movie that, no matter how much I dislike many aspects of it, I would recommend seeing even though it isn't good.  Even people who dislike it even more than me admit that it stays with you.  So, see it for yourself.",2,3,7,4 March 2003
Men in Black," A Good Film To Help You Forget
","This film is about the Men in Black, a top secret government agency specializing in dealing with alien visitors and relations and keeping them a secret from the general public.  We see the film mainly from the point of view of Agent J (Will Smith), a new recruit brought up to speed by Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones).  Together, the two of them must track down an intergalactic terrorist hiding in a human body (Vincent D'Onofrio).Yeah, it sounds really stupid.  And technically, it is, and also completely implausible.  But so what?  This is the kind of movie you need after a 40 hour week of work to relax.  You can just watch it and not think about anything else.  These types really aren't very deep and from a critical standpoint severely lacking in the script department, but they're fun and you can actually watch it with your kids without being embarassed.Jones and Smith totally own this movie.  It's rare to see two guys who can work so well together.  And Vincent D'Onofrio steals every scene he's in as the towering zombie-like creature.  Linda Fiorentino also rocks as Dr. Weaver.  I wonder why she had to win this role in a game of poker with the director, it's not like she couldn't pull it off.  A fun, light-hearted flick.",Null,0,0,24 March 2003
There's Something About Mary," Average & Overrated
","Ted (Ben Stiller) was a nerd who almost went to the prom with a high school beauty, Mary (Cameron Diaz).  When he *ahem* is not able to attend, the two of them don't keep in touch.  Years later, he hires a private investigator (Matt Dillon) to locate her so they can catch up on each others' lives and remnisce (sp?) about the past, and, as Ted hopes, maybe even pick up where they left off.  But as the PI begins to fall in love with Mary, he does everything he can to keep Ted away from her.The plot sounds like it could be entertaining, but this movie just doesn't deliver.  It isn't really as gross as many people say; there are some jump scenes, but nothing too serious.  Dillon and Stiller do seem to perform the roles well, but they aren't grand, and even good performances can't save a bad movie.The directorial work is marginal, but bearable.  It's really the script that did this one in.  As interesting as the plot may sound, it only has the potential to go so far, and even here, it did not meet that limited potential.  You'd be better off renting 'Dumb & Dumber' if you're in the mood for a good comedy, because this is mostly a grouping of cliches and some sexual references which are neither funny nor actually crude/offensive, just bland.",5,2,4,3 February 2003

McMurphy takes it upon himself to alleviate the situation.This is a great movie, but it was very different from the book.  Chief Bromden was originally the main character throughout the entire book, while in the movie, he only becomes the primary character near the end.

The Thin Red Line," One of the Three Best American War Films, Ever.
","Directed and written by Terrence Malick, based on James Jones' novel, The Thin Red Line follows the C For Charlie company as they battle for a strategically important hill at Guadalcanal during WWII.  As the men form bonds of life and death on the battlefield, the story becomes more and more character driven, and the men are fighting for their own survival, ignoring the outside world as they drag on.  I could not do justice to the film with my words, but here it goes.Malick and John Toll (a friend of my family) have created a visual masterpiece.  This has less action scenes than most war films, mainly because this is philosophical.  Many have called this movie 'anti-war', which I believe is incorrect.  Most war films now insult the viewers intelligence; they pose no important moral questions about humanity.  All mysteries of the way men function during war are fully explained away by the director, leaving no room for the viewer to form their own opinions about what is going on before them.The Thin Red Line does not insult the viewer's intelligence like this. Instead, Malick shows the ugliest side of a war which most people generally agree needed to be fought.  One could arrive at either the conclusion that 'war is bad', or that 'WWII was necesary' from watching this; Malick is surprisingly unbiased.  But the fact that you aren't TOLD what to think, that Malick takes no noticable moral position on the war, that you can't decide who's right and who's wrong in the conversations between Sg.t Welsh (Sean Penn) and Pvt. Witt (Jim Caviezel) drives many people crazy, as they are used to being told how to feel.  Consequently, this film is stereotyped as being 'anti-war', when it is not so concrete.The performances are solid, although I thought the casting of Clooney and Travolta was a bit distracting.  Nick Nolte, one of my favorite storytellers, gives a great portrayal of a man who sees this war as a mere game to further his career.  I could say Penn was amazing, but I feel that way whenever I see him, so I may be biased.  Caviezel did, quite simply, give one of the best performances I have seen an actor give...ever. Regardless of genre or time period.All nations have their own legacies, and in American war films, this is by far in the top three best.  I would say the other two are The Deer Hunter and Full Metal Jacket, again, films which many deride as strongly 'anti-war', and again, something I disagree with.  Simply showing the fact that war is hell is not saying that it cannot be justified; it's simply giving an accurate portrayal of the way war is.Most veterans I have talked to say no film gives a more accurate potrayal of what troops went through mentally/psychologically in WWII than Terrence Malick's the Thin Red Line.  This is one of the three or four films (out of several hundred) on IMDB I gave a 10/10 rating to.  If you like war films, buy this for your DVD collection, and even if you don't like war films, rent this just to see what you've been missing.",10,6,12,3 February 2003
