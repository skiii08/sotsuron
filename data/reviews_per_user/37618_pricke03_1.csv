Angels & Demons," On your seat the whole movie!
","I have never read the novel this movie was based on but the film is excellent. The filming in Paris is well laid out and fulfills the whole story line well. The theme is well hidden but found toward the end of the film. Though a dark lit movie, it falls in line with the film before it of The Da Vinci Code. Well played and a film that keeps you guessing and wanting to know the outcome throughout.Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) comes back as the symbol guru. Once the pope dies it is time to select the new pope. Tying in with a science experiment, the Illuminati has a mystery involved in it and Langdon is sent for in order to get through the clues of the event. I believe the theme is directed to secrets in high places. Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) is the daughter of the physicist that discovered a destructive weapon that may get into the wrong hands. Vittoria's father is killed and the clues begin. Langdon and Vetra team up to find out the clues to discover the secret behind the weapon all while seeing how the Illuminati ties in or if it even does.All while the clues are being deciphered there is a killer on the loose. This killer is linked to one of the hidden secrets of the two problems that Langdon and Vetra are trying to get to the bottom of. All together there is a lot going on.Camera angles aid in discovering who is intended to be seen doing what. There were times I would catch myself noticing things outside the main characters. These things I caught helped me follow more closely what was exactly going on. The angles were not noticed until I watched the movie another timeThis movie had me on thinking mode the whole time. Wondering why, how, and when was a fun aspect of watching the film. Camera angles and certain scenes were clues to certain aspects of the film. Sound was good and lighting was dark as stated before. Some of the scenes were darker than I would like but the way it is done it helps you focus on the shot and get only what the film maker intended you to get. The darkness plays well with the films intention.This movie calls for close attention. There are secrets in high places. There are different things going on in the movie that you must keep up with for the whole movie to make sense. Overall this movie was one worth watching again and again to catch other things I had missed before.",9,0,1,19 September 2010
