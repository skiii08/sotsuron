Hereditary," Where have 2 hours of my life gone?
","We settled down to watch what presented and marketed as something as awesome as the Exorcist! (The Actors are all awesome in other films) However, the reviews were over hyped and steered us to watch the film. BUT ..55 minutes in..we were still waiting for something to happen. Staring at each other we were yawning and falling asleep. A quick nudge to wake my wife to see a few naked bodies and some beheadings and a floating body! REALLY! .....YAWN....I'm going back to watch The Exorcist, The Burning and Superstion...Very disappointed...",2,2,4,26 August 2018
