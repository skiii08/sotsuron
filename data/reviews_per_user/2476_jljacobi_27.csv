Iron Man 3," Convoluted, over the top FX -- Saved by a fascinating actors
","There's a reason Robert Downey Jr. is a star. He's fun to watch. So is the supporting cast. Without him, or them, this flick would've been pretty bad. Whomever writes the script outlines and decided on the FX (which are well rendered for what they are) should be fired. The movie meanders, trying hard to please everyone, and winds up proving the old adage. I call it script writing by demographics--you have to throw in a scene to appeal to every category of movie-goer, no matter how little sense it makes or how it affects the flow. It also seems they promise a certain amount of screen time to every actor/actress to get them to sign.The FX are conceptually over the top, especially in the climactic scene. It seems that in FX-driven movies, there's an arms race to see who can create the most ridiculous, outlandish material. Only a ten-year old would be impressed. It's getting so obvious that the FX are becoming a distraction rather than an enhancement.Despite my complaints, I enjoyed the movie--for the most part. As I said, there were interesting characterizations and quite a few fun bits. But I found the ending trite, unsatisfying, and hypocritical.",5,0,3,4 September 2013
Darkest Hour," Fantastic performance, great movie
","Gary Oldman is dead on and the movie inspiring. At least for those that can imagine that WWII was not a done deal it appears to have been in retrospect.Much of the movie is historically accurate, with of course the alway-present need to create characters. That's not a hard thing to do with Churchill, who was one of the, if not the greatest personality of the first half of the century.My only, and very mild complaint, is the impression the movie gives that it was the civilian fleet that saved the troops at Dunkirk. While a number of civilian vessels were used, most were manned by naval personnel, and the majority of the troops were rescued but the Navy itself.Aside from that, great stuff. Best movie I've seen in a while and again, Oldman is fantastic as usual. I'd never have known it was him if not for the credits.",9,0,2,9 April 2019
Iron Man 2," Sequel-itis reigns. Okay, not good
","Overall, it's entertaining but this movie digresses too far and too often. When it's just Robert Downey Jr.and whomever, the movie is at it's best, it has a heart. Otherwise, not so much.And yes Hollywood, 13-year old boys will like tight, solid movies with a simple compelling plot. They don't have to be tantalized with Scarlett in tight leather for a two-minute martial arts session that leads to absolutely nothing plot-wise in the middle of the climactic showdown.Screen-writing by demographic. I've seen worse, for instance the remake of Mighty Joe Young (everyone should see the original then the remake as a case study in how to ruin a simple, compelling storyline) but this one's pretty obvious.Not to scare you off, I enjoyed the movie for the most part. But the obvious button pushes, Hollywood insider humor and gonad-targeting stifled much of it. That's from me, who's beyond the demographic, and my much younger cousins who are smack dab in the center.",5,1,4,5 September 2010
Star Trek Into Darkness," Good, but not as good as the the first
","This is a good movie, but only because the cast have so faithfully recreated the appealing characters of the original cast. The rest of the actors also do quite well. But it gets caught up occasionally in a secondary plot and a political message and loses its focus.I also had what I like to call a 'Titanic' moment. I know a lot of people loved that movie, but when I saw the leads dancing around in the freezing Atlantic waters which apparently had been warmed to bath temperature by flooding into the ship, any suspension of disbelief I'd had came crashing down. And that was a real event! This wasn't quite as bad, and I won't mention the STID moment that hit me like that to spoil it for anyone who reads this, but it was rather large. The science in ST is always a little fantastic, but this was sophomoric. Hint: it has to do with gravity.Also, there should be someone with a ruler ready to whack JJ on the head for the next movie and say 'You did that in the last one!' I also missed the slightly skewed ego maniacal strut that another actor once gave a certain bad guy. Speaking of which... Any movie only needs one of those, not two.I don't want to complain too much because all in all, the movie is enjoyable. I'm not sorry I spent the money, and will definitely watch it again when it hits Blu-ray.With every movie I see, I always listen to the crowd leaving the theater to see how much they enjoyed it. They were buzzing in delight after the first one, not this one. The cast lifted this one a full two points in my opinion.",7,1,3,10 June 2013
Balls of Fury," 5.3.... Are you kidding me? Better than that if you get the references.
","Humor is subjective, but to me this movie is both fun and funny. Not to mention a great tribute/parody on the karate flicks, primarily Enter the Dragon, that it mimics. I often use it to lighten a bad mood.I think part of the reason it's rated so low is that a lot of viewers may not be familiar with the old-school martial arts films and not get the premise, and/or the references. If you don't, I can imagine a lot of the humor whizzing right past you.Let's put it another way. If you don't think the idea of a ping-pong underworld and ping-pong death matches is funny, you may not like the movie. If you do, watch. I think Dan Fogler is brilliant, as are nearly all the bit players.It's over the top, but in a friendly sort of fashion. Don't dismiss it because of the low rating.",8,1,2,27 September 2015
Aquaman," It's dumb and full of plot holes--but that's okay
","I can't tell you how many times I noticed something amiss in this movie, only to have the pace and sheer likability of it have me forget about it almost immediately. Visually, it's stunning and once you get the idea, fun to watch.Shakespeare it ain't, but somehow the movie manages to make it all work. The dialog is cheesy and many interactions are camp. I mean what other superhero movie can you think of that tries to make us feel something for a bad guy that just killed a bunch of innocent people? Okay, maybe Loki. But in the same scene? Or one that has an endless kiss that takes place in lieu of the hero stopping the carnage of a major battle? That latter was a bit much for me, but hey...Obviously, the movie doesn't want you to take anything too seriously, so don't. Just sit back and enjoy a nearly endless stream of fascinating visuals and action sequences, and the off-kilter approach. It looks like they had lots of fun making it, and that comes through.",6,0,1,25 January 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Very good but walks a fine comedic line
","Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this movie. Just about all the acting is top notch and it's, well fun. But there is an aspect that you see sometimes in Hollywood, generally when actors get too much input, of 'top this' or 'I want a funny line too!'. In short, it borders on being to comedic for its own good.But only borders. Overall, the movie manages to walk the line pretty well. Every once in a while I thought I was watching the actor and not the character. But only rarely. I especially enjoyed Jeff Goldblum who was actually pleasantly understated when he had a chance to go way over the top (in a bad way) Regardless, and in spite of Marvel's shameless mangling of Norse mythology, it's good time.",7,0,2,7 December 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Not what I'd hoped for
","There are moments, but his is easily the worst Avenger's related movie to date. I never read Marvel comics, I was always a DC guy. Or I should say kid as I left them behind pretty young. But the Avenger's movies have been pretty good.Nothing against the actors, who are all quite personable, especially the leads, but there's just something off about the whole approach. Exactly how long does it take to convey teen angst? Get on with it for heaven's sake. Like many a modern movie, this one's too long and filled with characters and scenes that could've been omitted. The Avengers flicks can get away with this because all the heroes are interesting. Peter's school chums, not so much.From what I understand, Spiderman fans might find this truer to the spirit of the original character, but non-fans will probably wonder what happened to their Avenger movie. In that vein, this is the first that isn't on my re-watch list.Ultimately, for my taste--completely forgettable.",6,3,4,5 October 2017
Bohemian Rhapsody," Very good, but spotty flow
","If you like Queen, and with their iconic rock anthems, just about everyone does, you'll like the movie. The acting is top-notch, and Malek nails the conflicted Freddy.That said, I personally would've like a bit more about the early days of the band. The movie synopsizes those years and events in favor of Freddy's admittedly more interesting story, but the result is that the rest of the band members seem relatively two-dimensional.I suppose my real complaint is that while this is indeed really a biopic of Freddy Mercury, it's just a little bit too much so. It's dead-on in portraying his conflicts with his gay lifestyle and the lifestyle itself, but overboard with it. There's way more than is required to make the point.It's a very good movie but a slightly shorter cut would make it even better. Just an opinion. You feel good at the end, regardless of Freddy's doomed circumstances, a tricky bit, so that's a plus.Worth watching.",7,1,2,18 January 2019
U-571," Pure dreck...
","Historically inaccurate in the extreme, impossible situations--the movie in general and the behavior of the characters in particular is an insult to the people who served. It's reprehensible that Hollywood tries to pass this stuff off as being even vaguely historical. Sadly,  there will be some who think that this is the way it happened.",3,3,6,27 July 2002
Pearl Harbor," The event itself wasn't compelling enough?
","This ode to James Cameron's notion that every historical drama must have an overblown romance in tow is beyond belief. Way over the top. I was getting depressed listening to the dirge of a soundtrack from another room--and the attack was still half the movie away. Admittedly, there are some nice action shots, but even these often exceed the bounds of possible reality.As to the loose morality that Hollywood is so caught up in  that it can't help but inject it into every film, a quote from one of the real nurses who was present at the  December 7th, 'Well, they got some of it right, but we weren't sluts.'",4,0,1,27 July 2002
Avengers: Endgame," Entertaining in many spots, but too long, too complex, and too maudlin
","Before I start, I rated Infinity war two stars higher. I thought it was very good movie.This movie has many good moments, but there are way too many didn't-have-to-be-there moments along side them. Too many characters, to much time devoted to each one. It's a series of vignettes tied loosely together by a outrageously irrational plot.But in the end, when I think about it, it was the largely pointless and depressing exposition that rattles on for a good hour that really killed it for me. I seriously almost walked out.I'm not going into plot specifics because they simply won't stand the scrutiny of logic, but I will mention that Captain Marvel seems to be there just to advertise that franchise and she comes and goes for no apparent reason. There's another product placement so obvious that I groaned out loud, along with several people around me. This is a movie driven by too many concerns other than simply making a really good film.If you loved it, god bless you. I found it maudlin and bouyed only by a lot of very, very good acting and interesting characters. If that's enough for you, say no more.I will say that if the point was to end my interest in future Marvel movies, it pretty much did the job.",6,6,11,29 April 2019
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Technically superior; far, far too long
","It takes less time to read the entire book than watch one installment of this 'trilogy'. Peter Jackson must have needed work badly to participate in, or create this overblown epic.I find it shocking that viewers have rated it above 8. Yes, it looks good. That and the fact that there's hardly any toilet humor, except in the most literal sense, are the only reasons I rated it as high as 5. Beyond that, it suffers J.K. Rowling syndrome,i.e., the love of one's own voice and the inability to edit. Or is the motivation monetary? The action sequences are too numerous and too long. Indeed, everything is too long.The charm of the book is nowhere to be found. Well, I did notice Martin Freeman trying to inject some at a couple of points, but his efforts are are lost in a sea of effects and needless action. Also, there can't be any climax because everything is so amped up from the start. When not amped up, it's needlessly dreary. Is Kiwi weather relentlessly gray or something?Finally, I'm getting sick of movie-makers changing books and adding characters to suit their own vision, or please some imagined demographic. People love a good story. I do. But this one's so bogged down by effluvium that I can't imagine sitting through the opening credits again, let alone the entire flick. The entire trilogy boiled down into one two-hour (maximum) movie. That I might watch. That's what it should have been. Otherwise, they won't get any more money out of me. I'm officially in protest. You should be too.",5,4,5,20 March 2014
Wreck-It Ralph," Lots of heart
","I was not expecting to like this movie nearly as much as I did, but the voices and characters drew me in right off the bat. The two leads are fantastic, as are most of the support. There are tons of little touches that gamers, even older ones will appreciate. However, it's not a simple homage. The movie pays tribute, but melds it all into a perfect world all its own. The story is simple, classic, and to the point. There's little in the way of Follywood demographic button-pushing and it somehow makes even the light toilet humor seem classy.Films like this, the Incredibles, UP, etc. make one wonder if not all of the best talent in motion pictures is in animation these days.",9,3,3,13 July 2013
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Maybe it's just me...
","I liked the first movie enough to re-watch it, but the sequel is too long, too simplistic, and is yet another Hollywood epic that preaches pacifism and negotiation only to create a final solution out of violence. The politically correct messages are overbearing, the catering to every conceivable demographic obvious, and the characterizations disturbingly one-note. The whiny mannerisms of the hero really began to bug me only a short way into the movie. And they kill off an important character who happened to be my favorite. Does anyone else find it odd that the other characters seem blissfully happy only a few minutes later?How this movie has garnered a rating over 8 is beyond me. It's contrived and a real disappointment in my book.",5,34,67,1 September 2014
Big Hero 6," Not for adults, not very good
","When I saw the Disney name of this I figured it has to be pretty decent. Instead, it's another scripted by demographic, clichéd (even in trying to counter them) adolescent fantasy.I take that back. That's selling adolescence short. I'm figuring that anyone over the age of 11 is going to find this movie less than satisfying.I find it absolutely mind-boggling that this movie won an Oscar. Was it the only animated film made last year or something? I'd rate this hardly better than Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2. And that's bad.I'd say buy it for your kids, but I'm thinking you might not want to expose them to any more of Hollywood's hypocritical, schizophrenic relationship with violence than you have to.It's sad to see Disney produce stuff like this.",5,11,59,8 March 2015
Elysium," Looks great, liked Damon, too many stereotypes, wrong focus
","I liked District 9, it had a quirkiness that's lacking in this film. Elysium's visuals are stunning, and well thought out, but the concept is rife with South African sensitivities. The elite are shallow or downright evil, the military types are brutish, and the only people with any spark of goodness are the downtrodden.The movie starts with the premise that earth is massively over-populated, shows it, then veers immediately into a simplistic poor versus rich theme. At no time is any thought given to the basic issue of overpopulation or what it did to the planet and what could be done about it, it's just somehow the wealthy and powerful's fault.And I don't know how it works in South Africa, but there's a rich history of philanthropy in the U.S. At any rate, the director needs to pull his head out of wherever it's stuck and balance the equation. At least if he wants interesting movies. Matt Damon was very good, as were most of the actors given a chance to be. There was little to no development of the Elysium-side characters so it was hard to care one way or the other about them. In the end that made it difficult to care one way or the other about the movie.",6,1,2,27 November 2013
The Matrix Reloaded," Stylish and interesting in parts, but more often vapid and confused
","The stunts (many are digital) are marvelous and the movie moves along while they're in full play with the exception of one fight sequence that failed to hide it's CG origins adequately. But the plot is ridiculous, the main character seems to have lost the omnipotence he'd gained at the end of the last movie, and there are so many holes in the logic that it became difficult for me to watch after a while. 30 minutes shorter and I'd probably have been able to overlook the shortcomings, but I was often tempted to hit the men's room just to avoid having to sit through another contrived tension-creating device.",5,0,0,1 September 2003
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," My Lord! (of the rings)
","That's the polite version of what I was thinking while I sat through this. The rest of the thought was 'Will it ever end?'.The kicker is, there's some very good acting and it's a classic story with some truly touching moments. But the endless repetitive and exaggerated action scenes, unnecessary subplots, ridiculous added material and alterations to the plot distract mightily from the main. Personally, I'm hoping for a directors that culls all three movies down to the three hours total that's required for the story.Less is more, keep it simple stupid.. Choose the phrase. I don't know if it's bloated because of Jackson, or bean-counters, but rumors indicate the latter and it's a shame. Greed.Martin Freeman is brilliant and could have carried all three films (which should have been two at most) by himself, but wasn't really given the chance. Really frustrating.",6,4,8,11 January 2015
Shrek," Great, but with some tasteless moments for a kids flick
","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, even when the demographic button pushing was blatant. What I don't understand are moments such as a singing bird exploding, which dropped the jaw of the 7-year old girl next to me. They could've toned that one down a bit for the kids. Still, aside from a few snippets of modern Hollywood insensitivity--a very enjoyable movie.",7,0,1,27 July 2002
The Dark Knight Rises," Tooooo Looooong
","This is what you get when you try to get everyone screen time, please every demographic, and try to trump the last movie's special effects--a long convoluted mess. I liked the first two, but not this one. Way too much time spent on Catwoman or Batgirl, or whatever she was, and Robin, who was at least somewhat interesting. Too much time on ancillary this and ancillary that. Batman is a secondary character throughout much of the movie.Bad dialog, bad editing, bad etc. But nothing that cutting an hour from the movie wouldn't fix. This should have been two movies: The Dark Knight Rises and The Dark Knight's Boring Sidekicks. If you think no one would go see the latter, then you understand my complaint about this movie.A real disappointment.",5,3,7,26 November 2012
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Not fun, not entertaining, not worth the electrons it displaces
","I don't even know where to begin with this flick, but I still have a hard time believing I sat through the entire mess. It's overly serious, overwrought, and filled with what passes for 'wisdon' in Hollywood. I kept excusing myself to go out to the lobby just to clear my nostrils.Starting with the Dark Knight, the entire DC universe, which I preferred as a child, has gone to this ridiculously 'dark' and 'adult' place, which I find hard to fathom. They were feakin' comics for goodness sakes. At least the makers of the Marvel films know to keep it on the light side.This movie was not entertaining, not fun, and a complete waste of time. Including the hour it took me to recover from it and the 'worldly cynicism' of every character in it.Garbage. Three stars for the cinematic production folks.",3,4,10,20 May 2016
X2: X-Men United," More intelligent than the average summer movie
","I enjoyed it simply for the fact that it assumes some intelligence on the part of it's audience--unlike most of this summer's action fare. Doesn't preach, doesn't offer simple solutions and has some real honest to goodness adult characters. Fun if a bit dark.",7,0,0,1 September 2003
Midway," Parts are decent, but amateurish and too fantastic
","This hopefully will replace my last review, which was a bit hasty. I still think the movie does the audience a disservice by not portraying the action as it actually happened, and that the characters are more more caricature than real, but there are moments. Over-dramatized moments, but moments where I didn't find it completely unworthy.The air action is fantastical at best, with flights of planes in stupidly close proximity being shot down by Japanese AA fire, which in reality, was not very effective. Most planes were lost to Japanese fighters. I could go on, but realistic it ain't--more Star Wars than Pacific.The backstory is actually very accurate, so kudos there, even if it is relayed in ham-handed fashion. Don't get me started on the ominous, melancholy soundtrack. The acting, given what there was to work with is actually quite good. But there really wasn't much to work with, and the mood is non-stop dark, as it the color treatment. The Pacific at that latitude is generally blue skies and bright sunlight. The color editors know that, don't they?In short, this is yet another movie that relies on CGI rather than good dialog and assumes everyone has the sensibilities of a 13-year old. Actually, that's insulting to 13-year olds.This is a great story that deserved to be told and shown more as it actually happened, but at least it was told. I'll give them that.",6,2,3,14 February 2020
Midway," I really wanted to like this movie, but just can't
","First off, my dad flew SBDs in the Pacific. This is stuff I grew up with. It's tough to know where to start, but the characterizations are as good a place as any. Overblown would be the kindest way to describe them. Borderline disrespectful caricatures using Hollywood's naive idea of what military types are like would be the worst.Then there's the dialog. I know they're trying to set the stage, but having characters flat out spout the historical setup is crude at best. If you know nothing about WWII, it might not bother you. If you do, you'll likely cringe.Then there's the CGI. The actual renderings didn't bother me much, but darkening the entire color palette to stress how somber the subject is an amateurish move. The entire screen play is overwrought as well. Perpetual seriousness. If you've ever been involved with such things, you'll know that there are months of boredom and normalcy, interrupted with a hour of terror here and there.It seems as if the filmmakers wanted to honor the subject, I'll give them that. So an A for effort, but they miss the mark. Badly IMHO.If you want to see a movie about the Pacific, see Tora, Tora, Tora. The stunts are real, and the characterizations far more realistic. I didn't think the previous Midway was all the great, but this one is way off the mark.Dunkirk it ain't.",6,2,5,9 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Wow. Did they really do this? Spoilers
","You know... I guess I should be used to being out of the target demographic, but this movie was just plain rude to anyone who was a fan of the original. I'll get to that at the bottom so as not to put a huge spoiler in plain view. If you've never seen a Star Wars movie, or think the original is quaint and dated... Read another review.Problem one: They copped the plot and much of the script straight from of the original. There's hardly any variation except to delay one detail to the very end. Even the scenes are recognizable and comparable.Problem two: As with The Empire Strike back, this is only half a movie with the sequel set up in the last scene. Problem three: The movie is too long. Many scenes are too long. What is it with action movies these days? I think it's that they want you to have enough time to forget how much you paid to get in.Problem four: The new main characters and actors are of the Portman, Christensen ilk--too young and not mature enough to be truly interesting. The older actors look as if they know their obsolescence has been planned are part of something that lacks the magic of the original, and convey a sense of doom that doesn't come from the plot. Excepted are several character actors and a CG character.Now to the major spoilers...Luke Skywalker is on screen for all of 30 seconds in the very last scene. He doesn't say a word.They freakin' kill Han Solo! Are you kidding me? Even worse, in retrospect, it looks as if Harrison Ford is acting throughout as if he knows he's been written out of part VIII. This one thing absolutely ruined the whole deal for me. If you're a fan of the first movie, it's likely to do the same for you.Yet again there's a death star, only this time it's a base on a planet using the energy of a star. How clever.Why did I give this movie even four stars? Because once or twice, in between dozens of cringes, it made me laugh, and visually it's one of the best films I've ever seen. The last half hour cost it two stars.I'm beginning to think that JJ Abrams is only capable of extremely good-looking, but ultimately unsatisfying movies. He started off decently with Super 8 and Star Trek, but mucked it up with Into Darkness and now this. Maybe Disney put a gun to his head for this.I have two very carefully chosen words for Disney and JJ Abrams for what they did to my memories, but I'd never be able to review another movie here if I wrote them. Instead, I'll just say that they should have waited till all the fans of the original were dead. Enough.",4,24,29,31 March 2016
Deadpool," Guilty pleasure. Not for kids. Really.
","Okay, I wasn't sure to expect from this movie. After all, it is a comic book movie. Excuse me, graphic novel. But I enjoy those if they're well-made. I enjoyed this one. It is funny, and the acting is simply superb.But it's also crude, rude, and largely insensitive--in a good way. This is not a movie for kids, and should've been rated X. X as in you're going to be trying to eXplain stuff for several months afterwards if you make the mistake of letting the children in on it. Ryan Reynolds is a hoot, and everyone else seems to be pretty much having a great time feeding off the energy he brings on. Everything else? Geez, I can't really think of anything I didn't like about this movie except for the slightly guilty feeling I got after wallowing around in the off-kilter humor and gore.Deadpool somehow manages to capture today's urbane, cynical point of view and turn it into something positive. That in an of itself is a neat trick. Just put the kids to bed first. No matter how much they whine.",8,3,9,1 August 2016
