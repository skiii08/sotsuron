Changeling," Changeling
","This is a reasonably solid, well acted, interesting story, with good direction from Clint Eastwood. It just doesn't leave me overly enthusiastic about it. It has the requisite, if occasionally jarring, crowd pleasing moments, touches of Gothic horror, the darkness of the police corruption in the LAPD, a very disturbing and effectively done hanging scene. Yet it never quite goes deep enough in any direction enough to leave a lasting impact. It diffuses what could have been a very powerful compact tight film, by not concentrating on one or even two elements of the story. There are at least four or five different elements in this film that each could have demanded attention in their own right. So what happens is that film loses its focus, not in a fatal way; the film still is good make no mistake. Anjelina Jolie is good as Christine Collins whose son goes missing, and is convinced that the police have not found her son, but instead have landed her with an imposter. She then ends up being in an asylum through some law the police can use to incarcerate people they do not like or find awkward. As the story unfolds it becomes far darker, and it is clear that her son is unlikely to alive, and has almost certainly been murdered. Malkovich is good as the crusading preacher who takes her side against the police particularly Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) the overly done slick police captain. The moments of unintentional humour which soften the film, for example it is made to seem by a particularly clumsy scene that every one in the mental asylum is there because of police corruption. Then there is concession to a modern audience wanting a tough sassy heroine, rather than the probably terrified if still tough Chrisitne Collins. She says to the head psychiatrist ' f**k you and the horse you came upon' She may have said that in reality, but I suspect not, it was probably there as a bit of crowd pleasing. This lessons the reality of what must have been a terrifying ordeal. One scene such as the hanging scene although well done do cause you to wonder why it was there. Was it there so we could enjoy the death of the child killer, which I think in a film less subtle than this would have been understandable, but in a film trying to sophisticated seems awkwardly out of place. I could not help thinking that any chance of Christine Collins finding out the whereabouts of her son was gone forever with the killers death. If this had been the point of the hanging scene, then I think it should have been referred to in the story. There isn't much wrong with this film but some of the scenes to do seem awkward, and the tone of the film occasionally lacks the sensibility of the 20's and 30's in some minor but noticeable ways. None of the acting reaches the exceptional level, Angelina Jolie despite being a tad to glamorous for the role does show she has more range than I would have given her credit for. The film ticks all the good boxes, but none of the great boxes; not by much, but enough to be noticeable.",7,0,2,15 November 2009
Spartacus," An ambitious epic, but rather ponderous, and unsubtle.
","Spartacus is one film I felt compelled to watch. It had been frequently mentioned as a classic, and therefore I was pleased to finally catch up with it this year. I was disappointed with it however, on the surface, it has an interesting story, and interesting characters. The acting is good, if a little over done as might be expected in a Hollywood epic. It starts of well enough, with Kirk Douglas playing Spartacus who is a slave being trained to be a gladiator. The scenes in the gladiator school, are tough, and have a brutal efficiency to them. Then the story begins to escalate and I think struggles to maintain a focused narrative. Spartacus leads a slave revolt, which causes all sorts of plotting in Rome amongst the panicking generals and senators. Lawrence Olivier plays the most ruthless of the antagonists who sets out to destroy Spartacus, and in doing so wants to lay his claim to be the emperor. He is opposed by the machinations of Charles Laughton's higher minded senator. The acting is solid but subdued on the whole. Peter Ustinov as the Roman who runs the gladiator training camp, is doing Peter Ustinov's forte, i.e. doing a clever slyly witty turn. The film is rather worthy and its attempt to see Spartacus as a Christ like figure, is obvious. It amuses rather than jars seeing Hollywood's po-faced interjection of the religious symbolism in the film. Where the film disappoints is surprisingly its cinematography. Kubrick doesn't bring much visual flourish to the film which is unexpected. Only the major battle scene shows Kubrick at his best, with its cold and clinically powerful visuals. The film lacks the drive to sustain three hours though, even with the many sub plots. The film is never dull but it is only sporadically exciting, and you sort of drift along with it. There are some major faults with the film,one is the illogic of Spartacus in allowing himself to be attacked by three Roman armies. He did have the opportunity to attack one roman army at a time at his discretion. Poor generalship on Spartacus's part certainly, but not helpful to the films credibility. The last scene shows Spartacus being crucified, yet he has not a mark on him. Kirk Douglas suffers manfully but the lack of injuries is ridiculous, and really kills the power of the ending. It is a film I am glad to have finally seen, but it left me unmoved. It's a film that tries hard to be an intelligent epic, but it is strangely unconvincing, despite the good overall acting. It is by no means a failure, but somehow it lacks a necessary deep and emotional connection to any of the characters. The scene that does work best is the 'I'm Spartacus scene' it is a classic, yet not enough to make me like this film. I respect the ambition of the film, but once the film was over, I felt underwhelmed. It's one film ticked of my must watch list, but not one I would need to watch again.",5,7,13,9 April 2011
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Disappointing, but still watchable finale to the star wars story.
","I've seen all the star wars movies so I am a fan of the series; although I if I see a bad star wars film, it doesn't outrage me to supernova-sized proportions. I might be temporarily disappointed, bordering on contempt, but then I 'forget' about it, and move on to something else. Therefore, while I care about how good or bad a star wars film is, I have no axe to grind: No requirement to tear it a new one. I try to review it without undue prejudice. I will therefore not be an outraged fan; faux or otherwise. It will not trample on my dreams, even if I admit the phantom menace was shockingly bad. I just have no wish to watch it again - it's a film, after-all. Phantom menace came and went alongside those ill-judged Yoda commercials and the irksome Jar-Jar Banks interjections. I was therefore temporarily disappointed with the above but the world somehow will carry-on.So I can look the 'Rise of skywalker' squarely in the eye and say it was all right. Yep. Okay. It is not the best of the star wars' films, however I think it might be the weakest of the star wars films; outside the phantom menace trilogy. The latter of which all other star wars film should quite rightly be judged, as a warning at least.I saw this film a few days ago and the danger of that is that it does allow you time to think about its flaws; perhaps over-emphasising them. At the time I enjoyed the film, but I admit there was no great fulfilment. No feeling that I had watched an event film- that being a truly fitting finale goodbye to this sequence of the original star wars story. I am now more disappointed in the film, and I wondered why. One of the flaws I noted at the time was the early clunkiness of the scripts. The humour seemed forced, and the use of repetition in gag lines jarring, or Jar jar-jarring perhaps?! If the script had carried on that way, then the film would have had far more serious problems. The script though does tighten up; it is still not brilliant but it does suffice.
The film also threatens its own little jar jar binks moment with a 'cute' robot which has a cone for a head, and may or may not be there for commercial opportunities. Fortunately the robot is only on screen briefly and that petty annoyance is not so much of a problem for me at least.The story itself is a straightforward one: Rey (Daisy Ridley) has to find the Emperor Paladine (Ian McDiarmid) and destroy him, trying to locate palm sized pyramids which are a map to where the last base of the Sith and the emperor is to be found. Wrapped around this story are Rey's emotional battles with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), and at the very end the emperor who has raised a gigantic fleet of star destroyers, each usefully equipped with planet destroying lasers.The major problem with this film I think, is that it really offers nothing new to the star-wars story. The interactions of the Jedi in each other's location have been done before. The surprise appearance of old characters has been done before (Han solo, Luke skywalker and Princess Leia). The planet destroying lasers has also been done before; the only novelty being they are attached to all the star destroyers in a massive star-fleet. There is naturally enough the obligatory destroying of a planet as such. The goodbye to Princess Leia/Carrie Fisher was better done as in the earlier star wars film 'rogue one'. I think because 'Rise of Skywalker' recycled those old star wars tricks, there was really no sense of jeopardyIn contrast to Princess Leia's death, Kylo Ren's death lacked any real emotional punch. This isn't Adam Driver's fault, but probably due to the script forcing an ending that felt trite. You knew that Rey was going to defeat the Emperor. There have been elements of crowd-pleasing as a criticism aimed at the rise of skywalker. I think if the Star Wars writers had been braver then that could have been avoided. Yet because this was the last 'true' Star Wars, they perhaps felt they had to do a farewell tour and not upset anyone. The only real jeopardy in the film comes from when what appears to be Chewbacca's prison transport being blown-up with him on board. Even his 'death' is not allowed to be suspenseful for that long. He appears not long after to be alive and well, with the fact it was not his transporter. It feels like a cheat now, at the time of watching I went with it. If the directors had been brave and killed Chewbacca, yes there would have been Wookie like howls of outrage at this, but it might have skewed the film in a more thoughtful direction. It didn't and what we get is a Star Wars by the numbers, but not with the ingredients that made the previous star wars films in this sequence at least so good.The crowd pleasing elements therefore do feel like a film franchise that has nowhere else to go - in this guise at least. This feels like the right time for this sequence of star wars films to finish as has been reported. The original cast that helped make star-wars great, are getting much older, or have died. The sense of that star wars scale also seems to be diminishing. The half-destroyed death star stranded in the waves was meant to be an epic feature, but it lacked the impact of the crashed star destroyer that Rey used to scavenge from in 'the force awakens'. Again it is problematic because we have seen the tricks before. The CGI doesn't work all that convincingly in some cases; the Starfleet doesn't have the feel of a real star fleet. There are moments of absurdity as well. The riding of camel like creatures across a star destroyer by the rebel combatants was well ludicrous, and distanced you from the film. If the destroyer on the other hand, was on the ground for repair or as a result of damage then maybe they could get away with it. Here it doesn't work.I didn't always mind the cute creatures that worked their way into some scenes. The original star wars has always had 'cute' comic moments. The little robots on the original death star that Chewie scares into running of by roaring at them is still funny. I liked the birds looking on bemused as Skywalker raises the X-wing in this film. That by the way is another moment that should be exciting, but doesn't quite have the impact I wanted it to have, because it was better done in the empire strikes back.There are plenty of negatives in this film, but there are also positives. It certainly doesn't drag for one. The action sequences are well done. The light sabres fights do deliver if perhaps they go on too long. The acting is on the whole fine if unremarkable. Richard E Grant hams it up a bit, but I think that maybe is shown up in away by the cast who are maybe a bit subdued overall. Ian Mcdiarmid also does his best with a role in which he can only be over-the-top villain in. He also has an atypical Mordor like hall surrounded by giant statues of various Sith Lord worthies. It seems a little harsh to be criticising a series in which the director JJ Abrahams has played a significant part in revitalising. Star Wars has also moved with the times; by having Rey at the centre of proceedings, it has given the star wars a credible female hero other than Princess Leia. It was also nice to see Lando Calrissian back in business for some much needed if limited diversity in a film series which still has a predominantly 'white' feel to it. This film therefore has its faults, and lacks those moments that truly excite you, but it still felt like good enough (just) company all the same.",7,2,13,28 May 2020
The Duchess," Slightly better than average period drama based on a true story.
","I was tempted to pass on 'the Duchess', as it sounded like a hum-drum period drama piece which looked pretty but had no real edge. I did hear however that it might be better than I originally thought, and so decided to watch it. While this film is not a great one, I would say it is a good one. The main advantage this film has is that it is based on true events, and that does gives the film some dramatic urgency, something that it occasionally comes close to losing.The story had it been made up would have seemed too contrived and in a way too clichéd in its depiction of the events in this film. The truth (with artistic license, naturally) revealed by this film is a thorough if a sometimes uninvolving examination of the gender politics of that time (18th century England). It is also by remote implication a study of the systems that reinforce both the suppression and repression often involved in those politics.The plot involves Keira Knightley playing Spencer who is married to the Duke of Devonshire played by Ralph Fiennes, emphasising her 'inability' to quickly bear him a male heir; a state of affairs which is further complicated by the Duke having an affair with her best friend Bess Foster (Hayley Atwell). In a somewhat awkward turn of events Bess then moves in with Georgiana and the duke, in which the initial hostility between Georgiana and Bess gradually becomes an important friendship again. This in part is due to the rape of Georgiana by the duke, which is mainly heard of screen in a harrowing sequence. To make this cocktail of intertwining relations even more unstable, is Georgiana's 'scandalous' affair with aspiring politician Charles Grey played by Dominic Cooper.The story despite its complexity is well told, and the predicament of all the characters is nicely illustrated, each one of whom is trapped by the systems of class and codes that imprison them. There is the duke's desperation at not having a male heir in a society which demands it. Georgiana herself being married to the repressed and rake of a duke, who also represses her in turn. Bess Foster is someone torn between friendship to Georgiana and her love of the duke, and finally there is Charles Grey being unable to free Georgiana from the duke, who uses Georgiana's children as emotional blackmail to stop her seeing Charles Grey. Then there is the final sting in the tale; Georgiana has Charles Grey's baby (Eliza) which she has to give up ,and is finally brought up in secret by Charles Grey's family.The acting is good, although Keira Knightley's performance is not much more than what you might expect of a standard period drama piece. She doesn't do much more than is required, ie look attractive in nice voluminous dresses, and be impressed by the duke's palatial houses. This maybe seems harsh, but in a way that is all Keira Knightley is required to do in this film, and she does that perfectly capably. The film itself doesn't really demand much more of her in this role. The result is perhaps you don't always feel for her plight as keenly as you might.On the otherhand Ralph Fiennes gives you the feeling this is a duke who is usually repressing his feelings, and not given to emotional enthusiasm, other than to his dogs. The times when Ralph Fiennes does break through the strictures of his rigid comportment are done to impressive effect. The rape scene were the hidden hostility and aggression suddenly surface in his character is shocking. Yet Fiennes still conjures enough sympathy for you to not forgive the rape but understand it in part comes from a system that places unremitting pressure on both men and women.Hayley Atwell also gives an excellent performance; she seems to portray a natural warmth, that always makes her an interesting screen presence. It is also a convincing one. You can understand how her torn friendship to Georgiana is caused by Bess's love of her own children, which the duke has used his influence to gain custody for her, from her abusive husband. This act makes Bess's affair with the duke more understandable in her initial betrayal of Georgiana.Dominic Cooper is all right as Charles Grey, although perhaps a little ill-suited for the role. There doesn't seem to be the charisma that would attract Georgiana, but the political scenes are were Cooper is at his best, and as well as that Charles Fox played by Simon McBurney. McBurney is superb in that role, referential and respectful of Georgiana, and the impression of being a canny political operator as well. I did enjoy the dalliance with politics as seen from the Whig perspective in this film; they came across as slightly more radical that the Tories, and it explains why Georgiana's character would be attracted to them.The film is probably a little too polished and fitfully shallow to be more than an interesting and slightly better than average period piece. There is bite there, but maybe lacks the overall menace of Lady Macbeth, which is not dissimilar in terms of subject. In being a true story it is an important one as well. This comes at a time just before the upper class echelons are being threatened by demands for voting reform, and women are still seen openly as property to produce heirs. It appears to be a far different time and age, and yet the themes of misogyny, rape and abuse in marriage are still relevant. I think this is a good film, and yet maybe slips of the target, rather than skewering it. Yet the final captions for the characters are poignant, sad, and not unhopeful as well. The film therefore made me care about these characters and their fates, which helps temper the reservations I have about the film. I enjoyed the film without being in thrall to it: it is good but I can't say it is a classic of the genre.",7,0,0,17 June 2020
No Country for Old Men," Brilliant for most part, but ending is weak and diminishes the film overall.
","The Coen brothers can be brilliant or terrible; this film belongs fortunately to the Fargo side of their movie making. The plot is crisp, violent, snappy, and intensely dark, yet the pacing gives everything an exuberance that belies the overall material. This is a film about evil for the sake of evil. The acting is excellent, the beaten down cop on the case (Tommy Lee Jones), the very very bad guy (Bardem) the waster (Josh Brolin) who finds the drugs money, and his girlfriend(Kelly Macdonald) who will become a more significant character towards the end of the movie. The final scene is bitterly disappointing though, the film just drifts way. The novel I believe has this ending, but oh boy it doesn't work here. It is a shame, because it robs the film of greatness. I think the key scene in this movie is were the girlfriend comes face to face with remorseless evil(Javier Bardem). She realises she has been betrayed, and this gives the movie an understated but powerful emotion punch. Shame about the films ending though because it softens the harsh bleakness of the movies overall message. You will long remember Bardems performance, but the movie has more to offer than that though, but it needed a more dramatic, and better thought out ending to make the films other qualities more apparent.",7,1,3,25 January 2009
Midsommar," If you like your gory paganism delivered at a stately pace, then this might be your film.
","It maybe a bit unfair to define this film as gory paganism as described in the header. It is however hard to ignore those few but important moments of gore, because they are genuinely gory moments, and yet it doesn't destablise the film. The gore comes at the just the right moments and brings with it a necessary menace. This film might have been a long 2 hours and 20 minutes otherwise. .Ari Aster's direction is skillful,but a little distancing at time. He does get away with it, because the acting is often excellent. Florence Pugh plays a damaged woman, whose tragic loss of her family, forces her to be both fascinated and horrified by the unfolding pagan ceremonies in a remote Swedish village. Her portayal of Dani is complex, and demanding. She reacts subtly to the horror, even though you know exactly how she is feeling. It is difficult acting,but exactly in keeping with the films overall mood.Jack Reynor's performance as her boyfriend is very good as well. He had wanted to break-up with her but her tragic circumstances forced him to invite her to a midsommar festival. He hopes that she won't go therefore leaving it to be a jolly with him and three of his male friends..Will Poulter is good as the ass-hole character who is one of those friends, and you kind of know and hope that he's going to get his. .William Jackson Harper is another friend,and he is possibly outside the two leads the most interesting character. Obstensibly someone who has integrity, but who takes risks he knows he shouldn't. It doesn't end well.This is more of a pyschological horror film, although the gore does pervade your thoughts during the film. The film is beautifully shot, and yet I found it slightly disappointing. I'm not quite sure why. Maybe a tighter film would have been a better one. I know Aster has said this film is a break-up in pyscho-drama form. I do get that point in retrospect. There are also allusions as has been pointed out by critics to the wicker-man. I'm not a great fan of that film, which might annoy some people, yet strangely I think I preferred the Wickerman.I accept Midsommar is a good film, which is why I rate it seven, and yet I'm not sure it went any where really new. Perhaps it tried to too much, and slightly missed the right emphasis on both the pagan horror,and the modern pyschological take on Dani's emotional struggles.I don't need to see this film again,which means something is missing from it. I don't quite know what it is which puzzles me. Maybe the minor characters are not detailed enough to keep your attention in the many quiet moments. A good film, but not for me an enthralling one.",7,2,8,29 March 2020
