The Blair Witch Project," a bombastically fun look at the unknown and retro horror film
","THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT caters to myths and legends stemming from the 1700's and 1800's and things that go bump in the night. The film also touches onn 1970's myths about william peter blatty sect demonism 9 not the writer) and a possible entitiy or cult in the woods three people are investigating before they end up missing. A film that was retro 1930's and had a minimum or gore, this film was a student film which fared better story wise and plot wise than the sequel which at times had things in it that looked like they were out of a 1970's outerfringe film. The sequel was released but no one can argue the first one was original and so was it's hype machine. This student production had great acting and a sense of class that is not seen often in theatrical relese movies. A inventive film that was fun to watch and very creative. Low budget and smarts can eran you alot. This film did that for the producers who showed it at sundance and possibly telluride festivals. Not since the old UNIVERSAL ERA of horror films (the black and white days) has a movie made scares fun. Few gory scenes. A film that achieves scares by the concept of the unknown and bargain basement tactics like a old radio show...all of which work.",Null,0,1,25 August 2001
Saturday Night Fever," the movie ken starr and buddy richard jewell never saw
","I'm almost on vapors here..like vespers. SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER was a meshing of religious overtones and secularism for a commentary on a generation and a clash between the religious world (briefly) and the secular world. The film tells the tale of lost souls at the disco as seen through the eyes of father frank and the higfh flying antics of a popular disco celebrity played by TRAVOLTA. The film is high art and pop culture rolled into one. The film captures the spirit of the disco era and set a new standard in soundtracks and soundtrack marketing. (along with STAR WARS and GREASE) The movie has a moral to it about life and the cruelty of it and trying to get by yet the clash between father frank and his walking away from the clergy was a great subplot I loved. That subplot gave the film believability and substance. The family setting for the character played by travolta was also believable. It was almost like a real family. The plus points:plot, music and acting. A film about nobodys who are trying to be somebody having been a nobody all my life I have nothing to hide. One of travoltas best movies. I liked him as a villian in BROKEN ARROW.",Null,0,0,19 August 2001
The Bodyguard," the cult of celebrity and those who protect others
",This film has a romance angle as KEVIN COSTNER falls from a woman he must protect from a bad guy.I am not drawn to celebrity. Not in the least.In fact if it ever came my way i would kiss it off (granted it never will..sort of like me owning the buffalo bills). This film is a fantasy action adventure romance in which Costner plays the nice guy action heavy against all the bad guys in a story about a guy who operates in the world of the cult of personality. Personality and being seen witht he rich and famous are things I have never craved in this film Costner plays a PI/bodyguard who has to keep it in perspective and do his job. The bright lights and spotlight can be distracting to some yet his character is a professional who is not distracted. A interesting concept.,Null,1,5,25 August 2001
