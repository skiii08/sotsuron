Raiders of the Lost Ark," One of my top ten...
","I'll never forget the first time I saw this movie.  I was six years old and playing behind the couch in my living room.  I couldn't see the television from where I was at but I could hear it.  Well, my parents were watching Raiders of the Lost Ark.  I was sitting back there playing and I heard the music swell as Indy swung from the vine into the river in the amazon.  So I looked over the back of the couch and was hooked.  I slowly made my way around the couch, never letting my eyes leave the screen and sat and watched the rest of the film. I tell you...it's the music.  The story is great but its accompanied by the absolute best 'hero' theme song ever, bar none. That music makes this movie for me.  I dread the day when Lucas and ILM decide to make a 'special edition' version of this film with top notch digital effects.  Its perfect as it is.",10,0,0,22 September 2002
