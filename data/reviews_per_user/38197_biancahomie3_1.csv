Resident Evil: Afterlife," I've been a fan of the games and movies since I was a kid
","The first thing I would like to say is that I played the games when I was a kid and I saw the movie after playing the first and second resident evil games.The movie starts out with a huge action fight scene taking place after the end of extinction. The beginning already draws you into a great start. Mila and ali (Alice and Claire) make a great team and you can tell that they get along great. The movie does lack a little bit in the plot area but that's kinda the point the story is exactly what your seeing it's supposed to be like a video game so the plot is thin so you can focus more on what's happening. another complaint is that Chris didn't seem like Chris he was awesome but he could have been anybody though he was cool wentworth did a great job. The end fight scene with wesker was awesome taken from the fifth game replacing sheva with clair. The action was awesome wesker was really cool and he didn't come off to me like matrix rip off especially since he was really cool and the guy from the matrix agent smith or whatever his name was isn't cool. The movies are very enjoyable personal favorites and they just get better with each installment though the 3rd was cool but my least favorite. The actors were great the special effect awesome in 3D it's 10 times better but seeing it just on my TV is still awesome. One thing that I would like to point out is that if your watching it with expectations that's it's realistic then you kinda an idiot because zombie outbreaks won't happen and movies aren't supposed to be realistic otherwise they would be boring like life also what more of a plot should there have been that seems to be a common complaint but no one ever says what they wanted to see they just hate because it's the cool thing. You know why the characters are there because there trying to fix things and survive a zombie apocalypse starting with bringing down umbrella and finding survivors it's pretty straight forward. The first resident evil stars with being thrown into a situation you don't really understand and having to survive until at the end you find out what happened the plot of the movie is is just surviving. The second one apocalypse is about the whole city getting infected and having to survive through it and get out before it gets cleansed, It also throws you into the middle of the second and third resident evil games introducing characters and storyline from them. The second one also begins the umbrella storyline. The third extinction takes you through the whole world being infected and leaves you to watch as they try to survive though this one doesn't really have any plot. The fourth afterlife brings you to trying to take back the world starting with destroying umbrella and uniting survivors. HOPEFULLY THE NEXT ONE WILL HAVE LOTS OF JILL VALENTINE.",10,1,5,19 January 2011
