The Avengers," The Movie Fans have been waiting for!
","This is by far my favorite film of all time! I'm a big Comic Book Geek and when I watch this film I felt as if I was reading an amalgamation of the Ultimates and the early 616 Avengers. the cast is excellent, the story is simple but affective. the easter eggs are brilliant and the action is AMAZING!!! It's fun, but not in a stupid way like Michael Bay's Transformers. This is a film that MUST be seen by any person who's a fan of comics, or cartoons, or just wants to watch a fun movie without turning off their brain. Everyone does an amazing job, especially Mark Ruffalo, who I prefer over Edward Norton, and Eric Bana. So if you haven't seen it then GET OFF YOU'RE CHAIR AND SEE IT!!!",10,1,4,9 March 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man," Does for Spider man, what Batman Begins did for Batman
","I LOVE SPIDER MAN! he's one of my top favorite superheroes. and this movie did him justice! even more so than the Rami films in some cases. Andrew Garfield is as perfect for Spider man as RDJ was for Iron man, and Christopher Reeve was for Super man, he is far superior to Tobey Maguire, who felt more like a guy playing spider man, while Andrew feels like he IS Spider man, he's funny, he's smart, and he's git the right build. I know a lot of people hate on this film, simply because it's a reboot. but then again a lot of people did the same for Batman Begins. Although it is VEEERRY obvious that a lot of scenes were cut out. and Peter does do some questionable things, but Garfield is so likable that you forgive him for it. Martin Sheen, Emma Stone, Rhys Ifans, Dennis Leary, and Sally Field all do a great job as well. The score is very inspiring, and there's also some cool action scenes that feel like they were lifted right from Ditko and Bendis Spider man comics. Stone and Garfield also have great chemistry together!! much better than some romance films we've getting *cough* Twighlight *cough*. The only major gripe I have is the final line. it really makes Peter look kinda like a douche, but in a way I know it was done to set up something very important in the sequel....",8,1,3,9 March 2014
