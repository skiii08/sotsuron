It," Some good points but ultimately disappointing
","I was full of excitement sitting down in the theatre, my cinema trips are rare these days, and as a fan of the book and a member of the generation terrified by Tim Curry's Pennywise in 1990 I SO MUCH wanted this to be good. The opening scene is very strong. Georgie is out playing on a flooded rain-swept street, then his paper boat is swept into a storm drain. peering down the drain, the face of a clown appears, who introduces himself as PennyWise, the dancing clown. The clown jokes and joshes with Georgie, talking about circuses, and popcorn, they giggle together, then suddenly, the clown falls silent, his face goes slack, and he just stares..... It was a truly chilling moment, and I was thinking 'Yes! They've nailed it, this is going to be great' Opening titles roll, and we get introduced to the other kids in the next few scenes. I was pleased to see that all the kids in the losers club, with the exception of Mike, were very capable actors with real screen presence. Bev, and Eddie have real star quality, Henry Bowers is suitably hate-able. So far so good! And then, and then.....something went wrong, and the slow deflation and disappointment began to set in. I can't say this film was bad, it wasn't bad, but there was simply nothing new here for me that I hadn't seen in fifty other horror movies, Pennywise just became another bouncy vibrating CGI monster, with no more menace or substance than a video game character. In the first few encounters with the kids and IT, you quickly realise that we're back to very familiar ground, a series of suspenseful build ups to noisy jump scares which get just a little bit less effective every time. All this leads up to a final encounter which, although interesting, was unsatisfying, and most definitely not scary. As other reviewers on here have pointed out, this is a perfectly decent movie for young viewers who have not had the chance to become desensitized to the well worn tropes of the genre. Sadly, despite that early promise, there's nothing special, new or innovative going on here. Such a shame.",6,2,6,17 September 2017
Frozen," Number 1 at U.K box office for weeks and weeks. WHY?
","Admittedly I'm not exactly the target audience for this movie but I'm utterly mystified as to why Frozen is such a big hit. The plot is dire, full of clich√©s, boring and predictable. Apart from the ice palace scene, which was admittedly pretty cool, the animation is unremarkable. The endless songs are uninspired and grating. It's just so obnoxiously Disney, everything about it, the gurning animals, the sickly sentimentality, the songs, everything. For some reason the writers have gone back in time to the stuff they were putting out in the 80's and early 90s. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed films like Beauty and The Beast, Hercules, Lion King, Aladdin and so on, but that was over two decades ago. Besides, nobody else was putting out big budget animated movies anyway and we didn't have anything to compare them to. There is absolutely nothing original or groundbreaking about this movie. In an era of films like UP, Wall-E, Toy Story, this kind of output is baffling to me. Remember when Shrek came out and brilliantly mocked the fairytale, twee, sickly sentiment of Disney? It's like things have come full circle. And people seem to absolutely love it! It's very puzzling to me, what am I missing?",2,27,53,21 April 2014
