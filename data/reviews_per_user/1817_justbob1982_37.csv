Sucker Punch," Incredible visuals spoilt by an insidiously creepy plot
","Version I watched: UK bluray releaseActors: 6/10Plot/script: 5/10Photography/visual style: 8/10Music/score: 6/10Overall: 6/10Nominally Zack Snyder's first (and to date only) original project, Sucker Punch is actually nothing of the sort, wearing its influences openly and proudly. The film features a series of lovingly crafted fantasy sequences set in worlds inspired by Lord of the Rings, the Matrix, steampunk culture and Japanese manga.The framing device for these sequences, however, is a problem. A young girl, nicknamed Babydoll (Emily Browning) is wrongfully imprisoned at an asylum that turns out to be a brothel that exploits her and other girls who are similarly fraudulently incarcerated. Her escape plan involves performing (implied) erotic dances that captivate and distract all onlookers for several minutes while a group of her fellow captives collect the plot tokens they need. While dancing, Babydoll distracts herself from her own shame and degradation by escaping into the fantasy worlds described above, transposing her aims as 'missions', mostly of an aggressive kind, performed by her 'team' of fellow captives, now transformed into badass warriors clad in costumes with classically fetishistic connotations: schoolgirls, sailors and soldiers of the past and future.No matter how I look at this, it's not good. The most charitable interpretation is that Snyder is trying to 'sucker punch' us by luring us into escapism and then hitting us all the harder with the harsh reality; a form of social commentary. However, my conscience refused to let me be lured away, and indeed I rather resent the implication that I can be distracted so easily. The grimness of the 'real world' soured the fantasy for me.A worse interpretation is that Snyder didn't care, that he thought it was okay for Babydoll to be treated like meat, because she has somewhere cool to escape to. Or at least, that it doesn't matter because it's all just cool stuff passing in front of our eyes for a couple of hours, so it might as well be REALLY cool stuff.It's such a shame, because the fantasy sequences are simply stunning, and I am sure I would have greatly enjoyed the whole if they had found a framing device that wasn't so damn creepy...",6,0,2,30 September 2014
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Heart-warming high-school drama with a sting in the tail
","Version I saw: In-flight movie (KLM)Actors: 7/10Plot/script: 7/10Photography/visual style: 6/10Music/score: 6/10Overall: 7/10All three stars of this movie - Logan Lerman, Emma Watson and Ezra Miller - had baggage going into this film in terms of well-known roles in previous films. It is to their credit that they made me forget Percy Jackson, Harry Potter and We Need To Talk About Kevin. This is a well-judged high-school story that tackles a couple of sensitive issues with a good balance of cool distance and mawkishness, insight and introversion, witty dialogue and realistic awkwardness. Stephen Chbosky's direction (from his own book of the same name) is certainly not ostentatious, and this is probably wise. Too much camera tomfoolery would probably distract attention from what is really quite a personal, everyday drama.

The Notebook," Don't call it a 'chick flick'
","Version I saw: UK DVD releaseActors: 6/10Plot/script: 5/10Photography/visual style: 6/10Music/score: 7/10Overall: 6/10I don't believe in 'chick flicks'. I find the term incredibly patronising to women. I believe that a good movie can appeal to anyone, and a bad film should not be just excused.On the face of it, though, The Notebook is exactly the kind of film to which people might apply the label. It's a period romance, based on a book by the formulaic author Nicholas Sparks. Ryan Gosling is the main character Noah, a laconic salt-of-the-earth manual labourer type, and Rachel McAdams is the girl from the upper classes of the American south, with whom he falls in love. The story, set in the 1930s and 40s, also has a framing device in the modern day, featuring the two of them as pensioners in a retirement home, played by Gena Rowlands and James Garner.The performances are all decent or better, although McAdams was a tad too smiley for me, slightly undermining the worst of her misfortunes. In particular, Gosling is very good at the strong but silent character, internalizing his emotions so he seems dumb to the other characters, while still making his feelings clear to the audience.The whole is far from perfect - the filming is capable but largely mediocre, the portrayal of dementia is fundamentally different to that experienced by real elderly people, and when it comes down to it, it is all so clichéd that it ends up totally predictable, sapping some of the drama - but one must be wary of being over-critical. Despite what I said above, I found myself looking for reasons not to like The Notebook, because it felt like the kind of film I should not like, as a bloke.There is actually a fair amount to like. As I said, the acting is all solid, McAdams and Gosling make a nice couple I can root for, and the clichés are at least arranged and assembled in a seamless way with good narrative flow. There are even a couple of really nice photographic touches: the opening sequence has lovely art direction, and there are some World War II scenes that are handsomely mounted. The setting also provides a welcome opportunity for some great swing jazz.The fact is that I enjoyed it, in an unchallenging, easy-watching kind of way. What's wrong with that?",6,1,4,19 September 2015
The Babadook," Very good chiller about confronting your demons
","Version I saw: UK cinema releaseActors: 7/10Plot/script: 7/10Photography/visual style: 7/10Music/score: 7/10Overall: 7/10There was a great deal of hype in horror circles surrounding the release of The Babadook. It was called 'revolutionary', a 'masterpiece', and all despite the title bizarrely invoking cheesy 80s novelty party song 'Agadoo' in my mind. Australia is not without any track record of horror films, but nothing of this kind.In terms of type, The Babadook blends gore, jump-scares, creepy chills and oppressive psychological horror, and this is the first impressive aspect. Writer/director Jennifer Kent clearly has a command of all the different tools of the genre. There is great work in music, sound and especially make-up too.Crucially though, it is all in service of the story and the ideas being explored. SOME SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ONWARD. Like many such films, The Babadook has a central mystery about whether the terrors stalking the main characters are real or imagined, and ultimately, it doesn't matter. The 'monster' is a metaphor for the demons of depression and anxiety that stalk main character Amelia (Essie Davis), and the danger of her repression of her issues. The message is one that I have seen very rarely elsewhere: the characters win by confronting her demons, acknowledging them, and not defeating them, but instead learning to live with them. That is what impressed me most of all about the film.It's not revolutionary though. I don't think it's a masterpiece either. The kid is not a very good actor, for a start. Besides, there are lots of very good horror films, of which this is only one, and singling it out denies all of them. Watch The Babadook, but watch those films too.",7,3,5,3 March 2017
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," The best 70s political thriller that could have been made as a comic book action film
","Version I saw: UK cinema release (2D)Actors: 7/10Plot/script: 7/10Photography/visual style: 6/10Music/score: 6/10Overall: 7/10The Winter Soldier is the second film starring Chris Evans as Captain America. The first was set almost entirely in the 1940s, and documented his origins. It was a black-and-white good vs. evil story of the kind that is very dated by today's standards... which is exactly what it needed to be, to set up the character that is Cap, the 'Man Out of Time', whose obsolete, simplistic value system often comes into conflict with the complexities of the modern world.In this film, The Winter Soldier, we see him some time into his new life in the present day, long past the initial disorientation which has been done many times elsewhere and didn't need to be seen again. However, he still has some adjusting to do, as a major institution on which he depends - the covert military operation S.H.I.E.L.D. - turns out to have corruption in it. This was the stock in trade of a number of conspiracy thrillers during the 60s and 70s, during which the world learned to distrust. It's a lesson Cap has to learn at an accelerated pace, in an emulation of those films like 'All the President's Men'.To this end, the choice of Robert Redford as the calculating villain at the centre of the conspiracy is a knowingly ironic one. Redford starred in AtPM, as well as other thrillers of the type. In fact, over the 40 years of his film career, he has generally been one of Hollywood's most prominent liberal spokesmen, as well as one of its biggest stars.On Cap's side are two characters who have served to weave together the Marvel film-verse, even though neither has ever had as prominent a role as they do on this occasion. Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) is a counterpoint to Captain America: a hero who has learned the bitter lesson of suspicion, and perhaps been blinded by it. Meanwhile, Scarlett Johansson is the de facto co-star (and love interest?) as Black Widow, who goes on the run with Cap. She gets some real emotional scenes and carries them off in a way I would barely have believed if I had not seen 'Her', in which she gives a performance of unprecedented subtlety, showing me for the first time that she really can act.What the film does well, it does *very* well. The action scenes are exciting, with some cool touches in the fight choreography, and the political allegory, if a bit unsubtle, is forcefully put and well illustrated. If I have any criticisms, they are as follows:1. The Winter Soldier character himself was pretty peripheral to the overall plot, and his story was never very well explained. I was left feeling like there was a lot more to tell, but surely this, being the movie with him in the title, was the one in which that should have been told.2. Toby Jones' character, Dr. Arnim Zola, giving what amounts to a massive plot info-dump. Having to explain so much of the story in one expository lump is a sign of lazy writing. His explanation for doing so is not very good either.The modern comic book action and the tense, morally ambivalent political games don't quite sit comfortably alongside each other but, if you were going to put them together, this film is probably the best result you could hope for.",7,0,1,8 October 2014
Life of Pi," Ang Lee deftly brings to life an 'unfilmable' novel
","Version I saw: UK cinema release (3D)Actors: 7/10Plot/script: 8/10Photography/visual style: 9/10Music/score: 7/10Overall: 7/10Life of Pi is one of the very few films to genuinely justify the use of 3D, which is why I am reviewing the threed release. Using the very latest in CGI technology, Ang Lee tells the fantastic (in every sense of the word) story of a young boy marooned in a lifeboat for weeks with a live, adult Bengal tiger.There is one word that I have come to associate with Ang Lee's work as a director over the years: 'deft'. He knows how to handle emotional drama as well as computer technology in the service of a film. This movie is no exception, especially as he is assisted by an excellent performance from Suraj Sharma, who is required by the nature of the plot to carry most of the movie, as well as able support from Irrfan Khan and Rafe Spall.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/life-of-pi-2012.html",7,0,1,17 January 2014
Interstellar," Hard science and human drama, married with the help of cutting-edge VFX
","Version I saw: UK IMAX releaseActors: 7/10Plot/script: 6/10Photography/visual style: 8/10Music/score: 7/10Overall: 7/10Christopher Nolan is one of the most trusted directors in the film industry, with a flawless record of large box-office profits. As a result, when he asks for $160 million to make an epic sci-fi original project, studio execs set aside their usual reservations and stump up the cash without question.Interstellar is visually spectacular, with digital imaging grounded in the hard physics equations of scientific consultant Kip Thorne. However, it also marries this with human drama by exploring the personal impact of the phenomena discussed. As a result, we get dramatic close-up scenes of both star Matthew McConaughey and major support Anne Hathaway, highlighting their considerable acting talents.Admittedly, it isn't Nolan's best, as high a bar as that is. Interstellar starts too slowly, and the climax is just preposterous, arguably throwing away all the scientific credibility it had earned up to that point. It is suitably poetic though, with the right emotional impact (supported by Hans Zimmer's excellent church organ score), and as I say, visually breathtaking.I am grateful to Nolan for using his industry cred for pushing through work like this, of a type we don't see much any more.",7,0,2,12 March 2017

Russell's run of success is looking more and more like a consistently good track record. Including Three Kings in the run, I Heart Huckabees comes to seem like less of a misfire and more of an interesting experimental piece.American Hustle takes two of today's biggest stars from each of Russell's last two films: Christian Bale and Amy Adams from The Fighter and Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence from SLP.

Nightcrawler," Compelling portrait of a vile character
","Version I saw: UK cinema releaseActors: 7/10Plot/script: 7/10Photography/visual style: 7/10Music/score: 6/10Overall: 7/10I don't think there has been another cinema character in recent years as repugnant as Louis Bloom, as played by Jake Gyllenhaal. His brilliant acting, the screenplay, even the sickly, naturalistic lighting and score, seem tailor-made to vividly illustrate a complete wrong 'un.He is at the centre of a fairly nuanced story of news media corruption. The message appears not to be about the evil media corrupting a man, or a man corrupting the innocent media, but perhaps the media set-up being dangerously receptive to any monstrous practitioners who might turn up.There is a great deal to appreciate here, with good work in all areas, but I have to say, I came away feeling somewhat soiled, and can't say I 'enjoyed' the film.",7,0,0,6 April 2017
Cross of Iron," Mainly straight adventure, with a slight anti-war theme
","Version I saw: UK bluray releaseActors: 6/10Plot/script: 6/10Photography/visual style: 6/10Music/score: 7/10Overall: 6/10Sam Peckinpah was one of the most respected directors was one of the most respected American directors of his generation. He specialized in westerns such as The Wild Bunch (especially), and more generally went for adventure stories with a shade more subtlety than straight-up boys'-own swashbucklers.Late on in his career, he took on an interesting task in Cross of Iron: a Second World War film told from the perspective of the German soldiers. In any such film, there are a couple of elephants in the room: Nazism and defeat. While Nazism can be covered, and indeed has been covered in the past, from other perspectives such as the Allied soldiers, or German civilians, this point of view has the unique colouring that we know they are destined to lose. If any happy ending is to happen for the main characters (and it may well not), it will be contrasted with the fate of their fellow soldiers.In Cross of Iron, this is partly dealt with by isolating Sgt Steiner (James Coburn) and his squad behind enemy lines, and forcing them to make a daring trek through enemy territory. This cuts them off from the main pressures of the background, and allows the writers to bring them in on a controlled basis.The main conflict, apart from against the Soviet army, is between Steiner and Capt. Stransky (Maximilian Schell), a political commissar of sorts who, while he claims not to be a Nazi party member, enforces their ideology over Steiner's seemingly more noble, practical approach. The main underlying thrust of the film is an anti-war message, that those at the top do not understand the brutality of the front line, and so resort to armed conflict entirely too frivolously.When it comes down to it, though, the film is mainly a straight adventure, with very limited subtlety. The 'subtext' is even transformed into a supertext when it is spoken directly by Steiner: 'I hate officers.' It seems that, by his third-to-last film, Peckinpah had perfected his formula, enabling him to produce a strong, exciting adventure film with a bit of depth, without straying far from his comfort zone. However, he had also become somewhat set in his ways. There is a great deal of narrative and thematic potential in the central idea, I think, but Peckinpah had lost some of the flexibility to explore it.",6,1,2,13 October 2015
The Lego Movie," Lord & Miller pull out another surprise hit
","Version I saw: UK cinema release (2D)Actors: 6/10Plot/script: 8/10Photography/visual style: 8/10Music/score: 6/10Overall: 7/10While it didn't quite live up to the astonishing word-of-mouth support it got, The Lego Movie is a rip-roaring success. This is especially remarkable when you consider what it is. Whoever heard of a movie based on a toy (that has no actual story associated with it) being good?Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller have previous on this, though. Their first movie was Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, which is as goofy a title as I can remember, and no more than a one-gag set-up to boot... and yet they imbued it with a surreal humour that attracted audiences. Then they revived 80s TV series 21 Jump Street, and the record for that kind of adaptation is very patchy at best, but they pulled that round too.Lord and Miller seem to have their finger on the pulse of the zeitgeist. Supported by a genius idea for an underlying theme, The Lego Movie looks stunning too. The graphics are impressively composed entirely from Lego blocks genuinely available to the public, assembled into whole scenes and settings. The animators took the opportunity to throw in a million blink-and-miss-it sight gags, in a remarkable show of attention detail.I have to say that, in contradiction to other views I have heard, I found the song 'Everything is Awesome' by Tegan and Sara, which is a prominent part of the film, to be annoying but catchy rather than actually good, although that is still a credit to T&S because that is the role of the song in the film. It is improved by the comedic rapping of The Lonely Island in the full extended version, heard over the end credits.A host of star names, both playing their most famous characters and playing other characters of note, enliven the proceedings. This is appropriate, given that the Lego franchise's recent revival has been built on adapting iconic series such as Star Wars, Harry Potter and Batman into games using the Lego block style.A sequel seems inevitable, and I hope it is still this good, now that they have the weight of expectation on them.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk",7,0,1,10 August 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Ensemble super-cast hits the high notes
","Version I saw: UK cinema releaseActors: 7/10Plot/script: 6/10Photography/visual style: 7/10Music/score: 6/10Overall: 7/10The X-Men are possibly the ultimate ensemble cast. The central half-dozen have been joined over the years by well over a hundred named characters, each with their own personalities and powers. All the more surprising then that for X-Men: Days of Future Past, they chose a plot that meant doubling up on several characters, bringing together two whole all-star casts into what amounts to an absolute galaxy of stars.Of course, sacrifices must be made to some degree, so the old cast - Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry and so on - take something of a back seat as the new group brought in for X-Men: First Class predominate in the drama. This is fine, because Jennifer Lawrence, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are all excellent at their craft, and indeed all the best parts of this film come not from spectacle but sizzling character interactions.My sister pointed out that the role of Mystique (Lawrence) in the plot doesn't quite make sense given the existence of Darwin, a character who got inconveniently killed off in First Class. Being honest though, Jennifer Lawrence can now be relied on to carry the focus of a film in a way Edi Gathegi simply can't. Or at least, not yet. There's a slight problem with Professor X too, as Patrick Stewart and James McAvoy's versions of the character - both interesting and engaging in themselves - seem just a little too different to be accounted for by the development and aging of one person.The plot is outright bonkers, which follows a fine tradition of comics madness. In fact, a significant proportion of the plot revolves around characters struggling to convince each other of the truth, against their quite understandable skepticism. They make it work, though, due to returning director Bryan Singer's deft hand with character drama and returning writers Matthew Vaughn (who also directed First Class) and nerd queen Jane Goldman, who bring a real sense of playfulness that pokes gentle, affectionate fun at the plot, characters, setting and everything else that hoves into view.The title is dumb, the end credit scene is far too enigmatic for its own good, and there's no Stan Lee cameo, but these are all insignificant niggles compared to the fun, excitement and character-led drama, remarkably free from the inevitable encumberance of so many characters, so much comics history and so much money. Good job, guys.",7,1,1,13 July 2015
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Wes Anderson's return to form continues
","Version I saw: UK cinema releaseActors: 7/10Plot/script: 6/10Photography/visual style: 8/10Music/score: 7/10Overall: 7/10Building on the success of Moonrise Kingdom, The Grand Budapest Hotel marks the recovery of Wes Anderson's directorial career. The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, The Darjeeling Limited and Fantastic Mr. Fox were all commercial failures, but now he can be confident in the backing or producers and Hollywood money men to give him the artistic freedom a creative talent like him needs.The reason for the renewal is difficult to pin down. The brilliant cast certainly helps: a whole parade of famous names and faces, such as Adrien Brody and Harvey Keitel. Anderson has always had a talent for convincing stars to join him despite his very modest budget, but he has really outdone himself this time.Ralph Fiennes is a big factor in the central role. Until now, he has generally been thought of as a very serious actor, with gravitas and dignity aplenty, but GBH shows that he has also mastered the art of comic timing. His delivery of comedic lines is brilliant, as are his movements and gestures, playing on his his perceived seriousness to hilariously ridiculous effect.Anderson has always used obvious directorial flourishes and camera movements that deliberately draw attention to themselves, like the exaggerated movements of a mime or clown, but in this film it is taken to extremes. The models used for the exterior of the hotel and its environs are very obviously model-like. Not only is no attempt made to disguise this, it is actually gleefully emphasized. So prominent is Anderson's directorial presence that he is almost a character in the story.There is one very slight blemish: why does Anderson use a different star actress in every film? So many of the male actors return again and again, but not the women. Is there something about working with Anderson that puts them off? It's barely a mystery though, more of a curiosity, and judging by what we see on screen, they seem to be enjoying themselves as much as anyone.A key part of Wes Anderson's attraction to viewers is that he and his collaborators are obviously having tremendous fun, and they bring us along for the ride. His most successful films are the ones that convey that sense of fun best. I look forward to enjoying more from him in future.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk",7,1,3,14 September 2014
Gone Girl," The Modernist master
","Version I saw: Showcase cinema screeningActors: 8/10Plot/script: 7/10Photography/visual style: 7/10Music/score: 7/10Overall: 8/10David Fincher is the most modern of directors, dealing with modern issues in a modern way, drawing from cinema's history but not bound by it.He also has a habit of drawing career-defining performances from actors. Both of these are much in evidence in Gone Girl. I was aware of Rosamund Pike as a very good British actress before, but this portrayal takes her to the next level.This is not to say that I like her character Amy. Almost all the characters in the film are pretty repugnant: much of Fincher's work appears to take the premise that there is darkness just under the skin of every human being who ever lived.The tone of the film is unnerving, and this is due in no small part to the score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, of Nine Inch Nails fame.The plot develops in some pretty lurid directions, to the extent that I wonder whether it harms or enhances the themes explored, mainly of the crass cynicism of modern fame. The main plot twist is a bit of a stretch too, but I went with it, and I am glad I did, because the end it leads to is quite outstanding.",8,1,5,29 May 2016
Drive," Less petrol-headed actioner than human drama
","Version I saw: UK Blu-ray release (but watched on CRT TV)Actors: 7/10Plot/script: 6/10Photography/visual style: 7/10Music/score: 6/10Overall: 7/10Drive is about a mechanic and stunt driver (played by Ryan Gosling) who moonlights as an underworld getaway driver. Given this summary, you would expect exciting chase scenes, a dumb plot and probably some likable but slightly sleazy characters.The film is nothing like that, though. There are action scenes, certainly, and some of them are quite exciting, but the focus is very much on the human drama, and especially the relationship between the (unnamed) main character and his single-mother neighbour, played by Carey Mulligan.All this is filmed beautifully by the rapidly rising director Nicholas Winding Refn. It's visually quite a stunning film, and the main character has an underlying innocence that sometimes bursts through his near-autistic social awkwardness. I wouldn't go as far as some who named it unequivocally Film of the Year, but I look forward to more from Gosling and Winding Refn.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/drive-2011.html",7,0,2,11 January 2014
Frozen," The complete package, topped off with bags of charm
","Version I saw: UK cinema screening (2D)Actors: 7/10Plot/script: 9/10Photography/visual style: 9/10Music/score: 9/10Overall: 8/10Everyone I know who has been to see Disney's 'Frozen' came out raving about it, and rightly so. It blends classic old Disney, sassy new Disney, a clever subtext that delivers an important message, two strong female leads, stunning visuals, great songs and avalanches of charm.Inspired more by the style and context of Hans Christian Andersen's work than his particular story 'The Snow Queen', the stated inspiration for the film, Frozen follows Anna and Elsa, princesses in medievalish Arandelle. Elsa becomes a shut-in to hide her ice-controlling powers, then flees when she is unable to keep them concealed. The feisty Anna chases after her.It is hard to overstate how much love I have for Frozen. I love the two main characters. I love the authentic relationship between the sisters. I love the supporting cast, the clever script, the attention to detail throughout the design of environments. Somewhat to my surprise, I love the songs. I love the story, and the message.As with any story in which someone is rejected and cast out for being 'different', the plot of Frozen can be viewed as a metaphor for homosexuality. Like all the best allegories of this kind, the story does not depend on it at all. You can perfectly well view and enjoy Frozen as being purely about magical powers in a medievalish setting... but as a metaphor, it has several details that I find extremely commendable and refreshing, and it's very modern, very worthwhile, and presented with perfectly balanced subtlety: not too intrusive to interfere with the story, yet obvious enough to get through to the watching kids, for whom this lesson will be a very valuable one.It's the complete film experience: fulfilling, heart-warming, worthy, thought-provoking, visually stunning, intelligent and clever and visceral. Just go watch it, if you haven't already, and prepare to be delighted.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/frozen-2013.html",8,4,7,27 February 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Passable, but still not up to Raimi standard
","Version I saw: UK cinema release (2D)Actors: 6/10Plot/script: 5/10Photography/visual style: 6/10Music/score: 6/10Overall: 6/10If the producers of this film thought everyone would have forgotten the Raimi versions by now, they were dead wrong. The reasons for these films are well-documented: contractual stipulations mean Sony lose the rights to the character if they don't make films on a semi-regular basis. The commercial machinations are quite interesting, in a way, but not very artistically credible.To be fair, in some areas, this version stands up quite well. Andrew Garfield makes a good Spidey, balancing the nerdy weakling and wisecracking hero sides of the character. This has especially pleased some people who never liked Tobey Maguire's portrayal, although I think he was at least as good. The rapport with co-star Emma Stone is good as well; whether this is just good acting or a sign of their reported off-screen romance I do not know, and to be honest don't much care, although I understand that it makes a great bit of PR. Too bad that... well, you'll see.Out of the two villains, Dane DeHaan has even more of a balance to strike as the schizophrenic Harry Osborn/Green Goblin, and manages it with more aplomb than James Franco did, in my opinion. It's just a shame that James Foxx is given so little to do as Electro. He is a very good actor, and doesn't deserve to be CGIed almost out of existence and given an emotional register that ranges from angry to very angry.The plot holes have been commented on by others, but I think they overstate the matter. Yes, there are plot holes, and contrivances, and none of the good stuff is quite enough to forgive this, but many of the criticisms don't hang together for me.The biggest difference between old Spidey and new, and the one that is most difficult to surmount, is the director. Marc Webb seems capable enough, but he just doesn't have that touch of flair that Sam Raimi could add at times. Without that, the new films will never be more than passable.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogger, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk",6,3,9,16 December 2014
Patton," Two styles of war film combined
","Version I saw: UK DVD releaseActors: 7/10Plot/script: 7/10Photography/visual style: 6/10Music/score: 7/10Overall: 7/10I've never seen a bad film from the year 1970, and the Oscar winner that year was Patton, so I felt sure I would like it. Patton is a portrait of the famous American World War II general of the same name, played by George C Scott.It's a magnetic, compelling performance, from the tub-thumping opening speech through to the end, and it's a shame it did not make more of a star of Scott. I suppose the right role came along at just the right time.Patton comes at an odd time in the history of war films, which is encapsulated by the two screenwriters. On is Edmund H North, a veteran of the days when war films like his Sink the Bismarck! aimed first and foremost to be historical chronicles. However, the other writer is Francis Ford Coppola, the legendary director whose Apocalypse Now later transformed the genre into one that focused on a message or allegory ahead of dispassionate factual accuracy.Patton has a bit of both. The film is pretty literal, with no flights of fantasy, and also draws on a theme from Sink the Bismarck! that the Germans lost partly due to Nazi Party internal politics. However, it is also much more a film about one man than about the war, and if anything draws a comparison between its hero's war conduct and America as a whole in international diplomacy.The production is notably lavish, with huge sets heavily dressed with well observed period trappings, and masses of extras in many scenes. Whole battles are portrayed, always a challenge for any director, although while impressively staged, they left me rather cold.I did not know that much about General Patton, and for that reason I found the film quite frustrating. I was interested to know more, but because it focuses more on the individual than his place within the whole, I came away with more questions than answers. For those, I suppose I will have to watch more of those old 1950s historically accurate movies.",7,0,0,1 December 2015
Lincoln," American icon in political procedural
","Version I saw: UK cinema releaseActors: 8/10Plot/script: 7/10Photography/visual style: 6/10Music/score: 7/10Overall: 7/10When names like Abraham Lincoln, Steven Spielberg and Daniel Day-Lewis coincide, you know it's going to be a major cinematic event. Given the legendary status of this historical figure though, and his importance to American national identity, they could have gone safe and made a hagiography, a film about a saintly man being saintly and having no flaws whatsoever.Instead, they focused on one particular event, the passing of the law that outlawed slavery throughout the United States. In order to see it through, Lincoln is required to perpetrate an ongoing deception about the status of the war which is hanging over Congress' heads and inclining them to favour abolition of slavery. He lies over and over again, explicitly contradicting the traditional portrayal of 'Honest Abe', the man who 'cannot tell a lie.'The result is a 'political procedural', rather like the excellent TV series 'The West Wing', in which characters stay true to their principles because of - not despite - their wisdom and fine judgement in knowing when to compromise. This is exemplified in the film by Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, the character played brilliantly by Tommy Lee Jones, who climbs down from his tub-thumping rhetoric of absolute racial equality that has spooked many of the more conservative Representatives from voting in a bill which clearly leads in that direction.Due to Spielberg's talent for melodrama, this is a fascinating story filled with tension, in which the title character's flaws are not shied away from. Coming in the same month or so as Django Unchained, it showed a much better way of making a film about American slavery, without Tarantino's ridiculous excesses.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/lincoln-2012.html",7,1,1,6 April 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," Unrepentant
","Version I saw: UK cinema release (2D)Actors: 7/10Plot/script: 8/10Photography/visual style: 7/10Music/score: 9/10Overall: 7/10My key word to describe Guardians of the Galaxy is 'unrepentant'. It is what it is, and it stands proud of that, refusing to change to suit anyone's tastes. The genius of the film is that it convinces us to agree.British comics writer Dan Abnett revived the 1960s superhero team in 2008, imbuing it with the spirit of comics legend Jack Kirby, but also giving it a distinctly British edge. In American comedies, the characters are fundamentally friends, but the Guardians are more like those in a British sitcom: they hate each other, but are tied together by circumstances.The setting is that of a pretty silly, far-fetched space opera of the kind that might have existed in the 60s and 70s, but it is brought right up to date by several factors. The most obvious is the look: the most modern CGI is used, bringing two of the main stars - Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and Groot (Vin Diesel's voice) - to life in a way that would not have been practical even 5 years ago. The settings and backgrounds are also massively enhanced by computer technology.While I am on the subject, it's worth pointing out that the film is as full of stars in the celebrity sense as astrological bodies. Cooper and Chris Pratt (as 'Star Lord' Peter Quill) have shown that they can headline major movies, while Diesel and Zoe Saldana can do the same for medium-sized ones. Glenn Close, Josh Brolin, Michael Rooker, Benicio Del Toro, Karen Gillan, Lee Pace... The list goes on.Something so massive in scale can become humourless, but that is never a risk with GotG. The film is so packed with humour that I would class it as at least partly comedy by genre, and this neatly punctures any sense of pompousness, roundly mocking every character even while enjoying their antics.The music is key. I never would have thought I could like these cheesy 60s and 70s pop tunes, but they are well chosen and inserted perfectly into the narrative - and even the plot - with great skill. In fact, one is part of the scene which I think is the thematic heart of the film. In a brief down-time, Star Lord tries to explain to Gamora (Saldana) why his music is so great, but she only understands when he just plays it to her. The message is the same for the film: 'If we explain it, you won't get it. Just watch it, and you'll realize it's awesome.' And I did.The message goes further, when applied to yourself: accept who you are, don't compromise or change for anyone, and people will eventually 'get' you. It's a wonderful sentiment, and very laudable, if a little convenient for fanboy nerds like me, who are presumably the core target audience. Maybe they were actually addressing themselves, and their shallow Hollywood colleagues; I don't know.Before its release, GotG was predicted by some to be Marvel's first big cinematic flop, but its joy, exuberance, wit and sheer self-confidence have made it, for many, the MCU's absolute highlight.",7,0,2,11 November 2015
Evil Dead," Poor remake that misses the point
","Version I saw: UK bluray releaseActors: 5/10Plot/script: 5/10Photography/visual style: 6/10Music/score: 6/10Overall: 5/10Unknown director. First-time writer. Unknown cast. These statements describe both 2013's 'Evil Dead' and its predecessor, the 1981 original. However, while Sam Raimi's 'The Evil Dead' bucked the trend, the new version very much shows evidence of the inexperience of those making it.Some elements are done well, to be fair. The mobile hand-held camera work turns a budget limitation into an advantage, and the use of Raimi's patent 'camera on a stick' technique is a fitting tribute, if a little over-abundant. Overall, it looks more slick and professional than the original, albeit with a budget over 30 times bigger (not accounting for inflation).The screenplay leaves a lot to be desired, though. The characters are monumentally idiotic, undermining any sympathy I might have had for their plight. The theme connecting narcotics to demonic activity, while functional enough as a plot point, is woefully undercooked as a metaphor.Finally, there is not a shred of humour throughout. While the presence of humour in the original is disputed (I never found it very funny), the series is now best known for its blend of horror and comedy. At the end of the closing credits, we see Bruce Campbell as Ash, the main character in the original, but this only reminded me of what I had enjoyed back then, and not found here.Alvarez appears not to realize what made the original great, but thinks he does, and set about making a tribute to that. The success of the new 'Ash Vs Evil Dead' TV series shows how wrong he was.",5,4,6,6 November 2015
The Imitation Game," If you've never heard of Alan Turing, this is the film for you
","Version I saw: UK cinema releaseActors: 7/10Plot/script: 7/10Photography/visual style: 7/10Music/score: 6/10Overall: 7/10I came into 'The Imitation Game' knowing quite a bit about Alan Turing. He comes into conversations about science, mathematics, history and civil rights. I had seen the 1996 BBC drama 'Breaking the Code' starring Derek Jacobi, as had Benedict Cumberbatch, who has said in interviews that Jacobi's performance of the role influenced his own. For this version though, the focus is more on the effects of Turing's autism on his life than of his speech impediment.This is Cumberbatch's forte: characters who are right all the time, about everything, but communicate poorly. He's got the charisma to be likable even while behaving (on the face of it) badly toward people. In fact, he heads a cast featuring Mark Strong, Keira Knightley and Charles Dance, all doing the exact types of performances at which they excel.Turning this kind of story into a drama faces an obstacle that doing maths and breaking codes in rooms is not inherently cinematic, but the screenplay does a good job of getting around this by various means. Graham Moore's script is excellent in many regards. Also, I would like to point out some great location scouting and set dressing.My only hesitation is that... Maybe I am wrong, but I don't think The Imitation Game adds much to the knowledge of even a fairly educated layman. There's very little new information here, and some questions I had remained unanswered. It covers the basics in an engaging, dramatic, insightful way, but if you are coming to this to expand your knowledge of Turing, you might want to look elsewhere instead.",7,0,0,16 May 2017
Les Misérables," Just simply one of the best films ever made (no. 7 in my list, FYI)
","Version I saw: UK cinema releaseActors: 9/10Plot/script: 8/10Photography/visual style: 9/10Music/score: 10/10Overall: 9/10Les Miserables absolutely blew me away. I simply never cry at movies, but throughout large chunks of this one, I was on the verge of tears.Admittedly, it does have a couple of mitigating factors which predestine me to look favourably on it - a nostalgic glow from my childhood memories of the songs, and the fact that it seems to me an openly theistic film - and yes, director Tom Hooper uses every trick in the book to pull at the heart-strings.However, there is no denying the strength (and bleakness) of the story, the strength of the cast who all sing and act out of their skins. With the exception of slight accent troubles with one or two characters, the film absolutely excels in every single area, achieving near-perfection in the field of cinema.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk",9,1,3,14 January 2014
12 Years a Slave," The film Django Unchained was pretending to be
","Version I saw: UK cinema releaseActors: 9/10Plot/script: 7/10Photography/visual style: 9/10Music/score: 7/10Overall: 8/10The Academy adjudged this to be the best film of the year at the 2014 Oscars, and it is certainly a worthy contender, but I think come to be better known as the film that picked up the gauntlet which Django Unchained threw down.Quentin Tarantino's highly entertaining period romp became a mockery due to its pretensions at somehow tackling the 'issue of slavery' in a new way. 12 Years a Slave is the film that shows how to do it right.Director Steve McQueen's roots in the art world, where he used video material regularly in his art gallery installations, are apparent in his mastery of colour, motion, focus and movement. These are the tools of cinema, but they are also key to any number of other art forms.The cast is also excellent. I have had my eye on Chiwetel Ejiofor ever since his superb performances in Serenity, Kinky Boots and Children of Men, but he is overshadowed by total newcomer Lupita Nyong'o. Able support is lent by Benedict Cumberbatch and Michael Fassbender, whose characters lend the balance of which Django was so signally devoid.The plot is pretty predictable, and it's hard going at times, heavy on suffering, but that is partly because of the source material on which it is based, the book of the same name which was Solomon Northup's account of his own captivity.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk",8,0,3,16 July 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," Quality sci-fi with arguably the greatest film star ever
","Version I saw: UK cinema release (2D)Actors: 7/10Plot/script: 7/10Photography/visual style: 6/10Music/score: 7/10Overall: 7/10There is a case to be made for dubbing Tom Cruise the greatest star in film history. Not necessarily the best star, and certainly not the best actor (although he can be very good on his day). For three whole decades, he has played lead in among the biggest blockbusters of the year, and yet is also willing to set aside his ego on occasion to play villains and other deeply flawed characters. Alongside the action hero parts, I could point you to Tropic Thunder, Collateral, Magnolia and Interview With the Vampire for a truly rounded filmography that stretches right up to the present day.Edge of Tomorrow is one of Cruise's less outright heroic roles. Although he redeems himself by the end, he begins as a cowardly liar, and proceeds largely by an almost endless parade of failure, slowly developing into a badass.Comparisons have been drawn between Edge of Tom and several other films. In particular, Groundhog Day and Saving Private Ryan are the plot precedents regularly drawn upon, with overtones of Starship Troopers. The story seems to me a direct retelling of the D-Day landings as a science fiction adventure, notably being released within days (and in some countries, on the very day) of the famous World War II offensive's 70th anniversary. It seems this has not been focused on much by reviewers or the film's own PR, but I applaud it as an attempt to make history accessible to young action film fans.The plot device of a single day endlessly repeated while only one person is aware is now a well worn one, but EoT proves once again that there is more interesting material to explore. The set-up, it has to be said, doesn't entirely makes sense, but the focus is more on the implications than the causes.It has to be said that the plot trajectory has more than a few clichés about it, revolving around an everyman who discovers an extraordinary ability, trains under a master and exceeds the master to save the day. However, when the master in question is played by Emily Blunt, an expert in characters with a little bit of grit and a share of concealed vulnerability, I am happy to let it go.It's a shame they couldn't call the film 'All You Need Is Kill', the title of the Japanese light novel on which it is based, but I can see why the producers decided they needed something a bit less 'engrish'. This is very much a Tom Cruise film, and that is the way it was sold.",7,0,1,28 September 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," I wish I didn't like it as much as I do
","Version I saw: UK cinema release Actors: 8/10 Plot/script: 8/10 Photography/visual style: 7/10 Music/score: 7/10 Overall: 8/10 I am very conflicted about The Wolf of Wall Street. You see, accidentally or deliberately, it pulls the strange trick of making me enjoy it while simultaneously making me feel bad for enjoying it.Like many Scorsese films (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The Aviator), The Wolf of Wall Street is a deftly drawn portrait of an exceptional character, who faces pressures and trials very different to those of everyday people, and reacts in ways no ordinary person would. Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) is uniquely driven, but he is also self-centred, greedy, shallow and essentially immoral. As played by DiCaprio, he also has enormous reserves of charisma.The film follows the essential plot of Goodfellas, charting Belfort's rise and fall. He does abhorrent things to gain success, enjoys that success, and eventually has his comeuppance. Part of me hated him and delighted in his downfall, but another part was drawn in by his personal magnetism, and I found that my gut reaction was to smile when he did well, and be unhappy when he did badly. I was slightly angry with myself for siding with this monster against his victims, and slightly angry with Scorsese and DiCaprio for making me feel this way, no matter how subtly and impressively it was that they did so. I left the cinema feeling a little bit soiled.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk",8,0,1,20 July 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Ravishing and yet frustrating
","Version I saw: UK cinema release (HFR 3D IMAX)Actors: 7/10Plot/script: 5/10Photography/visual style: 7/10Music/score: 7/10Overall: 7/10I was a defender of Peter Jackson as the Hobbit films released to disappointed audiences, but it now seems clear that he didn't know what he was doing with the story. The Dol Guldur/Necromancer plot line really was tacked on for no good reason, adding almost nothing except opportunities to foreshadow the events of Lord of the Rings. The over-abundance of characters is a nightmare to manage, and yet they still get corralled into one place at the climax for the battle of the title. Smaug gets killed off before the opening credits. It's all a bit messy.And yet, the film remains very enjoyable, and I think, very good. The absolute orgy of scenery porn photographed by Andy Serkis' second unit combines with the master craftsmanship of Weta Workshop in both CGI and physical props/costumes/set dressing to make a sumptuous feast for the eyes. I honestly believe that if a viewer spent the whole movie focusing exclusively on the backgrounds, they would come away satisfied.And the acting is not bad either. Admittedly, none of it (and nothing else in the movie either) has a shred of subtlety, but the cast do a good job of portraying those big, blunt emotional arcs. Thorin's (Richard Armitage) operatic descent into madness and then redemption, Bilbo's (Martin Freeman) fear, suspicion and ultimate bravery, Tauriel's (Evangeline Lilly) pointless romantic sub-plot, all are implemented with gusto, and come across about as well as you could reasonably hope.As a die-hard Tolkien fan, I am happy to spend as long as I can in this Middle-Earth that Jackson has created. If the films had been 9 hours each, I would be fine with that. With more rigour at the screen writing stage, all three films could have been considerably better, but I am very happy with what we have.",7,0,1,1 June 2017
The Blind Side," Much better than you might expect
","Version I saw: Amazon Prime rental (Bluray)Actors: 8/10Plot/script: 7/10Photography/visual style: 6/10Music/score: 6/10Overall: 7/10The Blind Side presents as part sports film, part family melodrama, but there is actually more to it than that. Of course, it is about the rise of sports star Michael Oher, but in that story we see a lot of social commentary, and two really fantastic acting performances. Quinton Aaron is great as Oher, but it is Sandra Bullock who rightly got the attention of the Oscars committee for her role as well-to-do teacher and mother Leigh Anne Tuohy, who takes in a vulnerable black boy and then realizes his potential.The American football scenes are actually remarkably sparse, which is good, because I know very little about handegg. There is also a very good voice-over explanation by Bullock at the very beginning, which told me pretty much everything you need to know for the purposes of the story. There is more a bit later, and I have to admit that I wasn't following the subtleties, but I got more than enough to go forward with.The film does rather lead you by the hand emotionally, but I am happy to accept that from a film as long as it is done well. The social commentary, illustrated in the contrast between 'Big Mike's lack of ambition and the Tuohy family's assumption that the best is available to them, is nothing new either, but the point here is empathy, and the film delivers that in spades.The pace is fairly gentle throughout, which I think is director John Lee Hancock's forte. When he tried thrills and action in The Alamo, he came badly unstuck and ended up with an expensive, boring flop. He excels in writing, and slowly developing themes.The subtext is not perfect, certainly. I detected a couple of missteps, or at least sidesteps, but crucially, I could see mitigating circumstances for each decision the screenwriters made. All round, it doesn't put a foot far wrong.If you are a bloke, and doubt you would like a film this soppy, or you are a woman and doubt you would be too interested in a sports film, I suggest you give this movie a try. I think it will surprise you.",7,1,1,16 November 2015

Travers, are often reported. This film takes that and spins it into a magical tale of it's own, with a dark undercurrent stemming from Travers' troubled childhood and relationship with her alcoholic father. Tom Hanks (as Disney), Emma Thompson (as Travers) and Colin Farrell (as Travers' father in flashbacks interspersing the drama in Hollywood) all do what they do best, and what they do best, they do really excellently. They are supported by a strong cast, and the soundtrack is brilliant too, full of echoes of the iconic music in the original film.The whole is a delight to see. Just don't expect documentary truth. This is a Disney Corporation film, and they were never going to portray their founding father with all the character flaws he was rumoured to have.

The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Hunger Games grows up

Ever since I saw the first Hunger Games film a couple of years ago, the sources from which it drew inspiration were pretty obvious. Suzanne Collins claims never to have heard of Battle Royale when she wrote the books, but the premise is so similar that it is hard to credit, and there are strong echoes of Rollerball and The Running Man.The excellence of the films, though, is in the delivery. It is there in the acting, exemplified by the storied Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence). Katniss is genuinely one of the best feminist role models around today, a complex three-dimensional character often favourably compared to Twilight's Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart). Lawrence has also developed in the last couple of years into a highly respected actress from whom one can expect a strong, serious performance every time.Like Lawrence, all the characters and actors involved with the Hunger Games have developed from adolescence to full-on adulthood, with an increase in maturity and consideration. The plot is all about this tension, between the well-considered, dispassionate choice and the emotive decision dictated by the heart.Add in the well thought out production design, evoking a largely low-tech future that is easy to understand so that the more complex science-fiction concepts can pass without difficulty.Intelligent, well thought out design that develops the story between films, and solid professionalism in delivery, make The Hunger Games what it is. I only hope they are not derailed by the death of Philip Seymour Hoffman.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk",7,6,22,16 March 2014
Godzilla," Not quite serious enough, not quite silly enough
","Version I saw: UK cinema release (subtitled)Actors: 6/10Plot/script: 6/10Photography/visual style: 7/10Music/score: 6/10Overall: 6/10With 28 main sequence films, several spin-offs and numerous appearances in other media, the Godzilla franchise is formidable. In 1998, Hollywood tried to get in on the action under the helm of big, dumb blockbuster specialist Roland Emmerich, and while the result is routinely derided by one and all, it made a comfortable profit.Now, they have tried again, with inexperienced indie director Gareth Edwards. He has enjoyed a remarkable career trajectory since his micro-budget film Monsters won praise from a variety of sources. Before the dust had settled from Godzilla's landing, it was announced that he had been given charge of the first of several new stand-alone Star Wars films which will sit alongside JJ Abrams' main trilogy.The stars come from the indie world too. Aaron Taylor-Johnson broke through with British drama Nowhere Boy (which I thoroughly recommend), and continued the trend by starring as the unlikely hero Kick-Ass. Elizabeth Olsen's early success was trailer park drama Martha Marcy May Marlene. More recently, both have cemented their status as rising stars by appearing as super-powered brother and sister Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch in Avengers: Age of Ultron.There is something a bit... cynical, though, about the placement of their characters in Godzilla. ATJ is Ford Brody, a former soldier and war veteran, while Olsen is his wife Elle, a nurse. Both are, I gather, professions that are practically shortcuts to instant sympathy in large parts of the American audience. This is edging on being a problem for me, because in Britain at least, military people have no such rosy glow about them, and especially since what are widely regarded as massively misjudged campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. Anyway, to top it all off, they also have photogenic child Sam (Carson Bolde).I don't know why it bothered me. It's certainly no more egregious than any number of other blockbusters. It doesn't feel any more blatant, either in the moment or looking back. It isn't even that big a problem: throughout most of the film, I was more amused than offended. 'Of course they are,' I found myself thinking. 'It's almost as if they don't trust a skyscraper-sized lizard monster to cement audience sympathy.'Godzilla has always been as much a character in his movies as a plot device, though. He has personality, motivations, even emotions of a sort. Taken over the series as a whole, he has friends and allies too.This makes the character design extremely important, and Edwards and his team did a good job in this aspect. Yes, he is a bit wider around the waist than traditional portrayals, but calling him 'fat' is really a cheap shot, and not that important to the film either. And he looks fantastic. All the special effects work is excellent, in fact. Really top notch. It's not quite up there with Avatar, Gravity or Interstellar, but not far off, and putting such outlandish monsters firmly into an everyday context while still carrying the audience is quite a feat to pull off.The themes are the thing though. The best Godzilla films I have seen are either ridiculously daft, or deeply allegorical, and not that subtle about it either. This Godzilla film's themes are understated, and slightly troubling: it seems to say that nature can handle itself, and protect us as we heedlessly harm the planet. I wanted metaphors a lot more blatant than this, and preferably better thought out.By sacrificing the message, they move closer to the silly, spectacular model of Gojira films, but for my money, don't get close enough. It's a halfway house, and not successful enough at blending those two modes to raise it to the next level.",6,2,4,10 May 2015
Looper," No Twelve Monkeys, but not far off
","Version I saw: In-flight movie (KLM)Actors: 7/10Plot/script: 7/10Photography/visual style: 6/10Music/score: 5/10Overall: 7/10When you cast Bruce Willis in a time travel movie, you are placing yourself in a very significant shadow: that of Twelve Monkeys. Terry Gilliam's 1995 film is considered by many to be the epitome of what a time-travel film should be.Fortunately, Looper not only acknowledges this, but actively embraces it with several notable parallels. The way 'time travel fries your brain like an egg' has some interesting plot implications which are explored nicely.Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt play the same character at different periods in his life. While Willis' film-star mannerisms are too well-known for him too convincingly take on another's, JG-L is younger, and more than willing to subsume his own personality, in the service of the narrative. If there is any doubt of this logic, there is one trump-card: in this film, it works.Some have criticized the ending, claiming it makes a wrenching shift to a different type of film, but I think the change was set up well early on, as long as you make the effort to pay attention to the details.Speaking of details, I saw this film on a plane, and I think I lost out a bit from the cramped visuals and tinny sound. I would advise you to seek it out on a proper TV with a decent-sized screen.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/looper-2012.html",7,0,4,4 January 2014
What We Do in the Shadows," Accomplished vampire mockumentary
","Version I saw: Grimm Up North festival screeningActors: 6/10Plot/script: 7/10Photography/visual style: 7/10Music/score: 7/10Overall: 7/10Peter Jackson started two strings of Kiwi film: huge blockbusters, usually starring Americans, and micro-budget films, especially comedy or horror or both. What We Do In the Shadows, directed by Jemaine Clement (of Flight of the Conchords fame) and Taika Waititi, is one of the latter.I am a fan of Flight of the Conchords, the musical comedy duo, so it is fortunate from my perspective that the emphasis is very much on comedy rather than horror. Taking extraordinary things and putting them in a mundane context is a standard comedic method, and mockumentary is a style that harks right back to This Is Spinal Tap, so there is precedent here.Possibly too much precedent: some jokes I found to have been done before in other vampire comedies such as Dracula: Dead and Loving It and the more humorous parts of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Still, there was plenty of originality to keep me entertained. Clement & Waititi's last film together, Eagle Vs. Shark, was a bit too 'quirky' for my taste, but What We Do had more than enough to laugh at as far as I am concerned.Each of the 5 central vampires gets their own sub-plot, which is wrapped up comfortably in a display of admirable screen writing balance, and there are some special effects tricks that are even more impressive for the way they slip by practically unnoticed. The downbeat nature of the film, deriving comedy from stripping away the atmosphere and style to expose the ridiculousness underlying it, is very much in Jemaine Clement's wheel-house, and he even gets a bit of musical fun in, although it is a far cry from Flight of the Conchords' witty parodies and catchy tunes.All in all, I laughed out loud plenty of times, and what more can you ask of a comedy?",7,0,1,23 December 2015
Tarzan," One of the weaker Disney films
","Version: UK bluray releaseActors: 7/10Plot/script: 5/10Photography/visual style: 6/10Music/score: 4/10Overall: 6/10Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan has become a very cinematic legend over the century since his first story was published but, for me, the Disney version comes during one of the dips in the quality of their output. Their initial Golden Age ended with the Jungle Book, followed by a revival during the 80s and 90s. More recently, they've come back to the top again with The Princess and the Frog, Tangled and Frozen.It's interesting that both the directors of Tarzan were involved with this latest renaissance: Chris Buck co-directed Frozen (with Jennifer Lee), and Kevin Lima got it all started with Enchanted, which re-assessed the glittering Disney back-catalogue, and came away with an attitude that was affectionate, yes, but not actually reverential. Sadly, there is little evidence in Tarzan of that healthier relationship with the legacy.The setting is a problem, for me. I grew up with Disney films that each had a distinctive setting, be it Arabia or under the sea. However, The Jungle Book had already covered, erm, jungle, and The Lion King had done Africa. An adult perception says that the African jungle is distinct from both of these, but Disney are not about adult, subtle distinctions.Another problem with Tarzan is the soundtrack. I found Phil Collins' voice dull and detached throughout, and when I bothered to tune into the lyrics, they just explained what I could already see was going on on-screen, thus making them pointless. Okay, they got Elton John in to make good songs for The Lion King, and there are versions sung by him, but they are distinctly poorer in my book, and in the main film I am glad they stuck with the cast as singers.The animation is pretty good for the period, especially in the sequences where Tarzan is racing through the branches... although they are also suspiciously reminiscent of a roller-coaster ride, coming from the company that must always be on the lookout for new Disneyland attractions. The movements of Tarzan and his ape 'family' are also well-observed, I was pleased to note.Such a shame, then, that the character of Tarzan himself (as voiced by Tony Goldwyn) is so unengaging. I'm not sure why it is; he certainly has enough character drama, what with an identity crisis and overall coming-of-age in classic film style. Maybe it's because they have set aside the traditional Tarzan symbol of masculinity in favour of something more vulnerable and adolescent; a defensible choice, but one that requires real attention to detail to instigate. He just didn't quite grab me... in stark contrast to his love interest, Jane (Minnie Driver). Driver was at the height of her powers back in 1999, and brings to the role the confidence of an actress in charge of her destiny. She has so much more screen magnetism and, quite frankly, I would have preferred it if she had just been the main character throughout. Maybe Tarzan's development would have been more interesting through her eyes.Oh, and TWENTY-ONE story writers! What's that all about? There's barely enough story here for one writer, once you take out the contributions of Burroughs and the screenwriters. It would appear that they just gave a writing credit to everyone who did some work on designing the characters or settings. Office politics, I guess.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk/2014/12/tarzan-1999.html",6,0,4,31 December 2014
Inside Llewyn Davis," Another great collaboration between the Coens and T Bone Burnett
","Version I saw: UK cinema release (preview screening)Actors: 7/10Plot/script: 6/10Photography/visual style: 7/10Music/score: 8/10Overall: 7/10As befits a film about a misfortune-plagued folk singer in the dark days immediately before Bob Dylan caused a resurgence in its popularity, Inside Llewyn Davis is full of great folk music.It not only runs through the background, but is woven into the story too. The up-and-coming Oscar Isaac performs several songs, leading me at the time to think he was an actual folk singer the Coens had convinced to act, and supporting stars Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake both raise their own voices, proving surprisingly talented at it.T Bone Burnett must be given a large part of the credit for the music. He chose and assembled the songs at the behest of the Coen Brothers, having previously performed a similar task on The Ladykillers, and on O Brother Where Art Thou's wonderful Mississippi blues soundtrack.The film has a different look to any other Coen Brothers film, due to a change in cinematographer: their regular collaborator Roger Deakins was replaced by Bruno Delbonnel, who has a handful of Oscar nominations under his belt, although it pales in comparison to Deakins' eleven!Once you get past the visual style though (which is actually quite beautiful once you get used to it) and Llewyn's surliness, the Coen's trademark wry, surreal sense of humour is much in evidence. ILD comes from the more sober line of Coen Brothers films than their zany comedies, but there are still plenty of laughs, in my opinion.And then, although he takes a long time to turn up, frequent Coens alumnus John Goodman's reassuring presence in a quintessentially Coen Brothers role could almost have been directly transplanted from any of the other films in their shared career.It's not for everyone, but as a die-hard Coens fan, I was not disappointed... and I will probably be buying the soundtrack before too long.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk",7,0,0,27 May 2014
Her," Scarlett Johansson's best performance ever in a thoughtful hard sci-fi drama
","Version: UK cinema releaseActors: 7/10Plot/script: 8/10Photography/visual style: 7/10Music/score: 6/10Overall: 8/10I do like a good hard sci-fi. The term applies to a type of fiction that takes an idea from real science and explores it through a fictional narrative. In this case, the idea is of a romantic relationship between a sentient computer program and a human.To my eye, the plot drew on elements covered in Iain M. Banks' Culture novels, as well as some human evolutionary theory. It's not hard sci-fi in its original sense, as the mechanics of the AI is barely touched upon, but the question explored instead is what the effect of such a situation would be on the people involved.That means the actors are crucial, and especially the central pair, who both have difficult tasks. As the human Theodore, Joaquin Phoenix's face is in practically every shot, especially since there is no physical paramour to cut away to. Much of the story is told entirely through the subtle facial expressions that convey his reactions to the voice he is hearing. Fortunately, Phoenix is rapidly becoming one of the most intense, immersive actors today (witness his performance in The Master) and more than capable of carrying this burden.However, I was not expecting much from Scarlett Johansson as the sentient operating system, Samantha. I have not rated her past performances at all, and it seemed to me that she was a weak actress coasting on her looks. Well, that's all changed. Maybe it's age and experience, or maybe it's being forced not to rely on her physical attractiveness, but her voice is just perfect for this role. She has a hint of gravel in her voice, a slight imperfection that lends the 'artificial intelligence' humanity, until the moments come when we are jarringly reminded that she is not human. It turns out she can act, and act brilliantly. I will be hoping for that every time I see her from now on.With the whole invested with writer/director Spike Jonze's trademark absurdism, it's a remarkably cerebral film, but with heart that comes from the authenticity of the performances. If only more science fiction films were like this.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk/2014/08/her-2013.html",8,0,1,24 August 2014
