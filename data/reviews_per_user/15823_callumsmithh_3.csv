It," A instant classic in the making for future generations.
","A beatifully shot film with a fantastic cast that makes a film about a shapeshifting clown seem possible. Bill skarsgard as pennywise draws you into every scene he's in like your one of the kids themselves. The director doesn't fail to disappoint the audience with this instant classic of a remake. The young kid actors portray exactly what it's like to be a kid/teen nowhere days, this was especially shown by stand out performances by finn wolfhard, Sophia lillis and jack dylan grazer in particular.However, this movie doesn't get a 10/10 due to it not being very scary. If your frightened by clowns this movie will get you if not, you will just be in aur by the great performance and shot scenes. 9/10",10,2,3,3 January 2020

Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Disappointing end to the skywalker saga.
","This movie looked like it was a extra 30 minutes long but it has been cut through out the film to shorten the movie because of this the rise of skywalker doesn't allow you to breath and take in the parts of the movie that are brilliant (which there are some) due to this you fill no empathy gor certain story's/ characters. A very disappointing ending to the film but also the saga as a whole.Adam driver, daisy Ridley, John boyega and oscar issac have great performances ( their best yet in a star wars movie) which really carry the movie and makes it watch able. Also, anthony Daniels great c3po character finally fills like the droid we remembered for the original trilogy. JJ abrams did the best he could after trying to fit 2 movies in 1 due to the lack of story from the last jedi.Not the worst star wars movie and it is enjoyable but as a movie I have to give it a 5/10 unfortunately.",5,11,21,3 January 2020
