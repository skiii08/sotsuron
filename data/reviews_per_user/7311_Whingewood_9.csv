War Dogs," Interesting story, funny in places, worth watching, but perhaps not at the cinema.
","War Dogs is based on a true story. The actual story is far less exciting than the theatrical version, but still amusing when you consider what they managed to do.I'm not going to go into detail about the story, but it follows the two main characters (played by Miles Teller and Jonah Hill) as they delve into the arms trade.It all leads up to one massive deal they enter into with the US government, and circumstances arise that make it seem like they bit off more than they can chew.War Dogs is at times a comedy and other times a serious drama/documentary. Certain scenes were added to make the story more interesting than it actually was (their real life counterparts never put themselves directly into danger, as was featured in the film when they smuggled guns from Jordan into Iraq), but they seemed necessary to make it more than just an exaggerated documentary.",7,1,1,15 September 2016
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Entertaining, looked & sounded good, good addition to Star Wars franchise.
","(Originally published on my blog site, whingewood.wordpress.com)I had mixed feelings going to watch this; I like Star Wars but I really did not like The Force Awakens. However, I try to keep an open mind, so despite some 'meh' trailers for the film, I went to watch it. Any fan of Star Wars will already know the outcome of this film, but the journey is important. The film looked and sounded great. There have been mixed opinions regarding the characters of Tarkin and Leia; I think they looked excellent, particularly Tarkin, but I know there are those out there that disagree. Based on my own brief research into non-Star Wars fans seeing Tarkin, a lot of them didn't realize that it was CGI.The overall story was known to everyone going in (get the Death Star plans), but the story around Galen Erso (played by Mads Mikkelsen) and his role in the Death Star was good, and made episode four make a bit more sense (I know it's basically a retcon, but it works).There's been a fair amount of criticism about lack of character depth for the characters that we are introduced to, and yeah, they don't have much depth, but do they really need to? Sure, you're never really going to feel much when waves of faceless Stormtroopers are mowed down (except maybe FN-2199, more popularly known as TR- 8R), but when that fella whose only contribution all film has been throwing out witty one-liners, and they gets shot to bits, you might be a little sad. Ultimately, this film is more story-driven than character-driven, which is fine.So, what did it all add up to? Rogue One was entertaining, with great visual effects and a decent storyline. It gives more context to A New Hope, and is definitely a positive addition to the Star Wars franchise.",8,1,7,21 December 2016
Passengers," Decent film, formulaic, but enjoyable nonetheless.
","(Originally published on my blog site, whingewood.wordpress.com)There were some good points; the ship itself and the society that the characters come from (corporation-run, heavily-reinforced class system based on wealth) were glimpses into a universe that was interesting. Also the idea that they regularly send these kinds of ships on 120 year journeys made me want to know more of that story.But the film isn't about that universe, it's about the two main characters and their interactions (which is fine, as it was marketed that way, so it's not like I was surprised by that), and it's upon these characters that we should judge the film by.Without wanting to go into spoilers, the part of the film where Chris Pratt's character is on his own for a year reminded me of the only good part of 2007's I Am Legend, where the character of Robert Neville (played by Will Smith) roams around with only his dog for company (in Passengers, the companion this time is the android bartender, Arthur).The rest of the film after that was formulaic, which in my eyes resulted in it being fairly mediocre. Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt both gave good performances, it's just that they didn't have much to work with. To top it off, the ending was far too 'Hollywood' for my liking, but that may be because I'm something of a cynic!",6,1,4,7 January 2017
Suicide Squad," Entertaining comic book action film, well worth watching!
","Going into this film I was already aware of the Suicide Squad. I've had brief glimpses of some of the old and the new squads, and have also seen the animated version (which is definitely worth checking out by the way).So, onto the film. I felt that the pacing was good, as at no point during the film did I feel bored. The story, such as it was, progressed at a good pace and never really gave me a chance to stop and think, which may have been a good thing as it was not overly deep or original. However, this is a comic book film, so I wasn't exactly expecting a highbrow masterpiece in terms of story, but the action scenes were enjoyable and kept the film moving along.The characters were introduced through exposition, which would normally be written off as lazy, but was appropriate in this film in the context it was used. I'm not going to talk about the individual changes to characters compared to the comics as there are always going to be differences; I'll leave that to the fans to bicker about.In my opinion, you were given enough information about each character to get a sense of their motivations and capabilities (very similar amounts to characters in films like The Magnificent Seven and The Dirty Dozen, and you never hear complaints about them). Some people may complain about the number of characters, but those same people won't question the amount in Game of ThronesThe two main characters, Harley Quinn and Deadshot, were both portrayed well by Margot Robbie and Will Smith respectively. You'll probably hear a lot about how little of Jared Leto's Joker was in the film, which people are chalking up as a negative, however, I'd be disinclined to agree. The Joker should never be a main character in a film where Batman is not also the main character, and in this film, Ben Affleck's Batman was hardly present (again, not a negative thing).This film is about Amanda Waller's Task Force X (the Suicide Squad), who was played very well by Viola Davis (Waller is definitely not someone to be messed with), and this film establishes them as 'The Other Guys'; the ones you call when the Justice League are too busy, and the ones that the government has near total control over.If you enjoy films like The Magnificent Seven or The Dirty Dozen, and also happen to like comic book films, then I really think you'll enjoy this. People are far too quick to compare this to Marvel's misfit offering, Guardians of the Galaxy (which is an excellent film by the way, you should watch it!), when better comparisons are to the two films I just mentioned. Don't get sucked into the Marvel vs DC debate; it's OK to like both!(Review from my blog: whingewood.wordpress.com)",8,9,17,9 August 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Well-paced and enjoyable, fans of the series will probably enjoy it.
","(Also published on my blog site, whingewood.wordpress.com)I've been putting off seeing this for a while now (for no particular reason), but decided to go before they stop showing it. I've not seen or read all of the Harry Potter series, but enjoyed what I have. Thankfully, you don't need to know anything about that series going into this film.The story follows Newt (played by Eddie Redmayne) as he goes to New York with his case full of beasts, one or more of them escape, antics ensue.The visual effects were up to the usual standard for Harry Potter films, which is to say, very good. Personally, I particularly liked the effect for the teleportation (which there was a lot of).Despite having the word 'fantastic' in the title, this felt a lot less fantastical than the Harry Potter series. However, I am not listing that as a negative, but am instead just making an observation. I think this is due in part to the fact that the main character (Newt) is already extremely familiar with the wizarding world, and it wasn't necessary to go overemphasise the magical aspects (don't get me wrong; there is a lot of magic going on in this film, it's just that they don't go 'this is a MacGuffin, it does this' a lot. Basically, there is a lot less exposition.).The film progressed at a decent pace, and I didn't find myself bored at any time, which is usually a good sign. The ending had an interesting reveal, and although this film did feel 'complete', it definitely leaves room for sequels.",7,0,2,14 December 2016
Avatar," Pretty, but unoriginal
","I watched Avatar again today after having seen it previously, shortly after it was released in 2009. No complaints on the special effects side; they were superb. But nice visuals alone does not make a good film. Which leads onto the main problem; story.As numerous other posters have stated, anyone that has watched a lot of films will notice the not-so-subtle similarities. This makes the whole film rather predictable and ultimately, boring.Avatar was worth watching, once, but it is not a film that will leave a lasting impression on me, and I have zero desire to watch it again.",5,3,4,26 March 2014
Sausage Party," To use their vernacular, 'f*****g spooge!'
","Personally, I have found Seth Rogen's previous efforts to be very hit and miss. I quite liked The Green Hornet, but absolutely hated This is the End.With a title like Sausage Party, my expectations weren't set high. Just as well really, as it was extremely lowbrow (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). but unlike Matt Stone and Trey Parker efforts (South Park & Team America), it offered little in the way of intelligent commentary to counterbalance it.I know that humour is subjective, but to me this wasn't funny. I'm not even sure that my twelve-year-old self would have found it funny. If you find animated food saying f**k and c**t amusing, then this is the film for you. For everyone else, spend your ticket money elsewhere.The film's 'message' was not smart or original, and their attempt at shock factor ('haha, that vegetable said f**k!') fails because it's been done before, bigger, longer, and uncut (South Park movie).(Originally published on my blog, whingewood.wordpress.com)",4,3,10,2 September 2016
Arrival," Slow-paced, disappointing reveal.
","(Originally published on my blog, whingewood.wordpress.com)Based on the trailers I'd seen for this, I was quite excited to go and see it. I enjoyed Sicario (another film directed by Denis Villeneuve), so I was optimistic.The basic idea of the film (spaceships arrive, they wait for us to communicate with them, some governments go mental, mass hysteria, etc) seems 'realistic' to me, so for a large part of the film I was engrossed, even though the film moves at a snail's pace.Throughout the film you are sledgehammered with clues ('Your father is a scientist. SCIENCE! He likes science!'), which eventually build up to the 'reveal'. Personally, I found it a massive disappointment. Trying not to give spoilers, but it sort of invalidates the actions of nearly everyone else in the film.The slow pace and disappointing ending made this film a gruelling experience. However, I think this is a film that will firmly divide opinion, it's just that I sit on the negative side of that divide.",4,2,7,24 November 2016
Sully," Interesting dramatisation of a real-life event
","This is not exactly the kind of film you get excited by the prospect of going to see; it's basically a dramatic documentary. However, it's directed by Clint Eastwood and stars Tom Hanks, so that's normally enough to warrant a look.The film is about an incident in 2009 where a pilot had to make a water-landing on the Hudson River after both of his engines gave out. The film shows us what happened during the flight (from multiple points-of-view), as well as the investigation afterwards.If you like films like Apollo 13, then you'll probably enjoy this too (not just because of the Tom Hanks connection). I don't have a lot to say about it other than I found it reasonably enjoyable. It also compelled me to seek out actual documentaries of the event.(Originally published on my blog, whingewood.wordpress.com)",7,1,2,17 January 2017
