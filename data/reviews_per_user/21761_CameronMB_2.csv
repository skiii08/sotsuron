Love and Death," Possibly Allen's comic masterpiece
","Although the critics loved Annie Hall and some of Allen's other films more than this one, I think this is his best combination of comedy and philosophy.  I would strongly recommend this to any fan of Russian history, comedy, philosophy, or Woody Allen.",9,39,50,14 February 2004
Annie Hall," Good, but probably overrated
","I am an ardent fan of Woody Allen, and I think most of his films are underrated.  However, this is one of the few movies he did where the critical response was probably a bit too favorable.  Not to say that this isn't a good movie, but Allen has made many better films, including 'Love and Death', 'Interiors', and the very comparable 'Manhattan.'  Still, who am I to say that popular opinion is wrong?  Allen deserves acclaim; this just wouldn't have been my pick as his 'masterpiece'.",6,3,6,14 February 2004
