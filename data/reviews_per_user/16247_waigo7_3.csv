Your Name.," A movie for the heart
","There is a oftenly uttered (I cannot name it as a cliché) sad notion: If you lose someone when you are little or if a very long time passed since that moment, you cannot remember who that person was. That is how i fell about my grandmothers. I can't remember how they sounded like, what did they like, why they were angry. I can only remember vague things like how would one prepare a meal or how would other frown over my misbehaviour. These thoughts makes me feel sad and a little bit lost.
I followed this train of thought when i watched this movie. Japanese movies and animes usually follow these kinds of uncanny but strong sentiments and when done right(not too streched thin like in long-running animes), it is bullseye. Those men now how to manipulate my feelings. I have felt seperation and forgetting something i longed for.
It had some dorky and pervy humor of animes, some metphysical aspects to complete the recipe and at the end we had an emotionally moving piece to enjoy.",9,2,3,26 July 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," A bit uneven but a very good animation
","This review might include spoilers which i beleive would spoil the fun you will have by watching it.I love cartoons and animations. It was a risky move in my opinion to widely broadcast an animated feature which is not the strong suit of Marvel side. Furthermore, the main character is the new Spider-man, Miles Morales. An average movie-goer would have no idea who he is and why Peter Parker is not Spider-man and why am I watching an alternative timeline referencing to the Spider-man movies that i watched. It all seemed irrelevant because the movie was very entertaining. Besides, I think Marvel cheated in a way by doing this, feeding from the vast legacy of the comics instead of biulding a movieverse like their other counterparts do.
Scenes out of comics, awesome; some meta interactions with the narrative aspect of the film, also awesome; Humor, götümü yararcasina funny; Story, it has ups and downs both in quality and pacing. I would have liked to see more basic heroic stuff done by Morales and his time in his new school. It was nice to see some parts in the movies originated from the comics straight out like his first costume(Halloween) and death of the original spider man by the hand of almost green goblin(asist ona yazilabilir). Glad to see spider-ham and felt he was a bit underused(but he has his moments). Some moments felt a bit forced(call back before old Peter parker goes back to his dimension or Old Peter parker and spider gwen's appreciation of Miles' agility at the climax of the film)Overall, the movie might be better in some aspects than any other Spider-man film roaming around the world but personally, I enjoyed Homecoming more. (and maybe Spider-man 2)",8,2,11,14 December 2018
Heat," Best Heist Movie in my opinion
","This review includes some soft spoilers about the relationships between the characters and some detailed explanation of the synopsis. It is more focused on my sentimental impressions and I do not think it spoils any fun you will possibly have by watching this film.
It's been 4 years since I watched it so i may not remember the vivid details but i clearly remember De Niro's stoic appearence; Sizemore,why can't we see him anymore?; Val Kilmer's 15 minute period of handsomeness in some time 90s and that neo-Nazi Waingro.
It was one of the movies that showed a well-thought action which was fairly new in Hollywood. Actually, action widely meant trade of blows between the protagonist and any henchmen until script demands to continue in that era until there were some attempts to be more detailed like Top Gun with the flight sequences and unfortunately i cannot think of any other example right now. The heist scenes were detailed, organized, and easy to follow to entertain and enjoy them. I like to watch complex and planned things portrayed realistically and any film that manages to do that will be loved and maybe be fanboyed by me.
Wasn't exactly a fan of Al Pacino's overacting but loved the dynamic between him and De Niro. That was the only thing i may criticise but not enough to drop a point.
As i told before loved De Niro's stoic appearance and loved his relationship with the woman. It was beautiful and moving in a film with cold-hearted nature.
Many told it was one of the influences of Dark Knight in its portrayal of heists and in its no-nonsense, never even grinning manner(except Joker). It is a great film to be taken example.
In conclusion, do not be afraid of its running time and watch some skills of this wonderful cast and Michael Mann.",10,3,3,26 July 2018
