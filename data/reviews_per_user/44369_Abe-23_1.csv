Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Best, but not the best
","This movie really is the best I have seen in my life, I think is the best of the star wars saga, the plot was fantastic, the effects, the music, everything, the only thing that wasn't perfect was Jake Loyd acting, that did upset me up, but it don't care, this movie is the best, but some people don't like it, I guess that is because, they don't know that this movie is for kids.Go for it George.-",9,7,9,20 August 1999
