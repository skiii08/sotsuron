First Man," Boring and shaky, with unlikeable characters
","This movie was a nightmare to watch on a cinema screen. It's filmed entirely without a stabilizer and every single shot is shaky. After 1 hour of shaky close-ups and nothing happening I left.I don't understand this movie. We all know how it's going to end, so I was expecting the storytelling to be good. Instead it was frustrating.I'm not American, maybe that's the problem? I didn't like any of the characters, and this movie almost made me wish the Russians had succeeded before them! The characters are mostly American astronauts, all white men from the 60s, either geeks with no social skills, or successful engineers very full of themselves. But they all have one thing in common: they have no sense of humor whatsoever, and they are all boring/annoying. Almost as annoying as the shaky camera.",2,9,16,20 October 2018
A Quiet Place," Favorite movie of 2018
","I found this movie incredible. It had amazing characters, a great plot, enough information to not have us confused but enough mystery to keep us guessing.I was attached to the characters and hoped they would not die. They behaved in a relatable way, in a 'normal' way for a horror movie.There were a few actions that I had to question (like in every sci-fi movie) but the acting and story was so great that it doesn't matter.",10,0,1,20 October 2018
