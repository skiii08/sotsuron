It," Amazing adaptation that had me jumping in my seat!
","I have been awaiting the premier of IT not so patiently ever since I saw they were remaking my favorite Stephen King book and movie. Before I saw this adaptation, I read the reviews from it's opening night. I was surprised at the many 1 reviews I saw. It was as though people absolutely loved it or absolutely hated it. Many said it was essentially a comedy, not a horror movie. I love horror movies and was eagerly awaiting IT, hoping to finally find the movie that could not only startle me with jump scares, but actually scare me. After reading so many negative reviews I was skeptical. So after seeing IT on the Grand Screen at my local theater, I am extremely pleased ( and rather ashamed) to report that IT made me, for the first time in my life, actually yell out in fear! I actually girl screamed (not actually a scream, but close enough) for the first time ever at a horror movie! The humor that was spoken of in reviews I felt was actually appropriate humor for the age of the kids and what they were dealing with. It felt authentic to how kids would talk to each other. There were many jump scares, including the big one that made me shamefully yell, lol. Bill Skarsgard did an amazing job as Pennywise. I was originally disappointed when Will Poulter was unable to continue in the role, and was uncertain of Skarsgard, but man, he blew me away. He is utterly creepy, and you can see how he can lure kids (when he first talks to Georgie), while at the same time he exudes a confident, almost lazy evil its so natural, that appears to be unstoppable. The casting of the kids was well done. And unlike the TV version, they try to use an actual weapon, instead of two earrings and a slingshot, which always seemed completely far-fetched and a total underestimation of Pennywise. Finn Wolfhard is great as Richie, I loved Jack Dylan's take on Eddie, making him a little more brave and witty. Nicholas Hamilton is a great Henry, making you hate him, then make you understand where all his rage comes from.I do wish they had included the werewolf and mummy scenes from the original, but understand it was cut by the studio for budgetary reasons. ?? And we didn't get much of a backstory for Ben Hanscomb. All in all though, I was thrilled with this installment and cannot wait for Chapter Two! Amazing job!",10,8,16,11 September 2017
Warrior," I was blown away by this movie
","This movie is not in my usual genre. I'm not big on watching drama movies, having had enough of it in my own life.
I had never see. Joel Edgerton or Tom Hardy in anything before.
As I i into got to the movie, I could certainly begin to relate with many situations and characters.I was drawn onto this movie with powerful intensity. I was riveted by everything. Nick Nolte as the repented alcoholic father touched me. My father was an alcoholic who never repented or tried in any way, so I sympathized with his character, while also sympathizing with the brothers pain and anguish over what his drinking did to their family.I was deeply moved by the rift in the brothers relationship. Another relatable situation. I felt myself pulled deeper and deeper to the characters, expertly acted by all three actors. They did so well I literally get every bit of anger and pain.The end fight was the most powerful, emotional scene in a movie. It ranks very high for me for the top spot. The music chosen was superb to capture the essence of the brothers relationship and catharsis. It was violent, and harsh and rough, but there was a beauty to it and a real, honest human element that many of us can relate to.Again, not normally my kind of movie, this has become one of my favorites and is on the top shelf of my movie case.Beautifully acted, beautifully shot, beautifully directed. It did not receive the recognition it deserved",10,4,5,24 April 2019
