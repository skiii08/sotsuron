E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," 'I'll...be...right...here.'
","This was the first movie I ever saw at the movie theatre and also one of my first memories in my life. I remember going to the Aztec Theatre to see E.T. with my mom, dad and sister. I was in my dad's arms as we joined the long line who had come that night to see the newest Steven Spielberg film. I suppose I have Speilberg to thank first for my undying love of films.What Spielberg created from a script by Melissa Mathison was to me pure movie magic and a film with one of the biggest hearts in film history. A young boy named Elliot (Henry Thomas) has found an alien and almost right from the start they have an especially deep connection. Elliot finds that he must assist his new friend and try to send him back to his own planet.Amazing direction and storytelling mixed with great visuals and interesting sounds. John Williams also has a fabulous score that really belongs among the conversation about the best movie scores of all time. ET won four Oscars including Sound, Visual Effects, Sound Effects Editing and Music. Carlo Rambaldi as well gets a big thumbs up from me as he grabbed an Oscar for his work on ET. He had previously a few years earlier had worked on Ridley Scott's ALIEN and did work on the head of that alien. Two very different aliens though. The effects of the alien in this film are great and kids should love it.This film also was not just a little influential for the TV show STRANGER THINGS. ET was a monster of a flowing river of inspiration to that show. When it came out it was the highest-grossing film of all time until Spielberg outdid himself in 1993 with JURASSIC PARK.The acting in this film is great as well especially from the kids. Elliot has two siblings in Michael (Robert McNaughton) and Gertie (Drew Barrymore). It is to me through these three kids that the film must be carried when ET is off screen. They do a great job and bring quite believable performances. Also starring Dee Wallace as their mom, Peter Coyote and C. Thomas Howell in his film debut.On a final note I also owned the Atari game ET when I was a kid. Sorry, but awesome film, terrible game. It was one of the most frustratingly bad games I had ever played. Whenever I played the game it was out of the console within five minutes so that I could play a much better game like SPACE INVADERS.",9,2,2,17 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," 'There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.' 'You're going to die here, you know. Convenient.'
","Quite an amazing ending to the original trilogy. Little did I know when I was 9 years old watching this that this was not the ending to STAR WARS, but rather a door was open to create another 9 movies to date. This was my favourite film for a time being until I fell in love with another George Lucas creation in Indiana Jones.The group of rebels including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) to name a few are now off to the vile gangster Jabba the Hutt's palace. The bounty hunter Boba Fett has brought him his new prized possession in Han Solo (Harrison Ford) frozen in carbonite. Meanwhile, the Empire is recreating the Death Star and yep she is fully operational. So Luke must turn and face Darth Vader to complete his Jedi training and also save the universe.I truly love the first 45 minutes or so of this film and really to me out does the amazing battle on the ice planet of Hoth from THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. It really is an amazing way to open up a film. Quite action-packed. While there really are no boring moments in the rest of the film at times in a couple scenes it does seem to become dialogue heavy while there is very little visually going on. A very minor problem though, as it doesn't lessen the film really. Written by Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas with excellent score by John Williams.There are a couple scenes that were changed in 1997 that personally I prefer the original. First being a scene in Jabba's palace when in 1997 they added a couple very-CGI characters that sing a silly song. In this version it seems that the movie stops so it can go into a musical number. The second being the very end of the film. Even though the music in both versions are similar, I seemed to love the music from the original 1983 release. While the 1997 release added footage making it seem more universal.So, if you did enjoy the first two you must watch this one. You will likely enjoy just as much as the other two.",9,2,4,18 February 2019
Alien," 'The pit is completely enclosed. And it's full of leathery objects, like eggs or something.'
","Back in 1979 Ridley Scott brought us his second theatrical film in Alien and he does quite a job in only his second film. It feels weird rating the film lower than the average, but stating that it is highly recommended by me to anyone who loves horror or sci-fi. To me a 8/10 is still a great movie. And groundbreaking as well!A spaceship Nostromo is on a return flight to Earth. The 7 person crew lead by Tom Skerritt is awakened from their sleep early due to a transmission that they need to investigate. It is within this investigation that crew members come across a not so nice alien.Really has a terrific cast also including Sigourney Weaver in her powerful role as Ripley, Yaphet Kotto as Parker and John Hurt as Kane to name just a few. Jerry Goldsmith did the score and he really did create a wonderful, yet at times subtle or weird music score. H.R. Giger did spectacular work creating the look of the alien and the alien ship. Carlo Rambaldi was then brought in to create the head of the alien and one of its secret weapons. The film also does a great job with its use of sounds or concentration on a specific sound in its way to bring terror to the screen. A great scene where the use of sound is quite effective is the one where Harry Dean Stanton who plays Brett is looking for the cat Jonesy. Not exactly sure why there is a cat on a spacecraft, but it didn't seem to bother me too much.Now as well this film along with another Ridley Scott-great BLADE RUNNER has been ripped off so many times, but never equaled. Usually the rip-offs are stinkers. Last night I watched this film with my girlfriend. I have seen the film perhaps 20 times, but she had never seen it. She really enjoyed it, but perhaps through some of the ripoffs she has seen it was predictable for her. I must say though on my initial viewing (think I was 12 at the time) all the surprises were genuine for me. I would also place this film in the list of best Ridley Scott films. I must say though that I see some inspiration within the script written by the late Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett and direction from 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. Which is fine by me, because I believe that is greatest sci-fi film ever made. For example the use of having a computer running the ship and really in control of everything was not original. Here it is known as Mother in 2001 the computer was known as HAL. Even the crew not being aware of the full story or every detail on their assignment was not original either. That same thing happened in 2001. I feel I need to make these points, because I do believe O'Bannon and Shusett did create a great terror in space, but some of the plot points may have been borrowed from a groundbreaking sci-fi epic made 10 years prior. But, other things that happen in the film that are original have to do with the alien itself.Before ending this review though I must say Veronica Cartwright who plays Lambert in this film did a great job, because she truly looks terrified many times during this film. Also starring Ian Holm as Ash.So, if you are a horror fan or sci-fi fan I would strongly suggest checking this one out. You might love it more than I do. Then you can start on the countless sequels that follow and continue to be made to this day.",8,0,1,21 October 2018
Predator," One of Schwarzenegger's Best
","Right from the start we see cigar-chomping Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his dream team (including Jesse 'The Body' Ventura and writer/director Shane Black) are called upon by General Phillips (R.G. Armstrong) to rescue a cabinet minister from the depths of the Central American jungles. He also needs to bring along his old CIA-buddy Dillon (Carl Weathers) for the ride. This group is strong, tough, have monster firepower and just plain kick ass. Problem is they haven't faced the predator yet.Once the predator is revealed we witness a pretty amazing look that was created by Stan Winston and to me this was one of his greatest creations.Quite a great action movie that surprisingly to me was not exactly well-received when it was first released. To me really has an incredible pace that leaves you the viewer with your eyes attached to the screen.Directed by John McTiernan and he shows his skills off here creating a tight, action-packed film. This was just his second film and to me it is quite impressive what he did here. The music is done by Alan Silvestri and man is it ever great. It adds excitement and especially tension in scenes where needed.Followed by three sequels to date (not including a couple ALIEN VS. PREDATOR movies as well). But none of them really hit the stride that the 1987 original did.",9,0,0,3 December 2019
Aliens," What a Ride!
","Back in 1986 20th Century Fox released the first sequel to its 1979 sci-fi/horror-great Alien directed by Ridley Scott. This time James Cameron scripted and directed after his wonderful success in 1984 with The Terminator. Here Cameron has made a sequel that first does no harm to the original or the 'Alien' name in following that film and essentially leading us directly to this sequel. Secondly, in my opinion it brings the bar that Scott has left so high and brings it up another notch. To me this is something that does not happen very often. Interestingly, Cameron did it again when he made Terminator 2 (which to me was even better than the original). Co-written with Walter Hill (who directed the 48 Hrs. movies) and David Giler.Ripley (wonderfully played by Sigourney Weaver) is in deep sleep with Jonesy the cat after escaping the clutches of the alien from the original. She is found by a salvage team and woken up. Thing is she has been out for 57 years. The moon that she visited decades ago is now being colonized, but contact with them has dropped. In dealing with her own mental problems from her experiences in the first film she decides to join a group of marines to visit the moon and see what has happened.Like I did with the first film I watched this with my girlfriend who has never seen this film. In the end I think she loves this film as much as I do. I could tell there were a few scenes where terror took hold, but this is more aimed into the sci-fi/action/adventure genre where as the original was more sci-fi/horror.Also starring Michael Biehn as Corporal Hicks, Paul Reiser as Burke, Bill Paxton as Private Hudson and a really great performance from Lance Henriksen as Bishop. Weaver also got herself an Oscar nomination for her performance and I think she deserved it. In my opinion this film has the pinnacle of the Ellen Ripley character in her interactions with Newt (played by Carrie Henn), her desire to never give up and her ability to kick ass.Now, I own the Director's Cut version and would personally suggest viewing it. It does add 17 minutes of material and off the top of my head I can not think of a scene that really shouldn't have been added. Some times when extending the film from its original theatrical length can hinder the film a bit, but here in my mind it helps this film. It really gives you more character story or to me adds more meat on the bone. With the Director's Cut it clocks in at over two and a half hours, which to me is sometimes a breaking point on how long your film should be. But, to me it never begins to push you to a point of wondering when the film will end. Highly recommended.",9,1,3,30 October 2018
The Green Mile," 'Please boss, don't put that thing over my face, don't put me in the dark. I's afraid of the dark.'
","Writer/director Frank Darabont returns after the amazing THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION to enter the same setting; the American prison system. Although like SHAWSHANK based on a Stephen King novel it is a very different film.An old prison guard named Paul Edgecomb (Dabbs Greer) spins a fabulous yarn about his younger years when he was running 'The Green Mile' which was death row in Louisiana. Really it is about his meeting with a new inmate in John Coffey (great performance from Michael Clarke Duncan who was nominated for an Oscar).This is not your ordinary Stephen King movie. It is not in the realm of horror, but the character of John Coffey is a very King character to me. Something rare in film happens here. It may happen on a much more regular role in books, but in film you generally have 2 hours to show your characters, show your plot and solve whatever problem happens in the film. This one runs at over 3 hours and never seems to be long, drawn out or too long. The rare thing is all major characters are really fully developed before you really know much about John Coffey. All characters are running when Coffey's character and story take over the film. It takes some major ingredients to do that; time, great acting, great direction and a great story.Tom Hanks is amazing as the younger version of Paul Edgecomb and is surrounded by some great talent as well with the likes of David Morse as his working companion Brutal, Sam Rockwell as the crazy inmate Wild Bill, Graham Greene as inmate Arlen Bitterbuck and Harry Dean Stanton as the kooky Toot-Toot just to name a few. As well I think Doug Hutchison does an incredible job playing a character such as prison guard Percy. You should grow to hate him and perhaps not show him any sympathy as his character reaches a horrifying and ironic end.So, you don't need to be a Stephen King fan or Tom Hanks fan to really enjoy this film (even though I would consider myself in both of those camps). You just need to enjoy character driven and interesting stories.",9,0,0,4 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," 'I find your lack of faith disturbing.'
","Right from an amazing, quite epic opening where after the 20th Century Fox fanfare we are introduced with the STAR WARS logo rocketing through space. What follows is a crawl giving you the viewer some small needed information before watching the film. I do believe it is quite ingenious and ever since whenever it happens in other humorous films you know exactly what they are parodying.While I was not even alive when the original STAR WARS film came out, I did see it in the mid-80s and was always a fan of the original three STAR WARS films. Back in 1977 writer/director George Lucas created what is now a cash cow of an idea coming from a galaxy far, far away. This film is really quite amazing in showing both imagination in storytelling and innovations in effects.If you are one who has not seen the film yet, while this is the fourth installment in these series of films, I actually would suggest watching this one first.Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) has the secret plans to destroy the Death Star, which is a new operational massive space station run by the evil Empire. Darth Vader (body of David Prowse, voice of James Earl Jones) is on a death hunt in search of these plans. Leia has put them into a machine or a droid named R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) who with another droid named C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) must go search for Obi-Wan Kenobi (well played by Alec Guinness) to assist in this fight against the Empire. In addition a young farmer who dreams of joining the Rebel Alliance named Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), a cocky smuggler named Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his gigantic, hairy co-pilot named Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) also join in on the fight.I think of this film as almost like a western set in space. Meshed with one of the greatest scores of all time by John Williams that gets images flying through my mind when I hear it. I truly believe the original deserves all the acclaim it has received. Now, there are a few things that are negative about the film. One would be while there are some excellent lines of dialogue some of it though comes across as clunky to me. In addition back in the late 90s Lucas went over the originals and added some new effects to them. Really in my mind freshening up the effects was an excellent idea, but adding new scenes didn't really work for me. One in particular with a CGI Jabba the Hutt that just doesn't work, even though you do get a glimpse of Boba Fett.Also starring horror legend Peter Cushing as big baddie Grand Moff Tarkin. Like every role I have seen him in he does quite a good job.The likes of Rick Baker (worked on AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON), Rob Bottin (THE THING) both worked in the make-up department and Dan O'Bannon (who co-wrote the original ALIEN script) worked on the visual effects crew for this film.Anyways, I give it a strong 9 out of 10 and would suggest to anyone who likes a little adventure as this film is filled with it. Followed by numerous sequels, which almost all are at least worth giving a watch.",9,0,0,10 February 2019
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," 'No. Try not. Do...or do not. There is no try.'
","Three years after George Lucas changed cinema with his 1977 mega hit STAR WARS its first sequel came out. To me this is the best of the whole series of films so far containing both secrets and the introduction of a few great characters to be added to the list of STAR WARS cast. To me as well this film sits only behind Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY in space stories put on screen.Darth Vader (David Prowse, voice of James Earl Jones) is on the hunt for the Rebels. It looks like he has found them, so the Rebels are on the run to escape his clutches. Han Solo (wonderfully played by Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) bring along Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) within the Millennium Falcon (which gets a lot of screen time in this film). Meanwhile Luke (Mark Hamill) is of the Dagobah system in search of Yoda (voice of Frank Oz) to continue his Jedi training.This film is different than the original and really is much darker as the title of the film suggests. John Williams is back and with new themes like the amazing 'Imperial March' he has an even richer score than the original. I do believe Lucas did the right thing in bringing in two excellent screenwriters in Leigh Brackett and later Lawrence Kasdan. I have no idea who came up with what idea, but I am glad Lucas got some fresh perspectives and perhaps ideas to infuse into his space epic. As well as having veteran director Irvin Kershner direct the sequel. This film has everything a STAR WARS fan loves.Also starring Billy Dee Williams who is pretty cool as Lando Calrissian...until Chewie gets ahold of him and look fast for John Ratzenberger who plays Major Derlin.",10,0,0,13 February 2019
Back to the Future," Great Scott!
","Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale wrote a screenplay back in the 80s that was having troubles getting made. Due to earlier projects such as I WANNA HOLD YOUR HAND, 1941 and USED CARS all did not light up the box office. Once Zemeckis made ROMANCING THE STONE people in Hollywood were looking more at this writing duo and their projects. Thank God, because this was one of the best trilogies ever made!Within the first 10 minutes or so of this film we see Marty McFly (excellently played by Michael J. Fox) back in 1985. He has a super-dorky dad (Cripsin Glover), drunk mom (Lea Thompson) and two older siblings (Marc McClure, Wendie Jo Sperber) who are no longer at high school, but still live at home. Not to mention his band The Pinheads were silenced at an audition for being just too darn loud. At my prom it would have been amazing to have them rock the night away. After we see the first 10-15 minutes of the film it really does start to pick up and we are introduced to his friend Doc Brown (wickedly played by Christopher Lloyd and could be his best part in his career). He has just invented a new time machine. To make a long story short McFly ends up in the time machine and travels back to 1955 when his parents were in high school. So, he has to meet the younger Doc Brown and have him send him back to the future. At the same time not trying to meet his parents or screw up their relationship in any way.This really is a terrific sci-fi/comedy from 1985 that lets your imagination soar, laughter fly and emotions ride. Spawned two sequels that were also great. Also has quite an amazing score by Alan Silvestri that is in fact one of my favourites. Also has some great original tunes by Huey Lewis & the News.Also starring Thomas F. Wilson who is amazing as the bully Biff and his three thug friends J.J. Cohen, Casey Siemaszko and Billy Zane. Totally a need-to-see for anyone who likes a little bit of sci-fi, because even though it is really based on time travel the sci-fi elements are not overwhelming. I have watched this and its sequels endless times over the years since I first seen it over 30 years ago. Highly recommended.",9,0,0,19 November 2018
