The Avengers," Excellent.
","This IS a well made summer blockbuster.The characters are interesting, the acting is great and the script is able to be fun, but also deep and well written, it has everything you may ask for an action movie and even more.Joss Whedon does an amazing work with the script; the acting, specially from Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo and Tom Hiddleston is Top Notch. The film builds tension during the first two act to culminate in an amazing climax, were the visuals are incredible.It's basically a role model. Like Star Trek in 2009, it can probably inspire a new wave of blockbusters which can be smart without being pretentious, powerful without being dark.It's an amazing film and I would recommend anyone to watch it.",10,11,22,16 December 2012
