Marie Antoinette," Pants!
","Pants Pants Pants, Had to resort to Wikepedia to properly understand what happened to them both. The film was completely devoid of any engagement, and was utterly pants!! Not even worth considered analysis.But since I have to write 10 lines of text I'll fill it with how bad spider man 3 was. Oh, the common factor was... Ms Dunst again! As convincing a spoil to a boy bitten by a spider as she was as the missus to the almost impotent king of France.By the way as an aside I have never come across such a difficult site for posting reviews, I guess this is the downside for low cost, low service. This will be my 4th attempt, the last one got chucked back for the words 'daa dum'",3,2,5,2 June 2007
