Iron Man 3," A good Tony Stark movie
","I remember that after seeing the first trailer I was thrilled about the Mandarin and new suits. HOwever, after finally watching Iron Man 3, I was a bit confused.Don't get me wrong,it is a darn good movie, but I feel like some things were played out in a wrong way. In example, Mark 42 was supposed to be the most advanced suit of all. It was funny to watch all the glitches Tony had with that suit, but I was really disappointed how fragile the suits after Mark 7 became. In Avengers Mark 6 withstood a lightning attack from Thor, but here the suit is destroyed in an accident with a truck - c'mon on guys (it was funny, but stupid for Stark).The main idea of movie being set a few months after the Chitauri invasion of New York and Tony Stark is haunted by the experience, having nightmares, panic attacks and staying up all night tinkering with his inventions was neat.Somehow, I am under the impression that this movie shouldn't have been called Iron Man 3, but Tony Stark - The Motion Picture. In my opinion, we see too much of Stark and too little of Iron Man. On the other hand, I was expecting to see more of Tony's tinkering around the suits, as in the first one when he was building his Mark 2 and its boosters and exteriors.The take on Mandarin was new and surprising. However, I don't think the incarnation did justice to the character. I was expecting the Mandarin to be the true leader of the Ten Rings that kidnapped Stark in the first one, but no. I somehow hope that the real Mandarin will show up in later Iron Man or Avengers films.The ending itself was great and unexpected, no matter what people say. Tony Stark will always be Iron man. But I somehow don't get the fact how Tony managed to cure Pepper. That should have been elaborated - did he upgrade the Extremis or what, and will he use it on himself in Avengers 2 or Iron Man 4? Who knows. However, Tony is a great tech maniac, not a chemist.to conclude, I would give the movie 8/10",8,1,5,4 May 2013
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Not the movie we longed for, but ultimately fun to watch
","People who are reviewing this movie with 6 stars and below are obvious spoilers or at least narrow-minded. This movie is quite entertaining and a visual masterpiece. Furthermore John Williams delivers another great movie score.However I must totally agree with Mark Hamill on utterly hating on how the writers dealt with the character of Luke Skywalker. In the OT he was never a classic Jedi because he used his emotions to a certain amount, but now he keeps the ancient Jedi temple and scrolls safe, but at the same time resents Jedi for being egoistic and ultimately wrong about the Force. He does not seem like the Luke we all once knew and loved.Furthermore Leia was always Force sensitive, but couldn't wield it, but now she can somehow use the Force to bring herself back into the spaceship she was blown out of. Moreover the ease of defeating Snoke and not revealing his origin whatsoever is ridiculous. Not to mention Rey's origin, which kept us wondering for the past two years was a real letdown to me. Kylo Ren is still a whiny little b*tch but somehow evolves a bit, but still not enough to be considered a real threat and a heir to Darth Vader.In conclusion probably the thing that bothered me the most is too much of humor that I sometimes felt as I was watching a Star Wars parody instead of a new chapter in a longtime saga. SW always had some humor, but this amount kind of swept all the seriousness away fro the movie. All in all a fun movie to watch, but ultimately didn't meet my high expectations.",7,0,2,17 December 2017
Furious 7," A movie to remember and a truly emotional farewell to Brian/Paul
","I've seen it today and I was blown away. It's truly action packed, filled with exotic and muscle cars, fight scenes etc. CGI of Paul was really good, which amazed me, since I feared it would look more like Terminator Salvation Arnold.Furious 7 is a movie worth watching because of excellent action scenes, great acting, good story and a lot of cameos for all the franchise fans. Even though I have to admit that quite a lot of action sequences seem unreal and crazy, you have to remember that this is fiction and a movie after all.There are also a few funny scenes and most of all a very nice send-off and tribute to Paul. The final scene brought tears to my eyes, which is a hard thing to do.R.I.P. Paul Walker, gonna miss you bro",8,74,94,2 April 2015
