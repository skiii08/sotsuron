United 93," United 93 hijacked
","Based on the true story of United 93 which was the fourth plane hijacked on 9/11 the film is dedicated to both those who died except the terrorists and the families and friends of those who were killed. Paul Greengrass had done a great job directing this film and it was the way he directed it that made it felt the hijacking was actually happening instead of everyone acting.The film opens with four al-Qaeda Arabs preparing to hijack a plane United 93 headed for California from New York. The passengers who wait at the gate with the four thugs will not know that they will never see their loved ones again and ironically one of the passengers Tom Burnett who is perhaps the film's main protagonist sits beside pilot and ring leader Ziad Jarrah the main antagonist of the film and the pair would go on and end the film as they both fight over the yoke.Once in the air at 35, 000 feet the terrorists hijack the plane. While Ziad Jarrah and co pilot Saeed al-Ghamdi are in the cockpit the other two Ahmed al-Nami and Ahmed al-Haznawi hold the passengers hostage. Despite this the passengers knowing they will die if they don't do nothing fight back. Despite killing the two men and overpowering Jarrah and al-Ghamdi the former manages to crash the plane instead of heading for the Capitol.The film I think was probably slightly different than it happened in real life to make it more dramatic. I also think the hijackers especially al-Nami were criminally insane as he went as far as trying to hit the passengers with a food trolley and using a fire extinguisher.I honestly think this was a great film full of terror and heroism.",10,0,2,28 December 2014
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A New Hope part 1
","Forget calling this film Rouge One this film should be dubbed A New Hope part 1. This film more or less is actually the appetiser for the main course directed by George Lucas. As mentioned in the opening crawl of the 1977 version Rebel spies have stolen plans of the Death Star and the film leads directly to the start of the original trilogy.What I liked about the film was the return of the Death Star, Tarkin who looks his normal self despite Peter Cushing now deceased and of course the return of the one and only Darth Vader.However the film was not without it's disappointment as there was no opening crawl. The film begins with the infamous A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away before it simply cuts to the action. The biggest annoyance however was that the Death Star was operational the whole time in the film. It was not supposed to be able to fire with it's laser beam until A New Hope. I bet George Lucas would be angry and if I was him I would sue Gareth Edwards for every penny he had as that is a huge plot hole in my opinion.Despite that the film was not all bad as we finally see how the plans were stolen and we finally get a true prequel to A New Hope. I only gave it 5 stars as it had it's good and bad points and was not as great as the main Star Wars films.",5,20,43,15 December 2016
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," End of an Era. Start of a new Era.
",I got to admit this film was not the best Star Wars film but it is not the worst one either. In fact this was the best film of the sequel trilogy and just like Harry Potter it marks the end of an era for a film franchise we all and loved.In the film Palpatine like Voldemort was thought to be dead but he comes back and like Voldemort wanted to rule over the Muggle and Harry Potter's world Palpatine wants to rule the galaxy under his own tyranny and to do that he pressures Rey who his granddaughter (like how Luke Skywalker was revealed to be Vader's son) to kill him so he can process her and make her Empress. Palpatine is finally killed and the war which started before The Phantom Menace finally concludes.It was a great end to the saga and we see characters from over the decades appear in the film such as Ewoks and even Jawas as well as a cameo by Lando. We also get to hear the soundtracks from the previous films too especially Return of the Jedi.Maybe the film has ended the storyline which spanned 42 years but I think we will get a new trilogy in a few years that will see another possible war be on the brink of happening. Rey showing her yellow lightsaber possibly hints another trilogy is on the cards. I mean it is Star Wars for crying out loud and as the last word implies war never ends in Star Wars. Just because Palpatine died it only ended a conflict. It doesn't necessarily stop another war from happening.If they do another trilogy and I reckon they will it should focus on the events that take place after this film and that unrest is occurring in the galaxy. I think in Episode 10 Rey as a Jedi is assigned with a Padawan learner to prevent a war that is about to break out. Episode 11 should focus on the war that does break out and in Episode 12 it should involve the climax and Rey and her Padawan finally putting an end to the war and once for all. If they do a Star Wars 10 the title should be Star Wars A New Order.,10,2,11,24 December 2019
Inside Out," One of the worst and boring Disney films period!
","I have not seen every Disney Pixar film. The ones I have watched are the Toy Story films, Monsters Inc and it's sequel Monster University, a Bugs Life, Cars, Finding Nemo & The Incredibles. The ones I have not seen are Wall-e, Ratouttlie, Brave, Cars 2 and The Good Dinosaur. Most of the ones I seen were either great or not bad. My favourite Disney film is the Lion King followed by the Jungle Book (1967) and Pinocchio. But this film is one of the worst and boring Disney films I have ever seen!The film is about a little girl named Riley who moves to a new home in San Franscisco after her dad gets a new job and her mind is controlled by a group of creatures known as 'emotions' who get her through everyday life but two of them Joy and Sadness end up in the bowls of Riley's mind where old memories are stored and without them especially Joy Riley's life is misery at home and school.This film was just awful. This film may be family friendly but the film is nothing like a film for children. There is very little comedy and is more adult-themed than the other Pixar films. It is my opinion also that this film shares similarities to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, The Exorcist and The Land Before Time. Like in Snow White the emotions have names matching that of their personality. For example Joy is all happy and optimistic while Sadness is like Eeyore by being downright miserable. Like Regan McNeil of The Exorcist Riley is processed in her mind but by the emotions and not a demon named Pazuzu while her parents and presumably everyone in the film are also processed by emotions. The film's sub plot where Joy and Sadness try to get back to headquarters is a throwback to the Land Before Time where Littlefoot and his friends try to find the Great Valley. I also felt the film was rushed and none of the characters apart from Riley, Joy and Sadness get much screen time. Even Anger, Fear and Disgust hardly get involved in the film. Disgust arguably was the emotion who got demoted to extra.The film was as I said rubbish and how people loved this film has left me stumped. To me this film does not deserve a sequel as this film is just not good enough for one.",1,414,911,10 January 2016
The Lion King," Disappointed!
",I had been looking forward to watching this film for months and months. And when I finally got to see it I was just disappointed. When the film started I was at first awed by the breath taking CGI effects. The animals and the surroundings looked so very realistic. And the opening song Circle of Life was great but not great as the original film. Obviously the film is a direct remake of the 1994 classic we all know and love. Once again we see Mufusa die and we see Simba befriend Timon and Pumbaa.But this film was just plain awful. Obviously because this is not a cartoon the animals lacked emotions and I even felt James Earl Jones was disappointing as Mufusa. He simply did not sound natural enough like he was in 1994 although he is understandably elderly now. Chiwetel Ejiofor was not bad as Scar but he was nowhere as good as Jemery Irons. Even Beyonce was terrible as Nala.I also felt the film was rushed. For example the scenes between Simba and Rafiki was shortened and Mufusa never said as much as a ghost as he did in 1994 and it was annoying we never seen his ghost.I really wanted to like this film but I sadly felt Jon Favreau ruined one of the greatest Disney films of all time. I will watch it again as I did not hate it but I never enjoyed it very much either.,3,10,14,22 July 2019
1917," The best World War I film of all time
",This is in my opinion the best film on WW1. The film centres on two young men who are tasked to deliver a message to another Battalion on the Western Front and the two friends hike through the mud and craters littered with bodies and debris but one of the men gets killed causing the other to travel alone.The film was rich in detail about the war and it gives you a rough idea in your mind's eye about what life was like in the trenches. I found the film very frightening in bits especially seeing the bodies and the tense action in the war.But Sam Mendes did a great job bringing The Great War to life.,10,0,2,4 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Worst Star Wars film ever.
",George Lucas you had better be pleased with yourself. This film was the worst one I have ever seen in the Star Wars franchise. I totally regretted seeing this film. I just wished I saved my money. This film was not worth watching and I hate to see what IX will bring. Disney has nothing but ruined Star Wars. Even the prequels including Attack of the Clones was not as rubbish as this.Set right after the events of the Force Awakens Rey does her Jedi training with Luke Skywalker but he fears she will suffer the same fate as his former apprentice Kylo Ren. Elsewhere the Resistance continue their struggle against the First Order as the war continues between both sides.This film was both Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi all rolled into one from Rey doing training on a deserted planet to Rey meeting Snoke a la Luke Skywalker meeting Palpatine and like Vader killing Palpatine Kylo Ren kills Snoke but does not repent however. Like Vader Kylo Ren offers Rey to join sides with him and rule the galaxy together. And I felt Mark Hamill was a disappointment. He played one of the main heros in the franchise and we only get less than 20 minutes of him and he dies and becomes one with the force like Obi Wan Kenobi. To be honest I wanted the film to end. It was a hash remake of the last two films of the original trilogy and having a lack of key characters was simply dreadful. JJ Abrams may as well had directed this piece of crap especially how he directed the Force Awakens and will also direct Episode IX. If you want to see great Star Wars films just stick to the original trilogy and even the prequels. In my opinion the sequel trilogy is going to be worse than the prequels.,4,1,3,18 December 2017
Beauty and the Beast," The way the film should had been in 1991
","Well the film may only be released just over a quarter of a century after the original version but it certainly is a much better movie than the the original.Pros Cast made of some well known movie celebrities, Brilliant visual effects, some plot holes and puzzles from original film answered.Cons To similar to the original film, a bit to dark for children, songs not as great as the original film.Well when I learned via internet back in 2015 a live action remake of Beauty and the Beast was going to be made I was simply over the moon. I am a guy and even though like Frozen and the recent Cinderella movie it will mostly be girls that will be watching the movie I for one was not going to miss this flick and I am glad I seen it. I waited nearly 2 years for this film to be released and I kept thinking this film was never going to be released but I will download it when it is available via iTunes and I will see it again and again. I am a big fan of Beauty and the Beast and it is one of 2 Disney Princess movies I like the other being Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs which is apparently in the works to be a live action Disney movie as well. I grew up watching Beauty and the Beast that came out in 1991 the year I was born and I admit the original film may have been a bit to 'young' to get the live action treatment as it is nearly only 26 years old but we all know that most Disney cartoon movies are getting the live action treatment.I do agree with most critics the remake is simply a direct remake of the cartoon as Belle is a young girl who swaps places with her father Maurice in a castle the home of a prince who has been turned into a Beast and must win her love to break the spell before the last petal falls otherwise he will be cursed for entirety. There is of course Luimier, Cogsworth, Mrs Potts, Chip, Le Fou and of course last but not least the jock villain Gaston because after all 'Noone can be a villain in this film like Gaston'.In my opinion despite the film being to similar it is much better than the 1991 version and I swear to God Bill Condon has made the film the way it should had been in 1991. If Bill Condon was not going to be director my other choice would be Tom Hooper director of Les Misables as that musical was also set in France. I would had also considered Eddie Redmayne for the role of Beast but Dan Stevens did a great job as Beast. He did a terrific job singing the original song 'For Evermore' which I think should get a nomination next year for best original song. He sounded so much like Beast in the original film but I was slightly disappointed he did not speak to Belle when he returned to his human self. Emma Watson also did a great job as Belle except for the singing as that was not as great as Paige O'Hara's but she did a good job playing the main female character in the film. Luke Evans was not too bad but I felt he lacked the body-build Gaston had in the 1991 version but he was much more darker and evil in this film. I know a lot of people thought Le Fou was not that evil but in my opinion he was though not quite at the same level as his animated counterpart. Still both Luke Evans and Josh Gad showed great chemistry in the film but if I was to pick the actor to play Le Fou it be Ben Whishaw as he is gay in real life as was Le Fou in this film. The servants were alright but they never had a quite as a big a role in this film than the 1991 adaptation. For example Cogsworth and Chip don't get as much screen time this time around and I felt also Ewan MacGregor had more of a slight German accent than a French accent but he had fun playing Luimier . As for Mrs Potts her singing just was not as great as Angela Lansbury's for the theme song of Beauty and the Beast and I think either Julia Walters or Imelda Staunton could had replaced fellow Harry Potter star Emma Thompson for the role. Kevin Kline did a brilliant job as Maurice and had much more screen time than his cartoon counterpart.As I said the film was much better than the 1991 version but the songs especially Be our Guest and Tale as old as Time were just not the same as the original versions. As I mentioned Emma was not a great singer but she did a great job as Belle. What I did like was that she was simply stunning in her yellow ballroom dress. Emma simply looked like a cracker with her bare arms and her hair when she wore the dress. I did not like her peasant dresses very much but other than that she was stunning.As I said I thought the film was much better than the cartoon version as Condon made the film the way it should had been in 1991. We finally learn why the prince became rude and snobbish and unkind. We learn why Belle and Maurice moved to the village here named Villienueve after Belle's mother died in a plague and what I did like was that each time a petal fell the servants become less human.I would recommend this film to anybody and Bill Condon you did a brilliant job bringing this film to life.",10,1,10,21 March 2017
Sausage Party," The best R Rated comedy since Ted
","Sausage Party is arguably in my opinion the best R Rated comedy film since Ted. In fact I actually think this film is more of a Seth MacFarlane movie as this movie has all the kind of things you would find in Ted, American Dad and Family Guy such as violent slapstick, adult humour, crude stuff and drugs. At first glance the film looks like a typical Disney/Universal animated movie for kids but once Frank says 'Shit!' it turns out to be an adult movie.In the movie Frank a frankfurter, his girlfriend a bun roll named Brenda and the other foods hope to be chosen by customers to go to the 'Great Beyond' not knowing in reality they are in danger and are meant to be eaten alive by humans. Once the truth is found out Frank and his friends decide to protect themselves as well as get revenge on the humans. However a rejected douche named Douche wants revenge on Frank after he accidentally prevented him being used by a female customer for her vagina.The film wasn't the funniest comedy but if you love Ted and Family Guy you will probably love this movie. Only wish Seth MacFarlane was director.",7,2,5,8 January 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," 'Best since Original Trilogy the film is'
",First of all let me say one thing. Just one. No matter how good any Star Wars sequel film including this is one no other Star Wars film will ever be as famous or full of pop culture as the original. Even the Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi will not be as famous as the original. Because if it were not for the 1977 version we would not have Star Wars as it is today.Before I give a review I will briefly give away the plot; Set 30 years after the last film Return of the Jedi Luke Skywalker has gone AWOL and a new generation of warriors Rey and the repented Finn an ex storm trooper team up with Han Solo and Chewbacca to deliver a map to Leia so she can locate her missing brother but a new bad guy in the galaxy Kylo Ren will stop at nothing to get Rey and a new droid BB8 as war is re-freshened between the Light Side now called the Resistance and the Dark Side now known as the First Order.Now for my opinion on the film. I know that many of you think this film is either a remake of the original film or even a reboot. But I honestly believe that this film is not a remake because even though the film is similar to A New Hope the storyline is different. It is about Luke who has gone missing and a new droid BB8 has information on his whereabouts as well as Rey and Finn joining the light side. It is not a reboot because the film takes place after the events of the original trilogy. For those of you who think otherwise you should pay close attention when Kylo Ren spoke to Vader's charred mask which backs up the fact it is not a reboot. If it was a reboot Vader would not be mentioned and Luke and his friends would have to either start from scratch or not exist at all. The only 2 things that are similar are Jakku which could be Tatooine's sister planet as they both desert worlds and the Star Killer which is like the Death Star but more bigger and powerful. It was great to see Han Solo and Chewbacca again as it was not the same without them although it will not be Star Wars without Vader which is a pity as he was only mentioned. I think Kylo Ren is a much better villain than Vader as he is more agile and is stronger with the Force and his voice via the mask sounds more evil than Vader.The new film does make the Original Trilogy look a bit dated especially the technology and special effects which were not possible in those days. We do get a rough idea on how people including Bail Organa responded when Alderaan was destroyed as we see people in terror on another planet just before it is destroyed by Star Killer. The only thing I hate is that the Death Star blew up Alderaan in seconds but in this film it took much longer. The guy who played Bill Weasley in Harry Potter is more or less a young Tarkin while Kylo Ren's master is the new 'Palpatine'.The film is not the best in the series but it is the best Star Wars film since Return of the Jedi. The film was more modern and full of more action but the plot was a bit hard to follow to an extent. But as I said the original film will always be the number 1 Star Wars film forever.,10,55,126,21 December 2015
The Hangover Part III," The Hangover without a Hangover
","Hangover part 3 is one of my favourite comedy films along with Dumb and Dumber and it's sequel Dumb and Dumber TO, the Ted films, Stepbrothers and Due Date. It is not the best comedy film but it still has lots of laughs. The film is a bit strange because despite the title there is no hangover unless you count the post credits.Set four years after the previous film Doug gets kidnapped by Marshall a gangster after Chow stole his stolen gold and now the rest of the Wolfpack thanks to Alan getting drugs from Black Doug in the first film have 3 days to find Chow or else Doug dies.The film was as I said quite funny especially with Alan and Chow. Alan in my opinion is more or less the film version of Peter Griffin as both are obese, dim-wits, laid back, immature and childish but Alan I think is slightly more intelligent but just by a fraction. The film was funny at the start especially the funeral scene and Alan doesn't seem to give a damn that he actually caused his dad Sid to die due to his antics. Chow more or less stole the show and the film more or less was mostly about him just like how the Tigger Movie focused on Tigger.The film could have ended a bit better though especially as it is the finale of the series but still a funny film to watch.",8,0,1,7 January 2016
