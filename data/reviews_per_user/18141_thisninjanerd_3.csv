The Perks of Being a Wallflower," An adaptation that captures the heart of its novel. A roller-coaster of emotions.
","It's not everyday you get the author of an acclaimed novel to direct, write the screen play, and put his vision on the big screen. Readers of the book will be beyond pleasantly surprised by this outstanding adaptation. Chbosky doesn't have the best director status, but his passion for his craft makes this an astounding adaptation. Strong performances across the boards from the three leads (Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, and Ezra Miller), and it's supporting cast members (Mae Whitman, Nina Dobrev, Dylan McDermott, Joan Cusak, and Paul Rudd.) If you haven't read this book, the movie captures the feeling of high school, finding yourself, and finding friends. The movie captures the loneliness that happens for everyone in the high school experience. Prepare to laugh, smile, and cry. Just like high school, this movie is a roller-coaster of emotions.",9,1,3,20 November 2012
Silver Linings Playbook," What romantic comedies SHOULD strive to be like. An adaptation that beats its source material!
","Silver Linings Playbook is what all book adaptations should aspire to be like. Take a book that was good and turning it into a classic film. In the same vein as The Devil Wears Prada, Silver Linings Playbook outdoes its novel and creates a wonderful story and movie. The movie is close to the book to please fans but diverges enough to give you a fresh take and entertaining film. Even though I read the book, the movie kept me guessing and intrigued the entire time. The film wins with wonderful performances from Bradley Cooper, Jackie Weaver, Robert De Niro and Chris Tucker. A standout performance was given by Jennifer Lawrence, who reminds us why she was nominated for an Oscar before the Hunger Games. Jennifer Lawrence shows why the movie was rewritten to add her despite her age. The chemistry between the leads is impeccable. THIS is what romantic comedies should aspire to be. Real enough to deal with issues with a dramatic flair, but never forgetting their comedic undertones to provide the feel good feeling. I'm excited to see where this movie lands on award seasons.",9,3,10,20 November 2012
Pitch Perfect," Bring it on, but more advanced. Glee, but if Glee was more edgy, sarcastic, and sounded better.
","Bring it on, but more advanced. Glee, but if Glee was more edgy, sarcastic, and sounded better. If you're going to say this is Glee 2.0, you're sadly mistaken. This film combines wit, irony, sarcasm, and the talents of Rebel Wilson (who steals the show), Anna Kendrick (who continues to find her stride in good films) and a surprising turn from Brittany Snow. The supporting cast also does well to add onto the hilarity and delight of Pitch Perfect. If you're a fan of music and comedy, you'll love Pitch Perfect. The only digression for me would be the romantic sub-plot, which the predecessor (Bring It On) progressed better. A fun, witty, and entertaining film.",8,0,2,20 November 2012
