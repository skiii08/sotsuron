The Monuments Men," Terrific movie
","One of the 'untold' stories of WW2 told with accuracy and power. If you like a good detective story, you'll like this. If you like some of the 'smaller' stories of WW2, you'll love it. If you like some very thoughtful dialog, lines, without preaching, you'll enjoy this work, with solid acting, fine music and expressive cinematography. This movie gets my highest marks, and I'm a movie guy. As one reviewer noted, lots of folks walked out midway Â… can only say: I'm sorry for them. I suppose it was just too much work for them to engage with the depth of the story and the dialog.Oh well",Null,2,4,16 February 2014
