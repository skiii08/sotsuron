Your Name.," The greatest artistic accomplishment in all of human history.
","This is the first review I've ever written, mostly because I've never really felt the need to review a movie before I saw this. This movie is the most spectacular work of art I've ever seen, and probably will ever see in my entire life. Never have I ever seen or read anything that made me feel the characters' pain, and joy, and frustration like this. This movie (and saying that this is simply a 'movie' feels like I'm comparing the Mona Lisa to a toddler's fingerpainting) made me feel so much raw emotion that I was literally shaking (and occasionally crying) throughout every amazing second of it. The ending definitely leaves you wanting more, begging for even just an extra five minutes of the wonderful story. I wish that there could be more movies like this.",10,1,2,10 August 2018
