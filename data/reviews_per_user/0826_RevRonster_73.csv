Insidious: Chapter 2," Better than the first one...
","I didn't really care for the first movie. Other than two scenes that genuinely sent chills down my spine, I felt the movie was a messy, unbalanced affair with grating comedic relief and a third act that screamed, 'Is there a gas leak in my house and I'm hallucinating?' However, I found I really dug this one.While it's obvious that the film relies almost completely on the unimaginative and cheap jump scare, the movie proved to be scary than most horror films released thanks to an excellent creepy and unsettling tone that director James Wan crafted.The film also does a better job at working in the funny elements where they feel like they are assisting the story and the overall entertainment factor rather than working against it. 'Chapter 2' also ties together the two movies in super creative and unique ways that make the film feel like it should actually be a three hour epic horror film, rather than two separate movies.While this one isn't the scariest thing I've seen, I still really enjoyed it and found it creepy.Hey, like this review?

Million Dollar Arm," Predictable but okay
","I'm not really a sports guy. I don't watch the various sports that sporty people call sports-home nor do I really play the stuff. I'm more of the guy that sports people beat up and tease; however, that mockery hasn't made me jaded to sports dramas. Those things make me feel inspiredinspired to stay away from sports guys with looks of geek-beating in their eyes.'Million Dollar Arm' has an interesting story and a great cast so it felt like it would have been a sure thing for a great sports drama. Sadly, it only came out as a decent, mildly mediocre one due to the fact it's pretty formulaic and almost indistinguishable from so many other tales like this. While the story it's based on is still interesting and the film has a great cast giving off great performances and having some really fun moments throughout the film, it just doesn't pack the emotional punch it could have had. With the story and plot playing out exactly how one would predict and hitting all the notes in the obvious order, the film just doesn't have the impact it could have. It's enjoyable but not as moving as other sports dramas.",6,0,0,17 December 2014
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," A boring prelude to the (hopefully coming soon) action...
","I started out this franchise not really caring for the characters or the story but 'Catching Fire' did a fairly decent job of hooking me in. I was actually pretty excited for this onebut I was a bit let down with it.'Mockingjay – Part 1' is darker in tone and its political themes are nice but the film just feels like filler and a prelude to the real action. I appreciate how this one is basically gearing up for some big drama, conflict and action but it made for a film that feels like an extended first act of a bigger film. Add in that Katniss is not fully badass yet and spends most of her time blubbering and the fact the film is actively NOT showing action scenes and the final result is just a boring film that is sluggishly drawing itself out in order to potentially maximize Box Office Revenue. It's functional and serves a purpose but to be an entire film, it just felt like a boring waste of time.",4,4,6,29 April 2015
The Monuments Men," It could have been worse but it should have been better...
","On paper, this movie looks like a major hit. It's got George Clooney not only in the cast but on the writing department AND as director, it's has Bill Murray, Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett AND John Goodman, and it's based on a true story with that true story being about a group of men saving works of art from utter obliteration or occupation from the invading forces of WWII. That just sounds awesome.It was a little sad that it wasn't as good as it could have been.With its concept and cast, 'The Monuments Men' isn't that bad but it isn't as good as it could have—or should have—been. The biggest problem that kept me from really getting into this movie the way I wanted to was the fact the film felt very sloppy in its plot. There's no real tension or drama going on as the Monuments Men do their stuff and all their actions and activities feel sporadic and non-cohesive. Nothing they do in the plot feels like it is working towards any real major goal and it gives the film a feeling of being incomplete. Additionally, the lack of any real character development and an overall weak introduction to the characters didn't help either.I really wanted to like this film and, while it has some enjoyable moments with a great cast, the film just wasn't what my expectations were expecting it to be. While not overtly terrible, the film just wasn't as good as it had the potential to be.Hello, friends! The name is Rev.

The Equalizer," A bit boring but those action scenes...
","I was hoping that having Denzel Washington and the director of 'Training Day' onboard, 'The Equalizer' would have been epic. Sadly, it's not but it still is a must watch, in my opinion.Honestly, I thought the story to this one was pretty messy and way too boring in way too many parts. Additionally, the characters are pretty lackluster and don't really have much depth to them—well, most of them anyway. However, the acting is great and Denzel is just cold as ice in his role. But the true shining light in this film is the brutal and gritty action sequences. These parts break up the film's tedium and monotony extremely well and singlehandedly make the film something to watch.'The Equalizer' might not have ended up as intriguing and engrossing as I had hoped it would have been but watching a cold, calculating Denzel deal out justice with an icy stare makes the film something to take in.",6,0,0,23 January 2015
John Wick," Pure awesomeness!
",I wish I had the cash and the opportunity to see this one when it was in the theater over the summer because this movie was just entertaining as hell! I have no complaints about 'John Wick' because it is one of those perfect summer blockbuster flashy action flicks! Keanu Reeves is awesome as Wick and leads a cast of very talented people to play interesting and fun characters in a story that is simple but extremely effective. Add in the exciting action and fight scenes and this movie was awesome from beginning to end and just oozes adrenaline. It's a crime if we don't see more John Wick and this film doesn't spawn sequels.,10,5,11,13 February 2015
Gravity," Just awesome!
","I didn't get the opportunity to see 'Gravity' in the theaters because I'm usually busy fighting evil spirits who are trying to take over the world (you're welcome, by the way) and, secondly, it's expensive to see movies and I usually make sure my bills are paid for and I have groceries in the fridge before I think about hitting the theater. However, I kind wish I would have taken a day off from fighting those evil spirits and went on a Ramen Noodle diet for a few days in order to see this one in an IMAX theater and in 3D. However, even on the small screen, this movie proved to be too awesome for words.Alfonso Cuarón really created a movie that was unbelievably amazing and I can't think of a single thing that was wrong with it. The story is very simple but tossed into a new orbit thanks to it being in space, the acting from Sandra Bullock is incredible and she easily gets you to sympathize with her, worry for her and cheer for her survival, the editing and camera work is fluid and natural to the point it just consumed me into the action and the visuals are more amazing to look at than a dragon fighting a unicorn while surrounded by rainbows.There was, literally, nothing about this film that I didn't like. The moment it started, the film had me on the edge of my seat and 'Gravity' proved to be an amazingly awesome film that was absolutely terrifying at the same timeand I loved every second of it!

Lone Survivor," A lot better than what I was prepared for...
","'Lone Survivor' is a film that I left on the backburner for a bit for several reasons. Number 1) Mark Wahlberg is an actor that I will really enjoy in one role or completely be annoyed by in another. Number 2) I am not a fan of Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch, and Ben Foster (too bad that Foster's name doesn't also end with a 'sch.' I had a bit of a pattern going there). Number 3) The film is based on a true story of Marcus Luttrell's survival in a failed Navy SEALs operation and I was putting my money on the fact that Hollywood was going to take some insane liberties with it (the film was directed by Peter Berg and he directed 'Battleship'). Finally, Number 4) I kinda thought the film was going to be one giant cheerleading session about how great America is and that everyone in Afghanistan is a terrorist working for the Taliban.I was wrong on each of these concerns.First off, the entire cast—even the guys who I've never once seen a decent performance from (like Kitsch and Foster)—were absolutely incredible. The team had a very real chemistry and, more importantly, they all seem grounded and realistic. That last observation is a big deal considering this is the first time I've watched Ben Foster in a film where he isn't trying to chew on every bit of scenery he can find.Secondly, while the film does take some liberties with the story, the film is treated with a lot of respect and it really showcases the indomitable spirit of Marcus Luttrell—even though Mark Wahlberg's portrayal of him isn't even close to how really badass Luttrell was. Finally, going along with that whole respect thing, the movie isn't just one long fireworks display about how awesome our service men are. The movie is more about the men who were trapped behind enemy lines and cut off from all rescue. The film also stays away from Fox News-ing it up and will actually show that because someone is from the Middle East it doesn't mean they are a terrorist. The movie shows how Luttrell was sheltered by an Afghani village and protected from the Taliban. A fact like that was one of those liberties I feared was going to be taken but it wasn't and it made the film less about the war and more about the tale of survival—which is what is was meant to be.Overall, I was very surprised with how well constructed and how human 'Lone Survivor' was. Much better than I had originally predicted.",8,0,0,8 October 2014
Fury," Dramatic and filled with horrifying action and great performances...
","David Ayer wrote a war drama that is capable of being intense, horrifying, dramatic, and a visual feast that perfectly sets the tone and conditions of WWII. On paper, the film feels like it could be a tad formulaic and generic but the end product was something really intense and filled with great acting by the entire cast. Granted, my only complaints about the film are I wanted more development from a couple of the characters and due to its length and shocking visuals, I'm probably not going to watch this a lot in my lifetime and the replay value might be a tad low but, beyond this, I really dug the film.",8,4,8,27 March 2015
The Maze Runner," Darker and more exciting than I was ready for...
","Since I'm in my 30s, tween dystopian films don't speak to me like they do for the younger generation. However, they are big bucks and, until 'The Hunger Games' end or they just stop making money, there is no end in sight for them. Too bad too many of them look exactly the same'The Maze Runner' was pleasantly different.I had some reservations about this film but it proved to be more action-packed, more exciting, more dramatic, and a lot darker and grittier than I was prepared for. Not only was this a pleasant surprise that made the film a lot more entertaining, engaging, and intriguing but it also set the film apart from the usual, formulaic tween films that make up this specific subgenre. The only thing I really didn't care for in this film was the casting of Will Poulter. He isn't a bad actor but he just wasn't right for the role he was cast in.I thought 'The Maze Runner was going to be a generic, by-the-numbers formula that is too prevalent with the tween dystopian subgenre that is all the rage now but the film really set itself apart and the cliff hanger ending really has me pumped to see the next one.",8,6,10,26 December 2014
Star Trek Into Darkness," Pretty awesome...and that's coming from a guy who hates Star Trek
","I'm not a Trekkie--I don't even have a curious interest in Star Trek. I just could never get into the characters or stories. I'm a Star Wars guy! I gave the reboot a shot and didn't care for it but this one had Benedict Cumberbatch playing the villain all Trekkies will tell you is the greatest bad guy in existence (and I'll be honest, I don't understand why) so I gave the film a shot and I loved it! The story is decent, the action is fist-pumpingly awesome and the special effects will make your eyes bleed rainbows because they are so stellar. The film did, however, have some issues. There's plot holes that will drive the pretentious viewer and Trek purist insane with anger and the cast of characters felt way too big for me as most of the characters end up being haphazardly placed in the story and feeling completely out of place like the writers quickly wrote scenes for them so they don't go to waste.However, the complaints are minor in my opinion as the film is fun to watch and just plain exciting thanks to its action and Benedict Cumberbatch making a villain I once held firm was all hype and his lameness being painfully obvious and watching him turn that character into something cold, calculating and cool. Will this film turn me into a Trekkie? Oh my stars, no! But the film is still pretty dang awesome!",8,4,6,6 September 2013
The Babadook," Absolutely amazing and both emotionaly and terrifying!
","I don't want to come off like a horror movie snob but I've watched so many horror films in my young life that I have a hard time finding something that actually scares me or even gives me the creeps. If I were to throw out an estimate, I would say that 1 out of every 20 horror films actually spook me in any way. That's not good averages, in my opinion. However, I've always found that the best, and most original, horror films always exists outside the United States and, over the years, I've found that foreign made scary flicks scare me greater than any cheap 'found footage' film ever has. 'The Babadook' is just another one to add to that list This Australian film doesn't bother relying on gimmicks that are extremely popular in American horror film media and also doesn't bother with the cheap, and easy, jump scare. Instead, this film crafts an unsettling and bleak atmosphere and has it dance with shadows, creepy imagery, and sounds that result in stronger scares than all the horror films released in the last ten years. However, aside from the very amazing horror work, the film also tells a captivating and emotional story that centers on a single mother trying to bury her grief after losing her husband and deal with being a single parent. This mixes amazing well with the horror and crafts deep symbolism that just isn't seen in most fluff that is produced in this genre.Overall, 'The Babadook' is one of the strongest horror films I've seen in a long time. Even more impressive was the fact it was the feature length directorial debut of Jennifer Kent (who also wrote it) but it shows no signs of an individual's first outing in the director's chair making a feature. The film feels like it was made by a seasoned pro that has an eerie understand about horror and pure, uncut psychological terror. I am excited to see more tales of terror from Kent.",10,5,10,13 February 2015
Don Jon," JGL is just too talented...
","I like Joseph Gordon-Levitt as an actor but how does he fair as being the lead actor in a film that he is writing AND directing? Amazing well.'Don Jon' is just a captivating, entertaining and overall witty film that perfectly showcases how porn has come to ruin our modern day relationships. Gordon-Levitt is fantastic both in front of and behind the camera and is backed up awesomely with tremendous performances from Scarlett Johansson, Julianne Moore and Tony Danza—I never would have thought Danza would have been this entertaining in the film.The film is just perfectly put together and is all kinds of funny and amusing. I never would have thought that JGL's directorial debut would be so close to perfection.Hi! My name is Rev. Ron and I love movies!

Fast & Furious 6," They're not deep but they're fun movies...
","I'll just say it; I think these movies are just fun. I never really tire of them. Sure, some of the action is ridiculous—stupid even—and the characters are one-dimensional. Sure, some of the acting is hammy and cheesy and much of what happens not just laughs in the face of physics but actually punches physics in the gut before it runs away with its girlfriend only to leave her behind at the first gas station it comes across BUT, despite all these factors, these movies are massive guilty pleasures for me and 'Fast and Furious 6' is just another fun addition.I watch these movies because they are just action, octane and testosterone thrown into a blender and set to puree. The fast cars, the exciting action and the pointless, impossibly attractive women who seem to inhabit this clearly fictional world are all here and why this movie is not watched for narrative, character nuances or even plot or story. 'Furious 6' appeals to the primitive desire to see things blow up and see cars go super fastand that's why I think these movies are fun.My only complaint was the decision to bring Michelle Rodriguez back to the franchise (I think she's a terrible actress who can't play the one character she is constantly typecast into playing) and the decision to add Gina Carano to the cast (like Rodriguez, Carano can't act to save her life; the exception being she is a million times worse than Rodriguez); however, the presence of The Rock (let's face it, the dude just bleeds cool) and a decent antagonist in the form of Luke Evans, my complaints are non-existenceplus, more cars drive fast and things go boom, so ignoring Rodriguez and Carano is easy.'Fast & Furious 6' is just a wild, action-packed thrill ride that keeps reminding us why these movies make money.Hi!

Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Another great addition to the MCU...
","I'll just throw it out there: Ever since Marvel Studios put out 'Iron Man' and started Phase One of their shared cinematic universe, I have loved every single second of every single movie they have produced. Currently in Phase Two that builds towards 'The Avengers 2: Age of Ultron,' Marvel came out of the gate running with a more mature 'Iron Man 3,' a vastly expansive but ultimately more personal 'Thor: The Dark World' and now we have Captain America returning for a politically themed thriller/action drama in 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' and, not surprisingly, it is amazing! The returning players like Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson and Cobie Smulders once again prove why they were cast in their respective roles. Evans proves he's the man to throw the shield and it was excellent seeing more depth to Black Widow this time around. Additionally, adding Robert Redford to the cast was an amazing decision; for more reasons than just the fact the guy is a legend. Redford really captured the ambiguous, is he good/is he bad, mentality of senior S.H.I.E.L.D. executive Alexander Pierce. Furthermore, it was nice to see Sebastian Stan return as Bucky/The Winter Soldier, rather than just recast him with a more marketable name. Stan really delivered as this iconic Marvel character and was capable of being a terrific badass, an exceptional threat to Capt., and, as well as, a sympathetic character with a broken past.Finally, I was very excited to see Falcon added to the story. I'm a fan of the character and he was brought to the screen very faithfully and played tremendously by Anthony Mackie.Like all Marvel and superhero movies in general, 'The Winter Soldier' delivered amazingly with the action—the fight scenes between Capt. and the Winter Soldier also entirely make the film because they are fast, hard-hitting and all kinds of exciting—but the added element of political and social commentary through the story and themes of paranoia, security and freedom in our post 9/11 society really made the film feel mature and an answer to the critics who think comic books are just cartoons.'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' is just another win for Marvel and their epic cinematic universe. The story is great, the action is beyond satisfying and the drama and political intrigue fit in perfectly—not to mention the usual mid-credit sequence made me geek out like crazy! I have no complaints about this film and, once again, Marvel continues to prove they are making something incredible.Hey there!

Interstellar," Interesting and visually stunning...but I just couldn't get invested in the story.
","I'm a big fan of Christopher Nolan's work and was really excited to see 'Interstellar.' While the film started very strong and was loaded with emotional promise, the story just lost me and I quickly found myself growing bored with it.Yes, the film is visually stunning, Matthew McConaughey is awesome in his role, and the film has some very entertaining robots that provide some light-hearted and cool moments, the story's emotional impact was lost due to Nolan showing off how much he knew about science and time. While what we are presented with is interesting and neat to learn, they weren't presented in a way I felt was meshing with the story. They felt more like intermissions where the story is stopped and the audience is forced to pull out their textbooks to learn about what is going to happen. It felt like Nolan was stopping the emotional course of the story to show you all how hard he knows science.And while I loved McConaughey in the film, I felt a lot of the performances weren't coming close to what he was brining. Heck, even some of the characters come off as superfluous as they lack any real depth and feel tacked on in order to achieve the next plot device—for example, the surprise addition of a well known actor comes off as a needless villain that did little to really create tension and felt like something that was thrown in at the last minute.I still really enjoy Nolan's work and will forever admit that the visuals were gorgeous and McConaughey was very enjoyable in the film—and yes, I will say that all the science Nolan drops on us is very intriguing and cool but, in the end, I just couldn't invest myself in the story. It starts very strong but once the story took to the stars and traveling through black holes, the emphasis went from deep emotion to deep thought and that hurt the overall presentation for me. Science is pretty awesome but I just didn't see a balance of getting the human factor and the academic factor right. They didn't seem to gel and that kept me from getting fully invested in the journey to save the human race.Hello! The name is Rev.

Ant-Man," Keep them coming, Marvel, because I am loving them!
","I'm a die-hard fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and, so far, they are keeping me that way by constantly releasing incredibly entertaining films.'Ant-Man' was a big risk for the studio due to the fact the hero is pretty obscure for the general population and the fact that his abilities might be a little silly to them. However, like the chance they took with 'Guardians of the Galaxy,' Marvel proved they know what they are doing and got the right people involved to get the project to be a success. The effects are incredible and really show a sense of scale, the cast is fantastic and it's awesome to see Paul Rudd be a superhero in a Marvel film, and the story is filled with excellent themes and outstanding comedy. My only complaint was the fact that I found Corey Stoll's performance to be a little cheesy and some of the smaller sized action was hard to focus on because it was so incredibly fast and hectic. However, these complaints aside, I had a lot of fun with Marvel's heist/superhero film and continue to be an insanely dedicated fan to their MCU.Hello, potential new best friend! The name is Rev.

American Hustle," Good movie that just wasn't for me...
","My expectations were kinda high for 'American Hustle.' I didn't get to see it in the theater and one crisis or another (usually involving highly mutated and intelligent apes that know kung-fu) kept me from watching it when it hit the home media department. Thankfully, I got to see it recently and with the word of mouth and the critics nearly giving it 100% universal, irrefutable praise, I thought I was going to watch the greatest thing. A visual representation of chocolate and peanut butter meeting for the first time.It was close but not quite that.Overall, I thought the film was okay but maybe my expectations were too high. The soundtrack is filled with great tunes from an era where music was made to endure the span of time, the premise was definitely interesting, and the cast is filled with ridiculously talented actors who are each giving their all (and more) in their performance. Even Jennifer Lawrence, an actress I'm usually indifferent to and don't really see the hype that surrounds her, blew me away her role. And did I mention the awesome hair on Bradley Cooper and Christian Bale?!? But all jokes about perms and comb-overs aside, the actors and actresses within this tale were incredible.The real killer for me was the fact the film's plot and story unfold very slowly and, sometimes, feels like it is going nowhere or like it has no clue where it is going and decides to just take a nap. I wasn't expecting a flashy, fast pace crime caper film but I wasn't expecting to not get sucked into the story and have the two hours and crumbs of its running time feel like it is taking twice that amount of time to get somewhere. I could feel each second slowly chug its way around the clock and I wasn't able to get fully invested in the film to the point where the time just flew.Did I think 'American Hustle' was bad? No. Were my expectations too high? Quite possibly. I enjoyed a lot about the film but my inability to completely consume myself into the story and plot made the film just okay in my book. But that comb-over is top shelf stuff and I hope to one day rock something half as decent! Greetings there, potential new best friend!

Rush," My racing is usually Mario Kart but this movie was awesome!
","The only real interest I have in racing comes in the form of video  games. I never watch the sporthell, I don't watch sports in general,  HOWEVER, I was shocked by how entertained I was by this film.  Even though I'm not a sports guy, stories about professional rivalries  are just plain interesting and this one tells a great tale about James  Hunt and Niki Lauda from the 1976 Formula 1 racing season. Watching  this two men annoy each other onto greatness and have a mutual respect  for one another was interesting enough for me but watching the truly  epic performances from Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl only made the  film that much more interest-grabbing. And one can NOT overlook the  stellar visuals from Ron Howard or how exciting the racing sequences  are. Overall, I was just really taken back by how incredible the film  was.",10,2,3,18 January 2014
Nightcrawler," Chilling, intense and awesome!
","I really, really dug this film! The story to 'Nightcrawler' is incredible and builds at such a fantastic pace. Everything is developed very fluidly and naturally. It builds at such a great pace and the tension is crafted so well that, by the time the major event happens in the story, I was on the edge of my seat, holding my breath and staring unblinking at the horror about to splash across my TV screen. Writer/director Dan Gilroy crafted an amazing story and he showcased it perfectly.Once again, Jake Gyllenhaal completely dominates the character he is playing and proves that this dude is almost god-like in his acting ability. He was able to take this loathsome character of Louis Bloom and make him insanely interesting and captivating to watch. Not to mention he made him a bit humorous, partly charming but completely unnerving all at the same time. Sure, he was the main character but Gyllenhaal commanded attention in that role in a way that a lead actor is supposed to. Like so many characters Gyllenhaal plays, he made Bloom feel legit, believable, and completely realistic.Overall, I was just blown away with 'Nightcrawler.' Aside from what I already mentioned, the film also contains a great supporting cast, provides excellent commentary about the state of journalism and the media, and Gilroy made the very city of LA feel like a character in the film that Bloom is prowling and hunting through. It all added up for a fantastic film!",10,0,0,13 February 2015
Oblivion," Better than I thought it would be...
","I'm not the biggest fan of Tom Cruise but, lately (thanks to films like 'Jack Reacher' and 'Tropic Thunder'), I've started to come around to the man who made an acting career out of running really fast and smiling a lot.'Oblivion' feels like the classic sci-fi stories of old. The story is fantastic as it grabs you right away at the beginning. Sadly, it started to drag for me in the middle but it kicks it back up into high gear and heads straight on into a killer ending! The performances are top notch and it's probably the most entertaining I've seen Cruise in awhile (except for 'Tropic Thunder,' that one will always be my favorite starring him).Finally, the special effects are just incredible and the sound is unparalleled! For having no real expectations going into this movie, I was more than pleasantly surprised with how entertaining the film was. The only drag was the low point the story takes in the middle. Besides that, it's awesome!",7,1,2,15 August 2013
We're the Millers," Gut busting funny!
","The Red Band trailer sold me on this one but I worried that all the funniest bits were shown there--like a lot of comedies do. However, this movie kept me laughing the entire way through.The film can offend a lot of viewers but unlike a lot of shock value-based comedies, this one didn't feel like it was going out of its way to offend but rather just used offensive stuff for the sake of actually being funny. The movie felt very self-aware to me and like it was just trying to use rude and crude humor to be funny and not act like a hack comedian and use it to rile up their audience.The cast is fantastic and lead perfectly by Jason Sudiekis and features great cameos and scenes from actors like Nick Offerman, Ed Helms, Ken Marino, Thomas Lennon and Luis Guzman. Jennifer Aniston was also very funny and I don't usually find her all that amusing. The only downside in the cast was that I felt Emma Roberts couldn't hold her own with the rest of the actors.While funny, the only thing I didn't care for with this one was the fact it felt too long and it started to drag for me towards the end. While the momentum the film sets up wasn't instantly killed, it did cause me to end the movie with significantly less laughs than when I started. But it still was a very enjoyable movie.Hi!

Divergent," Yeah...this movie wasn't made for dudes like me.
","'Divergent' makes me feel like I have to take a step back and preface that all my opinions on the film are made under the basis that I am fully aware that I am not the intended audience for the film. I'm a 33 year old man who collects comic books, plays video games, and spends too much money on comic conventions every year—I'm not the person that the production had in mind for watching 'Divergent.' However, they didn't have me in mind for 'The Hunger Games' and I came around to be a fan of that franchise—although, I admit I didn't care for the first film.While the visuals are good and it really sells the dystopian future the film is set in, and the acting could have easily been a lot worse and, in reality, was pretty passable (although, you would think a film that has both Kate Winslet and Ashley Judd would have a little stronger performances), the film has just a way too predictable formula to really be anything but boring. I understand that this very specific subgenre that is the tween dystopia novel adaptations follow certain guidelines—all genres really do this—but 'Divergent' felt like a 'fill in the blanks' template for the tween dystopia film. The characters, the story, the unfolding origin of the backstory all play out exactly as you would predict it would as the opening credits begin. In fact, the film is so predictable that there is almost no need to watch it because, chances are, any prediction you make about it will come 100% true.I was pretty critical of the first 'Hunger Games' film but the sequel won me over; however, I don't really see this happening with 'Divergent' because the cast doesn't have enough great players thrown in, and the story, overall, is pretty bland and flavorless. Still, I won't rule out this franchise might get better and more interesting. After all, the boring beginning and the whole establishing the universe is now over so, theoretically, things can go up from herebut things can also theoretically go down, as well.",2,2,2,8 October 2014
Ender's Game," Emotional story? Bah! We have cool effects!
","Who needs an interesting story when you have cool spaceships!!! I think that was the mantra that Gavin Hood and the production of 'Ender's Game' had when they made the film. While basically a big budget popcorn action sci-fi film, 'Ender's Game' (the novel) has always had a reputation of not only being written by a complete lunatic who thinks 9/11 was a good thing for the country and that homosexuals are really, REALLY bad but has offered up interesting ideas about war, genocide and desensitizing children to the horrors of violence and battles. The film doesn't offer any of these ideas up or they just cover them and push them aside in order to celebrate how good they made the special effects look.The film has tremendous performances but the story lacks any real spark and is almost completely devoid of any drama, tension or thrills thanks to director Gavin Hood being more worried about you seeing that the special effects look really, REALLY good and thinks actually seeing reactions from his actors when reaction shots are kinda important for the scene are just optional. This ended up just making the film boring and forgettable for me.'Ender's Game' could have been a great or even just a decent sci-fi tale but with an overall sense that CG was better than character, spirit or emotion, the film just feels pointless.Hi!

The Lego Movie," This might have become my favorite animated movie of all time!!!
","When the movie was announced, I was excited. When the first poster was unveiled, I was more excited. When the first trailer hit, I was a rolling ball of excitement ready to split open and engulf all of reality in the spontaneous black hole that developed from all my excitement.I'm a big fan of Lego so, needless to say, my expectations were high for this one. However, directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller hit them all and then decided to go further beyond what I was expecting. To put it simply, 'The Lego Movie' is awesome and might be the best animated film I have ever seen. I can't think of a single element of this film that didn't work. It was, for the lack of a better wordperfect.First off, the voice acting is top shelf stuffworthy of the most complex Lego creation the world has ever seenI'm trying to say the actors were awesome and a perfect fit for their roles (get it? Fit?). Everyone from the characters who only show up for one line to the main stars like Chris Pratt, Morgan Freeman, Elizabeth Banks, Charlie Day, Will Ferrell, Will Arnett and more, really delivered in not only making the film extremely hilarious but brought their characters to life in a way that made the Lego world feel legit and right out of the imagination of a childor me when my girlfriend works late and I pull out my big box o' Lego.Then there's the fantastic story that takes all the various types of humor the film contains and mixes perfectly with just enough heart and emotion to make the film resonatenot to mention the story itself is just a rich stew of unique creativity that feels like a shining jewel and a beacon of awesome in a world of movies that many are starting to think has become stale and complacent.Finally, the animation is some of the most amazing I've ever seen dance upon the big screen. The way the animators seamlessly married 3D and stop-motion ended up creating a world of Legos that is every Lego fans' dream. The way they were able to make literally everything (fire, smoke, water and more) look like it was made of the greatest toy every created and an object feared by bare feet was just an awesome sight. I could throw all kinds of words to describe how cool the final product looked but words just can't do the animation justice.'The Lego Movie' is, plain and simple, awesome. The jokes, story, heart and animation come together to make a magical film that is unlike any other animated movie to ever exist. Just like toys, the movie is something that everyone can enjoy and, also like the toy, the scope of what the film delivers and is able to create feels limitless.Hi! My name is Rev.

Dallas Buyers Club," Wow...
","Everything about this movie is greatthe script, the story, the development, the editing, the visuals, the characters—all of it is captivating and interesting. The movie has all the right emotion and all the right drama to make the film memorable and intriguing. However, I have to say that Matthew McConaughey's performance was the one thing I enjoyed the most.I've always enjoyed McConaughey's acting—I just haven't enjoyed a lot of the movies he's been in. However, as of the last few years, he's been moving away from romcoms and more towards the dramatic and it's really given him a place to show off how talented he is. 'Dallas Buyers Club' really became another canvas for him to showcase his craft as he took an already interesting and potentially drama-filled product and made it really come to life. Ron Woodroof's battle with HIV and his desire to set up an organization to help others suffering from it during the major epidemic in the 80s is already interesting and engaging but McConaughey's ridiculously strong performance only made the film that much more attention-grabbing.And it's not like the rest of the cast were any slouches either. Jennifer Garner and Jared Leto both play major characters in Woodroof's life and journey to establish the Dallas Buyers Club (although, their characters WERE completely made up for the film) and both of them were performing fantastically. There was also a spark of magic as the relationships these two had with the character of Woodroof took a film that was already dramatic and interesting on the surface and gave it added dimensions and depth and, ultimately, created a film that felt very personal and emotional.Honestly, there was nothing I didn't like about 'Dallas Buyers Club' and it really was put together well—the lighting, camera work, script, story, and (especially) the editing—but it was the performances and the chemistry that the main actors displayed. They made a film that was already hard-hitting with its drama and were able to successful make it real and personal. They integrated themselves perfectly into the final product and it came back a film that is just as powerful as the quote that is on the Blu-Ray case says it is.Hi! My name is Rev.

Now You See Me," Illusions, Michael...
","Since this has come out, exactly nine thousand and fifteen comedians and syndicated critics have summed this movie up in one hack joke that reads, 'The only thing magic about 'Now You See Me' is it made my time and money disappear' but, despite how lame that joke is, the movie is fairly entertaining.The story is fun (it's about magicians stealing money, enough said!) and the characters are quirky and interesting. The cast, despite being maybe too big, is fantastic in their roles. Special mention MUST be made for Mark Ruffalo who stole the film as the obsessed cop trying to stop the magician thieves. It's already been scientifically proved (citation needed) that Ruffalo is an amazing actor but he never stops giving commanding performances that grabs your attention.The only drawbacks I had with the film is that the movie seemed like a 'For Boys Only' film as the female characters portrayed by Isla Fisher and Mélanie Laurent felt like they could have been more but were resigned to being romantic (or former romantic) potentials for the male characters. The film also weakly establishes some plot points that, sadly, go almost completely unresolved near the end (but there's a sequel coming, so that might help) and, finally, where was G.O.B. Bluth in all this?!?",8,0,2,6 September 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," The X-Film that we all needed!
","This is, without a doubt, my favorite X-film to date! After 'The Last Stand' left a very unpleasant taste in the mouths of many X-Men fans and after 'Origins' didn't quite kick off an X-men spin off series as well as it should have, it seemed that 'First Class' was going to be the film that would be responsible for bringing the franchise back to the greatness it had during 'X2.' While 'First Class' is awesome, 'Days of Future Past' feels like an apology for even allowing the existence of 'The Last Stand' and Bryan Singer's return meant making up for that mistake.You either love him or hate him for what he brings to the X-Men table but Singer really delivered with this adaptation of the iconic comic storyline. The spirit of the pages is there and the scope is so much bigger than anything else in this X-franchise. Seeing this movie crossover the First Class with the Old Class is awesome in and of itself but seeing how Singer was able to balance out this very large cast and make it feel like every character was important, no matter what size role they had. It was also very cool to see many fan favorites, such as Bishop, Blink and Quicksilver, make the jump to the big screen and actually have a part to play and not feel like they are just a nod-and-a-wink to the comic fans like what happens so often in X-films.Even though the story is very plot-heavy, the film never gets boring. The pace is perfect and the film is capable of being action-packed, character driven, and filled with tension as the fate of all mutants is placed in the hands of one mission that could easily go disastrously wrong. This, actually, is a great metaphor for the film itself. 'Days of Future Past' could have easily become a disaster just slightly worse than the fake abs that Vinnie Jones sported as the Juggernaut in 'The Last Stand' but Singer really crafted a film that feels superior to all other X-titles and contains a story that gave a shot of adrenaline to the franchise and has set the stage up for more adventures for both the young and the old classlike the fight against Apocalypse that is on the way.'X-Men: Days of Future Past' went above and beyond my expectations and delivered an X-film that not only creates a promising future for the mutants in the world of cinema but it also proved that Fox is finally ready to start taking their X-Men cash cow seriously and do with them what Marvel Studios is currently doing with the Avengers.Hi there!

The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Always a pleasure to return to Middle-earth!
","I can't get enough Middle-earth.I don't nitpick the films because Peter Jackson decided to make it a trilogy or about what frame rate it was filmed in or that they pulled elements from the appendices for the stories—I ignore all of that and just look for something that feels authentic to the Tolkien-created universeand Peter Jackson is the man for that!I really felt this was a step above 'An Unexpected Journey,' and I absolutely LOVED the opening film in this series. The story picks up like the last one never stopped for a credit break and what follows is a story that flowed so smoothly that I was sucked in and the time flew by. The pages of the book came to life with humor, drama and unbelievable action. Once again, the visuals look amazing, the special effects are great, the sets and costumes look how you imagine this fantasy world to be and, most of all, Smaug is a wonder to see! The dragon's special effects are incredible and, more importantly, Benedict Cumberbatch proved to be the perfect man to give the creature life; his voice was chilling and command the authority that you would imagine a dragon to command. I admit I'm biased because I love Middle-earth and Tolkien's stories endlessly but what Jackson and his crew made honors the author and his world to no end. This film was so much better than my already high expectations set for it that my anticipation levels for the final film are hitting critical massand I'm okay with that!

Non-Stop," Well, at Liam Neeson is in it...
","I'm pretty much at the point that if Liam Neeson is in the film, I will watch it no questions asked. That explains why I wasted my time and money seeing 'Battleship' in the theaters. The guy is not only a great actor but with the action-based roles he's been taking it has pretty much cemented the idea that he is a legitimate tough guy. His gruff voice, intense stare and the fact that when he's chopping people in the necks with his hands looks like he actually is well versed in the art of hurting bad guys translates to an instant draw for me. Honestly, Neeson was the best part of the film.For the most part, 'Non-Stop' isn't a terrible film. The problem is that it just has too many factors that were working against my personal enjoyment for me to find it anything more than just an average, one-time-watching film. For example, the film has some great, close-quarters fight scenes, Liam Neeson is acting the hell out of his role, the premise had amazing potential to be exciting and the film starts off as a decent thriller that looks like it is building to something interesting. However, the suspense is abandoned pretty early for a more generic action film with no real mystery working for it and the bad guy is way too easy to predict. Finally, the motives behind the hijacking are lackluster and vacuous at best.'Non-Stop' has its moments and didn't bore me but it just wasn't good enough where I will find myself finding any desire to watch it again in my lifetime.Greetings, good sir and/or madam!

How to Train Your Dragon 2," Completely epic in every way!
","Aside from the fact that I think dragons are awesome, I genuinely enjoyed the first go-around on training dragons (okayyou got me, dragons WERE the reason I enjoyed the film). I thought the first movie was so fun and amusing that I was very excited for the sequel and had high expectations (I guess you can say they were as high as a dragon in the clouds but that would be a silly, very forced metaphor). The thing that I wasn't prepared for was how my expectations were met and then instantly exceeded! It would be easy to say that HTTYD2 was better than the first but that would be selling the first film short. Instead, I see this completely fantastic follow-up as an intensely epic building block that built superbly well on a great foundation. Like the first one, the film is funny, adorable, and filled with a great voice acting cast but this one does one better by keeping all that and improving on their animation, bringing in more great actors for new and interesting characters and then decides to bring about a darker, more mature story that proves that animated films don't have to be talking animals doing fart jokes. In all honesty, the story is the best part about this film as it is capable of being emotionally dramatic, fun and amusing all at the same time.'How to Train Your Dragon 2' proves that this is a property that is a legitimate contender in the animated film department and, with all its epicness, I'm am more than excited to see this franchise have a long life and I hope to see more and more sequels in the years to come.Hey there, good looking!

The Grand Budapest Hotel," Wes Anderson being Wes Anderson-y...and it's great because of it!
","Whether you love him or hate him, Wes Anderson has a unique eye and makes some very imaginative films. And 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' might be my favorite one he's done.For some reason, the more Wes Anderson looks like he is making a parody of himself with his usual style, the more I like his films. The more the colorful locales look like elaborate set pieces, the more outrageous the characters, and the constantly panning camera work, the more I am entertained by his works. 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' takes all those tropes from Anderson and, as usual, makes them work in an entertaining way.And then there's the cast Anderson has a select group he likes to work with and, as usual, they're all back but the focus on this film was the absolutely superb and riotously humorous role of M. Gustave from Ralph Finnes. Yes, the rest of the cast is great and very funny but, Man Alive, was Finnes awesome in the film. His mastery of language, vulgarity, and body language really sold every joke and made the film a non-stop ride of hilarity.'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is another wacky, odd, and eccentric ride from Wes Anderson and it is one packed with great acting and an all-out hilarious story. I really enjoyed this one! Hi! My name is Rev. Ron and if you feel like reading more of my rants, ramblings, geek references, bad jokes, and other movie reviews (like a more in-depth look at 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' and other films that lack a Wes Anderson vibe) you can visit my blog at revronmovies.blogspot.com.

Foxcatcher," Dry, bleak, dramatic and very intense and interesting...
","'Foxcatcher' is a fairly decent adaptation of the real life events of Team Foxcatcher and John du Pont's murder of Olympic gold medalist David Schultz. Like all bio-pics and 'based on a true story' in the world of films, there are some inaccuracies, embellishments or total changes for the sake of story-telling, drama, or the need to up the ante because the real events weren't interesting enough. These types of changes don't really bother me because the end product is pretty dark and dramatic. Not to mention that the cast is giving off truly amazing performances.The only real downside I had for the film was the fact it has the habit of being a little dry and has quite a few moments that drag and has the potential to be boring to some people. However, overall, I didn't find the film to be a snoozer but found it pretty intriguing.",8,0,1,29 April 2015
It Follows," Would have been a better short film...
","I'm all for a slow-burn horror film that builds at a methodical pace towards some true, uncut terror but I found 'It Follows' to be more of a slow fizzle that was going nowhere very slowly and had only a few spooky moments early on in the feature.To me, I feel this project could have worked better as a short film because the concept is great and honors an old horror film trope while being unique as it does so, the camera work and shot compilation is great, and it makes use of some truly striking and intense music. However, I didn't care a single ounce for the characters, I found myself getting more and more bored as the plot felt like it was going nowhere and had no clue what it was doing and, after the first 15 minutes, all potential for scares were lost for me due to its repetitive and lost-feeling story.There were elements that worked and a lot that weren't working for me with 'It Follows' and it ultimately made me feel like this film is all hype with no real substance.",4,15,95,17 April 2015
Gone Girl," Heavy, heavy movie that stuck with me after I left the theater...
","I'm a fan of David Fincher's work. 'Fight Club,' 'Seven,' 'The Social Network,' the remake of 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'I just dig the guys work and the films he's behind (yes, even 'Alien 3'). So, 'Gone Girl' was going to be one I was going to jump at to see and when I factored in the story and the cast to the partnership of Fincher behind the camera and Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross once again helping with the score, I was almost assured to love the film.And then it had to go and be something even better.As a story, 'Gone Girl' is griping and shocking. It hooked me in and didn't let go for the entire ride. It even stuck with me well after the movie ended. It was heavy, dramatic, and even chilling. And all these elements were made even stronger by an unbelievably talented cast that delivered like crazy with their roles. Affleck was fantastic as Nick Dunne, Neil Patrick Harris looked at home in the thriller genre, and Tyler Perry was very entertaining as the defense attorney Tanner Bolt. However, as great as they all were, they all pale in comparison to the performance of Rosamund Pike.Words fail me at truly summing up how awesome she was in her role because she was capable of being sympathetic and chilling at the same time. The only phrase I can think of to really show-off how incredibly Pike was is 'Oscar worthy.' If she doesn't win Best Actress for her role in this film, then all that is awesome in this world will die a little.'Gone Girl' is just incredible and solidly put together. The story never drags or gets boring and unrolls at the perfect pace that kept me hooked and kept surprising me at every turn. Overall, just a tremendous movie filled with tension and heavy drama.Hello! My name is Rev.

The Theory of Everything," Beautiful and emotional!
","You'd have to be missing a soul and own a black heart to not tear up with this oneso, I'm assuming that most people who comment on the Internet can't cry when watching this film.'The Theory of Everything' is such a deeply emotional and beautiful bio-pic about the relationship between Stephen Hawking and Jane Hawking. The visuals are stunning, the story is very dramatic and it's hard to not sob watching the drama unfold and the performances are incredible beyond words. I have no real complaints about the film beyond the fact that the replay value of it is a little low for me. However, that aside, it's a terrific film and just absolutely fantastic in almost every way.",9,0,2,11 August 2015
Frozen," It wasn't meant for me...
","I wasn't sold on seeing this one in the theaters because it looked like a 'filler' animated film from Disney that appeared to only exist in order to take up space at a theater until Pixar decided to do another film and line The Mouse's pockets with sweaty, sexy cash. However, the critics raved about it, parents loved it because their kids loved it and tween girls everywhere went nuts because they finally had a Disney princess who was just as awkward as they were and, if smart phones existed in the fable of 'Frozen,' she would be addressing this awkward revelation with an unhealthy amount of selfies.There is definitely an audience for this film—and here's a hint: They all act like the character of Anna and are the type who take pictures of themselves and post them online with the caption 'lol I'm awkward.' The reality is that I was just not meant for that audience. While the film isn't bad, the animation looks great (especially the snow effects) and Olaf the snowman is amusing and adorable, the fact remains I just wasn't impressed or interested in the final product. The characters weren't ones I could relate to or even care about (seriously, I really understood you wanted us to know that Anna was awkward but did you have to show it at all times?) and the songs just weren't catchy for me and I found them more annoying than anything else (I know you hate me now because I just admitted that I don't like the internet-adored 'Let It Go').I'll admit that I admired that Disney was legitimately trying to make a true musical and not just one of their usual colorful story with an occasional catchy song but, in the end, I just wasn't sucked into the film and ended up finding 'Frozen' to be something that didn't live up to the hype and was just another forgettable Disney film that doesn't hold a candle to such films as 'The Lion King' and 'The Little Mermaid.'

The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Better than the mainstream critics had me believe it was...
","Even though I was sold on the trailer, I was a little hesitant to see this film because the main consensus with the main stream critics was the film was kinda 'meh.' However, after some friends recommended that I don't listen to them and that the film is pretty good, I sat down and found I really enjoyed 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.' While the film won't be a life-defining film for me, I really enjoyed the story, the cast and the humor of it. Ben Stiller directed and acted in a movie that really captured the human spirit and the drive to create lasting memories and weave a life full of awe and wonder. I really enjoyed how the film was able to feel larger-than-life with the fantasy/dream sequences that led to the real adventures Walter goes through but, at the same time, feel small and personal as Walter not only comes to know himself but better understand those around him.Finally, while the movie may not have been laugh-out-loud hilarious, I still thought the movie was very amusing. For example, Walter's interaction with the eHarmony tech Todd (Patton Oswalt) never failed to make me chuckle and smile and the film also has a couple of moments where they set up a joke very early in the film (like right at the beginning) and deliver the punchline at the very end. Instances like that are just great examples of patience and payoff.While the reviews are mixed, I definitely thought 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' was better than the 'Reception' tab on Wikipedia would have led me to believe. The movie is amusing, has heart to it without getting too sappy, and the cast all does their job tremendously.Greetings!

22 Jump Street," Just as insanely fun and funny as the first one...
","Let's be honest; was any of us really prepared for how freakingly hysterical '21 Jump Street' was? I know I wasn't. So, since I laughed my face off (and paid millions of dollars in surgery to have a new face put in—that I regret wasn't Nicolas Cage's face), I had extremely high expectations from the comedy teams of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller and Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill. And to a much smaller surprise than how hilarious '21 Jump Street' was, the film was flippin' hysterical! (I was fully prepared for hilarity this time)The best part about this sequel is the fact that Lord and Miller were not shy at all at making fun of themselves and the fact that the film was a sequel. The movie is already gut-busting with its never ending line of never stale, always fresh and numerous types of comedy but the fact the film is so darn self-aware and filled with riding right up to the edge of the fourth wall and hurling out a hailstorm of META-gags made the film work absolutely perfectly as a follow up to the first film.Once again, the movie has a great cast (especially the new additions to the film) and Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill have great comedic chemistry together. The duo play so well off each other that they make all the jokes look like there was no effort whatsoever in them and end up making the film just one long smooth sail through calm comedy waters. '22 Jump Street' is just fun and absolutely hilarious to the point it is just as good as the first film—something very rare in the world of sequels. Like the first film, I will be watching this movie many, many more times in the future.Greetings, gents and ladies.

The Amazing Spider-Man 2," There's some problems but Spidey's still good in my book!
","While there were elements I enjoyed with Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films (yes, even in the third. As awful as that one was, the special effects on Sandman were incredible), I found that I infinitely enjoyed 'The Amazing Spider-Man' much more. So, I was a little bit excited for this next go-aroundand I wasn't disappointed.The critics may not be digging the film but Spider-Man has been a big part of my life for a long time—actually, superheroes in general have been a big par of my life. While Tobey was a decent Spider-Man, I never felt he really fit the character I knew from the various cartoons and comics I grew up with. When Andrew Garfield stepped it, I saw an actor who nailed the geekiness, the cockiness when the mask was on and the awkwardness when it was off, and, most importantly, could nail those corny one-liners Spidey always tossed around. Garfield keeps that spirit alive and keeps the chemistry he has with costar Emma Stone.The new additions to this sequel, like Dane DeHaan as Green Goblin/Harry Osborn and Jamie Foxx as Electro, fit right in. DeHaan was impressive as Harry and made James Franco's portrayal of the same character look weak (even though Franco was one of those elements I really liked from that trilogy) and Foxx was just awesome as Electro. First off, it was cool to see the character of Electro hit the big screen because it was a refreshing sight to see this villain make the jump to the big screen and not another one of the fellows we've seen before and the way the writers combined the established Marvel character with Marvel's 'Ultimate' Electro really made for an exciting villain for Spidey to face. When you combine that with a great performance from Foxx and killer special effects, you have a recipe for some fun, exciting stuff.The only real complaint I had about the film was the fact director Marc Webb couldn't balance a story that was inherently both a sequel and a springboard for the upcoming spin-off for the Sinister Six. Both elements are at play as we see Peter/Spider-Man evolve and deal with his personal relationships and his responsibilities as a hero and we see the depths that Oscorp is going and a plan that Green Goblin is hatching to stop Spider-Man that will culminate in the Sinister Six film. This ended up causing some of the parts of the film to feel rushed or tacked on and it also rode the line of hitting the same problem that the third, jazz-dancing film had: Too many villains. Along with Green Goblin and Electro, the film also has The Rhino coming in to make a cameo and, even though he was there for the Sinister Six setup, it might have been too many villains—especially when you include that other Spidey comic characters have cameos along the way. However, being a geek, seeing Rhino come to life on screen was too cool and this complaint is so minor for me that it is pretty much nonexistent.Ultimately, I really enjoyed 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2.' While the story may have some hiccups, it was still fun, funny and had just the right amount of drama where it can be moving and touching but not a two-hour, 'Let's watch Spider-Man blubber and snot on himself' film like Raimi's trilogy. Additionally, the film had tremendous sound and awesome music that really helped create the tone—the music played for Electro really helped sell the confusion and frustration the character is going through. Finally, the action is fast and never boring. Overall, I feel this was a great addition to the rebooted franchise and I'm excited for the upcoming spin-offs and sequels.Good afternoon or evening or morning!

Ex Machina," Some of the best Sci-fi I've ever seen!
","'Ex Machina' is definitely one of those re-defining sci-fi films that will stick with me for a long time.The story is simple but incredible in the way it is intelligent without coming off like it's pretentious, creepy without being scary and dramatic without being cartoonishly so. The characters are incredibly dynamic and captivating to watch and when you combine that to the amazing story and the intense and spectacular visuals, it combines in a Voltron sorta way to make a film that is unlike most of the films churned out in this particular genre.",10,3,7,11 September 2015
Grudge Match," Pretty cheesy stuff...
","This movie felt like it was written by a stand up comedian in his late 40s/early 50s who still does his material from the 80s and think his Viagra joke is the height of hilarity.Going into 'Grudge Match,' I knew the jokes were going to be excruciatingly predictable (yes, they do a 'I've fallen and I can't get up' joke) and it was obvious that Kevin Hart was included just to get the younger people to the theater but I wasn't prepared how the film, almost like an Alzheimer's patient, suddenly forgets that it's a wacky sports comedy about two old dudes settling a rivalry and suddenly becomes a way too heavy drama about two old dudes who are foolishly ignoring the real priorities in their lives. While a drama element was as expected as the terrible jokes, the drama portion became way too serious that you forgot that just a minute ago they were doing jokes about Bobbie De Niro having moobs.Bad, easy jokes in the film aside, I honestly think the film's cast did a tremendous job. Sly and Bobbie really have some chemistry on screen and really come off as two rivals who are out to get under each other's skin and beat them to a pulp in the ring (even though we, as an audience, acknowledge that, realistically, Stallone would destroy De Niro due to the fact that Sly is still in really good shape). I also really enjoyed the chemistry between De Niro and Jon Bernthal as De Niro's character's son. Bernthal is already a terrific actor but the two really played well together. Finally, Alan Arkin, as usual, is amazing and is able to take the weak jokes and the times when Kevin Hart is trying way too hard to be funny and is able to turn it around and be amusing—but he's just a wizard like that.Overall, 'Grudge Match' is a weak, unfunny film (with some frightening CG at the beginning of the filmthey couldn't hire younger actors to play young Sly and De Niro? They had to use nightmare inducing computer effects?) but the cast works their magic and perform great despite the circumstances.Greetings, Earthlings! Do you feel like reading a more in-depth review of 'Grudge Match' and some more rants, ramblings, bad jokes (but not 'Grudge Match' bad), some geeky references and some more reviews that don't involve Sly Stallone restraining himself from killing Bobbie De Niro with one punch?

Big Hero 6," A great, great, great superhero movie!
","I can't say that I'm really a fan of the source material for this movie but the animated product that Disney Studios made from it I can honestly say that I am a big fan of! After numerous (and, in my opinion, warranted) changes to the 'Big Hero 6' superhero team from the comics, Disney Studios created a superhero origin story that never felt like all the other superhero origin stories and contained a story that had a lot of heart, tons of exciting action, and lots of ridiculously funny moments. Additionally, the film had a slew of interesting and diverse characters and all of them were performed amazingly well by a cast of very talented actors. Disney also proved that it is very possible to create a legitimately entertaining comic book film in your usual Disney 3D animation style and not make it feel like it was doing a disservice to the world of comic books.I don't have a single complaint about 'Big Hero 6' and it easily sits right next to some of the other great Marvel films out there (even thought it isn't actually a part of the MCU). In my opinion, this film is just as entertaining as 'The Avengers' or 'Iron Man' or 'Guardians of the Galaxy.' Just a great, great movieand Baymax is flippin' adorable! Hi! The name is Rev. Ron and if you feel like reading more of my rants, ramblings, bad jokes, geek references, and other movie reviews (like a more in-depth look at 'Big Hero 6' and other films based on comic books—obscure or well known) you can visit my blog at revronmovies.blogspot.com.

Guardians of the Galaxy," Absolute fun!
","Sure, someone who has never read a comic book may know who Captain America is and what Iron Man's real name happens to be but how many know who Peter Quill is or why there is a raccoon hanging out with something you are pretty sure was in The Lord of the Rings films? Guys like me do because we read 'Guardians of the Galaxy' but what about those who think comic books are for kids? Marvel Studios took a huge risk adapting one of their more obscure titles and bringing the Marvel movieverse further into the cosmos with 'Guardians of the Galaxy' but the gambit paid off and paid off extremely well! Since Marvel knows exactly how to find the right men for the job, they hit gold by having director James Gunn bring the pages to life and he made a film that had not only a great story but was action-packed and funny all at the same time.The cast is perfect and everyone—Chris Pratt as Star-Lord, Zoe Saldana as Gamora, Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer and Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper doing the voices of Groot and Rocket—were the perfect choices. Even if their characters were altered slightly from comic book pages counterparts, they all nailed what was needed to make their character work. Whether it be Pratt channeling a little bit of Han Solo or Bautista capturing Drax's insanity, Zoe nailing the badass nature of Gamora or Bradley getting the essence of Rocket or Vin Diesel able to make Groot come to life (which is a challenge since all Groot says is 'I am Groot'), they all made the Guardians great characters to watch and get invested in and have a blast with. But the cast didn't stop there, literally all players—Michael Rooker, Karen Gillan, Lee Pace, Benicio Del Toro, Djimon Hounsou—they were all captivating and all brought the rich cosmic world of the Guardians and made it something to really enjoy.'The Avengers' is still my favorite Marvel Studios film but there is no doubt that 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is a ridiculously close second. With all its Easter Eggs to try and find, it's outrageous and never-ending humor, the fantastic cast, the great characters brought to life from the pages, and some very exciting action, this film will definitely have a permanent rotation in my favorite movie list and I will be watching it repeatedly for a long time!",10,4,9,2 August 2014
The Imitation Game," Great film with great performances!
","I had never heard of Alan Turning until this film came out (thanks, American Public School System!) but, if you watch the film, there's a reason we never heard of him for a long time. Aside from having his activities classified for some time, Turning's story is a tragic one from a time when the human race was far less kind to the homosexual communitybeing denied a cake from an intolerant bakery is (and excuse the pun) a cake walk compared to what happened to Turning. And that's the double-edge sword being wielded by the elephant in the roomit's part of what makes Turning's story interesting and captivating.The tale and tragic end of Alan Turning is completely enthralling, horrifying, bittersweet and interesting all around. The film was moving and easily engaging and, when you combine the excellent performances from not only Benedict Cumberbatch but literally everyone on the cast, you have a film that hits all the right dramatic notes and makes a film that is incredibly emotional and powerful.",8,1,2,17 April 2015
Jurassic World," Mindless popcorn action fun!
","The first film appeals to both the 12 year old in me that loves dinosaurs and the more refined part of my psyche that loves well made films that have character, suspense, and amazing technical features and pioneering special effects. 'Jurassic World' doesn't compare to the first one but it's better than the last two and, at its core, it's still a lot of fun.The human characters aren't written the best and come off so flat that it was really hard to get completely invested in them but the popcorn spectacle the film throws at you non-stop is really what makes this film fun to watch. The film doesn't venture very deep into too many of the themes the first one had but what it lacks in this department it makes up in decent gags, set design that felt like a real, working park and some killer dino-on-dino death matches. Plus, it doesn't hurt having the awesome Chris Pratt in it and it really doesn't hurt that he has his own raptor pack.Overall, the film is just mindless fun and it works for what it is. It would have been nice to see some more practical effects mixed with the CGI like the original film did back in 1993 but we live in a world of filmmaking where computers are the default setting. The complaints are minor and they never really stopped me from enjoying the film because, at the heart of it all, Chris Pratt has domesticated raptors and that realistically could have been the entire film and I would have been totally cool with that.",8,8,24,16 July 2015
Prisoners," WOW! What a thriller!
","Holy Wow! 'Prisoners' is an unbelievable movie! To call the mystery in the film's story griping, attention-holding and pulse raising is to sell it lightly because this movie grabbed me by the jugular and didn't let go until it was over. The way the film just offered up only small bits of the answer to its mystery made me pay attention even more because I didn't want to miss a thing or a potential clue to the end. Add in the fact that there was tremendous performances from literally every actor and actress that was in the cast and you have a formula for a movie that didn't disappoint me in the entertainment department.The only real downside is the fact I don't think there's much replay value in the movie because I don't think the impact the ending and story had on me will be the same as it was during the first time around. However,that doesn't change the fact the film is amazing! Hi! My name is Rev. Ron and I love movies! So much so that I write a blog where I review whatever film I am currently watching.

Avengers: Age of Ultron," Another great chapter in the MCU!
","I've been a loyal Marvel fan since I was a kid and the shared universe film series that began with 'Iron Man' has pretty much become my drug of choice. I was very excited for 'Age of Ultron' and the film did not disappoint me in any way.Joss Whedon does a tremendous job on this last Marvel film he created. He balances the large cast exceptionally well, develops all the characters perfectly, introduces new characters seamlessly, showcases a story that is bigger in scope and darker in tone but was still able to bring in great humor and tops it all off with great special effects and killer action.The only things I didn't dig was, occasionally, the action was muddled and hard to watch and Ultron takes a long time to really show off that he is a huge threat. However, these complaints did absolutely NOTHING to kill the fun I had watching it because the movie develops the universe so well and takes great strides in setting up set pieces that will come into play in the next phase of films.",10,29,63,2 May 2015
Elysium," Copley steals the movie!
","I was excited to see this one because Neill Blomkamp made a fan out of me with 'District 9' and I was pleasantly surprised to see he made another epically awesome sci-fi film! The story is just awesome and has all the elements of an addicting formula. The characters are fun, the performances are great and the action is so gritty and awesome that I wanted more of it.If the movie had any problems, it's the fact that the story is a little chaotic as it will shift gears and alter course abruptly during its running time and some of the characters felt like they needed more development. However, the bad in this film is so small that it didn't stop me from loving every second.Finally, while Matt Damon was great as Max, it was Sharlto Copley that stole the movie as Kruger. His character was so psychotic, so tough and so interesting that I wanted to see more of him and I would actually pay money for a Kickstarter fund to see him get his own film that tells his story.Overall, 'Elysium' is a great movie!",9,0,3,19 August 2013
Selma," Powerful!
",Our society is a long way from true equality but we've come very far and 'Selma' really helps show that.The film does take some slight liberties with the history—like the fact that King's real speeches are owned by another studio and they didn't have the rights to use them in this film—but that doesn't take away from the power the story has. Combine that with a great cast and the inspirational tone of the film and you have a very moving feature.,10,0,1,2 July 2015
12 Years a Slave," Good movie...but Best Picture good?
","I won't try and deny the impact '12 Years a Slave' has. The unblinking way the film looked at the torture, horror and torment that was slavery is brutal, hard to watch and leaves an emotional mark on the viewer. The film tells a great, powerful story (and interesting too since it's based on a true story) and the performances from Chiwetel Ejiofor and Michael Fassbender are truly fantastichowever, I can't help but feel the movie is overrated.While the film is good and it definitely made me cry at the end when Solomon Northup was finally found and set free, the movie had a very messy plot that really failed at expressing that it really was 12 years that Northup had to go through after being kidnapped and sold into slavery. I understand that director Steve McQueen and the screen writer wanted to solely show the horrors of this journey from Northup's perspective but this ended up making the film feel like it was incomplete. It jumps from scene to scene and there was no real sense of time passing. The entire film felt like it took place over a few weeks or a month or two but, suddenly as Northup is being set free, I see he has gray hair and I found myself saying, 'Well, I guess 12 years have passed.' I couldn't help but feel it would have been nice to see how his family was handling it or the progress of finding him. Without this and only seeing what Northup was going through, the movie felt like stuff was left on the editing room floor and just gave an overall sloppy appearance of the plot.Did I dislike '12 Years a Slave?' Absolutely not. Did it feel like it wasn't living up to what it could have been? Absolutely. The film told a fantastically emotional and powerful story but it presented it in a way that looked like it was more concerned with getting as many big name actors attached to it than it was telling a complete tale. While a good movie, I just didn't find the film to be a great one.Hey there! The name is Rev. Ron and I love movies!

Edge of Tomorrow," Watch, enjoy, repeat
","As more and more trailers came out for 'Edge of Tomorrow' the more excited I became and, after watching it, I'm soooo glad I spent the money needed to see it in the theater because it is EXACTLY how a summer blockbuster should be! Since I'm a gamer, I really enjoyed the story because this is the closest a movie will come to actually showing off the feeling of playing a video game. The whole 'live, die, repeat' was broadcast perfectly and we really get a feeling that Cage (Tom Cruise) is growing with each reboot—just like when you play a particularly hard level in a video game and keep dying but you get to learn the tricks to surviving with each passing life and refusal to enter in the Konami Code. Cruise was just awesome in the film as he perfectly plays a guy who is doing everything he can to not serve in the war against the aliens to a guy who finally learns how to master his exoskeleton Jacket and transforms himself into an alien killing machine to a guy who realizes the weight of all humanity is on his shoulders and must do what is right for the future of the human race to continue. Cruise nails all these attributes and is capable of being very amusing all the way through, as well.Now, this shouldn't come as a surprise, but (are you ready for this?) Emily Blunt was fantastic in her role as Rita, the alien tail-kicking, make Ripley cry because she can't compete with her epicness and armed with a sword stolen from Cloud from 'Final Fantasy VII' soldier. It's a fact of life that Blunt is a great actress. You can't deny it. To do so would be like saying that chocolate and peanut butter aren't perfect for each other, the sky isn't blue, and that crazy doesn't belong on Fox News. Not only was she intense, tough, and determined in her role, she was also capable of being hard as a rock and a genuine hero without having her sexuality thrown into the mix. It's a rare sight to see a female protagonist that isn't all about being eye candy or sex drive driven. Instead, the moment she steps into the film, in all her exosuit, gigantic sword glory, you know that she isn't her to be the damsel in distress or get doughy eyed around the men-folk (or being portrayed in wearing next to nothingand if this movie was based on a video game, you know the developers would have designed her with a large chest and a thong underneath that suit. The video game industry is sad a lot of the times).Blunt and Cruise (which sounds like a buddy cop sitcom coming to FX this fall) were not the only strong aspects of the cast. In fact, everyone involved is great! The only downside is that a lot of the side characters—who all look like a fun, colorful bunch—aren't as developed as the Cage and Rita characters. This is kind of a bummer but not something that destroyed the film for me. While some characters, like Bill Paxton's (who is just plain fun) may not need extra development because you know what you're getting with him thanks to a fun, great performance from an established actor but many of the members of Cage's squad seem like they would be interesting but the most we learn about them is from gags about how Cage keeps living the same day over and over again and knows all about them when he 'first' meets the crew. This is a downside to the film but not an entertainment killer for me.One thing I wasn't prepared for with 'Edge of Tomorrow' was just how funny the film was. I knew it was going to be a cool Sci-Fi story (and it lived up to that) and I expected awesome action (and I got that) but never did I expect the film to be as funny as it was. Sure, I predicted there would be a couple of chuckle moments here and there but what I got was a film that was, flat-out, hilarious and capable of being so without creating constantly shifting and jarring moves in tones that stepped on the feet of the more serious portions of the film. This film had the balance that so many stories often fail at getting right and that is being a killer story that is filled with drama, tension, excitement, jaw-dropping moments and spectacularly hilarious all at the same time.'Edge of Tomorrow' is exactly what a summer blockbuster is suppose to be. The cast is great, the story is just fantastic, the action is more than enough to satisfy the action portion of your brain and it has the perfect blend of human drama and comedy. I can't wait for this film to come out on Blu-Ray because I plan on watching it over and over againkinda like Cage in this story only more sitting on my bum and more Cheetos eating.",10,3,6,11 June 2014
Whiplash," Fantastic!
","I had no real expectations going into 'Whiplash' because the trailer didn't wow me and I'm not the biggest fan of Miles Teller. However, the film proved to be a lot better than I was ready for.The story offers up no real surprises and there's a love interest element added to Andrew's story of becoming the best drummer and impressing his conductor and it really feels like it doesn't need to be there because the girl (Melissa Benoist) isn't really developed very well and feels forgotten about the rest of the time. However, despite this, the film is beautifully filmed and Miles Teller showed me that he's got some talent as he really showed the determination of Andrew. Also, I don't think I really have to mention that J.K. Simmons dominated as Fletcher, do I? We all know how awesome he is! In the end, 'Whiplash' was a lot better than I thought it was going to be.",8,0,3,13 February 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Offensive to some, hilarious to me...
","Director Martin Scorsese perfectly captures the excess of the Wall Street tycoon in 'The Wolf of Wall Street' and Leonardo DiCaprio once again wow'ed me with an astounding performance as The Wolf himself; Jordan Belfortand then he was once again denied the award he so richly deserved.I should have spent the money needed to see this in the theater or, at the very least, not wait so long after it hit the old RedBox because this movie is just fantastic fun! Sure, it's offensive and the dudes in the story are the type I would never hang out with (mostly because I couldn't afford their suits, couldn't keep up with drug habits, don't agree with their treatment of women and find their endless pursuit of money to be the lifestyle I actively avoid—I'm very poor, by the way), but all this aside, the film tells a great story of excess, greed and extremely loose morals and ethics but it tells it in a flashy, fun and, most importantly, funny way and done with tremendous performances from not only DiCaprio but the entire freakin' cast.From beginning to end, 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is a comedy that shouldn't be funny and a tale of greed and crime that shouldn't be entertaining. However, with all the awful things the story launches at you, the film is a lot of fun, super entertaining, perfectly acted, terrifically edited and filmed, has a great soundtrack and is funny as hades.Why, hello there!

The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Bittersweet farewell to Middle-earth
","And with 'The Battle for the Five Armies' my yearly trip to Middle-earth is once again overand it was a bittersweet farewell.I absolutely loved the last two films and, I'll be honest, this one is my least favorite of the trilogyof course, that isn't me saying I didn't like it or thought it was bad. The only problem I had with the film was there was some computer effects that I just couldn't look past this time and the actual battle between the armies had no real emotional value in it and wasn't as exciting as the stuff we've seen in LOTR. Despite that, the cast is still really great and they are really getting their characters right, I still like this adaptation of the story, and the final fight that sees Thorin taking on Azog was very exciting and entertaining. Finally, the film did do a great job of ending Bilbo's adventure and really made it a sweet but kinda sad goodbye to his life as an adventurer.'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies' may not have been perfect and epically entertaining for me like the last two—and its considerably shorter running time provides the argument that, with some edits, this trilogy could have easily been made into two films—but I still had a great time returning to Middle-earth for one last adventure.",8,3,8,17 December 2014
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Impressive film...but occasionally childish.
","Aside from one hiccup I didn't care for in the film, I really enjoyed 'Birdman.' The cast is great and they are all giving off tremendous performances. It's not really a surprise that Michael Keaton is great in it but it is a surprise how he seems to get better and better with every project. Additionally, I was really digging the story and the fact the film is made to look like one continuous shot ended up working in concert with the story and making the plot feel even more immersing and interesting. Granted, this had the potential to come off like a gimmick and could have worked against the film and story but, in the end, it worked very effectively.My only complaint about the film is the commentary the movie makes about comic book films and critics. Being a fan of comic book movies and a wannabe movie critic, I wasn't so much insulted by this but rather taken back by the childish-like nature of it and its complete lack of subtlety it contained. It became breaks in the film that suddenly went from being a funny, dramatic, and incredibly entertaining to being sorta pretentious, snobby and pretty petty and whiny. Thankfully, this only happened twice before it went back to being a great character-based piece of work.",10,0,4,7 May 2015
The Conjuring," WOW! That was scary!
","I'm not normally a fan of horror films because I think I've burned out my ability to feel fear from years of watching horror films. Mostly I watch this genre because it makes me laugh. So, it's not often that I'm scared watching these films but this one scared the living snot out of me! James Wan (director of 'Saw') made a ghost story/horror film and successfully made it feel real and authentic--and this is coming from a dude who doesn't believe in the supernatural. He magically used light, shadow and sound to create some unbelievable scares that made my hairs stand on end and my heart try to burst out of my chest, leave the theater and hide under my covers on my bed.Finally, the actors cast really did their jobs tremendously and continued the theme of making the movie feel less like a fictional piece of work and something you were actually watching unfold in front of you (yes, I know it's 'based on a true story' but in the world of movies, that doesn't always mean non-fiction.) Overall, I was really impressed (and super scared) of this film.",8,0,2,29 July 2013
The Wolverine," Better than I anticipated...
","I'll admit it, I didn't care for the last solo Wolvie film (but I'm not alone in that one...I just can't forgive the treatment Deadpool got) but you can't really compare the two because this one is lightyears beyond that one.I walked into the theater with minimum expectations--I wasn't expecting greatness but wasn't anticipating failure either--but this one blew me away.Once again, Hugh Jackman proves that like how Downing is to Iron Man, he is to Wolverine but what I really liked is how the film takes Wolvie into a new direction and provides a character-driven story that sees Logan dealing with inner demons and new challenges that go beyond just slicing up as many people as possible with adamantium claws.Then the action they toss in is just a delicious added treat! Just a really great X-title and comic book movie in general!",8,22,41,28 July 2013
The Croods," See Geico, Cavemen CAN be funny...
","I went into this one with very little expectations. I thought it would be mildly entertaining but a movie geared less towards the family experience (like a Pixar movie) and more towards the kids. However, it proved to be really fun.The animation is great and the character designs are fun--although it took a little getting used to as the story takes place in a fictional era of history with creatures that exist only in the minds of animators and artist but, once I accepted this fact, I found myself completely immersed in the film.The voice acting is great in the film as each actor really brings life to their character and seemed almost perfect for their roles. Special mention must go out to Emma Stone, Ryan Reynolds and Nic Cage because each really delivered. Especially Cage. We known that guy for his unique form of overacting but he really brought his A-game to this one as the patriarch to the Crood family.Overall, 'The Croods' is just a great family movie that adults and kids can enjoy. With it's underlining themes about love and the bonds of family, the film offers up some heart with the laughs and becomes just a great, touching movie.You can read a more detail review of this movie and other movies at my blog at http://revronmovies.blogspot.com",8,0,0,3 October 2013
Monsters University," I wanna go to MU!
","I love Pixar's films and I loved 'Monsters, Inc.' Ever since the film came out, I always wanted to see a return to the world that's inhabited by creatures our imaginations tell us live under our bed and in the shadowy corners of our closets. 'Monsters University' fulfilled my wish and it was a very pleasant return.Like most Pixar movies, the story is fun and even touching as it shows the importance of perseverance and friendship. Watching Mike Wazowski and Sully go from bitter rivals to the friends we know them to be in 'Monsters, Inc.' was a fun trip to partake in. Not to mention that Billy Crystal and John Goodman are so amazing in their respective roles and really are able to showcase a chemistry through their voice acting.Which is another strength that Pixar has going for them beyond their superior animation and stories: The cast they bring in to give life to their characters. This one has some great actors in it but one of my personal favorite performers in this one was Helen Mirren as the dragon/centipede head monster of the school; Dean Hardscrabble. Her chilling and calm voice seemed tailor made for the character design.For Pixar's first prequel, 'Monsters University' is a great addiction to the fictional world where monsters exist and, sometimes, have lives no different than our own.Hi!

Saving Mr. Banks," Great family entertainment
","I'll be honest, there was only one reason I watched this film: Tom Hanks as Walt Disney. However, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it.While I've seen 'Mary Poppins' dozens of times in my child years (they're like adult years but you're younger), I honestly didn't think a film about Disney trying to finagle the rights away from author P.L. Travers would have been that interesting of a film but I was surprised by how great of a family film the movie proved to be.Emma Thompson is simply fantastic as Travers as she captures, pretty much perfectly, a character that is intentionally annoying her rights-suitor, who viciously defends her property, who is deep down a broken and sympathetic character and is amusing the entire time. The scenes she shares with, literally, anyone in the film just keeps the story flowing amazingly well and are a joy to watch. Whether it be her annoying the song writers trying to give her a feel for how the movie is going to be, Walt Disney trying to prove that Poppins is in good hands or just Paul Giamatti's character (Travers' driver) trying to melt her icy façade, all these scenes just work to create a character that is not only interesting to watch but crafts a story that unfolds at a terrific pace and is touching the entire way through.And you can't forget that the movie gives you Tom Hanks as Walt Disneythat's just awesome! 'Saving Mr. Banks' is a terrific family film that showcases the hoops the Disney company went through to bring the iconic film with Julie Andrews to the screen. The movie is touching, funny and heartwarming and has just the right amount of sap and cheesiness to make it a great family film and great enough to overlook the inaccuracies of Travers being okay with the final product (Spoilers: She actually hated the film and never forgave Disney for it).Greetings, Earthling!

Thor: The Dark World," Better than the first!
","I'm a huge comic book geek and have been loving this undertaking that Marvel Studios has taken with their shared cinematic universe. I thought it couldn't get any better than 'The Avengers' but the Phase II films were set up with a terrific, introspective and surprising film in the shape of 'Iron Man 3' and now 'Thor: The Dark World' comes in and continues an epic build up to the next Avengers film.I actually believe this film was better than Thor's first movie (and I LOVED that one!) because we get to see a film that simultaneously has a larger, galactic focus but is still personal as it develops Thor and Jane's love and Thor and Loki's bitter sibling rivalry. Not to mention we also get a villain that is able to fill in Loki's shoes as the antagonist perfectly. While Malekith may not be a recognizable name to non-comic fans, Christopher Eccleston really brought the character to life and made him chilling and foreboding.Finally, the special effects are fantastic, we get to see more of Asgard than we did in the first film, the make-up effects were just absolutely stunning, the action is intense and exciting and the movie is very, very funny! Plus, we get to see more of Heimdell and whenever you get more Idris Elba in a film, you win! 'Thor: The Dark World' really felt like a comic book come to life and is how a comic adaptation should be. It's just plain fun, action packed and filled with larger-than-life characters.Hi!

The Purge," The concept is great...but the execution...
","I'll be honest, I like the concept of this film more than the final product. I'm not saying I didn't like the movie--I did--it's just that with the story, it had the potential to be something amazing. It just didn't live up to what it had going for it.The one thing that hurts this movie is the fact the story is a little sloppy. The movie offers up a twist ending (and it's even perfectly foreshadowed at the beginning) but the problem comes because the plot doesn't feel feathered out well enough and many of the characters aren't developed as well as they should be. This ends up making most of the story and the ending feel either quickly or haphazardly put together. Even with a twist ending that makes perfect sense feels like it was tacked on.Many of the characters felt like they should have a richer background and this could have made some of these characters more interesting or more sympathetic but all development was focused on the tormented family. While having a mystery figure play the antagonist (and Rhys Wakefield played it awesomely), it would have been nice to see the character have a little more depth to it.But not all is bad in this movie. While it has its shortcomings, most of the cast (especially Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey) are great in their roles and director James DeMonaco did a great job at crafting tension and a feeling of claustrophobia for the family trapped in their house...and we can't forget just how awesome the concept of living in a world where crime is legal once a year for 12-hours and how it is just instant thriller material! 'The Purge' had a lot of potential going into it as it called back to those great sci-fi tales about Utopian societies that carry the dark secret of how they got to be so great but, due to a little messiness, the film ends up wasting its potential and just ends up an average (but decent) movie.You can read a more in-depth review of this (and other) movies at my blog at revronmovies.blogspot.com",6,0,0,7 October 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," I didn't care for the first one but kinda dug this one...
","When the first film came out, I wouldn't say I was pushing over my own mother to get to the theater and see it. I'll be honest, I had no interest in the film but I will give every movie a shot, so when I had the opportunity came to see it(read that as when I get to see it for really cheap or for free), I gave it a chance and wasn't really wowed by it. The story really didn't interest me, the characters weren't really ones I found too captivating and there wasn't much development going on where I could see it being a franchise I would be a fan of—However, I did love the character of Haymitch Abernathy and Woody Harrelson's performance of him. My lack of interest in the film ended up raising the blood pressure of some people I know and even caused a dude to flip out on me and call me a snob. All because when he asked me if I like 'The Hunger Games,' I shrugged my shoulders and said, 'Not really but Woody Harrelson's character is cool.' When 'Catching Fire' hit the theaters,family, friends, coworkers, the drug addict that sits outside my apartment and the guy I pay to randomly attack me so I stay on my toes told me that since I wasn't a fan of the first one I would do a complete turn around if I watched 'Catching Fire' because it was just that good. Add to the fact my girlfriend really likes the books and wanted to see the movie, I gave it a chance and I have to say; They were right.I'm not going to say that I'm now a huge fan of the franchise but I did dig this one more than the previous one. The story was far more interesting to me and the tension and drama that was built upon the first outing easily grabbed me. The new characters that were introduced (like Plutarch Heavensbee, Johanna and Finnick Odair) were very interesting and played by just fantastic actors (Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Jena Malone and Sam Clafin respectively). Finally, the movie ends on a great cliffhanger that just gets the heart pumping for the next adventure.Granted, the film still had its issues for me that kept me from really jumping full bore on the 'Hunger Games' bandwagon (right now, I would say I'm just holding on to the side and seeing where the road goes). For example, the action still isn't that exciting (but a little more thrilling than the last one), a lot of characters are underdeveloped and just here to raise the body count in the games (and most of the deaths occur off-screen and that is disappointing in and of itself), Josh Hutcherson is still a very underwhelming actor and, because of it, I can't quite figure out if his character is suppose to be a likable one or not (not to mention, he kinda comes off as a tad incompetent) and, I know people are going to hate me for this, but some of Jennifer Lawrence's performance was hard to deal with as she laid on the hammy acting way too thick.However, these issues aside, I still enjoyed myself watching 'Catching Fire.' While I still wasn't completely wowed, I did find a film that was just entertaining to watch that my interest is definitely piqued when it concerns the next film.Hi! My name is Rev. Ron and I love movies! So much so that I write a blog where I review whatever film I am currently watching (Old or new!).

Godzilla," He's still the King of all monsters!
","After 60 years, Godzilla proves that he is still the boss! I've been trying to be patient waiting for this movie ever since I saw the Oppenheimer teaser trailer at San Diego Comic-Con last year but it was too hard. However, finally, I got to see it in IMAX 3D and it was everything I wantedand then Godzilla came in and tail-whipped and atomic breathed my expectations into the stratosphere and beyond.Other than having a minor complaint of wanting to see more of some characters (and believe me, this was an extremely minor complaintto the point it pretty much doesn't exist), the film is incredible. Director Gareth Edwards did a tremendous job of really giving Godzilla that sense of scale he deserves (and that matters since this is the largest presentation of the King of all Kaiju we've ever seen) and the story Edwards showed was capable of being a non-stop thriller of a monster movie, a knock-down/drag-out creature battle and a story of humans feeling inadequate against the mighty power of nature itself.I really enjoyed everything about this film and it proved to be what summer blockbuster popcorn epics are supposed to be. The scope is huge, the cast is superb, the story is fantastic, the special effects are enough to make the tin foil hat conspiracy theorists take a break from false flag theories to ones that Obama engineered a radioactive lizard and make them believe what they are watching is a documentary, and the action is exciting and worthy of some of the best in Godzilla's long and rich history.And I can't forget the soundoh man, the sound is so great in this film. There's nothing like hearing that iconic roar and feel it rumble your seat like the beast himself is outside the theater! My anticipation for 'Godzilla' was high but it was met and exceeded with this reboot to the franchise. I know giant monster movies don't have the greatest history of performing well at the box office here in the States but, Man Alive, I sure hope this makes bank at the box office because I want to see several sequels with this new Godzilla.Hey there!

What We Do in the Shadows," Great, great, great comedy!
","Very simple but extremely creative sums up 'What We Do in the Shadows' pretty well. That and extremely funny! In the wrong hands, this film could have been a complete mess but with it being written, directed and starring Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi and having an incredible cast right there with them, the film proved to be a wickedly entertaining feature with tons of laughs throughout the entire run. Everything about this film was awesome to me. The costumes looked great, the makeup was cool, the sets looked excellent, the jokes are top notch stuff, the characters are fun and the acting is fantastic! There was nothing about this film that didn't work for me and it made for a film with a very high replay value.",10,1,3,11 August 2015
Kingsman: The Secret Service," So much fun!
","Director Matthew Vaughn delivered with this one and delivered in a big way. Like, this movie needs sequels and 'Can I buy it now on Blu-Ray?' big way.The story to 'Kingsman' is action-packed and never ever lets up on being funny and exciting. The action scenes are incredibly put together and are capable of being amusing and totally badass in the same sequence—not to mention they actually proved that it is possible for Colin Firth to play an action hero. Additionally, the film is incredibly self-aware and wasn't afraid of taking easy shots at itself or the entire spy genre. While not technically a parody, the film is reminiscent of the time when parody meant you could both love and make fun of the genre you were working in—not this stuff now that is just people falling down, getting hit in the nuts, and dated pop references within a scene that kinda/sorta resembles the movie it is trying (and usually failing) to make fun of.Finally, the film has a truly epic cast of talented actors all performing interesting characters. I had some reservations about Taron Egerton because I never saw him before but he was absolutely fantastic in the film. When you have him, Colin Firth showing he can be a tough guy and the suave spy, Mark Strong perfectly balancing being a badass and a funny guy, Michael Caine being Michael Caine and showing that there isn't a role he can't play, and having Samuel L. Jackson look like he is having the time of his life as the wickedly fun villain Valentine, this film proves to have a cast that works as insanely well as every other aspect of the film.I have no complaints about this film because I saw nothing that didn't work. Even the film's music never falters as it tosses out a great score that feels like it belongs with the Marvel Cinematic Universe and is capable of using a popular song like the guitar solo to 'Free Bird' to make movie magic and scenes that are memorable. Everything about this film worked for me and resulted in a film that is action-intoxicating and stupidly hilarious. It will be a sin if this film doesn't become a franchise and get several sequels.",10,8,19,23 January 2015
The Hangover Part III," I guess it was a decent one to end the trilogy on...
","The first movie is awesome and I felt like the second was clearly not needed...and yet they went with it and pushed it further for a third one. Was it worth it? Eh...maybe.While nowhere near as funny as the first film, this third movie offers up some amusing moments but they are way too few and far between. The movie also goes darker than the rest of the franchise and does so without any comedy to back it up. In fact, it's like the script was a crime drama first and then retooled to include Zach Galifianakis.And speaking of Zach...This movie has way, WAY too much Alan. While the character stole the first movie and, I won't lie, has some great moments in this one but there is such a thing as too much Alan...and bringing in more Alan meant pushing both Stu (Ed Helms) and Phil (Bradley Cooper) into the background and neither really get any time to be funny.However, the film wins back points for including funny gal Melissa McCarthy into the story and even more points for adding John Goodman, and his amazing acting talent, to the roster.'The Hangover Part III' isn't outright terrible but it wasn't that great either. It has its moments but just not enough of them to be even worthy of the first film. That being said, this trilogy could have ended on a worse note and, in reality, it wasn't a bad ending to the series...just please don't make anymore.You can read a more in-depth review of this movie (and others) at my blog at revronmovies.blogspot.com",6,0,3,7 October 2013
Minions," How can you not like these little guys?
","It honestly was just a matter of time before this film happened because those little guys called the Minions quickly inserted themselves into pop culture and took the world by storm. What's not to like about them? They're adorable, they like bananas (because they're delicious), and they're funny. I really enjoyed their escapades in 'Despicable Me' and its sequel so, needless to say, I was all aboard for this film.The story of Minions is a funny and entertaining one that is created with great voice acting and fantastic animation. Additionally, the film has just an absolutely fantastic soundtrack filled with killer tracks from the late 60s rather than the bubblegum pop from the 'Despicable Me' films. The only thing I really didn't care for was how underwhelming Scarlett Overkill was as not just a character but how she was voiced by Sandra Bullock. She's not overtly terrible as the antagonist but she doesn't feel like she's giving her all to the role. This sorta mirrors how the character doesn't feel as threatening as she could be or as larger-than-life as she needed to be.My complaints are minor for this one because, at the end of it all, it's still pretty fun and entertaining. This movie could have easily been just phoned it and slapped together with some cheap jokes and a presentation that would make it feel like it was straight from the bargain bin but the final product was a very funny movie that delivers a very cute and satisfying Minions adventure.",8,8,14,16 July 2015
Inside Llewyn Davis," How are the Coen Brothers this talented?
","Whenever someone tells me the Coen Brothers directed a new movie, I stop letting them speak and say you had me at 'Coen.' I then fly into the air like I'm Superman. Yeah, I can do that! Honestly, 'Inside Llewyn Davis' may not go down as my favorite Coen Brothers movie but it is just as good as their ridiculous talented selves would lead you to believe it would be. Oscar Issac is fantastic as Davis, the presentation looks gorgeous, the story is interesting and emotional, the music is great and you get the trademark unique humor of the Bros. as well. The entire film is like a folk album come to life and decided to look like the album art and play out like one of their songs would stereotypically go and that was the magic of it for me.Granted, I'm probably not going to watch this one as much as I watch 'Fargo' or 'The Big Lebowski' but I will come back to this one and re-watch it numerous times. If only to figure out what crossroads demon the Brothers got their talent fromno mortal (especially two brothers) is capable of being this talented without some help from the supernatural.Good day to you, individual who took the time to read this and possibly hit the button that said this review was helpful (those who click on 'No' on the helpful question, I won't acknowledge youokay, yes I will. How are you?) If you wanna hear more of my ramblings and more of my reviews (including non-Coen movies), you can run on over to my blog at revronmovies.blogspot.com. Or don't, that's okay.

Her," Absolutely amazing...
","While initially interested in seeing this film after hearing it was about a guy falling in love with an operating system, I couldn't help but feel that this film could easily fall off the razor's edge and look like something Adam Sandler would make. However, with Spike Jonze at the helm, such a horror would never occur but there was still a risk this one-of-a-kind film had to take and that risk paid off big time because this movie is incredible.Spike Jonze not only wrote an interesting story that was a compelling look at our modern relationships and dependency on technology but he presented it in a way that was a visual feast and absolutely beautiful to take in. And when you combine the great story and wonderful visuals with the awesomely-amazing acting from Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson, the ending result was a film that was incredible beyond words. Seriously, the acting really has to be mentioned twice because when you realize that, essentially, ScarJo is just a voice and Phoenix is pretty much doing one long extended phone bit and they both are capable of bringing real, honest and true-looking emotion to the screen is, without a doubt, a wonder to behold. 'Her' is capable of being interesting, beautiful, emotional and heartbreaking all at the same time and really took the love story into a direction never before seen. I was completely enthralled with it and just blown away by the film's delivery. Just a fantastic movie.Hello there!

Mad Max: Fury Road," This set the bar high for the films of 2015 and action films in general!
","Unless you identify yourself as a Men's Rights Activist and really hate strong female characters, 'Mad Max: Fury Road' might be the best movie of the summer.The story for this one has the spirit of the other Mad Max films, the characters are terrifically written and performed, Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are particularly awesome in the film and Theron pretty much steals the show as Furiosa, it was cool to see the actor who played Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne) in the first film return and play a new, equally insane character, the action is almost too much to handle and those with weak hearts might go into cardiac arrest from it all (but appreciate it because the action is so awesome) and the over-the-tops elements not only feel at home with the Mad Max franchise but help make it wickedly entertaining and, at times, amusing.Aside from the spectacular action, one of my favorite aspects of the film was how strong the female characters are. None of them come off as weak or set dressings or as damsels in distress. This movie, thanks to the help of George Miller getting Eve Ensler to consult on the characters, isn't compiling with the outdated notion that action films have to be all about gruff, growling men who seem to never shave but actually trim their 5 o'clock shadow. It stinks that this has to be a highlight when, in reality, it should just be expected but it was so refreshing to see an action film with women who just come off as tough and you never have to question why they are that way.Overall, I absolutely loved this film and have no complaints about it. The movie proved that sequels—even done years later—can work and it proved the old, completely outdated notion that Hollywood is still mysteriously pushing in 2015, that it is possible to have strong female characters in an action film. Heck, I actually thought the character of Furiosa was way tougher and cooler than Max and I now want to see a spin-off that's all about her. Hollywood, take note because this movie just took you to school on how to write strong female characters.",10,5,13,19 May 2015
The Great Gatsby," More than a flashy party!
","The movie is pretty, flashy and filled to the brim with decadence...and I feared that may have been the reason why I wouldn't have enjoyed it. However, the film has substance and the flashy special effects and grandeur of the film's visuals all have a part to play that really captures the novel's undertones.I found I enjoyed this movie more than I anticipated as some great performances really made the film's story extremely addicting and very engaging. Leo DiCaprio is great as Gatsby and Tobey Maguire does a great job of leading the film's narrative as Carraway but the real show-stealer for me was Joel Edgerton. Watching any scene he was in was like watching a unicorn give birth to a rainbow--he was amazing, is what I am trying to say.The movie looks good, has great music (although, not indicative of the era)and the actors do their job tremendously. I really enjoyed this one!",8,5,9,20 August 2013
