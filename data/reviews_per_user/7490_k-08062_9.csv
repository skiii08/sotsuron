","The most disappointing thing is that reality is always played by dark human nature and corrupt systems.The most striking thing is the fate of the racing driver who always explores the edge of death.There was a moment when I turned from a world-weary attitude, and the next moment, the brakes failed, the explosion, and the loss of a permanent racer. Beautiful fantasy drivers transcend the reality of winning or losing, to gain their own peace and achievement, not to fall into the secular arena of human nature.",8,0,2,20 March 2020
Forrest Gump," Flying feathers
","I often talk about Forrest Gump with my friends. Forrest Gump is so lucky! That's what my friends always say. I was dumb. I was surprised that Forrest Gump was sitting on that stool, just telling strangers coming and going: 'look, how lucky I am'? Many years ago, I was full of confusion about life. I don't know why people live. Sometimes I sit on the windowsill and say to myself: I'm jumping now, it's no different from living to death. Fortunately, I didn't jump. After thinking about it for two years, I came up with an answer: how can people live better? Although there is no answer to this question, I am not as confused as before. Why are you talking about this? Because when watching this film, I seem to have experienced the process of questioning life again. A normal person has the ability to judge. He knows what is important and what is not. A normal person can have many choices, so he is always biding his time. A normal person will not waste his energy on useless places. But Forrest Gump is not a normal person, his IQ is lower than ordinary people, he even almost entered a school for the mentally handicapped. Girlfriend, school team, army, ping-pong, shrimp farming, running, it seems that everything about him is not his own choice, but the choice of others. Of course, he doesn't ask questions like 'what is life?' He will only foolishly do one thing after another. What exactly is this story about? I think the director said a truth in a very extreme way: choice is likely to mislead life. Because there are too many choices, some people do not work attentively, this attitude further affects his life. In the face of life, maybe you should be prepared: 'Life is like a box of chocolates, you don't know which one you will choose.' I like this film very much. I like the feather flying very much, as if it was myself.",9,1,1,3 April 2020
The Godfather: Part II," I love this movie
","There is a chapter in Godfather Trilogy analysis called 'Major Character Analysis', which makes some comparisons between the two godfathers. Some of these comparisons seem superficial, so here's a personal comparison between Vito and Michael godfathers.The differences on the surface of Vito and Michael, I have always believed, must not be analyzed solely by the differences in the character of two people, but I prefer to analyze the way these two people behave from the times and experiences they live in.One notable difference in careers is that Vito have a good grasp of the godfather role (ease), while Michael have been making great achievements but always seem laborious; another notable difference, for example, is that Vito maintain the family fairly well, and Michael is much worse. The authors of Godfather Trilogy Analysis tend to interpret both as Vito is a very enthusiastic person, but Michael is a cold-blooded.. The analysis is simple, however, because one obvious thing is that Michael have different personalities before and after becoming a godfather, that is to say, many of Michael personalities have evolved after becoming godfathers.For three reasons Vito have a good grasp of the role: experience, interest, and historical background. Vito is from a poor boy who has nothing step by step to the godfather's throne, from childhood to adulthood along the way with a variety of people, including his close friends as brothers, but also his opponents. He was also closest to and tortured by two different-style gang bosses (both Italian style and American style). From the experience, it Vito clear how to be a gangster who is feared by the enemy, trusted by his godson and loved by his loved ones. And do Michael have such experiences? Too bad. He may have never thought of inheriting a profession like his father since childhood. He wants to live like the average American, he has an American name, he has an American sense of honor (joining the Navy), he looks for 100% of American women as girlfriends. So Santino death, Fredo incompetence led to the arrival of the godfather position is too sudden for Michael, how can we expect such an inexperienced man to be able to make the godfather as handy as his father in the short term? Vito used to help people solve the trivial things of rent. Michael? To represent huge family affairs and mass killings of real guns. Vito got Clemenza such a capable arm along the way, adopted and cultivated Tom Hagen such a perfect-minded family lawyer; and",9,0,0,29 March 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," (Serious spoiler, suggested to read the article after viewing the film)
","(Serious spoiler, suggested to read the article after viewing the film)First of all, a statement of position, I was Quentin was originally a fan, then ordinary fans, now become passers-by. QT has gone downhill since the last long film, the Eight Evil One, which lasted 182 minutes, is far less narrative and Quentin-style than it was before.The Hollywood Past is no exception. The film lasts 162 minutes, and the narrative is even worse than the previous Eight Evil One.To begin with, the first time you know QT want to film the story starts with the news: QT want to remake the story of Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski, fans should know the story better. My initial expectation of QT the new film was that the story would be adapted into a QT-style action film and could then contain elements of suspense and B film, which should be enough for a fan.But the whole movie is so weird that many characters don't know what it means to be there.First of all Sharon Tate this is supposed to be the most important role. When she went to the cinema to see her own film, she put her foot up on the front chair and QT shot her foot all the time, making me think that the meaning of Sharon Tate was to satisfy QT fetish about Margot Robbie.And then there's the well-deserved Charles Manson of the character, which, by reason, is the main character. The result is not, the most surprising is that the Manson is played by Damon Herriman, unknown, and manson this role in the play only once, about two minutes of the play, people can not understand.Then the Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth, roles of Leonardo and Brad Pitt were even more surprising, first showing that both characters were fictional character, meant to be non-existent, and then the whole film, two hours and 42 minutes, two hours of the story of the two men, verbose and confusing, especially Cliff bragging about Pierce's nest, I really do n' t know what Quentin's doing.Then there is the discussion of the Bruce Lee plot, first QT exaggerating the Bruce Lee accent, and the real Bruce Lee muscle content does not know how much more than the play, and then by Cliff this fictional character to degrade Bruce Lee, is also confusing.The next step is what you call '30 minutes worth the fare back.' First I say, these 30 minutes are not worth the fare back. If you've seen QT past movies, you do n' t think the 30 minutes are much better. Although the 30 minutes are really good compared to the work of the ordinary director, they can only be ordinary to QT, even his work",6,0,3,18 March 2020
Schindler's List," Why do we shed tears?
","Why do we shed tears? A person we have never heard of is very far away from us to die, will you shed tears, CCTV News often reported that the death of leaders I am mostly senseless, not I am not patriotic, after all do not know. People are sentimental animals don't know how to talk about sadness, so to make the audience cry for the character you must let the audience have a deep impression on the character. Schindler's List has more than 120 characters, although the audience may not remember all, but remember 20 to 30 is still not a problem, to give a few supporting examples: female servant Helen; the Jewish female engineer; the little girl wearing glasses and her mother; clever little boy; one-armed grandfather; little girl in red and so on each makes the audience impressed like an acquaintance, then when they are in danger killed the audience will be absolutely sad.
The first person the nazis killed in the film was his one-armed grandfather, and spielberg's death of the one-armed old man who would not 'kill innocent people' opened the prologue of the holocaust. Let's look at how the choreographer creates a simple and foolish image of the old man with one arm, and let the audience have feelings or even tears for it. It was Spielberg's first show of his cruelty in this film. What kind of character is most touching? Is it the kind of person who's almost perfect without flaws? Not necessarily, sometimes the existence of small shortcomings but strengthen the role of our domestic film is different, we must distinguish between good and evil bad people must be bad to the bone, good people must be tall and powerful, this is not interesting, now the main theme of the main theme of the anti-Japanese drama are so positive not convinced. The jews in this film are honest and honest, ignorant and servile, but they are sympathetic, such as the one-armed old man, who feels very real because he is approachable.
The hero Schindler was eating, and the secretary told him that someone wanted to see him as a token of gratitude. Schindler was already very unhappy to see the other person was disabled, but had not yet appeared in the face, the one-armed old man was very uninteresting verbose, talking and halting, so finally Schindler sat in his chair to twist his face to the side of the old man, the atmosphere is very funny and awkward. Although Schindler did not say a dissatisfied line but composition and performance betrayed his heart, the composition of this scene is very wonderful subtext is expressed through composition, because the film is black and white film lost color contrast emphasis, so the composition and lighting requirements are higher.
After the old man left the camera to Schindler again, it was a quiet scene is very awkward atmosphere, Schindler's dissatisfaction jumped on the screen. Schindler felt that such a disabled person should not enter his own factory, and his angry face was black and blue and he did not even want to talk to his secretary. This is a further addition to the old and Schindler's image more plump for the next turning point. It was precisely because of this meeting that the audience and Schindler remembered the simple and honest old man, and both felt sorry for his death. It was the death of the Jews who let Schindler love and hate that inspired the conscience and made him determined to save these 'lowly' Jews. Besides, the choreographer took a lot of effort to shape",9,0,1,30 March 2020
1917," good movie
","After watching this, I think if only these four movies, this year's Oscar may come between Marriage Story and 1917. 'Irish' is good, but not beyond the godfather, many people still have doubts about de-aging film technology. 'Inheritance of the Pope' should be based on the male male male match, in the story and film director has not much room for play ;' Marriage Story 'is the 21st century Kramer couple, male and female stars and movies to achieve each other, followed by this amazing '1917'.I always think film is a perfect combination of technology and art. As a director, it is obvious that only technology can not, for example, Marvel DC; only art can not, of course, such as the various cases of failed artist directors. Most directors are of course focused, even very good directors. For example, I like Nolan is obviously more technical hang, and Ang Lee is an artistic origin, on the road of less successful technology pioneers. Most of the time, and this '1917', I really feel the artistic and technical perfection of the director is what.The story itself is simple: the spring of 1917, on the French battlefield of World War I. Two soldiers were selected to deliver an important piece of information that could save the lives of 1600 British soldiers, including the brother of one of them. The problem is that the task seems impossible: the enemy lines, trenches, and scorched earth are in front. And they only have two, and less than 24 hours.Under this setting, what would you do if you were the director? You can play a biography of a saint like Blood Wars Hacksaw Ridge, or you can shoot a human test like Save the Great War Ryan, or a shell bomb like most of the war films, with lofty ambitions. But the film was made into a long shot -- even if not -- an immersive war experience. Imagine you live in a big escape game, ahead of all kinds of checkpoints, enemies, traps, you have only one chance, can not be restarted, the only advantage is to have two lives (two soldiers), but the game is over when you die. In the film's two hours, the camera around the two protagonists, their every move, their breath, fear and hope, have been counted into the camera. The audience becomes them, their fear becomes the fear of the audience, their despair becomes the despair of the audience, and their bravery becomes the bravery of the audience. From a technical point of view, I think it's worth shooting a trivia of at least the same length, and I really want to see how Roger Diggins, who was able to seal the shots of Shawshank's Redemption, took those shots, thinking about the Andy shot in the rain. He was nominated 13 times for an oscar and never won, and if he doesn't win this time, I have the urge to smash the kodak theatre (just found out that he won the silver wing killer 2049 the year before last).The story of sending intelligence sounds so simple, but does not give people a minute of boring plot, because in the overall tense rhythm, the director also arranged Zhang Chi's environment and scene settings.

Joker," Nine points, Phoenix is worth an Oscar
","Nine points, Phoenix is worth an Oscar, the performance is too emotional, with uncontrollable laughter to express pain, even laugh to make people sad. The film is very different from most of the previous superhero movies, with no special effects, no wonders, or even too many action scenes. But in a slightly retro way, tell why the clown became that clown. It's a serious film, including social issues. It's evil, and it' ll make you feel a little sorry for the clown. In addition, the film should not be sequel and derivative, because it is still too real, if the character re-caricized, it is no longer him.",9,0,0,17 March 2020
Parasite," It was also a well-completed and well-expressed popular film
","It was also a well-completed and well-expressed popular film, but the palm did find it unworthy. I don't deny it at all, but I do n' t think it's necessary to retell it. I think there are great shortcomings in three aspects :1, the development of the plot is not logical. 2. expression means symbolic meaning is too straightforward, low-level. 3. theme is not deep.First look at the first, generally speaking a story is very strong film for the development of the plot in line with the basic logic is a minimum requirement. Of course, I fully agree that there is a de facto logical sacrifice required for thematic expression and dramatic effects. But the parasite's sacrifice did not achieve the same thematic expression, which is not ok. For example, the placement of four family members into wealthy families, which accounts for almost one-third of the films, was dramatic and smooth. When the first day of the male master's visit when suddenly the spirit of his sister when suddenly put forward, I feel wonderful, feel very clever, because after all received a salary more than the previous tutor, it is normal to double this salary. But then it was arranged a little bit, and it was so smooth. Second, if the smooth entry into the mansion is needed for the development of the plot, then these people can also be qualified for the mansion job seems even more fake. The rich's nannies and drivers are n' t so good, especially nannies, who have been working with former builders for years to get used to the job. And the whole conversation and manner, the slum environment living in the old couple can not be unmasked. Of course, the director did not fail to take this into account, adding Song Kanghao at home rehearsals and the male owner complained about Song Kanghao on the edge of the play. But it is still not enough, and the overall logical rationality is very fragile. Third, the night of the camping scene, drink all know four people in the living room drink wine and even broke over the wine cup can taste it, the hostess did not even notice, even on the sofa hit a shot, all over the glass residue was only a sweep of Kim Kiting a simple treatment, also unaware, this is basically intolerable illogical. There are a lot of such examples, I admit that some are necessary, but in the overall advance, the director did too much to advance. In particular, the final garden battle, frankly speaking, is it necessary, this ending does not feel a little abrupt, this is the director stall spread out there is no way to solve the outcome of the conflict created by the climax of the solution ah. And the end of the garden battle is the same, leaving the people in need, one to stay in the basement to write, the other to receive letters outside. And Song Kanghao also did not know when his son can come to see, so every day to knock on the Morse code, that lights flash all night our German residents do not find someone to repair. Forget it, you can't stop",7,1,3,18 March 2020
The Silence of the Lambs," The silent lamb
","Starling is not a simple woman, only ignorant people can be really simple. Starling's character is complex, she is rational, smart and ambitious, which is said by Hannibal herself, and she also knows how to deal with interpersonal relationships quite tactfully. These traits are one of the reasons why Hannibal likes her. Hannibal said he hates rude people, and 'etiquette' and 'restraint' are precisely the suppression and domestication of human anti-animal instincts. Most simple people follow their own nature and act bluntly without thinking, and Starling is definitely not one of those people. On the contrary, she seems to be a little too self-restrained, causing this cold beauty to constantly reveal her fragile fragility under her strong appearance, adding a bit of lovable beauty to her. but in addition, you can strongly feel a cold heart and an unshakable belief that you are in a weak position. Hannibal has always been a man with excellent mental control and seems to have transcended all the limitations of human inferiority. He advocates reason, intelligence, and appreciates classical literature and music (remember the Gothenburg variation in the background when he was in a cage, Bach's music is recognized as the most rational). He must have loved the grandeur of classical tragedies more than the pleasures of earthly life. So there is no doubt that Starling is typical of his favorite image: rational, strong, neat, self-respecting, sensitive, and because of the shadow of childhood or her nature, she has a strong melancholy temperament and the lonely beauty of isolating the crowd. a little neurotic can also please a psychiatrist. So Hannibal should be attracted to her at first sight.
In the end, however, it was the story of the screaming Lamb that eventually prompted Hannibal to fall in love with Starling, which was so idealized and symbolized that it had a certain allegorical color. That kind of compassionate feelings, the great love for human suffering, make Starling exude a kind of holy martyrdom, but also make Hannibal explore her story again and again and be deeply shocked. Hannibal has always been sure of analyzing people's minds, and Starling is an exception. He had speculated that she might have been sexually abused by relatives or wanted to escape from a poor and barren childhood, no matter which kind of trauma was limited to her personal misfortune. It is common for people to hurt themselves because of bad luck, even if it is reasonable and reasonable, because it still cannot escape the scope of personal grief, and the resulting tragedy is marked by a particular experience. And the real profound tragedy should be a more universal, not based on this appearance, based on the origin of life shudder. It needs to put aside the abusive self-catharsis and resonate with it with a rational and simple soul. So Starling's story was a big surprise to Hannibal. She saw other creatures suffering, grieving for them, and giving up everything to save them, a state that few people could achieve. It is an exaggeration to say that there is an awareness of Christ carrying the cross. So Hannibal would give an infinitely gentle sigh, 'Thank you, Starling.' I think the second half of what he didn't say should be 'Thank you, Starling, you have given me a little bit of confidence in human beings.' So 'the world is more interesting because of you'. The only physical contact between the two men in the film was a touch of the index finger, reminiscent of Michelangelo's famous mural Genesis, and God's finger turned Adam into a spiritual connection between God and man. this passage in the film may suggest a subtle shift in the relationship between Hannibal and Starling. The dialogue between the two of them across the cage is my favorite part of the play. The exquisite performance and deep music are very touching. There was a lot of symbolic dialogue, and Starling said that at first she wanted to release the lambs, but they 'didn't know how to run away, they just stood there confused and didn't want to go.' How similar these lambs are to the dull world. Even if they are given physical freedom, they are still prisoners of their own souls. They all say that the strong save themselves and the saints pass from one person to another, but most mediocre people do not know how to escape from the tragedy of life. They are even so sad that they do not realize that they are in a tragedy. They only keep wandering outside the heavenly gate with a fragile heart and a wandering soul, constantly indulging in pain. Keep screaming in my heart. And all this cruelty is masked by a colder silence between heaven and earth. As sung in 'The Sound Of Silence', when silence becomes a sound, making people think that everything is normal, but tearing apart this layer of appearance, is it not the execution ground of hell burning in the scorching sun in front of us? The pain and weight of life will unbiased fall on everyone's head, as Starling said, 'they are too heavy.' Did Starling really hear the 'scream' of the lamb when she was a child? I think the answer is probably no (for movies only). It's winter night, everyone is sleeping, and the butchers shouldn't have started yet. How could the humming of a few weak lambs be big enough to wake up Starling in the room? Why can't other people just hear this sound? So this 'scream' is probably an abstract intention, a voice that exists only in Starling's heart, and echoes again and again like a nightmare as an adult. This is the symbolism used in the film. The title of the film tells us that 'the Lamb is always the most silent animal', but only in Stelline's eyes they keep asking for help and struggling because of suffering. In the final analysis, it is because she has a sensitive insight into the world. Many times as sensitive as ordinary people and several times as compassionate as ordinary people, Starling is not destined to be a happy person. Hannibal's sketch shows her dressed in white with a lamb in her arms, and her eyes seem gentle but exude a desolate and resolute strength, which bears a resemblance to the Virgin Mary. In fact, if we talk about the topics of 'the strong' and 'the weak', is it true that each of us is not a 'weak' in front of nature and fate? And the world itself may be the greedy eyes that Hannibal said. People come to the world with the original sin called desire, unconsciously fighting against each other, forming an invisible and huge net, each person is not only the giver of evil, but also the victim of evil; both greedy peeping and frightened escape; both a sinner and a victim, there is no escape, no escape. Like poor bad boy Bill, like the man who looked at Starling at the airport, like those contemptuous male policemen, like you and me. Perhaps, in the eyes of Hannibal, human beings are pathetic, struggling for their own interests, but can not escape the butcher's knife of fate, and will eventually be mercilessly swallowed up by life, just like stupid and frightened lambs waiting to be slaughtered, ignorance, numbness, pitiful and pathetic. It can be said that Hannibal has been looking down on human beings with a cold reason, just like a ruthless god, who does not know what benevolence is, regards all things as a ruminant dog, and cannot change human tragedies, so he is indifferent. Until he met Starling, a shepherd girl who, sensitive by nature and aware of human tragedies, was crying to save even one lamb, a thin, frail girl who tried to carry all the sufferings of the world on her shoulders. The two people are both similar and completely opposite. So Hannibal's love for Starling is not only a sympathy for each other, but also a guardian of the beautiful soul of dissidents. 'Brave Clarice, if one day your lamb stops screaming, will you come and tell me?' If this world can really become the kingdom of heaven one day, even the ruthless gods will be a little moved, right?",9,0,0,3 April 2020
