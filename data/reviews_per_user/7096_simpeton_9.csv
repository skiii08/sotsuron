Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's a BEGINNING, People!
","For all the people who are complaining about this movie, I would just like to point out that you are the people who never cared for the other three in the first place.  You just got caught up in the 'hype' and didn't want to be left out.  So you jumped on the 'cool' bandwagon and started talking about how always loved the first three, thinking you had us fans fooled, but we knwe.  You know how?  We ask you what you thought of the Phantom Menade after you watched it.  And when someone started saying how 'it didn't go anywhere' or 'it just kind of ended with no real resolution' or 'JarJar Binks was nothing but comic relief', we know you are just jumping on the bandwagon.If you people will take the time to watch the original three, particularly Star Wars, you will realize how obvious you really were.  This is not one movie on its own.  It is Act I.  The first trilogy was that way as well.  If you watch Star Wars on its own, it doesn't hold up as well.  If you watch it realizing it is just the beginnig of one long movie consisting of three individual Movie length sections, it works completely.  The same holds true for the Phantom Menace.  It is only the beginning of one long movie, to be shown in three parts.  It introduces the characters, sets up the basic plot, and gets you thru the first segment of a longer story.  The first trilogy was one long story how Anakin Skywalker redeemed himself.  This trilogy is the story of his original fall from Grace.  That is how you should view it. I mean, you don't read just the book of Genesis in the Bible and just say 'Well, this really don't seem like it's gonna go anywhere.'  It has to be taken as a whole, or at least a small part of a larger story until the whole thing can be taken in.As far as JarJar goes, of course he is the comic relief.  What do you think R2 and C3PO were in the originals for?  Sure, they saved the day a few times, particularly R2, but for the most part they were there to make you laugh.  Same with the Ewoks.Oh well, that's my little explanation for all you bandwagon jumpers out there.  But don't worry, when the other two films come out, I'm sure we'll see you again, telling us about the masterful way this story was told across three movies, and all the detail that allowed them to put into the characters",10,0,1,12 August 2000
Unbreakable," Either You Get It, or You Don't
","The way to think about this movie as you are watching it, is to imagine it as a comic book brought to film.  Not like X-Men or even Superman, where it's all action with little attention to detail or story.  It's hard for people who don't read comics and look down on them in general to believe, but there ARE a lot of comic books out there that are more cerebral than any book or novel they ever read.  This is THAT type of comic.Yes, a few of the plot points are far fetched, but that's the way it is with a comic book, or even a novel.  It's called 'suspension of disbelief' and it means that you just accept the story and don't nitpick every minor detail. If you can't do that, then you will never enjoy ANY work of fiction, no matter how High Brow.  'How could it work out that the two main characters just happen to live in the same city?'  'How did Elijah's physical therapist just happen to be David's wife?'  Because it is a story and it works out better for the story if those things happen that way.The other thing I see most people questioning is this 'How could he have never been sick, never been injured, and not know it?'That one actually has a very simple psychological answer that has nothing to do with fiction.  It's called repression of the past.  Your mind is an amazing thing.  It can have all kinds of knowledge stored up inside it, that you don't access because a decision is made by you subconsciously that you DON'T want to know, or remember.  Have you ever met someone who was sexually abused as a child, but didn't even know it until they were thirty?  I have. It's because on some level their mind decided they could either have that in their head all the time, or the knowledge of the abuse could be pushed to a back corner of the mind, never to be thought of again.  It happens all the time.Bruce Willis' character repeats throughout the movie 'I'm just a regular guy.  I'm just a regular guy.'  That's the same thing his mind has been repeating all these years, convincing him he was normal until he had no knowledge of the fact that he wasn't.  The more Elijah made him see the truth, the more David was trying to convince himself other wise.  He wanted a normal life.  He wanted to be with his girlfriend for the rest of his life.  And so his mind cut off any knowledge he might have had of his true nature.  It made him blind to the fact that he had never been sick.  It made him blind to the fact that he had never been hurt.  It is even hinted at in the flashback sequence that the decision to fake the injury after the accident was made subconsciously.The bottom line about this movie is: either you get it, or you don't.  You don't have to be well versed in comic books to enjoy this movie.  But you do have to be able take in all the details.  There are NO insignificant details in this movie.  Everything that is said or done is done for a reason, and leads to something else later in the movie.  If you don't have the temperament to be able to take it all in, you won't understand or like this movie.",10,0,0,7 August 2001
Shakespeare in Love," Flawless
","An excellent film, without flaw, though they did omit Shakespear's deal with Morpheus, that he be given the power to write stories that would be remembered long past his time on earth, in exchange for writing two plays devoted to dreams, namely: 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' and 'The Tempest'. But, one could hardly expect them to include that detail, as it would have clashed with the rest of the story.  Still, all in all, a first class movie.",Null,0,0,2 September 2000
The Shining," What is Idiocy?
","The fact that this movie is even in the top 1000 movies of all time, much less the top 250.  That, in fact, crosses over the line from Idiocy to pure Lunacy, or worse.  Someday, this disturbing race of mutated movie goers who have been dubbed 'Kubrickites' by Pentagon scientists will die off, as their numbers are already dwindling.  Until then, the rest of us simply must tolerate them, and correct them when necessary.",1,63,139,5 May 2003
The Shining," Absolutely Worthless
","Do not waste your time on this movie.  It is one of the best examples of a botched translation from print to screen ever.  It has been inexcusably 'Kubrickized' to make it fit in more easily with the rest of Stanley Kubrick's body of work.Kubrick takes the basic idea from the book-- and I do mean the most absolutely basic outline of the story-- and changes it into something that is not even remotely scary. In the book, the Hotel itself is the fourth main character, slowly driving Jack Torrance insane.  In this utter waste of film, Jack was crazy when they got there, and the isolation from the outside world is what takes him over the edge.  In this bastardized version, there is no point in having Danny possessed of psychic powers, nor of making the Hotel itself haunted.  Those two points, which should be the two most important facts of the story, instead take a backseat to a very predictable, very generic story of an already unstable man finally snapping.Do yourself a favor, and instead of this absolute SIN of a film, watch the made-for-tv mini-series starring Steven Weber.  It is much more faithful to the book, and therefore a much better and well worked story.",1,34,75,22 July 2000
The Shining," Not Worth Your Time, or The Film it was Made On
","AVOID THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Lots of brain dead Kubrick-heads will try to tell you that this is the best Horror Movie ever simply because Kubrick made it.  This is a FALSEHOOD.First off, it's not a Horror Movie.  You have to at least try to be scary to be a Horror Movie.  This film never even makes an effort in that regard.Second off, it's not good.  Even if you try to watch it as just a 'suspense movie' and forget about all this Horror which you are supposed to be exposed thru all throughout this movie, it's still just not a good movie.  There is no plot to speak of.  The Wife and Son, and the Hotel for that matter, who should ALL be treated as equal characters to Jack (and in the case of Danny and the Hotel, MORE important) are all pushed to the side so that we can constantly be treated to scene after scene of Jack Nicholson completely botching every aspect of his character.  How the man ever had a career, much less a successful one, after this travesty is beyond me.Do yourself a favor and try to catch the ABC TV Miniseries version.  Stephen King actually oversaw that one to make sure it came out right.  And it did.",1,14,33,7 April 2003
The Shining," Complete and Utter Crap
",Not much else really needs to be said.  It's not scary.  It's not interesting.  There is no real story.  A complete waste of film that Stanley Kubrick should have had too much shame to release.  Read the book and then watch the Mini Series.  You will be much happier with the results.,1,13,33,20 June 2001
Resident Evil," Really, REALLY, Bad
","The two main things about this movie that bothered me the most are as follows:1:  They never established a sense of utter hopelessness.  In any Zombie flick this is the key.  Zombies are dumb, clumsy, and slow.  The only way to make them a true threat is to have your heroes in as small and unescapable place as possible, and to have HORDES of zombies for miles and miles as far as the eye can see.  It has to seem hopeless. While it was clear from the start that at least 2/3 of the supposedly highly trained paramilitary team was expendable, at no time was Milla Jovavich in any danger.  There are scenes in this movie where five or six soldiers are being swarmed by Zombies, and despite all their training and vast weaponry, they can do little.  Then Ms. Jovavich, in her ripped up nightgown and with no weapons at all, drops in on them and goes Bruce Lee for three minutes, and, there ya go, no more Zombie threat. BULL!!2.  While they did seem to spend a decent amount on the special effects for the zombies, the main Mutated Beast that comes at them in the end looked like something Ray Harryhausen might have done for one of his movies in the 60's.  Which is not a slight to Mr. Harryhausen at all.  Clash of the Titans and Jason and the Argonauts are two of my favorites, and a documentary on Mr. Harryhausen put me in awe of his talents. But the claymation-like movements of the Mutant in this movie really clashed with all the rest of the high tech goings on.All in all, if you want a decent Zombie movie, go rent 'Night of the Living Dead' or 'Zombie', an unnoficial Italian sequel that came out before Mr. Romero came out with 'Dawn of the Dead'.  If you go with 'Resident Evil', you will regret it before you finish the movie.",1,11,18,30 July 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Read Your Greek Mythology, People
","To all the uninformed people who are trashing this enthralling movie for ripping off the story of whatever movie you THINK it got its story from, and to all the folks who think certain directors of past films might be offended at this film taking liberties with 'their' stories, get your facts straight before you commit them to be printed for all to read.  'Moulin Rouge' stays totally faithful to its TRUE source of inspiration: the myth of Orpheus from Greek Mythology.  I'm not even gonna explain it for you.  Get off your lazy cans and go read it for yourselves.  They've taken Orpheus and his ill fated bride, moved them to a fantasy location loosely based on turn of the century Paris, and simply told their story in that fashion.  Look it up.",Null,0,1,27 January 2002
