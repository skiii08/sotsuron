The Avengers," The Avengers Assemble for One Heck of a Summer Blockbuster!
","After four years of anticipation, Joss Whedon's The Avengers hits theaters. And, of course, it is really good. There was no doubt in my mind that this movie wouldn't be good. And, if it disappointed, it'd still be looked back on as the culmination of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.I think Whedon is the only one who is able to put a movie like this together. I'm not a huge fan of 'Buffy the Vampire Hunter', 'Firefly', or some of Whedon's other works, but he does have a knack for taking a bunch of different characters and making them all relevant. And he brings that trademark talent to this movie. Every hero is given just enough screen time. We see Captain America's struggle of pulling his team together, we see the regret Thor has for having to battle his brother, we see Hulk's desperate attempts to control 'the other guy', and we see Tony Stark as the narcissistic playboy that's always equipped with a great one-liner.One thing that sort of concerned me about 'The Avengers' was Loki as the villain. I thought he was great in 'Thor', but it seemed kind of weak to have all these great heroes teaming up against a re-used villain from a previous prequel. Fortunately, I was one hundred percent wrong; Loki is great as a villain. He's more intense and less whiny. Combine that with a lust for power and an army of aliens and you've got one of the greatest villains in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe.The effects are great, of course. You've seen the trailers for this, I'm sure, so you know that the movie's climax takes place in Manhattan. It was gripping, exciting, and even laced with a bit of comedy, with none of it being offensive or racist. The entire time I just kept thinking to myself that this is what 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' should have been. I can see who the heroes are and even identify with them, while the action is entertaining and not too long.Final verdict: The summer movie season hasn't been kicked off this well since the first 'Iron Man' movie. Ever since Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight', I've been waiting for another superhero movie to come along and do something new. And 'The Avengers' has done just that. It takes a very basic, traditional story and amps it up. It's smartly handled, well made, and, most importantly, a lot of fun. I look forward to taking another trip to the theater to go and see it.",9,1,4,5 May 2012
Men in Black 3," A Rare Occasion in Which the Three-quel Surpasses the Original.
","Yes, the title is a true statement; everything that was good about the original 'Men In Black' is done better in 'Men In Black 3', which is quite a surprise, considering that the third movie in a franchise is usually the weakest. Now, I've never been the biggest MIB fan; I enjoyed the first movie for what it was: a flawed, but nonetheless, entertaining sic-fi comedy. The second, although I don't hate it, failed to live up to the bar that was set so high by its predecessor.And now we have the third, and best, installment. First, the bad things. I found the whole time travel plot, although it does have its fun moments, a bit too clumsily handled. It seems a bit too clunky and interfered too much with the laws of space-time-continuum that have been set by previous movies. The first twenty minutes of the movie seems too reminiscent of what made the second movie a flop. It's self indulgent, full of lame one-liners, and it sort of prevented me from enjoying myself. I feared I just paid to watch another bad MIB movie.But after Tommy Lee Jone's Agent K is erased from time, the movie really steps it up. First of all, the villain is really good. The villains from the first two movies were...well, I don't remember. So I know a villain lacks charisma when I can't remember a single thing about him/her. The villain from this one is a lot of fun. He looks bit like Randy Savage and sounds like Tim Curry. He's got some good one-liners and a couple of cool fight scenes with the heroes. While we're on the subject, the action in this one is a lot better. This is sort of a weird thing to point out, but the first two MIB movies are ugly movies. They look gross and dirty, which I think is what the filmmakers are going for. But there's so much grime and muck that the audience can take, so it's nice to see a cleaner MIB movie.No doubt you've heard how awesome Josh Brolin is as young Agent K. His control and surly attitude capture exactly what Tommy Lee Jones brought to the table, but there's hints of emotion to him as well. 'Something hasn't happened to him yet', so Brolin's allowed to show some happiness with Agent K's former life.Final verdict: With the exception of the first twenty minutes, it seems like the filmmakers were able to go back and get rid of all of the snarky stupidity of the second movie. They've found their roots with the first movie and managed to make an even better movie. It's a good summer action movie, plain and simple.",8,1,3,26 May 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Brilliant, capable, and resplendent!
","The first Sherlock Holmes was not only an accomplishment of storytelling and intrigue, but it pushed the ever-present envelope of science vs. magic. With that said, it is probably one of my favorite movies of all time. And though this sequel doesn't quite capture the wonder of it's predecessor, it is worthy enough to carry the title of the famous detective.The story is engaging and will keep you hooked from beginning to end. The character of Moriarty presents an ever elusive threat, and it's up to the famous Sherlock Holmes and his trusty Dr. Watson to stop him! Though this scenario may seem clichéd and tired, the filmmaker's awesome dialogue, combine with excellent performances from Downey Jr., Law, and Harris, makes it quite an experience.As awesome as I'm making this movie seem, and trust me, it is, there are some problems I have with it. The killing of McAdams character is too quick. And though we clearly see how her death affects Holmes, they filmmakers don't dwell on it. I see this as a great opportunity to create a truly dramatic scene. But no! She's killed, Sherlock is sad for a bit, and that's the end of it.I also hate Stephen Fry in this movie. The character of Mycroft Holmes is every bit as ingenious as Sherlock; he is intelligent, but lazy and blunt. Fry certainly captures the apathetic nature of the character, but I never saw anything scintillating about him. For Fry's weaknesses, however, we get more of the back-and-forth banter from Sherlock and Watson in this film. Much like the first one, it focuses on their relationship-er, excuse me, partnership, and satirizes it to the one hundredth degree. This makes both characters more identifiable and more like brothers.Particular praise is for the dialogue between Moriarty and Holmes. It brings back fond memories of reading the original short stories. Both men hate each other for their opposite morales and personalities, but at the same time, respect one another for their equal intellect. I wont say anymore, but trust me when I tell you that those scenes make the movie.There's also a lot more action in this one, and though the constant slow motion and organized battle strategy is an acquired taste, there's a lot of gunshots and explosions to please any popcorn-flick fan.Final verdict: This is a brilliant film! It's not as good as the first one, but certainly one of the stronger Sherlock Holmes movies (and trust me, there's quite a few). If you liked the first movie, or just want a huge murder/mystery story, then this movie is for you!",8,2,10,18 December 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," We're halfway there...
","The Twilight movies are the opposing force to good movies, but with every new release, they've been getting better and better. This one is probably the best of the Saga, but does that make it a good movie?The story is just as romanticized as the other movies, but what was a good change of pace was is that this one is dark. I know that the other movies had well shot, Gothic cinematography, but the silliness constantly got in the way of making them epic. This movie takes itself seriously. Much like the Planet of the Apes or The Exorcist movies, if you can buy the absurdity, they are good movies. This installment is grisly, bloody, and is the first of these movies that seems more like a fantasy as opposed to a romance.The cast of this movie has improved, but none of them are good. Taylor Lautner and Robert Pattinson are still emotionless, boring characters who constantly have me wondering why they house the affecting of so many teenage girls. But, to Kristen Stewart's credit, this is the first movie where she actually seems to care. She's finally acting! She's finally showing real, authentic human emotion (how ironic, because, at the end of the movie, she becomes a vampire)! The rest of the cast is slow, empty, and boring. That's pretty bad when Kristen Stewart is the best thing about this movie.The CGI is pure crap, simple as that. There is no thought or passion put into it. I guess the idea was that the filmmakers cared more about the story than the special effects in order to please it's intended audience of teenage girls. Here's a little hint for the filmmakers of these movies: you are a movie first, and a worldwide phenomenon second. Focus on making the film work before you take your fans advice into account.One more thing before I give this movie a final verdict. A lot of people are saying that this movie has a pro-life theme and is in fact ENCOURAGING abortions. I've seen several reviewers saying stuff like, 'How dare they influence the choices of teenagers like that!' or 'Twilight isn't talented enough to make such a statement!' Here's the reality of the situation, internet trolls: IT'S FRIGGIN' TWILIGHT. They are dumb movies made for the sole purpose of pleasing their fan base. It isn't some elaborate scheme to recommend abortions. It is pure, stupid entertainment.Final verdict: I'll admit that I have read the books and, even though they aren't masterpieces of literature, they kept my interest. If you're a Twi-Hard, you'll probably like this movie, though, as I said before, the ending is very gritty and could upset some viewers. If you hate the Twilight Saga, this brings nothing new to the table and you probably won't like it.",3,1,7,23 November 2011
Skyfall," The Best, and Only, James Bond Movie I've Ever Seen!
","You read correctly, folks: This is the first James Bond movie that I've seen, at least all the way through. I guess that's not technically true; I guess I have seen one or two on television, but to be one hundred percent honest, they were pretty forgettable. However, if every Bond movie was like 'Skyfall', then I'd go out and buy the entire collection. Honestly, I had no intention of seeing this movie. I saw the trailers, which looked pretty cool and also had the fortune of having Javier Bardem in them, but they didn't really impress me to such a degree that I'd actually go ahead and see the movie. But, as it turns out, I received an invitation from a friend to go and see it. And I came out of the theater satisfied.Director Sam Mendes said in an interview that 'The Dark Knight' was a huge influence on this new installment in the Bond franchise and it really does show. This movie has deep emotional layers to it, alway staying a step ahead of its audience without entirely alienating them. The camera angles are very unique and really add something to the film.The nice thing about James Bond is that he's a staple of pop culture to such a degree that I already knew the character before I entered the theater. He's very suave and elegant, but also very hardcore and awesome. And Daniel Craig plays the part very well.Since I mentioned him when talking about the trailer, you could probably guess that I am a Javier Bardem fan. And he plays a villain that is so intimidating and so confident in how awesome he is, that he literally blows all other villains out of the water. There's a scene in a jail cell between him and M (played masterfully by Judi Dench) where he is so scary that it might as well have been Hannibal Lecter standing in that cell.Final verdict: I have no complaints about this film. Yeah, there's definitely some stuff to nitpick, but seeing as I'm not that type of person, Skyfall, to me, is a modern day masterpiece. The only reason it gets a 9 instead of a 10 is because I only score movies a 10 if it's one of my favorite movies. Still, if you're a fan of James Bond, I don't know how I could give this a proper recommendation since I haven't seen the other movies. But if you're looking for a great action movie that's a little deeper then you have been lead to believe, Skyfall is the film for you. It's one of the best movies of the year.",9,3,13,12 November 2012
The Hunger Games," Hollywood's New Teen Adventure Tent Pole Does Not Disappoint
","Before we get on to the more gritty, action packed movies of 2012 (The Dark Knight Rises, The Avengers, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, etc.) let's talk about The Hunger Games. Based on the Suzanne Collin's book of the same name, The Hunger Games has had a lot of hype circulating it ever since the end of the Harry Potter franchise from last year. Does it live up to the high expectations of the uproarious fans?One thing I'll state clearly before I get down to review this movie is that: 1.) I saw the midnight screening of this with a group of friends and family. I was awfully tired before the movie started, so once it began, I may have missed one or two details. I'll do my best to comment on as many things as I can.2.) I have read the book that this movie's based on. It's a good read. Obviously it's not perfect, but it kept my interest. With that being said, I am not going to grade this movie solely on what was left out of it. I'm not a big enough fan of The Hunger Games series to speculate on every detail that didn't make it into the movie.Okay, let's begin. I'll admit, much like the book, this movie is very good. It followed the book pretty closely, though again, if it didn't, I wouldn't have cared that much. The real treat with The Hunger Games is the cast. Many of them look and act the part. I've been a fan of Jennifer Lawrence ever since I saw X-Men: First Class last summer, and here, she doesn't disappoint. She portrays Katniss as an independent survivalist, much like how she was in the book.The supporting cast is also good...for the most part. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark and Liam Hemsworth as Gale Hawthorne both show the intensity and maturity of their characters and, naturally, it's great to see. Haymitch and Effie are a lot of fun, and the other contenders in the game are competent enough as villains to make up for lack of any characterization.Sadly, the two weakest characters are Lenny Kravitz as Cinna and Amandla Stenberg as Rue. Both characters left a tremendous impact on Katniss in the novel, while here, they're simply boiled down to bland, uninteresting supporting characters.The violence is entertaining, though I think that's very much a personal preference. As I said before, Harry Potter devotees will come to this movie for the weekend entertainment, and that might present a problem. The action in Harry Potter is pretty tame; when you get down to it, it's just a ton of sparks and colored lights flying around the screen. Whereas this movie is much more intense and gritty. There's definitely some pretty disturbing scenes, so I suggest keeping the kiddies home for this one.One more gripe I have with this movie is how it was presented. Much like Harry Potter, The Hunger Games is very self-contained. Essentially, if you haven't read the book, there'll be a lot of scenes where you might find yourself scratch your head in confusion. Maybe that's nitpicking, but with other movies based on books, such as The Lord of the Rings trilogy, there was enough character and story to appeal to other audience members. And, as much as I liked this movie, it really didn't do this.Final verdict: Is there any point of writing a final verdict? You're going to see this movie regardless of my opinion. It's going to be one of the highest grossing movies of the year, and deservedly so. It's a smart, action packed, sci-fi story. It's characters, though not the best, are still pretty enjoyable and the action scenes are intense and brutally realistic. There's also a lot of quiet moments where you're just allowed to soak in the atmosphere and tone of the film, something that I don't recall Harry Potter ever doing. If you're a fan of the books and above the age of ten, check it out and draw your own conclusions.",8,1,12,23 March 2012
Beauty and the Beast," 3-D Re-Release
","I finally have a legitimate excuse to review this movie. One of the great ones. One of the greatest animated masterpieces of all time. There's no real reason to hate on this movie; it really is a gem. It's been talked about to death that all I can hope to do is bring my own opinion to the table.The story is still good. It's perfectly paced and excellently executed. The best scenes involve Belle and the Beast falling in love. One of the best elements in the movie is the romance. Unlike most Disney romances where the couple meets, falls in love, and gets married a few days later, Beauty and the Beast takes its time. You never know how long it takes the couple to fall in love; it could be weeks, maybe even months, so its open for debate and allows the viewer to draw his/her own conclusions. The characters are still memorable. Belle is beautiful (duh, the title tells you that), but she never flaunts it. She is constantly taunted and mocked, but does she care? No. On top of that, she's smart, kind, and anything else you look for in a Disney princess. The Beast is drawn great and you do believe he's evolved throughout the course of the film. Gaston is one of the best villains of all time. I love how egocentric he is, and when he doesn't get his way, he becomes this vengeful, hateful person. His transformation is just as believable as the Beasts.The side characters...do I need to say anything about these guys? You all remember the quick-witted Lumière, the snobby Cogsworth, the gentle Ms. Potts, and the hilariously stupid LeFou. They're all memorable and I don't need to say anymore about them.I guess I'll talk about the things that I don't like about the film. The first thing is the design of the human version of the Beast, or as Disney so persistently calls him, Adam. It looks goofy and unlike Disney males of the past. Adam looks very out of place, but that's just nit-picking. The 3-D is another gripe I have with the movie. I did not want to see the movie in 3-D, not because it's not a good film, but because I own the movie. Why would I want to pay $13.50 for a ticket when I could pop it into my DVD player FOR FREE? But, after the 3-D Re-release of the Lion King, everyone began to praise the 3-D animation. So, I spent the money on the ticket, and within the first 5 minutes of the film, I regretted it. The 3-D isn't a cheap conversion like The Last Airbender or Clash of the Titans, as I am told that Disney put a lot of money into re-releasing the movie in 3-D. But still, the movie is so clearly NOT shot in 3-D that it just doesn't look good. The opening shot in the forest looked great, but that's it.Final verdict: Though I don't think the movie is worth seeing in 3-D, still take your kids to see it. The animation, the characters, the story, and the music is perfect. It's a better alternative than something like The Smurfs. Raise your children on stuff like this, parents of America. I hear some theaters show the 2-D version, and by all means, go see that. For the problems I have with the 3-D, I won't deny that it was great seeing this film on the big screen. Do yourself a favor this weekend and go.",10,6,7,28 January 2012
The Adventures of Tintin," This generation's Indiana Jones.
","The Adventures of Tintin is an exceptional piece of work; this and Super 8 really seemed to capture the nostalgic, heartwarming tone of some of Spielberg other classics like Jurassic Park and The Goonies. The movie is very long, especially for a children's film, but it goes by in a flash. As I left the theater, I found myself wanting more.The story is very convoluted and adrenaline filled. and it's sure to entertain kids, as well as adults that read the original Tintin comics. I'll admit I have not read the comics, so I don't know if this film follows the integral story ark of the comics or if they just made it up. But, standing on it's own, it's good. There's some pacing issues and I would have liked to see more done with the mystery of the Unicorn, rather than it being a cat-and-mouse/revenge scheme, but I digress.I feel bad saying this, but the character of Tintin is very bland. Again, I haven't read the comics, but judging by this film, he's just a generic hero; a journalist that will do anything to get the scoop on the latest story. I wouldn't mind so much if they'd given him more personality. But for Tintin's weaknesses, the movie makes up for it with a lot of colorful side characters. Andy Serkis is enjoyable comic relief as the drunken, but good intentioned Captain Haddock. Daniel Craig is delightfully over-the-top as the movies villain Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine. And Simon Pegg and Nick Frost play a pair of bumbling, likable sidekicks named Thompson.I'm glad the Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg wait a few years to bring us this movie, because the special effects are great. I haven't seen it in 3D, but it's not converted, and there are a lot of scenes that, I'd imagine, would look great in 3D.Final verdict: This is summer blockbuster brought to us in the winter. It's good fun for the whole family. If you can sit back and enjoy yourself for 107 minutes, just admiring the fantastic visuals and funny side characters. you'd like this. I myself wish it wasn't so simplistic, but for what it is, it's a good movie.",9,0,2,16 January 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," Best Marvel movie since original Iron Man.
","The final set up movie for The Avengers now reveals itself, and I am proud to admit that it's an enjoyable experience. Much like Thor, this movie, despite all of its implausibility, takes itself so seriously that we, as audience members, start to buy into this world that Marvel has made for us.The story is surprisingly intriguing. It's got a lot of action, but behind it all, lies a heart of gold. The first act does a good job of introducing our heroes and villains so by the time the third act rolls around, we are ready to see them go toe to toe in combat.The acting is actually pretty good as well. Chris Evans, thankfully, doesn't play Steve Rogers the way he played Human Torch in the Fantastic Four movies. That was my biggest fear, but I'm proud to admit that I was wrong. Evans plays the role of Cap not as a reckless, proud leader, but more like a lost soul that just wants to do right. Hugo Weaving is a great Red Skull. He and Cap are completely different people so, in the case of this movie, opposites do not attract. The supporting cast is okay, except for one weak link in the chain: Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark. For me, it seemed like he just wasn't too invested into the role. It's almost like he had the idea to act like Robert Downey Jr., but somewhere along the way, decided to drop it. To me, that was a disappointment.The special effects are loaded with tons of CGI and impressive stunts. Being a comic book movie, it's chock full of implausibility, but strangely, as I said before, since it takes itself seriously, we take it seriously. It pulls us into the drama of the characters with such ease that I was utterly at awe.Final verdict: While it's not as good as other Marvel movies like Iron Man and X-Men: First Class, this is one of the better comic book movies. It's energetic and successfully hyped me up for The Avengers movie. Don't miss out on this one!",9,1,4,11 November 2011
Hugo," An experience!
","Well, I finally got around to seeing Hugo, after weeks of anticipation. Was it worth it? Yes. Hugo is not only a great movie, but, as the title of this review states, an experience. It's got enough wonder to take you back to a simpler time, filled with macabre wonder and awe.With that said, there are a few minor problems with this movie. Asa Butterfield as Hugo Cabret and Chloë Grace Moretz as Isabelle are very uninteresting and bland. I'm sure they're nice kids, but the delivery of some of their lines is, for lack of a better term, wretched. However, they are saved by a strong supporting cast made up of Ben Kingsley, Helen McCrory, Jude Law, and Sacha Baron Cohen. These characters are far more interesting than the two leads, but that's very much a personal preference.Even small roles are all far more engaging, even though they aren't really relevant to the plot. For instance, the character of Monsieur Labisse serves no real point to the overall story, but because he's played by Christopher Lee, the character leaves much more of an impact. Even Richard Griffiths and Frances de la Tour, as entirely irrelevant as their characters were, gave such a weight to their parts that you can't help but notice them.The story starts off very slow, with no real direction or initiative. But, as time goes on, you see why the beginning started off slow. The film takes its time and, in return for your patience, gives you a heart warming throwback to...well, a lot of things. The main focus is that every person has a role to play, but it's up to that person to determine his or her own fate. That's a very deep message for a kid's movie. But it's also a throwback to old entertainment. Watching the scenes where Ben Kingsley's character reveals his past is indescribable. You just have to watch it.Final verdict: Though I acknowledge the problems with this movie, I can easily overlook them because there's too many great things about it. This is the best movie I've seen all year, and I highly recommend it. Even the 3D isn't that bad; it's very atmospheric and impressive. This is Martin Scorsese first family flick, and it's a real gem.",9,2,5,30 December 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man," Amazing? Not Really. A Solid Comic Book Movie? Yes!
","I've always been a huge fan of Sam Raimi's 'Spider-Man' trilogy (yes, even the third one), but after watching them again, they aren't exactly the great movies I remember them being. True, they are a lot of fun and did address the dilemmas of being a superhero, but, face facts, folks: they are very corny and very silly. And this re-boot, though I think it came out a little too soon, manages to capture that spirit and energy that the first trilogy had, as well as improve upon the mistakes of the previous movies.Even though I liked the earlier movies, I never liked Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. As Parker, he certainly played up the part of being socially awkward, but, even after he got bit by the spider, he still stayed in that phase of acting. There was no variation, no passion in him that made me want to get invested in him. Andrew Garfield is very much the superior performance here. There are some aspects in his acting that seem very Haden Christensen- esque, but he is very likable and very funny. I found myself rooting for this Spidey more in this single movie than I did at all in the previous trilogy!The supporting cast is much better as well, for the most part. Gwen Stacy played by Emma Stone is very cute but wasn't afraid to get her hands dirty. In the original trilogy, I always got tired of Kirsten Dunst's Mary-Jane screaming and hollering until Spidey came to the rescue. Here, Gwen Stacy still needed to be saved, but she was quite capable of defending herself when she needed to. We also have Denis Leary as the tough, no-nonsense Cpt. Stacy and Martin Sheen and Sally Field being very likable and supportive in their respective roles.Now a common complaint from a lot of people is the villain, Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard. I have to disagree, but not for the reasons you may think. I think Rhys Ifans did a great job as Connors, making him very likable and complex, which makes you all the more heartbroken when this travesty befalls him. I'm also glad that The Lizard did talk instead just being a huge, grunting, CGI mess. But, like everyone, I'm not a fan of his design and he doest hold a candle to the villains from the first two movies.There are also some problems with the movie. In the trailers, we were promised answers to 'The Untold Story'; we were meant to know what happened to Peter's parents. And what do we learn from this plot point? Nothing! I guess that means that they'll save the answers for a sequel, but they could of at least given us some clues as to what's to unfold.The action scenes, while good, seem much less cinematic and sweeping than the first trilogy. There was this sense of wonder and atmosphere that they captured and, try as I might, I just didn't get that from this movie. Still, the action is decent.Final verdict: Anyone who's fresh off 'The Avengers' and is still awaiting 'The Dark Knight Rises' should definitely check out this flick. Die-hard fans of the Raimi movies probably won't enjoy it, but if you're a comic book geek or an action movie fan, this should definitely quench your summer movie season thirst.",7,1,3,3 July 2012
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Great fun, but again, I ask: WHY DOES IT NEED TO BE SO LONG?!
","'The Lord of the Rings' are not just some of the best fantasy films of all time, but three of the greatest films of all time. Period. Jackson's return to Middle-Earth in 'An Unexpected Journey' was an enjoyable time, but suffered because of its length, pacing, and effects. Now we have 'The Desolation of Smaug', Jackson's second installment in his new 'Hobbit' trilogy. There's much improvement in this film from 'Journey', especially in terms of pacing. 'Journey' took a little too long to get going, but in 'Desolation' you are launched immediately into the action. This film is also a bit darker from the first, with the threat of war beginning to reveal itself.The casting is still top notch. Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen, and Richard Armitage do a great job in their respective roles, as they did in the first film. Jackson also does a lot better with identifying the other 12 dwarfs in this film, though some of them still aren't quite too developed. And the newest additions to the cast are great, as well, particularly Benedict Cumberbatch as the dragon, Smaug, and the Necromancer.The problems with this film are still ones that arise from the first film. Why does 'The Hobbit' need to be split into 3 movies, each with a 2 1/2 to 3 hour length? If you want to make it a trilogy, by all means, do it. But they don't need to be that long! You can justify that sort of length in 'The Lord of the Rings' because they are suppose to be these huge, epic movies. But 'The Hobbit' was meant to be a children's story. The effects in this movie have improved slightly over the first film. The crowning achievement in the movie is definitely the dragon. But the orcs still look really fake in this movie and there's a couple of scenes that you can tell they use too much green screen. This is a huge disappointment, especially considering that 'The Lord of the Rings' had so many practical effects that made it look great.Final verdict: 'The Desolation of Smaug' does a much better job of telling the story of 'The Hobbit' than its predecessor. It's fun, exciting, and makes for a good time in the theater. But the problems that plagued the first film sadly follow into this second installment, which prevents it from becoming a truly great fantasy film like 'The Lord of the Rings'.",8,0,0,24 April 2014
Batman Begins," Christopher Nolan Has Given CPR to a Supposedly Dead Franchise
","The original 'Batman' was released in 1989, under the direction of then-newcomer, Tim Burton. It was one of the first comic book movies to give itself a dark tone. It made for a pretty entertaining, albeit flawed, superhero movie, though this was mostly due to a fantastic performance from Jack Nicholson as The Joker. Burton's second Batman movie, 'Batman Returns', was too dark and too stupid, so for the third movie, Burton handed the reigns of this franchise to Joel Schumacher. This is where things took a turn for the worst.Schumacher's first attempt at the Batman franchise resulted in 'Batman Forever'. This one was definitely more kid-friendly and manipulative, and even though it wasn't as well received as the first two movies, it was a huge hit at the box office. Because of this, Schumacher was brought on to direct the fourth, and final, Batman movie called 'Batman & Robin', which is considered to be one of the worst movies of all time.1 out of 4 just isn't good enough, unfortunately, so Warner Bros. shut down the idea for a fifth movie and left this franchise. However, in 2005, Christopher Nolan, who was riding the success of the critically acclaimed 'Memento' and 'Insomnia', rebooted this franchise. And, from both a Batman fan boy standpoint, as well as an avid movie goer standpoint, I couldn't have been more surprised.Christopher Nolan has taken the character of Batman to a whole new heights with this movie. He takes more of a realistic and prudent approach to the lore of Batman. Because Batman, like all the other superheroes out there, can be phenomenally goof sometimes. Here, Nolan makes you believe that a vigilante could dress up like a bat and fight crime, which, let's face it, could not have been an easy task.From a casting standpoint, everyone brings their A game. Christian Bale brings more duality to the characters of Bruce Wayne and Batman. As Bruce Wayne, he acts the part of the drunken billionaire without a care in the world. As Batman, he it more intimidating and stealthy. He preys on criminal's fear, and the best part of the movie is seeing him develop this strategy. Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson, and Morgan Freeman are all some of my favorite actors, and, naturally, they all give great performance. Because of the direction and tone of the movie, they act not like they're in a comic book movie, but more like they're in an Oscar nominated film. They each flesh out their characters brilliantly and effectively.The movie is shot very nicely. Nolan is a master of scenery here; there are just so many moments where he lets you soak up the atmosphere, allowing you to take in the sheer scope of everything that is Batman.Final verdict: This really is a smartly handled movie. This is the Batman movie that I wanted to see, but never thought I would. It's superior to the Burton/Schumacher era, but the next one takes it to an entirely new level of greatness. But, that's another review for another time.",10,2,2,18 July 2012
Wreck-It Ralph," A 'Roger Rabbit' for the Gaming Generation
","So I was not the biggest fan of the trailers for Wreck-It Ralph. Even though I liked the small appearances from classic video game characters, I wasn't riding the train of 'this movie will be awesome' because I'm not a John C. Reilly fan and definitely not a Sarah Silverman fan. But after finally seeing it, I thought it was really good.The best part of Wreck-It Ralph is the first half of the movie. In fact, it's flawless. The writing, characters, and animation is all perfect. I found myself laughing quite a few times (which I rarely do in a kid's movie) and having a lot of fun!One of the best elements of the movie is the character if Ralph, which is weird, because I don't really care for John C. Reilly. But he was a really good and likable guy. And the filmmakers know that, despite the fact that this is a movie filled with video game characters that everyone knows and loves, they need to keep the focus on him. These video game characters are more like cameos. They work very similarly to how the toons in Who Framed Roger Rabbit worked; they definitely have some of the best laughs in the movie and are a lot of fun, but they never pull focus from the story or the main character.Okay, so I've praised this movie so much that you're probably wondering why it has an 8 instead of a 10. Well, the movie sort of loses gravity as soon as Ralph enters a game called Sugar Rush. He meets a little glitch named Vanellope, played by Sarah Silverman, who dreams of becoming a racer. But King Candy, played by the very charismatic Alan Tudyk, forbids her from racing because she is a glitch in the game. Everyone taunts her, but despite all of this, Ralph and Vanellope form an unusual bond.And you can pretty much guess the rest of the movie from there. They race, defeat the bad guy, and Vanellope is crowned a princess. But, if that wasn't predictable enough, there are more plot points going on involving bugs, a jealous video game character, and a silly, but hilarious, romance between two side characters. All of these elements work, I guess, but it becomes just a little too complicated along the ride. It's not horrible, in fact it's not even that bad, it's just not handled as well as the first half was.Final verdict: I would recommend anyone, young or old, gamer or not, to see Wreck It Ralph. It has wonderful animation, great characters, and some great laughs. Yeah, I wish the second half was a bit more polished, but this movie was still a lot of fun. In fact, I think this is the most fun I've had in a theater since The Avengers in May, which is saying a lot.",8,3,6,2 November 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Jackson's Return to Middle-Earth is a Glorious, Albeit Lengthy, Trip
","Anyone who knows my taste in movies knows that I usually favor the fantasy genre. Heck, I even gave a positive review to this summer's 'Snow White and the Huntsman'. But, and I know many out there agree with me, the crowning achievement in the fantasy genre is Peter Jackson's 'The Lord of the Rings'. Each film was superbly crafted, with practical effects and great casting that will make it stand the test of time, much like Lucas' original 'Star Wars' movies.So, like many people, I was pretty excited for 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey'. I didn't like the fact that a 300 paged book was being split into three movies, because I knew that a lot of things were going to be stretched out far beyond their natural length to ensure a 2 hour and 45 minute length. And there in lies my biggest problem with the movie; why does it need to be this long? 'The Hobbit' is a completely separate entity from 'The Lord of the Rings', both tonally and scripturally.The casting is solid, with Martin Freeman playing an excellent, energized Bilbo Baggins. The dwarfs, while funny, were sort of forgettable, though I expect we will get more development from them in the next two movies. And even some of the characters from 'The Lord of the Rings' appear, whether they are minor cameos or are involved more intricately with the plot.As I said before, I was very impressed with the practical effects in the previous trilogy, so I expected more of that in this movie. And while some of it is practical and effective, too much of it is CGI. And that just looks out of place, especially in a Middle-Earth that is so fresh in everyone's mind.Final verdict: The movie is too long and too overindulgent to be a great movie like 'The Lord of the Rings', but it is a good movie. I didn't get the chance to see it in 48fps, so I can't judge the film on that basis. I just hope that Jackson can either better utilize the length and pacing in the next two movies or just make them an hour and a half, because the length is really the biggest problem with this movie. Still, it's a good movie that should be experienced in a movie theater.",8,2,9,16 December 2012
Brave," Pixar's Official Apology for Cars 2.
","I've been a big Pixar fan since the beginning. Sure, not all of their films were great. But, even at their lowest, their was always something good found in any Pixar movie. And then that fateful day came. June 24, 2011 saw the release of 'Cars 2', a sequel that no one wanted to see. The first 'Cars' was fine, but I think that it's universally accepted that it's definitely not a Pixar gem. That said, the sequel was awful. Sure, it continued the streak of opening #1 at the box office, but critics and audiences really ripped this sequel a new one. The people at Pixar needed a movie to get audiences back in the theater seats and loving them again. And 'Brave' is the first Pixar movie to indulge in what their corporate partner, Disney, has been doing in the majority of their animated films: a fairy tale. So, is 'Brave' good? There's some good things in it. Firstly, the animation is stellar, but I think that's the case with every Pixar movie. The backgrounds are so detailed and the colors are mesmerizing. The characters are actually pretty good, too. Merida is the first female lead in a Pixar movie, played by Kelly Macdonald. At times she's a bit too whiny, but I have to admit that I have a soft spot for any defiant character in a movie. The mom and dad, played by Emma Thompson and Billy Connolly, are very likable and have a strong, some-what damaged relationship with their daughter. There's also a pair of triplets that almost make the movie. Their expressions are priceless and they provide the biggest laughs in the movie.The rest of the supporting cast kind of falls flat. In the other Pixar movies, the supporting characters are given just as much personality and jokes as the main protagonists. A prime example is 'Toy Story'; I remember Ham, Rex, and Mr. Potato Head just as much as I do Woody and Buzz. Here, we never get enough screen time with our supporting cast to really be invested in them. A part of me really likes the fact that Pixar is doing their own take on a fairy tale. I guess I'm just kind of let down by the fact that they didn't bring anything new to the table. I admit that it's difficult to do new things to a formula that's been done to death, but I think Pixar could have done something really spectacular here. They were probably just playing it safe after the disaster that was 'Cars 2'.Final verdict: Though definitely not Pixar's strongest film, 'Brave' is still a delightful treat. The fact that's it's this good fills me with hope that Pixar will return to it's high form of storytelling and animation. It's a good idea to rush to your local cinema and give it a watch.",8,2,5,25 June 2012
The Dark Knight," My Favorite Movie Of All Time. Period.
","After the success of 'Batman Begins', when I heard that Christopher Nolan was making another Batman movie, I didn't think it could surpass the first movie. But I was wrong. Dead wrong. 'The Dark Knight' truly is Nolan's masterpiece. I know that a lot of people didn't enjoy 'Batman Begins' because, even though it took a more realistic approach, it still felt a little bit like a comic book movie. That is not the case with 'The Dark Knight'. It works as many different types of movie. Whether it be viewed as an action movie, a thriller, or even a romance, I think that it's safe to say that any viewer can find something that they like about 'The Dark Knight'.Christian Bale is back as the Batman, and he's still got it. I hear some gripes about his growling voice, but I still stand by what I said about him in 'Batman Begins': this guy knows how to portray the duality of Batman and Bruce Wayne. He's methodical, intense, and courageous, like all aspiring heroes, but he's not perfect. In the movie, when something happens to a certain character, you see his vulnerable side. Sure, he's learned how to control his fear and prey on criminal's weaknesses, but he's still young and has a lot to learn. I like that about Bale's Batman; it makes him seems so much more relatable.The supporting cast from 'Batman Begins' return, along with a few new faces. Maggie Gyllenhaal replace Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. I didn't mind Katie Holmes in the first movie, but Gyllenhaal plays her with much more confidence and fire. Aaron Eckhart plays the D.A.- turned-psychopath Harvey Dent/Two-Face. Eckhart undeniably plays a great Harvey Dent, but this is really illustrated when he has to flip it 180 and become the psychotic Two-Face. All his ideals are replaced with anarchy and misery, making him just as evil as The Joker. And then you've got all the other supporting characters from the first movie, who are excellent.But the performance that everyone raves about is Heath Ledger's Joker. In the 1989 'Batman', Joker was played by Jack Nicholson, who, at first, planned to make Gotham City kneel before him. But, about 30 minutes into the movie, Jack's Joker falls in love with Vicki Vale. This made Jack's Joker look really materialistic and envious, which is not the case with Ledger's Joker. The Joker here acts very much like an unstoppable hurricane that came into Gotham City at the worst possible time for the heroes. He's like a demon that can't be destroyed, but the most disturbing part is that he acts like her shouldn't be destroyed because it's part of the bigger picture. This is also attributed to his dark reality and twisted nature. Needless to say, this was a great performance.Even the minor gripes I expressed in 'Batman Begins' are fixed in 'The Dark Knight'. The action is a lot bigger and edgier, but it abandons the shaky cam that was so distracting in the first movie. The bat suit looks a lot slimmer and easier to move around in.Final Verdict: 'The Dark Knight' is undeniably my favorite movie of all time. Not only does it work as a comic book movie, but as a film in general. the underlying themes and Gothic setting are fantastic, the performances are stellar, and the story is flawlessly told. It embodies everything I love about cinema and much, much more. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and watch it on the highest quality T.V. you can find; I promise you that it won't disappoint.",10,0,3,18 July 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," The Best of the Twilight Movies, But Still Riddled with Problems
","Finally; let's put a stake in this terrible franchise by review the final chapter of the Twilight movies (no, I will not call it a 'Saga'). You know, even though these movies aren't technically that great (actually, they're pretty awful) I will not deny that, much like movies like Dungeons and Dragons or Commando, these movies are a lot of fun to watch. In terms of comedy, I really enjoy the first four Twilight movies. They're stupid, nonsensical, and make very little sense, but they're a good time.One major problem with this movie is, of course, the story, but for very different reasons. The first four movies are very paper-thin when it comes to the plot, so I can't help but think that the director of this film overcompensates with this final installment by throwing a lot of new ideas and characters at you. This makes the film really hard to follow a lot of the time.The three main actors are just as bland as you remember them. They show hardly any emotions at all, which make it very hard to connect with them. But, for the weaknesses of our three main characters, the film makes up for it with the supporting cast. The Cullens family is very likable and the Volturi, lead by an astonishingly over-the-top Michael Sheen, ride that fine line of being very menacing and very goofy.The cinematography is awful and the special effects, most notably in the final battle, look like they have the budget of a sci-fi special. I honestly do not understand how these movies have such poor effects when they rake in millions of dollars per movie.Okay, this is where I'm going to get into spoilers a bit. The final battle confrontation with the Volturi is exactly what you'd come to expect from a Twilight movie: the effects are bad, the dialogue is lame, and the acting is sterile. But the film takes a very interesting turn when the actual fighting starts: people start dying left and right. Seriously, it's kind of awesome. And, if this is the ending the filmmakers had stuck with, I actually would have considered giving this movie a 5 or 6.But no, the film pulls the ultimate cop out in any movie: it was all in someone's head. I won't divulge how since the reason makes very little sense, but that ending is really unsatisfying. They probably wanted to stick closer to the books this way (which I haven't read), but if that's the case, why even have a battle at all?Final verdict: This is the best Twilight movie, but it is by no means a good movie. If you're a fan of the books or like to make fun of the movies (like me), then chances are you've already seen it. If not, you're money would be better off spent on Skyfall.",5,8,19,18 November 2012
Dark Shadows," Pick a Consistent Tone, TIm!
","Tim Burton is a great director. And, with Johnny Depp in the lead role, Tim Burton can make a good movie. Examples of this are 'Edwards Scissorhands', 'Ed Wood', and 'Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street'. It is also my opinion, as well as the majority of people I've talked to, that Tim Burton is at his worst when he re-imagines things. Examples of this are 'Planet of the Apes', 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', and 'Alice in Wonderland'. Factoring this in, I was convinced that 'Dark Shadows' was going to be one of the worst movies of the year. Was I right? Eh...I guess?While I don't think that the movie is terrible, it's no 'Sweeney Todd'. Let's get all the good in the movie out of the way first: Johnny Depp. Yes, I've yet to see a movie where I didn't enjoy the guy. He commits a lot to his roles, which really shows here. He had me laughing pretty hard. The supporting cast is fine, even if Eva Green does tend to overact a bit in a few scenes. Another plus to the movie is the scenery. Even the bad Tim Burton movies have this going for them. The cinematography and set pieces are grand and full of energy.I am no fan of the 'Dark Shadows' t.v. show; I haven't seen a single episode. Before I saw the film, I saw a lot of uproar about how it tries to cram too many of the main points of the show into an approx. 2 hour movie. And though I've never seen the show, even I could see that the movie felt too bloated and self indulgent.Another big problem with the film is the tone. It seems to me that Burton was trying to make this one a comedy, and for awhile, I believed him. The jokes hit hard and were funny! But when you mix those scenes with Depp suddenly murdering a bunch of hippies around the campfire, that just clashes with the lighthearted goofiness that Burton is hoping to make with the movie.Final verdict: I came home and was prepared to give the movie a solid 6 out of 10. Just slightly above average, just because I did have a good time with the flick. But a few hours later, I didn't remember too much of it. The movie is sort of like cinema hypnosis; you are having a pretty good time, but once you've left the theater, the spell is broken and you don't remember jack squat. And that's the movie's biggest crime: it's so forgettable. Even the bad Tim Burton movies I remember; I may not have enjoyed them, but they left some sort of impact on me. And this just didn't. Only the biggest devotes of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp should flock to the theaters for this one...or they should just see 'The Avengers' again.",5,4,12,11 May 2012
Taken 2," If You Enjoyed This Movie, I Will Look For You...I Will Find You...And I Will Kill You
","I love the first Taken. To me, it is a fine example of an action movie with solid build up, top notch acting, and, well, memorable action sequences. In this day and age, how often does that come along? And when I saw the trailer for the sequel, I knew it wasn't going to be as great as the first one. Still, I figured it'd be a good time at the theater. Was I right? Well...no.Let's get the good stuff out of the way first. You will never hear me say anything bad about Liam Neeson. The man is one of the few actors today that just demands respect and awe when he enters the room. A perfect example was in Battleship; the movie was awful, but Liam Neeson was one of the few things about that film that worked. And there's no exception here. They did things with the character of Bryan Mills that I didn't agree with, but Neeson is having fun with the part, so I got to respect that.I was also glad to see more of Famke Janssen in the movie. With so little screen time in the first movie, I was looking forward to seeing more of her in the sequel. And, whether you love her or hate her, Maggie Grace did a fine job as Neeson's daughter. I actually like her character; sort of a spoiled girl who must be...well, competent in order to survive.Also, the first twenty minutes began to feel like a solid follow up to the first movie. You see the relationship with the family, how Bryan is dealing with his daughter having a boyfriend. There are some pretty funny jokes you can get out of that scenario and they take advantage of the majority of them.Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's talk about the bad stuff. The action in this movie is some of the worst I've ever seen, which is a shame because the action in the first movie was very slick and nicely choreographed. Here, the editing is so choppy and abrupt that you can hardly see what's going on. I haven't seen anything else done by this director, but I hear that his action movies are all this way.Also the story is sort of a mess. I could follow it fine in the beginning, but as soon as the family arrives in Istanbul, things take a turn for the worse. The pacing suffers tremendously here and there's just too much suspension of disbelief going for me to have bought what was happening. Yeah, there was a lot of that going on in the first movie, but because the action was so great and the pacing was so quick, you didn't question it.Final verdict: This is a disappointing, unsatisfactory sequel to a phenomenal movie. Basically everything that made the first movie great is the opposite here. It's not horrendous, but there are plenty of other action movies that deserve your time and money. I really don't know who to recommend this movie to, especially if you're a fan of the first movie like I am.",4,2,5,8 October 2012
Thor: The Dark World," A Welcome Addition to 'Phase 2' to the Marvel Cinematic Universe!
","Last summer's 'Iron Man 3' turned out to be very disappointing, but 'Thor: The Dark World' does a much better job of kicking off this second phase of Marvel movies. I did enjoy the first 'Thor', but this movie does a much better job of exploring some of the other worlds and raising the stakes.The original cast returns for this second film and they are great! Chris Hemsworth is still a great Thor and Tom Hiddleston really gets a chance to shine as Loki. Natalie Portman is still hot and plays a good Jane Foster. The rest of the original cast is good, also, though I really wish that Kat Dennings was not in these movies because she's annoying and pretty pointless. Christopher Eccleston is Malekith, the new villain for the film. He's a bit boring and is honestly pretty forgettable, which is a shame because Eccleston really is a good actor.The story for this movie is very fun. No, it doesn't always make sense, but like other successful Marvel movies, it keeps you entertained and wanting more. The film also does a much better job at foreshadowing 'Avengers 2' than 'Iron Man 3' did, so that's an added bonus that all fans should look forward to.The effects are sort of hit and miss. Asgard and the other realms that are shown look spectacular. The action sequences are well choreographed and make for an exciting time. But some of the costumes look a bit silly and fake.Final verdict: 'Thor: The Dark World' is exactly what it is meant to be. It is an entertaining thrill ride from start to finish, with good characters and great, action packed scenes. It is not a great Marvel movie like 'Iron Man' or 'The Avengers', but it is a worthy entry that will leave you entertained and wanting to see it again.",8,1,1,24 April 2014
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Everything I expected it to be...and possibly more.
","Before I begin this review, I'd like to state that I am a big fan of the Harry Potter books and movies. I feel that the books are interesting and can be just as much for adults as they can be for kids. The movies do a good job capturing the essence of the book and are all very strong adaptations, yet still remain fresh and new.With that said, let's get this review going. By the time the movie starts and I see the Warner Bros. sign coming towards me, with excellent musical accompaniment by Alexander Dumas, I am already invested. And, as the movie continues, it gets better and better.The story, for those who read the book, was already revealed in 2007, but I must admit that it is cool to see it fully realized on the big screen. The filmmakers do an excellent job of capturing Rowling's riveting storytelling. Are events and details left out? Of course. But, for the most part, this movie does a good job at being faithful to its source material.The cast is at their best here. The three main child actors do exceptional jobs, and admittedly, this is the first time I actually feel for them. They've come a long way from being the sweet children from the first movie and have now evolved into well-developed characters that we love. The supporting cast, however, does a great job, as well. Each and every actor/actress gives so much weight to his/her character that it's absolute perfection. Particular acclaim goes to Alan Rickman as Severus Snape. The character has evolved extraordinarily from the cold, calculating potions teacher to the sympathetic, three dimensional character that we bother to concern ourselves with. Rickman should definitely win something for his performance...maybe even an Oscar?The visuals are splendid and heart wrenching. I kept seeing the destruction of Hogwarts on commercials but when I finally saw it on film, I couldn't hold back the tears. Seeing some of these beloved characters go through so much destruction and pain is almost too much, and yet, at the same time, pretty entertaining. The cinematography is beautiful, with much care and detail put into it, much like the previous Potter movies.Final verdict: this is hands down the best film in the Harry Potter saga. It proves that wanna- be sagas like Twilight don't win the audience over through rushed romances and undeveloped characters, but with a compelling story and care put into every single detail. I will miss these movies and, if you're a fan of the franchise or not, go check it out. There's something for everyone.",9,0,2,11 November 2011
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," 3 Stars for the 3rd Installment of this Awful Franchise!
","As bad as they are, I've been pretty lenient on Dreamwork's 'Madagascar' franchise, for the most part. The first one was pretty awful; it was tedious, unfunny, and tried to shove that 'Move It, Move It' song down our throats. The second one I remember enjoying. The jokes did improve, even at the expense of the story, but for a kid's movie, it was sub-par. The third movie takes what made the second movie such fun and ruins it! We spend about five minutes of the movie in Africa where the second movie left off before the animals SWIM TO MONTE CARLO. How? Only the half-baked minds of the writers could answer that...When they arrive in Monte Carlo, they find the penguins and the monkeys have disguised themselves as the Prince of Versailles so they can get away with playing poker. Since I doubt your six year old kids know who the Prince of Versailles is, they will be utterly confused while your busy asking yourself 'Why the heck would the Prince of Versailles be playing poker in Monte Carlo? This is the worst disguise ever!'But, as you might have guessed, the animals are discovered, so a security guard calls in Captain DuBois of animal control to take care of them. And this is where I actually start to sort of enjoy myself. Captain DuBois is the only character with a clear motive and a likable personality. The way she's animated is quite hilarious and she has the best lines of dialogue in the entire movie. And how sad is that when a psychotic, obsessive woman is the most identifiable character in the movie.The animals get away on their plane but the plane crashes. The animals sneak aboard a circus train. Here, we're introduced to Vitaly the Russian Tiger, Gia the Jaguar, and Stefano the Sea Lion. And here, I'm sorry to inform you, is where I end the plot synopsis because I honestly have NO IDEA what goes on afterwards. From there until the end of the movie is a jumbled, incoherent mess. Final verdict: I apologize that this isn't a complete review, but I just don't have a clue what to say about the rest of the movie. My guess is that if you want to keep your kids quiet for about ninety minutes, then this is okay. But there are much better movies for them that'll do just that. If your a fan of the first two, you'll probably like this okay.",1,7,19,9 June 2012
