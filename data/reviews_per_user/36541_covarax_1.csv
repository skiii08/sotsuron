Minority Report," Great film!
","If you are looking or a mixture of suspense action and science-fiction 'Minority Report' is the film to see! After Tom Cruise's 'Vanilla Sky' he's back in a blockbuster that will keep you on the edge of your seat! The film looks futuristic, but not fake. Together with a good plot and a great director (Steven Spielberg) you are sure to get something worth you payed for. In the nearby future a special police unit can arrest suspects for murder before they committed the crime. Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise), who thinks the system is perfect gets accused of murder too. Now he has to prove his innocence before being put behind bars. All the ingredients for a thrill ride!
