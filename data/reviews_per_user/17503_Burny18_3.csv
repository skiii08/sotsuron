Catch Me If You Can," Catch Me If You Can and my nostalgic, retrospective thoughts...
","All of us have different opinions, especially about movies and women.. but this film is definitely an all time favorite of mine.Every now and then you probably feel like me, watching the collection of your watchlist movies again and again, over and over, never feeling bored of the past, craving to go back in time, and wishing that you could just see it again for the first time. The years go by and we get older, and your watchlist grows. At least that is the case with mine. Ever since I joined IMDb I have added some films that I saw to my watchlist. Although I do admit sometimes I forget to add films that I already saw. So far during my lifetime I have watched over 1400 movies if not more and I can tell you with confidence that this film is not something that is going to disappoint you. Retrospectively, 2002, seems a long way back even if some people say 'Darling, its as if 2002 was just 'yesterday'. I cannot put it into the span of this box how much happened since then...But the one I recall most recently, is that I have lost one of my favorite actors and I still sometimes feel like crying when I watch his movies, speeches, and stand-ups...Robin Williams and also the Hungarian equivalent of him an actor called Imre Bajor. I tend to get nostalgic from time to time; if most of you would know my age you would probably say I am still very young for that.. However, I cannot forget the joy some of these films like CMIYC gave me and the feelings that it conjured up in me as I was growing up. Catch Me If You Can ensures that the viewer is experiencing never ending excitement, thrill, and pure entertainment. This is mostly due to the fact that the script is extremely well written and tailored immaculately to the characters, and it all becomes realistic. The performance by the three major actors Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, and Christopher Walken is truly off the charts. You know when sometimes you have a movie or TV-show where the cast just fits exactly like a puzzle? Well, I do and these three are meant to be on screen together as it is in Catch Me If You Can. In this film Tom Hanks is persevered,Christopher Walken is Mysterious as usual, and Leaonardo DiCaprio.. the lad who is an adventurer.I do believe Hollywood should aim to go back towards making movies like this, I personally despise the fact and find it vile that we have all these supernatural, fantasy, space movies. I was never really a fan of Star Trek or any other 'battlestar galatica' movies...and hopefully, someday they will indeed produce films that are of such quality as CMIYC.If you have not seen this movie yet...then waste no more time searching for another film to watch this December, or on this Sunday afternoon... and if you already seen it then you know how it is good and the environment which it should be watched in. To make it ideal...I usually get some wood logs from outside, put it in the Fire place, get a hot chocolate, some popcorn/pistachios and lay back in your usual seat on the couch. For me it just matches the movie to watch it during the winter season... and if there is snow outside and you can hardly see out from your windows then you know its time.I know that I did not provide any details to the plot or described what the movie is about, but I hope I got you into the zone of having a relaxed afternoon and I shared true honest feelings with you about how I feel when I watch movies.Thank you so much for reading this 'review', (More like a 5 minute monologue) BD",10,1,2,21 November 2014
Lone Survivor," War is terrible, but it must be propagated to the 21st century generation!
","If you have seen Hurtlocker, Zero Dark Thirty, or Private Ryan then you understand what these soldiers are experiencing or sacrificing their time and energy everyday in war zones in order to store peace and harmony and protect the innocent at all times. This film depicts the importance of U.S military interference in the Middle East.The movie conjures up all sorts of feelings, and great sympathy towards all the fallen soldiers. Since the movie is based on a true story it is even more shocking and if one imagines how authentic this film is I am sure that you also get shivers.. The film posthumously respects these soldiers who have gone through hell in order to complete the mission, even if it costs their life.It is a must watch, it raises awareness and respect towards soldiers.Thanks for taking time reading this review!

Blood Diamond," Sensational Thrill
","Imagine this, It is a Wednesday afternoon in early April, the weather is perfect, the sunshine strikes through the windows on the front facing end of the house while the back garden is beginning to darken due to the approaching storm from the hills... you can already smell the scent of rain in the air.Yes, this is the time for me to watch a movie either set in a jungle or on a beach, but more importantly the film should be tropical and adventurous.If you have not seen this movie, search no further. I guarantee you will not be dissatisfied. Leonardo Di Caprio and Djimon Hounsou will deliver you a sensational performance from start to finish.This movie is exciting, real and dramatic. All that you would expect, you can find in this movie.I wish there would be more movies like this one. If you are watching this film for the first time I envy you, once you seen it you will not forget it.There is not much explaining to do here. Go watch it! BUT BEFORE YOU GO Take a minute before and after watching this film, to think about protecting the environment, from climate change to animals. We are surrounded by nature, it is our treasure chest, it is appalling to see so many people who take it for granted. I know it might not change in my lifetime but passing on education and awareness is essential for humanity to head the right way. Our Earth is amazing. I thought about setting up an NGO strictly to serve this purpose, who knows maybe in 10 years time I will have achieved this. All I want is for humanity to survive, and nature to flourish. Our existence is limited, and our time is finite. I believe we will never know our true purpose, but passing on knowledge is part of it. So now, if you read this far, I want to thank you for your time, I really mean it. Thanks! And if you feel like sharing this video, then please do.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqxENMKaeCU (HOME-EARTH) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBqMJzv4Cs8 (Kevin Spacey (one of my favorite) on Rain forests) Lastly, THANKS for your support!
