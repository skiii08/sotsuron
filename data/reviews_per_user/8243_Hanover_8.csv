Vertigo," A movie about obsession, but not just about Scottie's..
","A lot of people seem to miss the obsession that Midge had for Scottie. She follows him around and spies on him.  She also leaves a note under his door that says 'Where are you?!'She paints herself as Carlotta, half-hoping he would see her the same way. Then she beats herself up in a tizzy-fit after he gets upset at the 'joke' and leaves...Then the final realization that she will never get him back at the mental hospital.  But the she was a smart girl and gave up.Scottie on the other hand didn't, and look what happened to him.Vertigo is a great movie.  The kind you can just lay on the floor during a lazy afternoon and view --each time seeing something you didn't notice before.",Null,2,3,22 February 2001
Requiem for a Dream," Hallucinatory and Unforgettable
","My partner and I had watched this knowing it was going to be depressing. However, I didn't realize just how much of a 'trip' that the director was going to put us through as well as the characters who were taking the drugs.This is a film I loved because it stuck with me for days afterwards.  The people who don't find any sympathy for the characters don't really understand what this film is about.  Each of these characters had dreams, just like us.  They really thought they had the way to achieve those dreams. Sadly, they had no one in their lives to tell them otherwise except those who were being hypocritical.The heart-wrenching conversation where the son learns that his mother is on uppers and tries to convince her to quit is so sad.  The junkie learning that his mother is on the same road and powerless to do anything about it.I think the parts that really stuck in my mind are when the director seems to be accurately letting you feel what a drug trip feels like.  Like when the mother suddenly sees her entire livingroom as a TV Show and the entire cast, crew and audience starts laughing at her.  It was a hallucination that felt real..the kind you might have if you had a high fever. 
In the end, I felt mom was a victim of the media..this idea that we all must be slim as a pretzel stick to be beautiful.Just like the son and his friends fell victim of how you need to have money to be successful. But when it all comes down to it, all these characters really needed was the love they had for each other.  It's a movie of people who run at each other with open arms and constantly miss with disasterous results.As much as I liked this film, it's definitely on my 'watch once, never again' list with such films as Happiness and In the Bedroom.",Null,0,1,16 June 2002
The Ring," The Ending is Easy to Explain..
","*Spoilers..Major Spoilers Ahead...*Wow, it's funny to see people coming up with these weird explanations of why Rachel was saved and the others weren't...It's really simple, actually....Samara wants everyone to know what happened to her.  She wants to spread the message.So when you watch the tape, you are required to make a copy of it and pass it along to someone else, else you will die.  (Although I'm not sure what happens if you give it to someone without a TV Set..)Thus, that is where the name of the movie, 'The Ring' comes from.Sort of a chain-letter from hell.Great movie by the way...really spooky stuff.  Hopefully we will also get a sequel and the prequel remade too.It's interesting to see a lot of 'Ringu elements' in games like Silent Hill and Fatal Frame.  Each containing creepy little kids who seem to have more power than they should have.I also loved how the American version still retained the Japanese quality of the original film..even the little girl with her hair in front of her face looked a bit Japanese.Dan",Null,0,0,20 October 2002
The Polar Express," Cynics should learn from this movie
","Many of us look fondly back on the holiday evenings when the CBS Special Presentation logo would spin and then reveal such puppetoon classics as Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer or Santa Claus is Coming to Town.Yet, all the bad reviews for The Polar Express state how poor the animation is. How the eyes don't look quite right. That the North Pole looks like a fascist regime. Yet, we can't remember how the Munchkins or the Oompa Loompas acted around their guardians. Did the eyes in our puppetoon favorites look real? Did any of our favorite Christmas specials ever have tons of characterization?The Polar Express is a sterling movie. The 1940's/Victorian feel gives it what I call 'creepy warmth.' The Hobo on top of the train. The industrial city that is the North Pole with the 30's/40's scratchy Christmas music playing through the loudspeakers. All this gives the movie an unsettling atmosphere that is comforting, yet at the same time, makes you shiver. This is the atmosphere of Charles Dickens and Norman Rockwell.I was amazed at how much I was touched by the messages in The Polar Express.These messages were obviously lost on the cynics panning it.As I sat there watching the picture book coming to life, I put it in the perspective of the holiday specials I enjoyed as a kid. Within that boundary, it fits perfectly.I give this *** 1/2 out of 4 stars.",Null,0,2,24 November 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The audience laughed -- And they weren't supposed to
","'I hate sand, it's gritty and coarse.  But I like it here...Everything is soft and smooth.' --and the entire audience burst out laughing.Just an example of some of the awful dialogue you'll find in Episode II. It's too bad that George Lucas has forgotten how to write a decent script, decent dialogue and direct a decent film.All he gives us are some very annoying characters..even Yoda has become annoying.  Young Bobafet must have had one direction from Lucas.. 'Look Bad!' because that's all he ever does..produce a really stupid looking sneer and fake maniacal laughter from time to time (and now I'm really disappointed that I know who Bobfet really is....another annoying child actor that Lucas dug up somewhere..).Perhaps 'Howard the Duck' and 'Radioland Murders' should have given us a hint of how much he's fallen as a filmmaker.What people forget is that he didn't direct the last two episodes..and he should have given the directing helm to someone else during the first two episodes.The biggest problem with the last two Star Wars pictures is the lack of a Han Solo-type character who would roll his eyes for us during those cheesy Jedi-speak moments.  So now we are forced to take everything seriously and it just makes it overly campy.  You can tell that Lucas is trying to interject humor into his screenplay for Ep II, but it just seems overly forced and cliche'.  ('I hate it when he does that!' harr harr harr!!!)Sorry, but now I dont even CARE about Episode III.  If it's as bad as the first two episodes, then the first Trilogy is just part of a completely different story as far as I'm concerned, and I'll leave it at that and continue to enjoy Episodes IV - VI as if I'd never seen the first three.",Null,0,0,4 June 2002
Mulholland Drive," A 'Peripheral Film'
","I just got back from seeing this movie.The one unique quality of this film is that if you try to dissect it too much, the meaning will get farther and farther away.  It's a film to sort of just remember out of the corner of your brain where snippets of reason and meaning can sort of be seen.There is a story here, but it's told in 'Dream Time' where events aren't always in the order you are watching them in and some of them may not even exist out of someone's imagination and memories..But the major thing I interpret is that the first half is the 'Glamorized' version of Hollywood.  Where old people smile in the back of limos and everyone talks to each other on a first-name basis.  This is the hollywood that a lot of naive people dream about.The second part is about the REAL hollywood....where lovers can change and then change back in a single kiss.  Where hearts get stomped and the creative have to make compromises to people in big hats.  And the people who go there dreaming about the idealized version of Hollywood find themselves tormented by their dreams never coming true with the fantasy still lingering, (and according to this film, escaping out of little boxes) and chasing them down until they go crazy and kill themselves.",Null,1,2,10 January 2002
Ice Age," Good Animation, Same Tired ol' Story
","**Possible Spoilers** (even though you've seen this ending before in other movies...)First of all, for me, the voice talents (if that's what you want to call it) of Ray Romano are enough to kick my rating down a star.  His normal voice and 'annoying voice' and 'angry voice' are really not that different.  His monotone drove me crazy through the entire movie. PLEASE don't let him become a staple in the voice-over animation industry!Second of all, how many times are we going to see the 'Benedict Arnold Makes Good' plotline?   Or the 'Suprise I'm not Dead' ending? (my partner mentioned the fact that the Tiger really didn't get hurt enough to even be lying there on the brink of death to begin with...) The only thing that really saved this movie at all was the Squirrel which seemed to be destined for a series of short features soon.Other than that, we have good 3D animation wasted on a movie we've seen thousands of times before.",Null,0,0,16 March 2002
Prometheus," Hope they had insurance...
","Most of the bad reviews on here pretty much sum up my feelings...especially where the leaps of logic are concerned.I will sum up how bad this film is with one scene.Years ago, I saw a comedy sketch where someone was about to be run over by a steam roller that was six feet away and traveling about 5mph. Instead of getting out of the way, this person just stands there screaming for the entire duration the steamroller slowly approaches and rolls over them.There is a scene in this movie exactly like that. Yet, instead of a steamroller, its a space ship that crashes into the earth and then slowly rolls over someone as it topples over. Yes, a person gets run over by a spaceship in Prometheus. Not killed by an Alien or from exposure on an alien planet...literally squashed by a space ship.And here's the worst part....this almost happens TWICE. Seriously Damon Lindelof? You couldn't come up with something better than that?",Null,74,130,9 June 2012
