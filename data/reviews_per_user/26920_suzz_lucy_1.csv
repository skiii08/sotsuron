Marie Antoinette," Acting is ho-hum - Set and Costume is AMAZING
","To be brief the story is good. The acting is OK, nothing too horrid or Oscar worthy. The Sets, props, and clothing are just beautiful. The way in which the film was shot is remarkable. It has a sort of modern look to it, but it doesn't go overboard. It is still a period piece. Kirsten Dunst doesn't speak with an accent of any kind. She speaks as if she were living in the time period but it just seems as if she is reading lines and not truly speaking them as Marie Antoinette. Jason Schwartzman is good as King Louis. He looks, walks, eats, speaks, and acts the role. He was a good choice as far as cast goes. It was OK to sit and watch to say I have seen it, it isn't something I will watch again just because I have some free time.",7,0,1,19 February 2007
