Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Don't waste your mind, heart, attention, time or money
","The summary says how I felt before I even found out about the oppression of the people used in making it. I have never before rated a movie with 1 star and wished it could be rated with none. I have never before felt so taken in and misled by reviews and word of mouth on radio. I am not even going to waste any more words or attention on it now and since I have to write 10 lines I will recommend recent movies more worthy of attention: What the Bleep Do We Know?; The Secret; One; Conversations With God; An Inconvenient Truth; America: Freedom to Fascism; and for those who may think I am just some kind of prude, I also found Transamerica worthy of attention; and for those who went to it just for the graphic and close to graphic sex, I actually liked Shortbus and had a salon myself during the Gay Era at Villa Amari, though I didn't recognize it as such at the time.",1,13,28,14 November 2006
