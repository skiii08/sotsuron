The Avengers," Incredible!
","I am a huge fan of superhero movies, so I had to see this one in the cinema. I had my doubts about this one though. A group of individual superheroes who don't know how to work together and have to work together as a team. And yes, it was just this way how the movie started. The first half was boring. I don't like Jeremy Renner as an actor and this movie didn't change that feeling for a bit. I just don't like 'hawkeye'.The Hulk (and of course Mark Ruffalo) was just... incredible. Yes, he is the best Hulk ever, but to be honest, it is Bill Bixby who has put Banner on the screen in the first place. We are now in 2012 and now Mark is the Bruce, who will be the next Bruce Banner? The Hulk was funny, surprisingly good, entertaining.That the movie was about Thor and his half brother was disappointing. I thought we had that fight one year ago.Now there is one thing that is bugging me. This year is all about competition between the avengers and the dark knight rising. I don't think the new Spiderman will be in the same race, but I like to be surprised. After seen this movie, I hope I will be satisfied in July with The dark knight rising. The Avengers just didn't entertain me the whole time. Some parts it was just boring.The movie had action, a lot of jokes. The second half was great, but I still don't rate a whole movie on the second half.",7,0,8,28 April 2012
The New World," Very awful movie!
","I only rent this movie because Bale would be in it. I did not see Bale in the movie at all. I fell asleep before I could see him. I regret spending my money on this movie. It was so boring. Colin meets a girl of an other tribe. She learns to speak English in no-time, and sudden she speaks it very well. She should become a doctor, she's that clever.That is not the only thing that makes the movie boring. It is very slow. So little happens in so much time. I have nothing more to say about this movie. If I am going to buy this movie, I only would do it because I can throw away my sleeping pills. I really tried to stay awake, but all my efforts were in vain. Is this the worst movie of 2006? If it's up to me I would say yes. But hey, that is just the opinion of one person...",1,3,8,14 August 2006
The Expendables 2," Breathtaking.
","As a young boy I loved the movies of Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Willis and so on. So a movie like this is a dream. Action was great, fighting scenes were breathtaking. I am glad I came out of the cinema alive. Stallone is still great. My wife came with me to see the movie in cinema and asked me why these old men still make movies. Well, I don't know, but I'm glad they do.Gunnar (Dolph Lundgren) was funny. Because of him the movie was watchable for the female audience. Li, where the hell was he? Stratham was awesome. Willis and Schwarzenegger were funny, but what happened with Scharzenegger's hair dress? Did his hair explode too? I did not like Liam Hemsworth in the movie. In the beginning he was O.K. but then sudden he had this story about his dog or something and it got very boring. I don't know if it's because his acting or because of the lame story of maybe the chemistry between the lame acting and boring story, but it didn't work out well. I know this could have been better and if it was better, you would get more attached to this boy as a viewer. Jean Claude was great. Norris was good, I did not expect this of him, but he was good. Not good enough to watch all his movie he made that I haven't seen. He wasn't that good enough.The movie had great one-liners. At the end the actors came on screen and for a moment you get to see their skulls. That was very beautiful!Now there are rumors about a third movie, and there should be a third movie. Now there are also rumors to have Steven Segal attached to it. Oh please don't! Except when he is going to play the role of a pony-tailed woman who gets kidnapped and has to be saved by the men who really do have muscles. Making expendables was a good idea, making expendables 2 was even greater. Don't waste it on Segal in the third. If I may suggest someone who I would like to see, more than Segal, I would prefer Jean Reno (Leon 1994).",7,1,5,19 August 2012
Source Code," Groundhog day?
","I have loved the movie Donnie Darko, it was great. But somehow this Jake Gillenhaal cannot catch my attention. So I heard about this movie, it would be great, but it had Jake G. in it. Even though I had to see this movie.Jake wakes up in a train, after eight minutes everyone dies in the train due to a bomb explosion. Jake wakes up in a capsule. He's connected to an experiment called source code. The government can get him back into the train into the body of someone else, just for eight minutes, over and over again, to find out where the bomb is hidden and who the person is behind this act of cruelty.Now, that is a formula of a good movie isn't it? Besides of getting the feeling that you're watching groundhog day, you also want to learn more of what the situation is where Jake is captured in. Jake talks to the man who has created this source code and with a lot of science-alike blablabla you have to believe of what this man is saying, that is the reality. Well, there this movie lost me because I only heard a lot of crap that did not make any sense, ave the movie a second chance and watched the movie further. You get to see the situation where Jake really is in and that is not pretty. You know that it does not matter in which direction the story goes, you will never be satisfied as a viewer. And that really is the feeling I was left when the movie was over.Some people say it gives you stuff tot think about, but this ain't Inception. The concept really had a lot of plot holes like the movie maker only had a concept and a little time to work it out. That's a shame. It could have been so much better.",7,0,2,13 November 2011
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," I expected more from this movie.
","I am not a star wars fan, but I can enjoy a good movie. In my opinion Rogue 1 had lots of flaws, therefore I could not enjoy it. First of all, I liked the actors and actresses, although some of them had small parts (but there are no small parts...).In the beginning Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen, great actor) says he has to work on this disaster machine. If he doesn't go, the bad guys will find someone else to make this machine. Then why did the bad guys go all the way through the galaxy to find him? There is this planet where Jyn Erso can find a tape to get the blueprint of this disaster machine. To enter this planet you have to go through a circle because the rest of the planet has a protection shield. Really? If a planet has a protection shield, this shield will orbit around other planets and the planet in the shield will crash against the shield. Okay, let's say this is science fiction and somehow it is possible, if I am a bad guy and I invented a shield around a planet, why just one? Why did they not create a back-up shield within the first protection shield? So the good guys have a plan. With a very small spaceship they push a very big spaceship of the bad guys against an other spaceship of the bad guys. And when the big spaceships collide they crash into each other and explode. In reality this could never happen. The big spaceship would only bump against the other big spaceship and that's just it. I wonder why the people who created these images did not say 'wait, this is just stupid'. When I push a big truck against an other big truck with my small car, the trucks will not explode.At the end Darth Vader kills a couple of good guys with his light saber. That looked very stupid. If he has the power to squeeze their throats, why did he bother to wave with his light saber? What was the purpose of Jyn Erso to be in prison at the beginning of the movie? If Jyn Erso had a rough life, how did she manage to keep the crystal she got from her father? If Galen Erso did not know whether his daughter was alive or not, he had not seen her for many years, why did he named the tape after his daughter's nickname? What if his daughter decided to become a chef, why did he put this huge responsibility in her hands and not in the hands of Saw? Chirrut Îmwe (Donnie Yen) gets killed by storm troopers. After getting killed Baze Malbus comes over to his friend to say goodbye. Where were the storm troopers at that moment? This movie did not make any sense to me.",6,2,5,5 January 2017
Iron Man 2," Very refreshing.
","I like the Iron Man movies. The special effects are great, story is interesting and surprising. Acting is good. After seeing Iron man 1 I thought, what can they do different in Iron man 2, but it really worked out great.After seen so many superhero movies, it is known that it's hard to make a good third movie (see the original spider man movies). It is hard to top the first two. Now they are going to make Iron Man 3. I have seen the cast list on IMDb and I'n eager to see the movie. Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce, William Sadler. I am not going to mention the whole cast list, but what bothered me is why Anthony Michael Hall is not listed. It would be great to see him again with Robert Downey Jr. in a movie.",8,3,4,8 August 2012
The Hunger Games," Wasn't that great.
","The hunger games is about people coming out of different districts and two people from each district have to fight 'till life and death. The are brought Harry Potter like to the center with a train. Like 'cabin in the woods' there is a Big Brother involved. This is an action movie, and from time to time there is an emotional element.The people who came to fight, join groups to eliminate the weaker people. Why? It's everyone for himself. When the weaker people are eliminated, they surely have to kill each other, because only one can survive in the end. So it doesn't make any sense. For the movie maker it was easier to let some people join groups, because when they are eliminated, they are eliminated together. Besides that, it is easier not to work out all the different characters. There is this little black girl who puts leaves on the main character, why? At the end it is better is you would have killed the better contestants.Nice movie, but it is not very believable.",7,2,6,19 August 2012
Argo," I'm not a fan of political movies, but this one is good.
","I am not a fan of political movies and the most recent movies of Ben Afleck weren't that great. But this one got in the media very big so I had to see it. Maybe the Good will hunting actor made a hit, and yes he did.Argo is an entertaining movie. It is very exciting and surprising. The most important reason why this movie works, is because the story is very realistic. Most people go to the airport and is afraid to go through customs, even when you haven't done a thing. So you can relate to the people in this movie.Acting is good, story is good. Good cast! Of the people who have to be taken out of Iran, you don't get to see much, but that does not matter. I don't think this movie is overrated. To say that after wards is very easy. I know the Hurt Locker was overrated, but I don't have the same feeling about Argo. Those who have not seen this movie, it is worth watching.",8,1,2,19 March 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," I'm not a Trek fan, but this rocks!
","Since I was little I have been watching the Star Trek movies. I have watched them all and none of them made me a Star Trek fan. Yes, they were amusing, but that was all.A huge change came when J.J. Abrams made his first Trek movie four years ago. His Star Trek movies are much faster, exciting, comparable with movies from Nolan and Snyder, but still I won't wear Spock pajamas in bed. I'm just not that geeky enough.One thing I don't like about prequels is that you know who just won't die. Spock and Kirk cannot die in J.J. Abrams' movies. But that did not make this movie less interesting or exciting, and that's a big plus. The movie gives you everything you don't expect and it never gets you bored. If you are not a Trek fan like I am and you won't buy this movie on DVD, like I won't, just go watch it in the cinema. It is worth the money. What a rush.",8,5,9,6 June 2013
Creed," Nice boxing movie.
","The Rocky sage continues in the Creed series. I grew up with the Rocky movies. We Always watched them between Christmas and New Year. Watching the life of Rocky Balboa winning every fight he had in life. Watching Stallone's struggle of his own in life. Seeing Rocky and Stallone at this age in the movie Creed is magnificent. Who knew.Stallone puts this 'Micky'-like fragile trainer and he did it well. The beautiful Phylicia Rashad gave us a small performance, but I was glad to see her. After the Cosby she went off the radar for me. So it was a nice surprise.As a Rocky movie this one is, sadly to say, a little bit modern. It's not the old school hero versus bad guy like Samuel Jackson explained how a hero and a villain has to be, when he was Mr. Glass in the movie unbreakable. But when you remember Rocky fighting Drago, the one who killed Creed sr. you know what I mean.That being said, I am looking forward to Creed 2, where Don is going to revenge his father's death by fighting Drago. For me, the Rocky saga is still on! Great movie, thank you for not bringing in too much rap music.",8,0,0,12 November 2017
Terminator Salvation," Nice movie.
","I like the Supernatural series from McG, so I thought, why not watching this movie. It was great. Bale made a new batman movie, and now he blows a new wind through the terminator movies.This terminator movie is not the best. Still T2 is the best with the action through-wards the whole movie what we are used of Cameron (True Lies). There were not many new stuff in this movie. Only the biker robots were pretty new and the sky net factory.I liked the acting of the young kyle Reese a lot, perfect cast. Bryce, Bale and Sam were casted great also. I could not understand why Moon Bloodgood was in this movie. She was totally miscasted with her misplaced acting, beautiful woman though.Micheal Ironside was a surprise for me. I like that man in SF movies, certainly in Total Recall. Unfortunately he had to leave the party this time also.I would like to say that I'm looking forward to see a fifth terminator movie. Well, it will be the fourth movie, Terminator 3 is not worth to be mentioned compared to the other movies.Story was great, Connor looking for his young father. Special effects were average, not many new stuff we haven't seen in movies before.The voice of the woman speaking to John Connor on the tapes didn't sound like Linda Hamilton's voice. It is weird to see the movies go forward without Hamilton, Schwarzenegger Patrick and Furlong. They made Terminator to what it is now. The terminator movies (1 and 2) were not that bad compared to the batman movies of Burton. But McG made a worthy effort to continue the story of John Connor. I only hope he gives the audience more action in the fifth movie, I missed it in this movie.",7,2,3,7 June 2009
Spider-Man 3," Not that great.
","I loved the hype around spider-man. Spiderman 1 was awesome! A lot happened. There was a lot of action AND s story! So it had everything you could wish for. So spider-man 1 was a success. Everyone wanted to see a sequel. Spiderman 2 came. Here was too much story and a little action. The story was a bit boring, too much romance. But when there was action, so it was great! So spider-man 2 was also a success.Now spider-man 3 is out in the cinema's. I've seen is just yesterday. Spiderman 3 was a lot of story and a bit of action. And when there was action, it wasn't that great. Venom was not as big and gigantic as in the comics or cartoon. The action with venom was just a little and not awesome. Some people think Venom died, but he didn't. The teacher of Peter Parker has a bit of the stuff that came out of space. So the teacher can change into Venom, or a student who comes into his office and touches the alien stuff.The relationship between Harry and Peter was great! But I don't know why the friendship between them had to involve in such way. The tearjerker at the end was sad, and unnecessary.There is an open ending so there is more stuff for more, but I hope this third episode is the last one. I don't think Tobey and Kirsten will come back for more episodes. In that case it would not be worth is to make three more. But then again, Peter and Mary Jane aren't married yet...",6,18,37,2 May 2007
The Adventures of Tintin," Stupid comic, great movie.
","It's very common now to make a movie out of a comic, but not like this one. Tintin the movie is in any way funny, action packed and interesting. Besides E.T. flying on the bike before the movie, Spielberg put more jokes with his signature in the movie, like The drawing made of Tintin in the beginning, looking like the comic Tintin.Knowing the work of Jackson, I knew I could expect a beautiful cartoon movie. Everything was beautiful, the landscapes, the people and animals in the movie. I did not get bored at all during the movie. It was original.Although it is a great movie, I don't hope for a sequel, because mostly sequels aren't better than the first movie.Great work!",8,1,13,29 October 2011
Suicide Squad," Not that spectacular.
","After all those Marvel movies, DC opened with Suicide Squad. In a world without Superman, we need bad guys to protect us. Yes, Batman caught some of these bad guys, but still, we need them. I guess Batman was too busy, with what exactly? This movie Obvious has some major flaws. But if we don't look at all those flaws, we see what this movie really is made of; a mixture of good and bad actors and actresses and some cosmetic make-up of special effects which made this movie a bad Marvel look alike.The movie starts with retro introductions of the bad guys. That was a bit awkward. Margot Robbie was a terrific Harley. Will Smith had a great come-back. Very beautiful his bond with his daughter. I did not get this Australian guy with his boomerangs, like I did not get the guy of The Avengers with his bow and arrows.The thins about these movies is that these actors and actresses have to act like they are scum. IRL they are very rich and have a rich life. So while watching the movie, it just does not make any sense. I did not feel the hurt or grief of the characters.I like Jared as an actor. Has been watching his movies from the nineties. But the Joker is still Ledger. If you can't make a better sequel, just don't. The end of the movie, I just did not get it.The movie as an intro for a better movie is succeeded. This movie as itself is not worth watching a second time. First time is painful enough.",6,0,2,6 August 2016
Shutter Island," Nice thriller, with some flaws.
","I love the combination Scorcese and DiCaprio. It's like Depp and Burton; somehow it's a magical combination. They put together a brilliant thriller at the first sight. Two cops go to an island to investigate a break-out.As the story continues with riddles of which you know you'll get the clue somewhere at the end of the movie, you already know Kingsley is behind the whole thing. There is something about Kingsley you know as a viewer you can't trust.The SS past of DiCaprio is almost well done. I like the fact Scorcese made this aspect a part of the movie, even with Kingsley in it who made his movie about Anne Frank's history. But when there is a line up and people are getting shot, they are shot all together at the same time but they drop on the floor at the time the camera is shooting them.The movie is exciting until the end. The end, where the plot drastically and originally changes, is wonderful. But then I got the feeling this movie had some flavor of the movie 'a beautiful mind'. As sudden this uniqueness changed into unoriginal.The very last ending of the movie was not happy, but very suitable.",7,2,3,10 June 2010
Life of Pi," Astonishing. Best movie I have seen this year.
","I went to Life of Pi special event in our local cinema and the movie was sold out on two screens. I have never seen this before. The movie is about religion and a cast away. The movie is very funny, frightening, serious, dramatic, beautiful, breathtaking, intelligent at the same time. The story behind the story is fantastic. Acting is wonderful. I am glad Irrfhan Khan has put a step out of Bollywood. I loved his movies even when he was not yet a Bollywood star. He had a small part in this movie, but fulfilled that very well.Suraj Sharma is a newcomer and an underdog when it come to acting. He did very well for a first time. This cannot be said about most beginning actors or actresses. I hope he will make more movies (as an actor or director) who have a deeper meaning like Life of Pi. I don't hope for this boy to follow the footsteps of Dev Patel who acted in this wonderful Slumdog Millionair and then in this boring Aribender.Like the beauty of Shravanthi Sainath was breathtaking, so were the scenes of the animals in this movie. I can say it was fantastic. I can imagine that this movie will not make it in India, because it has a heavy take out when it comes to religion. Even in the West the gravity of the real story might for most people be to hard to follow and understand. But for those who can keep their mind to a movie, it is worth watching in the cinema and more times after when it gets out on DVD.",8,4,8,18 December 2012
Chak de! India," New Sharukh movie? Crap!
","I waited so long for a new Sharukh movie. I hoped Sharukh would be back with a new way of acting, but no.Sharukh has been the king of acting in Bollywood. But seeing all of his movies, his acting was net refreshing. He has a clumsy way of acting. In the beginning it was funny, now it ain't funny anymore. It's like a joke you hear for the 20th time.Amitabh Bachchan had to deal with the same thing, but A.B. came back very strong in Mohabbatein. I hoped for a strong comeback for Sharukh in Chak de India, but the movie was crap! In my opinion it was an introduction of several new actresses. Nothing more, nothing less. The moral of this movie is that women can do what men co do. That's it! For a movie with Yash Raj and Sharukh you may expect more than what this movie has to offer you.My advice? Don't watch this movie.",4,9,24,27 August 2007
Pacific Rim," Best action movie of the year?
","I was looking forward to see this movie, for a long time. This should be Real Steel in the square. The movie is about big robots, driven by people to destroy huge monsters. Very simple story with many layers. Acting was good, action and special effects were awesome. Soundtrack rocked. This movie is a treat. During the movie I was wondering if the cast was chosen well, but it worked out well eventually. Ron Perlman was great, as usual. Charly Day was annoying with his weird voice, as usual. It could be the best action movie of the year, but the year ain't over yet. If there will be an action movie, that will be better than Pacific Rim, I will be amazed. I'm sure waiting for the sequel.See this in the cinema, Imax.",9,3,9,18 July 2013
Ant-Man," Very beautiful made,and original.
","I went to the cinema to watch this movie. First day and only 8 people in a very large room. I loved how Douglas played. Terrific actor, love him still. Acting was great, story and the action scenes as well. I had a little deja-vu when Scott shrunk himself and went under ground. It was like 'Honey I shrunk the kids' but a very modern version of it. The way Scott went in the world of the ants was great.Now what I didn't liked. The first half of the movie there was not much action. They took the first half of the movie to build up a story. That's way too long for an action movie. If there is going to be a second movie (with ant-woman, very attractive woman by the way) I hope they won't make the same mistake there was made with The Amazing Spiderman 2; First movie was awesome, second movie was an overkill of special effects and no heart to the story. Keep a good balance and don't let one take control.Loved the movie. Great respect to Michael Douglas, to perform this well, at the same age of my father.",7,1,9,23 July 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," A bit dull movie.
","I like those superhero movies. I heard a lot of negative ideas about this one; it's all about America. That's fine, I din't mind that. America can be proud of all the superheroes that came out of the comic books.But there's something I do mind. And that is when a superhero movie becomes dull. The movie begins where a man enters a spaceship and asks 'What is this?' Well, what do you think it is? First half of the movie ain't spectacular. I was waiting for the action. The idea of the funny suit that the Captain wears is not original.The second half of the movie is predictable. Captain America enters the airplane of the red skull and leaves with a smaller plane. You know he has to come back to the bigger plane to beat up the red skull. This movie takes place in 1941 or something like that. I already knew that Nick Fury was in this movie, so Captain America has to enter the future. With knowing all these facts, I had the idea that this movie was built around those ideas for the next superhero movie The Avengers (2012).That's why I could not see this movie as a movie itself, but a warming up for an other movie. Action wasn't that great, yes it's all about America, Hugo Weaving acted just like Ralf Moeller, so why didn't they cast Ralf for the role as the Red Skull? Weaving didn't add much to the movie.It was nice to see Stanley Tucci in a make over. Tommy Lee Jones acted well.",6,3,10,1 August 2011
Rush," I'm not a formula racing fan, but this movie kills.
","I'm a huge Ron Howard's movie fan, and this movie just proves me right. It's a very realistic movie. It can't be otherwise, because it is about two rivals who compete with each other in Formula 1. I never watched races in my life, because I never have been attracted to something I cannot do. This movie is not about racing, it is about something else. It is a story between two men who became rivals on one day and they started to compete to each other. Filled with hate they watched death in the eye every time they stepped in their cars.What is more interesting is how this movie knows how to reach your heart. And who more can do this better than Howard? I don't think there would have been someone in the world who could have made this movie like Howard did. Soundtrack was amazing, evolvement of the characters, their game and finally their respect towards each other was astonishing. Cast was perfect. Watch this one in the cinema, it is worth it.",10,2,3,4 October 2013
The Last Legion," This is far from Gladiator!
","I didn't think this movie would be bad! I loved the movie gladiator with Russel Crowe. This movie is also in Roman history. When I saw the face of Thomas Sangster, I got weird feelings in my stomach. Not nice feelings. But I thought, when this boy has no pretty face, maybe he can act very well. No he can't. He plays Romulus Augustus, who is about to become Caesar. He is protected by Aurelius (Colin Firth) en be tutored by Ambrosinus (Ben Kingsley). Okay, does this sound great or what? Romulus' parents are killed by some enemies who want take over their power. Aurelius, who has sworn to protect Romulus until his last breath, even if he has to die for it, goes down after a few slaps. When he wakes up, everyone is gone. Romulus and Ambrosius are kidnapped. Aurelius is determined to rescue them! He gets help from a knight, or no, a knightress. In the beginning the knight wears a mask, to give the illusion he's a man. But then there's a surprise, not a pleasant one. It is Bollywood's Aishwaria rai! She doesn't wear the mask the rest of the movie, so what was the purpose of wearing it in the beginning? Only an audience purpose? This woman is like Uma Thurman. They look alike, but Uma can act, Aishwaria cannot act. To have a pretty face does not mean you can act. I know, I can't act, I have a pretty face, but you don't see me in movies. With a bad cast as Aishwaria and Thomas Sangster this movie cannot be saved anymore. Even not by Colin and Ben.But Romulus has to be saved (story continues). He finds a beautiful sword. His enemies want to take that sword. It looks like Lord of the rings, but in this case the ring is a sword. In battle Ben Kingsley stands with his arms wide like he is shooting fire balls, like he is Gandalf. Aurelius (Colin) gets beaten twice and hits the ground. He is about to die after two slaps! What a wuss! His body isn't pierced or something, he hasn't broken something. Aishwaria rai gets him in her arms like only she can do in the romantic bollywood movies. Is this a comedy movie or something? These are the people who have to protect Caesar (Romulus).Ambrosinus starts a fight with an enemy nearby a tree from sleepy hollow. When all battle is gone, Romulus throws away his sword. Luckily enough the sword does not hit anyone. No, it hits a rock and there it stays for many years. Yeah right.This movie is a waste of your time. Or, it was a waste of my time for sure!",3,4,12,4 June 2007
Justice League," Average movie, not original.
","The thing I liked about the Dark Knight trilogy was that it was refreshing, new, Original. We have seen a lot of cartoons or comics that have been changed into improved cartoons we call movies nowadays. We saw The avengers, where a couple of individuals have to team up to save the day. At first it doesn't work, but for the sake of mankind they have to. Then we had Suicide squad, where a couple of individuals have to team up to save the day. The same happened with the x-men. Now the writers of Justice League had the chance to giver the viewers a whole different kind of story, maybe an Original one, but still they choose to invent a couple of individuals which have to team up to save the day (I just copy pasted that line and changed it a little, like the writers did of this movie).There were a lot of questions I asked myself while watching this movie. Like in the beginning how did wonder woman end up at the Libra statue? Did she jump on top of it or did she climb the statue, and why? To be honest, I am more a Marvel fan. The Marvel movies are more fun to watch. For instance, Marvel's x-men has Quick-silver. He is very fast and the scenes are funny to watch, and very well made. I had the feeling they were trying to copy paste Quick-silver into The Flash. Only at the end of the movie, the last short scene with The Flash and Superman, thát was funny. Why not in the movie? I think DC misses the marks on so many levels. I did not enjoy Batman-Superman and Wonderwoman. The movies are very promising, but not the heart and soul of The Dark Knight Trilogy or the Marvel movies. Maybe DC tries to be different, but different is not Always better.",6,0,1,19 November 2017
Man of Steel," Not original, no heart, no beautiful Lois Lane.
","I grew up with Reeve's Superman, so I had great expectations about this one. Even more because Nolan, Shannon, Lane, Crowe, Costner and Fishburne were involved. But how much I tried to enjoy this movie, I was disappointed all the time.1. This movie is not original. The street fight between Superman and the two aliens were much like Superman II (1980). Children being born like machines was like the idea of Matrix. They even had Morpheus working for the Daily Bugle.2. Like humor and drama was the strength of The amazing spider-man, this movie had no emotions at all. This fantastic cast, especially my greatest respect for Shannon, could not give this movie a deep layer of emotions, so as a viewer I did not get involved with the characters. That was a pity. When I left my seat in the cinema and I put off my 3D glasses, I did not have the feeling like I was Superman.3. Nolan made his mistake by giving the role of Rachel Dawes to Holmes in Batman begins (2005). We all know who did not play Rachel Dawes in the sequel. Where did Amy Adams came from? I had no Lois Lane feeling when I saw her acting.Cavill is a handsome Superman, that's for sure. But whether he is a worth full follower of Reeve I doubt that. I do not have that doubt with Routh. I just enjoyed Routh as Superman. Why was he not in Man of steel? Where did that go wrong?",7,5,10,20 June 2013
The Revenant," Internse movie.
","Just saw this movie yesterday and it was great. It's about Hugh Glass who travels with a group of men through the mountains and is left behind for death after a bear attack. The power of the movie is the cast (DiCaprio, Hardy and Gleeson) and the way the movie is made. As a viewer I got the feeling I was there with them. It is very realistic and some times horrific. Most people, like me, did not get the end of the movie. It was very quiet when the movie ended and everyone left the cinema.I left the cinema with the feeling that although this movie is wonderful to watch, when it will win some Oscars I think the movie (and the wonderful actors) will be overrated. I kept thinking about Mel Gibson's Apocalypto (2006) which was, in my point of view, a much better movie than this one. The Revenant was exciting and authentic, but from time to time boring. There is no doubt that the bear attack will become epic. But compared to previous results of other movies, like the one I mentioned, I think this one is slightly overrated.",8,0,1,30 January 2016
Split," 'This is more than a movie, this is art.'
","Besides of his ridiculous middle name I am a huge fan of Mr. Night Shyamalan's (Manoj's) movies. Especially Unbreakable was awesome. I had to see this collaboration between Shyamalan and McAvoy in the cinemas.I heard so many negative sounds about this movie. They were not really about the movie, but about Mr. Night. I don't understand. In their eyes Manoj can't do anything right anymore. So their judgment is already made based on the director. That does not make any sense. Manoj said in an interview that some people don't like his signature by being a small part of his own movies as an actor. That is what I do like about him. Why would the suit fit Stan Lee and not Manoj? Manoj makes me proud to be an Indian and writer of a thriller novel as well.Split is a very thrilling movie. I was on the edge of my seat all the time. I did not want to miss a second of the movie. The end scene was amazing. The acting of McAvoy is phenomenal. The script is not predictable. This is a worthy movie in the resume of Manoj. I wish him all the luck to surpass the greatness of this movie. The woman I went to see this movie with said; 'This is more than a movie, this is art.' I totally agree.",10,7,21,29 January 2017
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Best action movie ever!
","I have seen this movie in the cinema in 1991. I was blown away, even because I had not seen Terminator 1. Even T1 was great, but T2 was the best! I bought the extended DVD and I loved the extended version of T2. There were scenes cut out of the movie what made the story more understandable.Schwarzenegger and Patrick gave a remarkable performance as a terminator. I did not like Schwarzenegger in T3, he did not have to make that movie. T3 was a great disappointing.I like the fact they did not go for the alternate ending with the old Sarah Connor. The original ending with the highway road was much better. I liked Linda Hamilton even when she was the beauty in beauty and the beast. She is one of my favorite actresses, and unfortunately highly underrated.I liked Furlong very much, his drug history is a waste of talent. I hope he'll come back. There was something I did not understand. In the interviews I heard that all terminators would have the look of Schwarzenegger. Did is wrong, because in T1 Reese gets a dream of a terminator coming into their bunker, but it wasn't Schwarzenegger.The idea of the terminator with skin around the metal skelet is that a normal man cannot see that it is a terminator. When you make all terminators with the (outside) look of Schwarzenegger, it would not be a disguise anymore.T1 and T2 were great, T3 was very wrong. Schwarzenegger was not convincing anymore. I'm curious about T4,5 and 6 with Bale. Although I think no one can replace Schwarzenegger, I think it is time for some new flesh. Schwarzenegger has left the building. I don't know why Nick Stahl played John Connor in T3, that was such a miscast! I hoped for the actor who played a few seconds John Connor in T2 (Michael Edwards), to let him be the Connor in T3. But no, nobody asked for my opinion. ;-) Schwarzie, if Stallone can make films at his age, even you can. You are not the guy for politics. You have to make T3 up for your fans. T3 sucked big time! I hope you'll be back in T4. Don't let Batman get you.",10,6,9,10 January 2008
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," It even got better and better.
","Due to some internet problems this is the second time I have to write my review for this movie. But here it comes: I have heard of this millennium trilogy and I was very curious. But I never saw the movies in the Swedish version. I never read the books which are sold very well. Now this Fincher's version I could not resist seeing in the cinema, so I just went.The beginning of the movie was beautiful. Dark images, computer animated. Very beautiful. The transfer between these dark (black) images and the actual movie was not very well. This movie is about Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) who agrees to investigate a several murders on women on an island. At the beginning I saw that Stellan Skarsgård was in it. So I already knew that the odds were big that he had something to do with it. Good actor though, I don't hope he was chosen for this movie because he only was born in Sweden.When the story goes on, we gets to see what this girl Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) has to go through in her daily life. That was very bad. I'm sorry, I don't know how to put this into words. I really felt sorry for her. No woman should go through something like that. I know that this just is a movie, but these things could happen in real life, or even worse. That got me thinking. Some people are really sick. Good acting from Yorick van Wageningen here. Good actor, liked him in Winter of wartime.Like Robin Wright gets prettier every year (most women don't), this movie gets better and better. When you think the movie is over, it isn't. The story goes on and on and it's a good story. As a viewer you really get treated on a good movie. Good acting, good story. It is worth the money.As we have seen the bad life of this young girl Lisbeth Salander, you really want the best for her. So does she want that for herself. At the end of the movie she hopes for a life with Mikael Blomkvist and is left all alone in reality. So I am asking myself what would I have done, but that does not make the decision of Mikael Blomkvist easier to understand.Very, very good movie. I cannot wait for the next two movies. I know, I can read the books or watch the Swedish version, but I am spoiled with Fincher's version now.",8,1,5,22 January 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," See this one in the cinema, definitely!
","When I heard this movie would come out I was very skeptic. Andrew Garfield is not very known as a good actor. He doesn't have the looks. What new could this spider-man movie bring after the trilogy of Rami? After seen the commercials about spider-man to be the outlaw, a vigilante, I got this cheap feeling about this movie was to become a similar reboot of the spider-man movies like Batman begins was with Christian Bale. For Batman begins it worked out great, even with that movie I had my doubts at first.Due to the high rating om IMDb I had to see this one in the cinema and so I did. Garfield turned out to be a fantastic Peter Parker and an actor. This movie had almost the same story like Rami's first movie had. This Lizard was a cross-over between Green Goblin and Doc Oc. The movie was moving all the time. Spiderman had almost no time to sit down. As a viewer I got entertained all the time. The movie was funny, scary, very good.The acting was good, I loved Emma Stone, Martin Sheen, Sally Field, Irrfan Khan. Special effects were great, soundtrack was awesome. There were some little mistakes, like Peter Parker breaks the window of the front door of his aunt and uncle and at night the door is fixed. But I don't think we should really be picky about this, especially when I left the theater well entertained. I was glad that spider-man shot his webs and really hit something all the time and not hitting the open air and still now falling down, if you know what I mean.Some people keep comparing this movie to Raimi's spider-man movies. But let those movies be. Rami's movies were, except the third one, very good too. So I don't think this is a reboot of Raimi's Spiderman movies. This is an improvement of the Rami's movies. To be honest I think The dark knight rises has a big competition this year. I wonder if there will come more spider-man movies with Garfield. Will it be a trilogy again?",10,6,16,29 June 2012
Now You See Me," No deeper layer, acting way overconfident.
","I like movies with magicians, as I like The prestige 2006. Michael Caine was involved in this movie as well, so I had my high expectations. This movie could not live up to them.Yes the movie is entertaining, it surprises the audience from time to time. Mark Ruffalo, Harrelson and Franco were awesome. Sorry, I'm just a Harrelson fan. But Eisenberg and Fisher were way too overconfident. Due to their way of acting, I guess Eisenberg was still stuck in his Zuckerberg-character, I did not believe in there characters. That's why I could not relate to them or care what would happen to the team of illusionists. This movie just did not blow me away.This movie has no deep layers like we already saw in movies like The prestige or Inception. I guess we have to wait a year if we want to see a high level movie like these two when Interstellar will come out.",6,2,5,30 June 2013
The Butterfly Effect," Butterflies
","I've seen many films about time traveling, but never one like this with a original view on it. Evan Treborn is a boy who has memory loss in his youth. When big tings happen, he snaps out of reality and when he comes back, he doesn't know what happened. Because of these losses he keeps up a journal to remind himself what happened before or after the memory losses. While Evan grows older, he begins to read his journals. He travels through time and relives his memories. But that isn't everything. He can change in the past whatever he wants. He tries to make the future better for his friends by changing the past. But whatever he does, he makes things worse. I saw this movie in the cinema, and bought it on DVD. In my opinion is the director's cut the best version. The way how this version goes is more catching. The cinema version is for the ones who want a happy ending, and not a good story.",8,1,3,15 July 2005
Twilight," Boring movie.
","I was surprised, after seeing this movie, to hear it has won some awards. This movie was full of bad acting, bad duologue's. The movie did not make any sense. The genre is fantasy, but even the characters were created in a different dimension, like they were not from this planet (I mean the normal people).There was too little action, too little horror. It was very boring. I knew from the beginning the main characters would get a relationship. The girl was not very beautiful like Megan Fox, and still a couple of boys asked her to go to the prom with them. Like she was the only girl at school. The story took so long to get the main characters into a relationship. The way she found out the guy was a vampire, just by buying a book from a bookstore she googled from the internet, was very stupid.",3,1,3,8 July 2009
Django Unchained," Funny.
","When I watched the interviews I was curious to see this movie. I like Tarantino's movies, so I had to see this one. It would be much better than his previous movies, more action, more blood than Kill Bill 1 + 2. Both of them did not happen. I'm a fan of the Kill Bill movies. In my point of view they both are better than Django, even Pulp Fiction is better. Django Unchained is just newer, that's all.What is important is to know that Django Unchained is a good movie. It is funny like only Tarantino can make it. Good actors and actresses. And most important; very original. Like most of Tarantino's movies, you must not miss this one.",7,3,8,17 January 2013
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Well done Stiller.
","I wanted to see this movie for a long time, but it was rented every day at my local DVD-store. Finally I got it today and it was worth watching. This movie is shot very, very beautiful. The story has a deeper meaning. Acting isn't very great, but the story makes that up easily. The movie is funny, touching and I as a viewer wanted to know what was behind the story. That was making me watch the whole movie. Seeing a man chasing his dreams and finally becoming his dreams was wonderful. I can only say well done Stiller, best movie of yours made 'till now. I can only applaud such serious movies that can move your feelings. Some moments were a little bit dull, and that was a shame. Still very good movie.",7,0,0,9 May 2014
Kick-Ass," Second half was awesome!
","I just came from the cinema and watched this movie. The first half was not so terrific. The story was built up slowly. The reality of life, that almost everyone dreams to be a superhero was shown very clever. Real life ain't that great.Aaron Johnson played the nerd very well and during the movie he didn't change a bit. He played his role very good. Nicolas Cage was just good. I don't know why they didn't cast Gary Busey for the role as Big daddy. Maybe the moviemaker wanted to add a big name to the movie. A pity, Gary would have been a better pick.The cherry on the pie was Chloe Moretz. This young girl owned the movie. What a great performance she gave us. Such bolt and horrific scenes she played in.The action was great, new. Humor was O.K. The best part of the movie for me was the silent before the storm (dutch saying) where Cage, Moretz and Johnson prepares themselves for 'the big fight'. And then... there came a lot of fantastic action! Background music was fantastic, wonderful.Christopher Mintz-Plasse gave a great performance and at the ending he suggested there could be a sequel for this movie. Please don't, unless it will be better that this movie. But I don't think that is possible.Great work guys... and especially the little girl.",10,5,14,25 April 2010
X-Men: Apocalypse," Got to see the previous movies first.
","The x-men movies evolved over the years, and that's a good thing. There is so much potential left en there is so much more to tell. If you have not seen X: First Class (2011) and X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014), I highly recommend to see both before watching this one.The movie starts a little bit weird, with Egypt people taking of their masks and there is one guy who grunts weird. I thought, no please don't let this high budget movie be filled with bad actors. And luckily, besides Alexandra Shipp, it wasn't.X-Men: Apocalypse (2016) has little action sequences in the first half of the movie. The first half it is about building up a story what leads in the second half to all the action we are used of this kind of movies. I was afraid the movie would feel a bit cartoonish, but that was not the case.From all the characters I like Evan Peters who played Quicksilver. This guy should get his own Quicksilver movies. He is so hilarious. It is a shame his relationship with Magneto did not have a satisfied ending. But maybe that will come in the next movie. At least I hope so.Good movie, worthy to be in the line of the x-men movies.",7,3,9,20 May 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," A lot of talking, less the action.
","I am a huge spider-man fan. I liked the Tobey McGuire trilogy and even the amazing spider-man 1 topped those three. The first amazing spider-man movie was tight. There were no unnecessary conversations and it was mature. This movie wasn't. It was way too long. There was a lot of explanation going on about the mystery around Peter's parents and the thing between Peter and Gwen. This took a lot of space in the movie so we didn't get a lot to see from Electro, Goblin and especially the Rhino. That was a big disappointment. Somewhere in the movie I saw the suit of Dr. Octavius, will he be there in the third movie? I don't have much more to say about this movie, only that it was a big disappointment. Now up to the third movie; will that one be only action? The mystery about the parents, Peter's father, is solved. There is nothing more left. Maybe Peter finding the killer of his uncle, but even that provides a thin shred of story. Will Gwen Stacey and her father be forgotten when Mary-Jane will appear? Will the lizard come back? Will the third movie vanish the story of the first two? Will Venom and Carnage appear? I don't know. Do I care? Maybe a little. I'll first have to get over this disappointment and silently wish for a wonder that the third movie will make up for this one.",5,25,52,27 April 2014
Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi," Sharukh acts terrific.
","This totally renewing story brings us a lame movie. Sharukh acts very good, wonderful! But only Sharukh's good acting cannot bring this movie, what has an original story, to a higher level.The story is boring. It could have been a better movie than it is right now. It was a disappointment. The wife of Sharukh is about to have an affair. Noting in this movie disapproves her behavior. No, it's the fault of Sharukh. What a rubbish! This woman was married. Her husband saved her from face-loss, and still she felt in love with an other man.Lame story, I liked 'Kabhi alvida na kehna'. I missed Abishek Bachchan in this movie a lot!",7,0,4,28 December 2008
Transformers," Awesome?
","I was a transformers fan back in the days, so I could not wait to see this movie. Before I went to this movie, I heard all transformers have a different look compared to the transformers of the cartoon. Most people don't like that, my wife doesn't like it either. But it didn't bother me. The most thing that did bother me was that Megatron and Starscream were shallow.The jokes in the movie were not funny. Most people who are going to watch this movie are adults who had been a fan of the cartoon. Kids of today don't want to watch transformers, but Harry Potter. The jokes were more for the youngers. I did not like the small jokes about the movie E.T. from Spielberg, or about the movie Armageddon from Michael Bay. These jokes were complete unnecessary. Even when the agent was handcuffed in his underpants, was not funny.The movie was like terminator 2: Sam Witwicky was like John Connor, protected by the terminator Bumblebee and hunted by the T1000 Barricade. Even in a fight sequence I heard the drum sound of the movie T2.The transformations were amazing! But the way how the fight sequences were followed was messy. The flight of Starscream between the other jets was awesome! The fight between Optimus and Megatron was short and not really exciting.All the actors and actresses speak normally American. But Rachel Taylor had to have a messy English accent. This was really annoying! Megan Fox on the other hand was nice to see. I liked the fact that Hugo Weaving did the voice of Megatron, but he didn't have a lot of lines to speak.The way how the transformers hide themselves at the house of Sam was not funny. In this way the viewer cannot take the transformers serious. That was a pity. There was a mistake made: Sam goes on a pink bike in the morning for a ride. He gets followed by Bumblebee. Then he gets in with Mikaela and gets chased by Barricade. And sudden it is from morning evening! This movie was about 2,5 hours. For this time I saw too little action! It took too long to make an introduction. In the middle of the movie we see Optimus. I hope there will come a second movie, with more action.*spoiler alert!* but how will there be a sequel when Megatron is dead?*/spoiler*",7,0,2,5 July 2007
Logan," Good movie, but very overrated on IMDb.
","As a father of a seven years old girl I like to watch father-daughter movies like Kick-ass, Maggie, Taken, The wrestler. I had to watch this one to. On IMDb people rated it a 9.2 so my expectations were very high.Acting from Stewart and Jackman was magnificent. In the film there were some surprising elements, but when you think about films that already has been made, they were not original. The story was flat. Film felt like a mixture of Universal soldier / Kick-ass / Terminator Genesys. In my opinion Kick-ass had more power, more feelings to touch the viewers heart.The little girl kind of let me down in acting being a mute a big part of the movie. It is easy to say the last movie in the line of the x-men movies, is the best. It does not Always has to be. That a movie is new does not mean it is the best. I am still fond of x-men days of future past. But that's my personal favorite.",6,9,32,1 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," There was so much not there...
","Just saw the movie in the cinema. Next to me there was this teenage boy with his dad. This boy was a die hard comic fan thinking to be as smart as Tony Stark, but when he laughed he did not know whether he had to breath through his mouth or nose or both at the same time. Really annoying.Now about the movie. I watched the first movie two days ago and compared to the first movie I had the feeling this sequel had a smaller cast. Now I don't have something against a smaller cast, but this cast still had Natasha in it and Clit Hawkeye (the dude with bow and Arrow). Both people are no superheroes. They are just well trained. So what are they doing in the movie? Oké I liked the thing between Natasha and The Hulk, but what is this dude Clit still doing in the movie? This sequel tries to catch a emotional tone. There's this thing going on between Natasha and The Hulk and this brother and sister thing between the twins. And here is why that does not work; The Avengers is an action slash comedy movie. You can't build emotional scenes on a foundation that began with humor. You just can't.Now for the good stuff. The fight between Iron Man and The Hulk was awesome. Paul Bettany looked very great. Well, that's about it.What will happen in the third movie? Will there be doubts about the unity of the team again? Will this be the theme of the movie like it has been in the first and second movie, again? Do we have to feel sympathy for the superheroes slash well trained people, knowing that no-one will die? How exciting can that be? Movie was a bit disappointing.",7,6,14,23 April 2015
Avatar," Only Beautiful.
","I saw this movie in 3D. I don't wear glasses, so it was a little bit weird to watch a movie with glasses on. Watching a movie in 3D is quite an experience. You can see the depth of the movie, but things do not come out of the screen, what some people say it does.Now I'm not a fan of Worrington. In Terminator I did not like him and this movie did not change even one bit of it. Cameron thinks he is a handsome man, I don't know. But even Bollywood proves that when you only are pretty or handsome, you can make it in the movie industry. You don't have to possess the ability of acting. Worrington is a shallow actor, maybe suitable for an action movie, but not with a high budget like this one.The movie itself is beautiful. You keep watching the screen seeing beautiful flowers, animals, a new world within a world. A discovery. Almost everything we get to see is a new experience, except the airplanes of the humans. They remind me of the airplanes of the last Terminator movie. The whole movie is a rush, and that's a good thing. As a viewer you don't get a chance to get bored in this 2.40 hours long movie.Not only the animals and flowers are beautiful. Also the way the people on the new planet called Pandora are connected to animals or flowers is fantastic.The story is simple, a little less interesting than Terminator. But this movie is not about the story, where they want to tell people that they are raping the earth and after that they want to find other planets as their victim. What is good about this idea is that it shows that people with high influence in business life don't always have to be the people who make the sanest or smartest choices. In real life I can relate to this aspect. You got to see this movie in 3D for a great experience.",8,2,12,19 December 2009
3 Idiots," Not original, nothing new.
","So Amir Khan made a new movie. Since Lagaan I have high expectations of the movies Amir makes, but he cannot keep up with the level he has put with Lagaan.Everything about this movie is annoying. The story is told by one of the idiots. A story telling movie in movies nowadays is not modern anymore. The stupid giggles like the narrator is telling a joke is not funny. Never laugh about your own joke. Every time the narrator talks, it's just like he thinks he's telling a joke very time.I did not know who in this movie were the idiots. Kareena Kapoor, because she wants to marry a donkey and an other idiot has to open her eyes? Omi Vaidya, because he's running his school for years (like in Mohabbatein) but he does not know how to educate children? What happened with Amir Khan's muscular body from Ghajini? Spoiler: Rancho (Amir Khan) ain't Rancho in real life. So Farhan and Hari want to look where Rancho is, but they find out Rancho is an other guy. They see a school photo, but instead of seeing Amir Khan on the photo, they see that other guy. This can't be, because Farhan and Hari were present on the day the photo was made and Amir Khan was on that photo, not the other Rancho. What were the movie makers thinking? That their audience are idiots too? The movie was too long. I fast forwarded most of the scenes. There were no good songs, so I forwarded every song also. In the beginning Omi Vaidya had a pen that he would give to a student who would be outstanding. From the beginning you know that he will give it to Amir Khan. What teacher lives with his family at school, that when his daughter has to give birth to a child, a student called Rancho has to do the delivery? Omi Vaidya plays a man who has two daughters. Amir Khan plays a student that has no child at all. It is not obvious that Amir Khan did the delivery.I do not understand why this movie gets an eight on IMDb. It wasn't that great. It has moments where the dialogs were interesting, like the father of one of the idiots did not give his son the laptop, but suggested to buy him a camera instead. But there were moments where the movie was awkward, like the speech what was made and raped by Rancho. Rancho was laughing his ass off when the stupid student recited the speech. Why? He rewrote the speech by himself...I have higher expectations when it gets to movies from Amir Khan. Oh brother where art thou? This movie was a mixture of 'Patch Adams' and 'Dead Poets Society'. Bollywood movies in general are not original. Mostly they are copies of Hollywood movies. This one is not original either.",6,7,16,8 February 2010
Total Recall," I finally figured it out!
","I know, I was not the fasted kid in the class. I liked Schwarzenegger's movies when I was little. I have seen Total Recall over and over. Great action movie, great soundtrack Even when the cast is announced it has great music on the background. Special effects were great. If you know what people can do much easier than they could do then, I still have much respect for the people who made this movie.I know a lot of people might already know what had been bugging a lot of people; was it all a dream or not? We get to see the answer when Douglas Quaid is going on his trip to recall. It is right at the beginning of the movie where he meets this boy Ernie and dr. Lull. Dr. Lull is asking Douglas some questions and shows him some alien artifacts. The she gives something to Ernie and Ernie says; 'That's a new one. Blue sky on Mars.' And just there this Ernie shows us it all has been a dream. If it would have been reality, it should have been coincidence that Douglas met this woman he choose numbered 41A, but it could not have been coincidence that Douglas created a blue sky on Mars.So on the first sight this Ernie had a small role in this movie. But after viewing this movie a lot of times he was the key to an important answer; 'What if this all was a dream?' Now this peace of puzzle if solved. Douglas Quaid was dreaming and after his kiss with Melina under the blue sky he should wake up some time. So when he wakes up he is still married to Lori. If that would not mess someone's head...Great movie though.",9,1,3,1 October 2011
In Time," Intense movie.
","Wow, I haven't seen such a movie as original as this one, in a long time! I just saw Real Steel in the cinema, ran downstairs to buy a ticket for In Time and I did not regret it.In this movie, people live until they reach the age of 26. After 26 years they just die. So every people has a limit of time he or she can spend. In their arm is written how much time they have left. If you want to buy something, you can buy it with time. In this way you have less time to spend. But if you work and get paid, you get paid in time. Great story right? It doesn't stop there! The story writers got everything out of this concept to give you a great action movie what you would have expected.There are different people; people who live day by day and who don't have much time and rich people who have all the time of the world and who want more time, even over the backs of the poor people.Will Salas (JT) wants to get more time for the poor people (like a modern Robin Hood) and meets this rich girl Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried). They steel time from the rich people and are being chased by the minute men (people who steel time from poor people) and Raymond Leon (CM). The chase of CM and JT reminded me about the cat and mouse hunt of Freejack (1992) where Jagger was chasing Estevez and even this hunt was very exciting. I was waiting for CM to count his one Missisippi and two Missisippi, but in his head CM was counting backwards when he was left with only a few seconds on his arm.Left all the realism aside, the story is not bulletproof. Sylvia Weis is living her life in the rich world, has never been in the poor area, and still she knows how people live in the poor area. I laughed when JT and SW kissed each other in the limo. When you are being chased you don't think about kissing I guess. But hey, I have never been chased before and definitely not in the company of a very beautiful woman.The vehicles in the movie were as fantasy less as the vehicles in Freejack. If cars in the future look like the cars in this movie, we don't make any progress. That was a pity.Great movie, great action, very exciting and intense. JT needs a few movies more to become a very good actor. He isn't there yet, but that's OK. He'll get there. If some don't know what I'm talking about, JT is not a flat actor, but he is not an actor who knows to reach your heart by acting with a lot of emotions, like an actor as Russel Crowe can do. But knowing his background as a singer, I must say, JT is on his way to become a good actor.",7,1,7,7 November 2011
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Mwah...
","Not a really good movie. Megan Fox was hot. That's really it. I was glad that the blond girl with the stupid accent from transformers 1 was not in this movie! Story was not great, I expected more from Bay and Spielberg. Megatron was shallow, the two geeky cars were stupid; most intelligent creatures and they are stupid, not very likely. The big transformer was not cool. I liked the combined transformers from the animated series (toys), but this one was too big. I could not see what was what. The panther/saber transformer was awesome! I liked it that a transformer could take the shape of a human being. There was no (or too little) character development. I liked the story about prime's ancestors, but I didn't like that prime was out of the picture for a long time. The fight at the end was not great. For the length of the movie, we got to see just a little of the transformers. They should have called this movie; The Sam Whitwicky chronicles.",7,1,3,6 July 2009

","I liked the Rocky movies when I was a little kid. And I always thought there wouldn't come a movie like that anymore. I was wrong. Next to Rocky 6 this wrestling movie was outstanding! Mickey Rourke acts phenomenal. We all know wrestling is fake, but it looked pretty real in this movie. Wrestling is not harmful for those big guys, but it is when one of those big guys gets old. Mickey was cute in this character with his hearing device, his heavy breathing. It took a great deal of acting getting the viewer there where he wanted to get us; to get sympathy with a old man who neglected his daughter.In this movie Mickey and Pam are too old for their business. Pam has a family, her son. Mickey has no-one. His daughter hates him and Pam cannot have a relationship with her customer. The ending was excellent, where the crowd becomes his family. Great movie, great acting. Wonderful!",8,0,0,30 October 2009
Inception," Very clever movie.
","I had to see Nolan's movie in the cinema, so I did yesterday, like I saw The Prestige and the batman movies also in the cinema. Movies that are worth watching over and over, but the first time you have to see it on big screen.I cannot leave some spoilers behind, so if you haven't seen this movie, don't reed further! Inception is about entering some person's mind while this person is asleep. Nolan goes a bit further than this. People in this movie enters a dream in a dream and much further to get information they need. That's it! Now that sounds a bit like The Matrix, but it isn't. Inception is nothing like The Prestige. The Prestige was from the beginning to the end very exciting and far more clever than Inception. But Inception on the other hand has more action than the Prestige has to offer.The first half of the movie DiCaprio selects a team to enter Robert Fischer's (played by the handsome Cillian Murphy) mind. Here Nolan explains what the Inception is, but he tells as much as he wants you to know. And, like in the Prestige, you find out that you see a lot, but don't know a thing. That's why this is a movie you have to watch a second time.The ending was like Total Recall. Are you still in a dream? Or are you awake? When the movie was finished, I heard some people say that it was a very difficult movie to make, to go through three dreams of a person. I thought at the end we were in the fifth dream. Was that the deal Cobb made with Saito? I'll explain why I think it was the fifth dream: Cobb did not great his partners when he was at the airport. His kids were not at grandmother's house, but at his own house. The first he saw his kids, it was just like in his dreams.So I like it that Leonardo chooses to get those dark roles to play. I liked Inception more than Shutter Island. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was quite a surprise. I didn't think much of this guy as an actor. When I was little I saw him play in The Juror (1996). I didn't whether he was a boy or a girl. This young actor did his job very well in Inception. I'm glad he got (and took) the chance to be in this movie. He was the cherry on the pie. He controls his acting. Marion Cotillard scared the hell out of me. I didn't like this character. There was something wrong with her, and at the end, there was really something wrong with her.It was a pity that Michael Caine had a small part to play, but seeing The prestige and the batman movies it was fun to see him anyway in this movie.I'm sure I have to see this movie a few more times. It will keep me busy while waiting for Nolan's next movie. But if Nolan will keep it up like this, the list of the top 250 movies all time on IMDb will be filled with his movies. If I'm not mistaken, he has 5 movies now in that list. There is no one who can say the same.",10,1,3,25 July 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Quite boring.
","I like detective series of detective movies. It's like Columbo; you already know who is the villain, but it's the question how to trap this villain.So Sherlock Holmes starts good. You get to see the warner brothers logo in the street. That was beautiful done, this is immediately how the rest of the movie is; beautiful. When it comes to Holmes, Watson and Blackwood, I got the idea I was looking to Scooby Doo without an animated dog. Although the movie and special effects were beautiful, the movie itself was boring.Then there is a female thief who had a relationship with Holmes. There are some scenes where she comes in situations where Holmes have to safe her. Well, I didn't care if she would die or not. Holmes is the main character. This woman cheats on him, so why would Holmes care for her life? Strange man.The way Holmes calculates what he does, like fighting, was well brought into picture. It gets you to see how he thinks.Jude Law gave a great performance. I was at the edge of my seat when he was blown away. Every time I saw Downey I was waiting for him to put on his Ironman suit.So now Richi is thinking about making a sequel. Ah well, Scooby Doo got a sequel too.",5,1,2,26 May 2010
The Blind Side," Always about white helping black.
","I never liked movies with Sandra Bullock. I just don't like this actress. In this movie though, she is watchable. This movie is about a white Christian family who takes care of a black boy and give him everything his own parents never could give him, because he comes from a poor family. He gets a car, wrecks it and the white people don't care. He gets his own room, gets private schooling, his little brother and very, very beautiful sister take him as their brother.Now I have seen Untouchables and now I have seen this movie, they both are lovely movies. But to me they are not very realistic. Maybe they happened in real life, I don't know, but as a colored boy I grew up in a white neighborhood and the one thing I learned is that white people, they just don't care about colored people. So maybe I just grew up in the wrong areas of the world, but movies like Untouchables and The blind side are just like Disney movies to me; What you are watching is just good entertainment, but it ain't real.Good acting though, good story. Very little emotions, drama. All the drama comes out of the story and not from the acting. That's a pity.",7,1,2,5 October 2012
Prometheus," What was this really about?
","I guess I am going to be one of the less people who is not really content about this movie. Before I went to this movie, I heard it was a little about the Alien movies back in my younger years with the beautiful Sigourney Weaver, but then again it wasn't. So, I did not know what to expect.When the movie started, I learned it was all about a group of people who went from earth to an alien planet to find out who could be the creator of mankind. They went to look for a possible God. That was a fine concept for me. After seeing a lot of things going on, like an octopus with four legs coming out of a woman's stomach, or this big guy killing everyone, I was asking myself what this movie really was about. If this movie wasn't about the prequel of the alien movies, what was it then about? It certainly wasn't about finding God or the beginning of mankind. I mean, at then end the search continues.And there my biggest problem remains. They have seen this big guy. He wasn't kind or gentle. So why does this woman who gave birth to this quatropus want to search further? To meet more of these hostile creatures? This is the most unsatisfying movie I have seen in a while. A lot of money has been spend on making this movie. Cameron's Avatar and Christopher Nolan's movies are well made. Not because they only have a concept, but because they give the audience a whole package. Their movies have a beginning, a middle and an end. Prometheus has a beginning and a middle. Where the middle is, half away the movie, there is where it ends. It leaves you with the question where the movie begins with: who created mankind in the vision of Ridley Scott? Was it the big people who (I guess) created the aliens? But I think that was not relevant, because if it was, the movie did not stop half way the search.And there is where the problem starts: If there would come a sequel to this movie, where would it go from here? Would the first alien movie be the sequel or the search for the creators of mankind? This movie did not get me warm to have this urge to see more of this expensive crap movie with a beginning and a middle. The only thing I liked about this movie is that Charlize Theron was driven over by a dough-nut shaped alien aircraft.",3,23,43,3 June 2012
X-Men: First Class," Great action movie.
","I liked the x-men movies and I still do. What I didn't liked was that James McAvoi was in this new movie. I didn't like him a an actor, but he changed my mind with participating in this movie. McAvoi Has learned to act in a mature way, he did it very good. Many actors can learn from him, and I never thought I would say that.Overall acting was good, great action. I liked Kevin Bacon, I always have liked him as an actor. What was I surprised to see him. And also Michael Ironside who gained a lot of weight over the years. I'll never forget his role in Total Recall. It was a pity he got a small part in this movie, but still was great to see him acting.Special effects were great. It is very tricky to make a prequel, especially when it has a trilogy behind of it. After seeing a new movie, it is always easy to say that this is the best x-men movie ever. That this movie is better that the previous three. But still, without the previous movies, this movie would never been made.Background music was awesome, it sounded a bit like the music from Inception. It suited great with the movie.(Oh yes, I forgot mentioning Hugh Jackman).",8,1,2,1 October 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Will this be the last one? Really?
","I am a huge fan of the batman movies. I also was when I saw Burton's version and when was announced that Nolan would bring his own version, I had serious doubts. I am glad I have seen the trilogy of Nolan. It is almost worth living for. Before I am going to comment this movie, I must say something about the rating on IMDb on this movie. It is very wrong to rate this movie below 5 because you are or not a batman fan (just don't watch this movie) or to rate it very low because you think it is not worth to be number one movie made ever. The first batman movies of Nolan were terrific and a lot of people rated them 1 also because they did not want this movie on number one in the top 250. I don't think that is the way to rate a movie, that is definitely worth above the five. Nolan's work deserves more to be treated like this.Now about the movie. I must say we don't see much action in Wayne. The fast man (playboy) he was in the first two movies is gone. Christian gives us a broken man and shows us what a great actor he is. Even Michael Caine, we don't see him much in the movie and that's a pity, but what an actor! Nolan knows how to pick out the cast. Joseph was great, his alter ego was hidden very well! He made the ending open, I wonder why. If this would be the last Batman movie, why would the ending be left open? Hardy is a fine actor, but we did not get to see a lot of him because of his mask. I did not recognize his face or his voice. His role could have been played by Billy Zane and you would not see the difference.The movie was three hours long and the hours were flying by! It did not feel like three hours. These Batman movies are very addictive. When one is made, you still want more. Nolan gave this third (I won't say last because I don't want to believe that) a great script. The movie grabbed back at the first movie and misguided the viewer often and very well. Due to the shooting at the premiere in America I had the shivers seeing Bane shooting for nothing at people. I got this weird feeling seeing this movie in the cinema, because also in The Netherlands we have crazy people with guns shooting for nothing at the shopping malls. I was shocked when the bomb exploded at the end, I did not believe what I saw. But the way the hero revived was a little bit under timed, also with the background music. Dutch subtitles were very, very wrong. I'm glad I have learned to understand English a bit.For my last words; great movie. Three hours are like one and a half. Nolan showed us with all three his Batman movies that each one of them are aces. Don't let this be the last Batman movie. I hope not that there will come an other director and wants to blow the Batman movies a new life like The amazing spider-man. Burton and Schumacher showed us that changing Bruce Wayne from Keaton to Kilmer and Clooney did not do any good. Even changing Homes into Gyllenhaal was a wrong move, to be precise, adding Holmes to the first movie was not very great to begin with. If Nolan wanted to do it right he should have taken Gyllenhaal for the first movie as well. Make a next movie with Bale, but don't go on a fourth movie with Gordon-Levitt alone. That would be a mistake like Berry's cat woman.",10,5,11,22 July 2012
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Good movie, worth watching.
","Just when the movie came out, it got a high score on IMDb. It began with a 9,5 and quickly sunk to 7,5 which is more suitable to this movie. Maybe people who worked on this movie rated it a 10 and people who hate the director or the cast members slowly rated it 1. So the discussion started whether IMDb rating is credible or not. Well it is, after a few weeks. Like people who worked on this movie, everyone is free to vote as they please. Why do people vote it as 1? If you just don't like superhero movies, or the director, or the cast, there is Always a choice not to watch the movie at all.So some negative points I have about the movie: * Movie was way too long. Three hours! What were they thinking? Give the audience something worth for their money? Well, the movie was not that great. * There were some flaws. Maybe we should forget that part. It's a fictional movie to start with. * Nolan's / Bale's Batman got killed. And that's a waste. * Music was weird at time to time. Not suitable. * The movie did not have a real story. I got the feeling they just made this movie, to make a movie. * Weird ending. * Why that monster?Some positive points: * Despite of what people say; good cast. * Awesome action sequences. * Exciting.Isn't it because these few positive points why we watch this kind of movies? Well, at least I do.",7,3,6,28 March 2016
Looper," Not very good.
","I love time travel movies. So I had to watch this one. I did not like looper very much. There is little action. Acting was good. Joseph did his best to look like Bruce Willis and that worked out very well. But because Joseph had a bigger part than Willis, I asked myself why this was not worked out the other way around.The movie is about Loopers who kill people who are sent to them from the future. Spoiler: they even have to kill their own selves, but the thirty years older version of themselves. And there's where they lost me. Why do they let a looper kill his thirty years older version? That's very stupid. That's asking for trouble. The best way to deal with this, is to let an other looper kill an other looper.The whole deal about this looper thing is because in the future they don't kill people. So they send people to the past and let the killing be done by these loopers. So why did they kill this Asian girlfriend of Willis? Why didn't they kill Willis as well? This movie has flaws. When you are thinking this movie is about the loopers, we get introduced to this rainmaker and his younger version. What happens to this boy in the future, remains a riddle at the end. The ending is very disappointing. It ends in an anticlimax. There is this silence and the screen gets black. Although it is original, it is not an ending of an action movie. People left the cinema in a sort of distress. Asking themselves, was this really the promising movie that turned out to be disappointing?",5,2,4,2 December 2012
50_50," Heavy movie with humor.
","I've seen a few movies about people who have cancer and they die. But this movie is more different then the others. First of all, a young man gets cancer a the age of 27. He has a good friend who makes jokes all the time and learns how to use the illness of his friend in, for him, a positive way.The movie is filled with great actors and actresses. It shows in a great way what happens when someone gets cancer, and adds up a little bit more spice to it.This friend, played by Seth, made the movie watchable because he gave humor to this heavy story. What I missed was the change of Seth during the movie. I asked myself why Seth didn't grow up because of his friend. I really hoped to see Seth play in a serious role as a worried friend, instead of being the clown all the time. It didn't happen. And maybe it was the best after all. The seriousness blinked out in the book he read about people having cancer, and he is just a person. Not everyone get changed during life. So I found my peace in this Seth character. The movie isn't meant to be heavy although the topic is.",7,1,2,10 June 2012
Cloud Atlas," Three hours of beautiful crap.
","I have seen the preview of this movie and was disappointed that Halle Berry was in this movie. She is a very boring actress who always plays a confident woman and in this movie she was not different than that. But Tom Hanks and Hugo Weaving made me watch this movie in the cinema. I did not know it would be a three hours hell.The movie is very beautiful made. What more can you expect from the Wachowski brothers (or brother / sister, I got lost there). The movie switches from the one parallel universe tot the other. In the preview the only thing the actors and actresses said was that the story is very complex and everything will come together at the end. Like boring the preview was, so was the movie. We got to see three hours of scenes going from story to story and back. Only to tell a simple story what the whole movie was really about. Yes, you get to know what the movie is about at the end, but it is very disappointing.Acting was bad. Make-up was awesome. The actors and actresses were pimped up very beautiful. Sometimes the actors and actresses had to speak words of the English language in a different way like we are used to. I could see they had a bit of trouble there and that really stole the magic of the movie.Some people left the cinema before the movie was over. Most people, like me, stayed. Maybe because we hoped the movie would get better, or the urge to know what this movie was about, or maybe not letting our money we paid for the movie wash down the drain.One big advice: don't watch it in the cinema. It's a waste of your money. It's nothing like the matrix, what in my opinion was a great action movie.",1,269,482,2 December 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," Horror?
","This movie is about a group of teenagers going to a cabin for the weekend. The cabin is in hands of a company engineers who creatively want to kill these teenagers. They keep an eye on them with cameras.Now I like horror movies, this was not a horror movie. It was more a comedy than a horror. Yes, there were zombies, big snakes and even a Pinhead like character in it, but they did not really scare much. I more liked the two engineers dancing in the beginning of the movie. That was funny.The special effects were awesome. The story was not what I expected and that's a plus. I really got surprised all the time. The movie goes to places where you don't expect it to go. That makes the movie not predictable. It's like the movie makers deliberately wanted to make the movie unpredictable. Like they have studied what is predictable and what isn't so they could write a script around it with a so called horror genre beneath it.Acting was OK, not really that great. This blonde girl acted from the beginning very confusing; saying this and meaning that thinking it is funny. No, it is confusing. Then seeing Thor driving with a motorcycle against a wall, was killing. Movie was entertaining.",7,1,5,19 August 2012
Hacksaw Ridge," Vey intense movie,
","I am glad Gibson traded his career as an actor to direct movies. Despite of the negative sounds he got when he made Apocalypto and The passion of the Christ, he did not let them beat him down. And I am glad for that.Hacksaw Ridge has a magnificent cast. The first half of the movie has a romantic taste. It did not feel like a Gibson made movie. Vince Vaughn was hilarious. The first half was the building up towards a second half that turned out to be quite a spectacle. It felt like I was in that war. Very great shot, beautiful soundtrack, well done acting.Maybe some will say this movie is nothing compared to Braveheart, The last samurai or even Platoon. I think that is correct. This one is a different war.",9,2,7,27 November 2016
Law Abiding Citizen," Very genius story with a lame ending.
","I was very amused while watching this movie. I would have rated this movie an eight and would have bought it on DVD, if it wasn't for the ending that did not make any sense!Here it comes, and so also the spoiler: Clyde Shelton is in prison, and Rice finds out it is Clyde who is behind the murders. So Rice goes to the workplace of Clyde, next to the prison, while Clyde is heading for the Town Hall. Clyde is putting a bomb in the Town Hall, while Rice is watching the place where Clyde has put all his equipment and his cars. Rice watches the whole cave, and also how Clyde gets out of the isolation cell. The in a split second Rice gets to the town hall, while Clyde is getting back to the prison. Rice gets the bomb and in a split second he is back to the prison before Clyde gets there! How can that be???Clyde arrives and he has no clue that someone has been there, even when the lock is forced. A genius man would notice that. Or that someone would have been there, when he has taken off the sheet of the car.So this so-called brilliant action of Rice putting the bomb under the bed of Clyde is very stupid, unless Rice is a sort of Superman.Very pity.",7,0,0,1 November 2010
Furious 7," This movie is sick.
","I watched all Fast and the Furious movies and to be honest, I have not been a Paul Walker fan. I'm still not. It's a pity when someone has to die that young of age, but in my opinion he was a terrible actor, I'm sorry.The seventh movie though was a big rush! It did not bore me a second. The action sequences were just amazing. I did not want to blink my eyes, hell even the dutch subs were partially blocking my view. The movie was not very realistic, but that's not what we are watching this movie for. It was original.When I heard Walker died I hoped this would be the last movie of the Fast and Furious movies. Now I watched the seventh movie, I'm looking forward to the next. About the question if this movie should win an Oscar? If it would be up to me, fortunately it isn't, no. I love action movies, but the point of movies like this is that when it comes to the story, it's pretty much the same as we have seen before. Keep up the good work.",8,0,3,19 April 2015
