The Ring," A better-than-expected adaptation
","I'll leave the symbolic analyses of this film to more lettered critics of cinema, and get to the meat of the matter: this film, for all its' Hollywoodized flaws is still miles ahead of anything else in the pack so far this year. Director Verbinski had the wit to adapt as much as he could from the original Japanese version, 'Ringu', thereby letting the sheer momentum of the story's corner-of-your-eye horrors herd the viewer into an inescapable nightmare. It accomplishes the neat trick of (mostly) sidestepping all of our 'here-it-comes' expectations and coming out of left field to deliver something even more horrible. It reminded me of Stephen King's comment twenty years ago, when he said that he thinks books are better at conveying horror than movies because with books you can get the audience alone, one at a time. 'The Ring' came closer for me than most other American films(exceptions being the 1963 version of 'The Haunting' and 'Wait Until Dark') at doing just that. When I saw it recently in a packed theater, the audience laughed nervously every time the expected scare made them jump; about two-thirds of the way in, nobody was laughing, and we were all pulling for Naomi Watts' heroine to solve this horrifying riddle of the fatal video tape and save herself and her loved ones. It really conjured up a modern-day horror to address modern alienation, and its attendant ills. By the way, in addressing another reviewer's canard on this site: yes, Verbinski's insistance on using overly loud 'whooomph!' sound effects was fairly annoying, but that failed to kill the mood this film conjured up for me and millions of others. If you want a REALLY annoying example of intrusive music and 'BOOGA-BOOGA!' foley effects, catch 'Ghost Story'. I saw that turkey when it came out in '81, and it was all I could do not to throw my large-size Coke Classic at the screen. A small editorial note: any and all critics who didn't find this film even a little spooky obviously suffer the 'auteur disease': if it's made in America,it's automatically crap; if it's made in France, they'll kiss it's ass no matter how bad it is.

Saw," A pleasant surprise for strong stomachs!
","Decided to catch 'Saw' last Thanksgiving weekend. Paid for my ticket, got some popcorn, sat down and...oh...oh, my...OH-MY-GOD...BWAAHAHAHA-cough,cough,hack,snort(wheeeze)-THIS MOVIE TOTALLY %##&*%@% ROCKS! A truly demented, pleasing surprise for people(like me)who've practically despaired of seeing anything original on the big screen before it's sent off to the video purgatory!You think you've seen it all? This is Dario Argento multiplied! This is like the original version of 'The Vanishing'--no reassurance of a happy ending here, kids! The creators managed in eighteen days--ah, let me repeat that--EIGHTEEN %##&*%@% DAYS--to film what Mainstream Hollywood doesn't have the stones to make on its' own(Want to bet they're already making carbon copies of the 'Jigsaw Killer' for their own pallid big money projects?). Everybody involved acquits themselves quite nicely in the terrifying, gory proceedings. Even Elwes' uneven accent somehow adds to the verisimilitude, especially when you realize that he's under pressure to HACK OFF HIS OWN FOOT OR ELSE. I'd have an uneven accent, too, under those conditions! Check it out--you won't regret it!",Null,16,32,6 March 2005
