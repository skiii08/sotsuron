The Avengers," Fantastic! Now I can't wait to see the sequel to the AVENGERS
","Joss Whedon was a great choice for a director, and he always does a good job at finding the right guy to play the villain, Loki. Great collaboration from the actors with fairly equal spotlight given to the characters. By far the best Hulk ever! I've never been a fan of the Hulk until I saw this movie. The only thing I thought was a tad bit cheesy were the space aliens at the end. Some movies have computer generated characters without it looking computer generated, but these definitely looked like they belonged in an xbox360 video game. I'm looking forward to seeing the sequel to this movie. I liked the other characters who were included in this movie as well, even though marvel didn't make any previous movies to introduce them. I have big hopes for the new upcoming Spiderman movies as well, it looks like it will top all its predecessors! Good job Stan Lee and Marvel Studios you give something worthy for DC to compete with.",9,4,10,26 May 2012
Men in Black 3," Men in Black III (an excellent ending to the series) short review
","MIB3 has a very strong storyline. I would give this movie a 7.5 or 8, out of 10. I loved the ending, and my dad thought it was the best of the Men in Black movies. Josh Brolin does an outstanding job portraying Tommy Lee Jones's character K. Just a warning, there are a few scenes which are inappropriate for young children. All in all, an excellent ending to the series. Would definitely recommend and it's worth a repeat watch!",8,2,6,26 May 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Better than the Avengers (in my opinion)! Exceeded my expectations!
","Honestly, spiderman is not one of my favorite superheroes, but after seeing this movie, I really hope they make a sequel soon. From the previews, I felt like this spiderman movie would be the best yet, and it certainly was! It exceeded my expectations! The casting was spot on. The casting choices for female roles in these superhero movies have been very disappointing to me, but I felt like Emma Stone was a great choice --- a breath of fresh air. Andrew Garfield really made Peter Parker shine! I've never heard of this guy until I saw this movie. He was a brilliant choice. I felt like I could really connect with the character and Andrew gave the character a lot of depth. This movie is worth watching many times over, and I'm definitely putting it on my list of favorite superhero movies. I only hope the new Batman movie can live up to this movie, and I've been a Batman fan since I was probably 6 or 7 years old. The Amazing Spiderman tops all of the movies made with Tobey Maguire. Sorry Tobey! Marvel's making better choices in my opinion. The Hulk in the Avengers was the best so far, and Andrew Garfield in the Amazing Spiderman, is the best spiderman. I recommend this movie for the whole family.",10,6,13,3 July 2012
