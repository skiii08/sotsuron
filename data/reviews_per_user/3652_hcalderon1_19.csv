The Benchwarmers," Bad News Bears was funnier
","It wasn't that bad, I'll give the film makers effort for trying, the three main characters were pretty funny, but as the film went on it became one bad joke, silly gags that wasn't making me laugh. As this movie went on it made me put my hand over my face and wait for the movie to be over. This movie starts out with three friends named Gus, Clark, and Richie, three guys pretty much get no respect from anybody. But one day they end up helping a kid who was being bullied, by playing them at a game of baseball. By miracle they beat those jerks, but it soon doesn't end there as they become a target from a bunch of big shots who really want to beat them. If you want a baseball comedy buy the Bad News Bears instead.",5,0,0,21 May 2006
