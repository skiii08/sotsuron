Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," He did it again!
","Let me say at once: I expected it to be mediocre. There was too much hype, and the movie would have to face the comparison with the original trilogy. That made the pleasant surprise even better!It's a very good movie. It is absolutely on the quality level of the original. I would place it somewhere at the level of 'Empire strikes back' - definitely better than ROTJ, but probably less inspired than the first 'Star Wars'. The effects. of course, are out of this world - I'm not going to go into that, because trying to describe them is like trying to describe sex. Let me just say that everything else looks like 'South Park' in comparison.Star Wars has never been about artsy acting, and this movie is no exception. The story also had to be fairly straightforward, for the kids to be able to understand it. So don't expect Oscar performances by actors, or deep allusions in the script.What you can expect is an awesome fun movie. I'll probably go see it the second time, and I haven't done this since middle school.",7,0,0,21 May 1999
