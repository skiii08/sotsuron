Mission: Impossible III," You'll Get What You Want from Mission: Impossible
","I just saw this movie and I thought it was great. You'll get exactly what you think of when you think of Mission: Impossible, action! A lot of action from start to finish. They were also able to get a love sub-story in there without slowing the movie. The first two M:Is seemed to have a different feeling then this one. Would may or may not fit your style better. There was quite a bit of talking and sitting around in the first two, M:I 1 for sure. In M:I III, the action is nearly non-stop. But yet, not over done. If you wanna see shooting, things blowing up, etc. this movie is for you. Even if you're not 100% into that, I think you'll still enjoy this movie.",9,0,1,6 May 2006
