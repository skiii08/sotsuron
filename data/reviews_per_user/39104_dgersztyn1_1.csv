The Ring," A CINEMATIC NIGHTMARE
","I am 45 years old and considered an extremely knowledgeable film buff. I am NOT a teenager.Only 'The Exorcist', upon its original release, had this terrifying effect on me. This film sticks with you--it's extremely difficult to shake off. Sure, it contains a number of schlocky tactics, but they are effective. You could shoot arrows through some of the plot holes, but this is a supernatural tale, and not responsible for totally explaining itself.
The haunting images and creepy atmosphere suggest a nightmare gone several steps too far. The makers of this film have tapped into exactly what scares an audience. There are several scenes that linger long after viewing this movie. I have seen it twice at the cinema and rented it today, on the debut of its home video release. It still creeped me out to no end!I admit that I have not yet seen 'Ringu', but I plan to remedy that situation tomorrow.Now, can someone go down to the basement and get my laundry.....???!!!",Null,1,1,4 March 2003
