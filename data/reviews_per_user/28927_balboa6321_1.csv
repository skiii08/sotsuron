Sucker Punch," Heroine uses imagination to escape ghastly realities.
","If you're seeking a realistic story, this is not it. As an imaginative, Gothic (while futuristic), cinematic experience - this film takes you there. Comic book novel-like story and pacing - without being overly campy or silly. Action scenes are extremely well choreographed and visually breathtaking, battle sets are haunting and alone worth seeing. The acting is appropriate for the film, and the villains and adversaries are truly frightening. Best seen in IMAX. Destined as a sleeper cult classic because of it's style and marketing, nonetheless - a very worthwhile see for those who have a wide range of tastes in film.",8,2,8,5 April 2011
