The Hangover," What is there to grade 7.something?
","Not funny at all, just not funny, not a bit. I remember I smiled a few times but no recollection of a laugh (I saw the 10 minute longer unrated version). I was hoping for some laughs and fun but instead I got so bored, damn I have this habit to see to the end! It was unnecessary to shoot for the cinema, is waste of time for the audience. I don't understand what some people find funny about this movie but if you are not a person that laughs at everything, if you are selective about comedy, you will not want to see this movie again. Even laughers-at-fart and laughers-at-curse won't like it. And a part 2 is coming?! God forbid!",3,4,9,3 April 2011
Inception," Really awful!
","It is so unnecessary and fairly persuasive; unsuccessfully, insistingly imposing the audience there is a great mystery going on but weak fiction just causes a perception of a confusing and boring movie in you. Full of very irritating logical errors, incoherence and lack of intelligence. Categorically, this kind of movies are not science fiction, they are action movies because there is no science going on in them. By the way, there's no mystery about dreaming, your brain is just rearranging the randomly recorded data during the day; defragmenting them according to their relations and deleting the unnecessary ones.",1,12,23,12 March 2011
