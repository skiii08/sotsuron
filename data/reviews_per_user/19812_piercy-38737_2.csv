First Man," Loved it
",Everyone has their opinion but I think those that rate this movie with one star are insane. I knew the outcome of the mission but was still on the edge of my seat. The family scenes were great as well. It's a fantastic movie with excitement and gut wrenching emotion that everyone should go see.,9,0,1,18 October 2018
