Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Episode 1: The Phantom Menace  Review: 11th June 2003
","Its 1983 and one of the most visually appealing Star Wars movies ever, has been released. The film is Return of the Jedi. We have some of the best set pieces ever committed to celluloid and we see the culmination of characters we have cared about since 1977. We finally see Anakin Skywalker return to the good side and the galactic war is at an endmany years pass then its announced that George Lucas, will create a whole new trilogy, chronicling the life of Anakin Skywalker and explain just why he turned to the 'dark side'. The release of the star wars trilogy: special edition only increases the expectation for Episode 1: The Phantom Menace and so it begins. The year is 1999 and the movie begins Does it start off with General Kenobi and Anakin facing off in the Clone Wars? Does George Lucas enthuse it with hard core mythologizing from the start? Do we find out how good Anakin was as a pilot from the very first frame? NopeGeorge Lucas goes back to basics. Return of the Jedi was the last film where we had an intergalactic war, but this film is essentially about a small planet being attacked by a Greedy trade federation. Doesn't sound too star warsy does it? Well not on the surface. To fully appreciate this movie you have to accept its not going to the rip roaring roller coaster ride that the originals were. By their very nature they were extremely exciting adventures with characters on the run . In this film, we have a peaceful galaxy as opposed to galaxy engulfed in a intergalactic war spanning hundreds of planets, instead its one planet. That of Naboo, which has came under attack from a Trade Federation.So why start with this planet? Well, Senator Palpatine is the senator from there and as we know, Palpatine, just like Lucas for introducing the films at this unexpected episode is genius for planning ahead. Upon its release, many movie goers attacked Jar Jar what with his bumbling nature he was hardly your typical star wars character and unlike the previous movies, he even had the audacity in acting the fool in the final space battle. But people who let themselves get distracted by this, mis-interpret it and thus, take an instant disliking to the film. But concentrate on what many perceive it to be its flaws and you see that it's the films and overall, the trilogies greatest strength. It shows how even the smallers things can have a bearing on the bigger picture, from a small time senator of Naboo promoted to the ruler of the galaxy and how the Jedi Knights trigger a count down to their own destruction, by taking a young boy away from his mother. George Lucas should be given credit for trying to do things differently and not hanging off the coat tails of his original films. Had we seen a Han Solo character in this movie like many wanted then it would have cheapened the real Han Solo. Likewise, many other circumstances which fans wanted in the movie. Sure, the characters dialogue is more stilted, but this is the Victorian area of the star wars universe (you will notice the dialogue loosens up somewhat in Episode 2). So basically, the galaxy is peaceful but there's a few things rumbling and its these smaller things which will shape every film following it. A great epilogue for the star wars movies and a movie which compliments the other films, as opposed to blatantly copying their style and therefore, robbing them of their originality. 3 Stars out of Five.",Null,0,1,16 May 2004
X-Men," X-Men 1  Review: 11th June 2003
","Having never seen a comic book adaptation at the cinema, I settled into my seat and expected a few hours of pretty soul less antics. Many had tried to put one over the greatest comic book movie of all time, Superman The Movie, but where that film had heart, verisimilitude and great effects. Most of the others only seemed to succeed at the 'great effects' part. How this presumption was shattered. Right from the get go it calmly faded in to a World War 2 camp and we see Eric (Magneto) as a child, using his powers. The look of horror on the faces of the army men is subtle, yet brilliant. Then we go to the present day and the film just gets better and better. With Wolverine, we have one of the best movie characters of all time. Hugh Jackman is absolutely superb. Anna Paquin is wonderful too, playing a teenager who's tormented by her changing bodily functionssomething everyone can relate to when growing up. Overall, this movie simply kicks ass. I came out of the cinema and it was the first time I had ever left the auditorium and wanted to walk straight back in for the next showing. It was that good! Since the release, many have complained that the action scenes don't really deliverbut the beauty of this film is that first and foremost, it makes you care for the characters. When these are put in the tiniest bit of peril, you want them to succeed. So although the set pieces may not be as hard core as some people had liked. It didn't really need them to be and when you take into consideration that the budget wasn't exactly large, it shows that the director had his priorities right. 5 Stars out of Five!",Null,0,0,16 May 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Episode II  Attack of the Clones - Exhilarating!
","After what many perceived to be a weak entry in the prequel trilogy of the star wars movies with regards to TPM. Lucas still 'did his own thing' and produced one of the most breathtaking, exhilarating and fantastic star wars films to date. In this film we have already established characters thrust upon the cinema screen once again. The opening scroll is simpler than in TPM, it doesn't require us to think, it just puts us into the right frame of mind to pick up the story. As soon as we see a ship gliding through the foggy clouds we see straight away that something is amiss in the republic. The bright and breezy republic in the previous film seems to be bathed in fog. Difficult to see the dark side is. Lucas said these are silent movies and the visuals tell their own story and it happens a lot in this film, like the Darth Vader silhouette that had no digital tinkering whatsoever . The footage of Anakin with his robes on was basically a mirror image of darth vader but without the helmet. The footage of Padme next to him was strikingly reminiscent of Emperor Palpatine in Return of the Jedi. Absolutely everything in this movie is intriguing, Obi-Wan Kenobi investigates a clone facility on the planet of Kamino. A mysterious Sifo Dyas placed an order for the Clone army based on a template of a Bounty Hunter called Jango Fett. Jango Fett states he was employed by a man called Darth Tryannus. We find a former Jedi, Count Dooku knows all about the corruption in the senate, even if the Jedi arnt yet aware and plans to do something about it. Secretly creating a new order with the goal to build an army powerful enough to fight the Republics army. A republic army which was mysteriously started at the Clone facility even though the Jedi Council were not aware! Confused? Nointrigued? Most definitely. Anakin Skywalker also gets given a sole mission on his own. Its here that the much vaunted love story begins. To be honest, it's a bit choppy and seems rushed. Its not a smooth romance like in The Empire Strikes Back, instead it's a romance which reeks of desperation, as if the characters themselves know about their impending doom and they just want to be as one before the inevitable happens. The deleted scenes on the DVD really should have been implemented within the film. They are gold, with regards to character motivations and shows little glimpses of their affection to each other. Would have made the final, declaration of love scene less jarring. In fact, would have been completely smooth and believable. The final showpiece in this film is the Clone Wars, they begin on a planet called Geonosis and this is where the film gives us a scene so wonderful it just keeps on piling the cherry's on top of the cake. A superb full scale war better than anything in any star wars movie happens, its absolute mayhem and its absolutely brilliant. But it doesent end there, we have not one lightsaber fight, not two, but three. With the third being one of the most memorable of all time. Also, a plot point that culminated in A New Hope makes its entrance here and it left me absolutely gob smacked Basically, this film is everything you would want in a star wars movie. Is it the best star wars film out there? Quite possible, difficult to call. Had George Lucas just gone with the flow and put in the Padme/Anakin deleted scenes plus toned down the over bearing nature of Anakin in the fireplace scene (after reading an earlier draft there's some vocal foreplay at the beginning that would have been great to have in the final movie) then this would have been the best Star Wars film without a doubt. We see intrigue, we see action and we see the galaxy begin to rot away in a very obvious way. The beginning of the end.Four Stars out of Five.",Null,43,81,16 May 2004
