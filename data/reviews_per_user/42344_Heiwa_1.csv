Requiem for a Dream," Perhaps the best anti-drug movie ever made?
","Beautiful acting, a fast-moving plot and characters drawn so well you can't help but empathize with them make this movie the masterpiece it is.In a nutshell, it is a view of how drugs can bring down four otherwise normal & good people.  On a larger scale, it is a heartbreaking and visceral downward spiral as the dreams of the four major characters are shattered and die, leaving only their requiem to be sung.Brilliant movie, fabulous score.  A must-see.",10,0,0,25 December 2000
