The Blair Witch Project," Outstanding indie, but doesn't live up to the hype...
","This is a very good indie feature. It accomplishes what Hollywood is having a hard time doing (producing a genuinely creepy movie), and because it's making tens of millions, it will be analyzed to death, and elements from it will be recycled for years to come.Basically, the movie uses numerous means to manipulate the audience into feeling major anxiety - not the least of which is the jerky handi-cam shooting which can cause mild motion sickness. Once we're physically distressed, it's easier to work on our minds with the creepy bump-in-the-night psych. Very cool.Now, it's fine for an indie to be a one-trick pony, but this is not what I expect for seven bucks, so I hope the majors are taking notes (Spoilers ahead):More character development. Dump the stereotypical teenage arguing, high pitched whining and constant swearing - please! I'm not offended by language, but it gets old.Giving the audience credit for imagination is the best way to get scares, but hey, throw us a visual bone... a blur, a shadow, a distortion, a bush rustling, SOMETHING.The end was shocking in its abruptness, but I wouldn't have changed that. I do agree with a previous poster that there should have been wrapup... 'stock' news footage of the house, and reporters interviewing people after the cameras and films were found (like in the newer TV trailers). The ending credits hit most of us in the face like a bucket of cold water, and there were groans all around in a theatre filled with teens and twenty-somethings.",6,0,0,5 August 1999
Lost in Translation," So what...?
","I like 'slice of life' movies ... but this was just boring and pointless. I don't understand what all the fuss is about. Murray was at his best in 'What about Bob?' and here he's just a boring, washed-up actor who meets some boring, rock photographer's wife. They stumble around Tokyo and never really get to know one another... yawn.Am I supposed to be impressed that a great comedic actor can play a boring real guy that's bored... So what?! Life is boring, that's why we go to the movies - to escape from boring experiences like this. Anyone could have played this role by just playing himself. Maybe I just didn't get it.",5,7,14,11 September 2004
Watchmen," Dark, sweet treat...
","Why does the one well-written, but extremely negative review of a great movie always get picked for the main page? Trolling...?I did not read the graphic novel, so I could hardly be called a fan-boy... but I still loved this movie. You will too, provided you are up for deeply flawed, comic book superheroes running around in an alternate reality circa 1980's U.S.Beware, the film richly deserves it's R rating for brutal violence, fairly graphic sex scenes, and some full frontal nudity. This film is no place for children (or squeamish adults)... but if you've seen (and still enjoyed) movies like 'Kill Bill' or 'Sin City', you won't be too shocked.There's a rich, gritty back story to each of these characters, told in flashback. Despite what some have said, I did not find this confusing at all. This is a sweeping tale which required masterful storytelling which was done seamlessly. I loved the nostalgic pastels and fashions of bygone eras in the retro scenes.If you're still intent on seeing this movie, do NOT wait for the DVD. This is a sweeping tale that makes for a jaw-dropping film and it really must be experienced on the big screen.",9,3,6,16 March 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," An instant classic... but what happened in Lothlorien?
","Great screenplay, acting, location, scenery, costumes, props, action, effects... What can I say... 9/10. Excellent!This is simply the best adaptation of epic novel to movie I've ever seen. Those who haven't read the books or seen the movie, stop here... possible SPOILERS AHEAD.For you Tolkien nuts out there... My only real criticism was the enchanted wood. In the movie, the two chapters in Moria are given excellent treatment, while the three chapters in Lothlorien are butchered unmercifully. Perhaps it was the result of last-minute editing, but the portrayal of Galadriel as a cold, distant sorceress made me angry. Cate Blanchett is capable of so much warmth but we never see her smile, much less laugh! Celeborn may as well have been a mannequin.The journey from the edge of the wood to the elf-city, Galadrim, took days. In the movie, the characters turn around and they are magically there. Missing is a shot establishing the distance travelled - 10 seconds, tops. There is no blindfolding of the travelers to build the relationship between Gimli the dwarf and Legolas the Elf. Also, the bestowing of gifts, which is important in many ways later on, was cut almost completely.I am a Tolkien nut, having read all the books through several times. IMHO, Arwen's chase to the ford was overlong and showing the ring being cut from Sauron's hand THREE TIMES was a bit much. These should have been trimmed to give us precious more minutes in Lothlorien. I sincerely hope this was only sloppy editing for time and that we'll see justice done in a Director's cut DVD. Lothlorien cost this movie one star... Otherwise, I would have given it 10/10. A stunning achievement.",9,0,0,21 December 2001
War of the Worlds," Just a few botches on an otherwise good remake
","This was a fairly good update to the classic movie. However, with a couple simple changes, it could have been a 10 instead of a 7.1) Technically, the idea that the tripod machines were buried millennia before the invasion is just silly. How could the Martians have anticipated the rise of a technological human civilization so far in advance? Wouldn't the Martian's own technology also have advanced in the intervening thousands of years and wouldn't they want to use their own latest and greatest against us? Wouldn't they have aircraft? The tripods were cool, but they should have arrived in massive flying ships, perhaps similar to the swan-like machines in the original.2) Worse was missing the pivotal scene in the church. OK, Cruise is a Scientologist, and Spielberg wouldn't put him or either of his on-screen children in a Christian church. So, why not show people praying in synagogues, mosques, churches, and reflecting alone in their homes? The whole point is that when we are in our deepest despair, facing certain death, most of us will turn to faith in a higher power. At least, we contemplate our own mortality. Is showing faith in God considered lame in the 21st Century? Would it have made Tom Cruise less of a Scientologist? I hope not, faith is one of the things that makes us human, and what made the ending of the original film poignant and uplifting. Missing that scene is to have missed the whole point of the story.If you doubt this, read the last lines of the original... in memorable quotes: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407304/quotes",7,3,5,21 December 2008
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," One of the best of 2000...
","I can't say enough about this beautiful movie... The imagery, the camera work, the locations, the story, the acting, and oh... the music! I'm not a big bluegrass fan, but I went out and bought the soundtrack CD - something I rarely do.This is the kind of movie you want to go out and tell people about. Why is this playing in so few theaters!? It's been several days, and some of the scenes keep playing in my head. I really cannot wait to see it again, and will be buying the DVD. THIS is what movie making is all about!For those wanting to take kids, my advice is to go for it... The worst language in the movie that I remember is 'sum bitch!' - and if your kids haven't heard that, well, you must be a puritan. Our girls, ages 13 and 11, loved this movie. We all left the theater smiling. Go see it!",9,0,0,24 January 2001
