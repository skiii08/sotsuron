Iron Man 3," Do you expect to have more in the battle at the end
","I think the film is good, nice story, lots of humor, a happy ending The battle at the end is very impressive with a lot of iron robots in different armors. When i saw them flying i thought it would be a very dramatic fighting But i think if only the producer could provide more scenes for the iron suits to perform, it would be very interesting. There are just a few fighting scenes, and although there are dozens of suits,we could only see a few of them. I expect to see more suits with different functions I specially like the big and strong robot which run from the river, it is also featured in the trailer. But i could only see them for a few seconds. What a pity!! i expected they could do something important for Tony. Most important, i think it should have a leader suit which is strongest among them. It will make a real battle.",8,1,4,4 May 2013
Pacific Rim," Why don't the jaggers use all of their heave weapons in the beginning
","I first, i want to say that this movie is really good, and worth to watch. They have done a very good job. The acting, the story, the emotion are good. The only thing i think it missing are the fighting scenes. The jaggers are destroyed so easily, there are only 4 jaggers, and indeed, only 2 can fight. Most of the fights are just hand-to-hand combat. The 2 jaggers have little time to show their ability. They even cant fire any missile or use any special weapon. They have a lot of heave weapons, but i wonder why they did not use them ( the weapons) in the beginning. Overall, i enjoyed this movie, and some scenes are really moving.",9,1,5,19 July 2013
The Wolverine," 3 interesting lessons from the movie
","Just watch the movie and it did give me 3 lessons 1. The Earth is a round, we can meet again at some point in the future. But the time is a line, so never expect your friend be the same person as he used to be 2. Beauty is always a perfect trap that can fool any man. 3. TRUST NO ONE!! The story is good and it did surprise me. In the beginning, i have thought that it was too simple, but in the end, it was not. There is some funny moments in the movie, you can laugh for sure. The open ending could mean that this series will continue. I expect to see more mutants in one movie. One thing that i am keep asking after watching this movie. At the end,how could they manage to get out the house with many skilled ninja in there?",9,3,9,25 July 2013
Thor: The Dark World," Not only about war, but also about love and lost
","Comparing with the last movie, this movie is far better, because they are deeper, logical, the story is far better.The humor factors has decreased slightly compared to other Marvel movies. i thought that movies of Marvel are always funny, humor but for this movie, they have put seriousness and darkness on this,making this movie more that just an action, fighting blockbuster. Although i kindly didn't like it since i prefer more humor. For other movies like Iron Man, you laugh most of the time. But for this movie, there are many silent moments in the cinema. Its not only about fighting, war,power...its also about love and lost. What you saw in the trial and what you thought is not what this movie about. I am sure you will be surprised when watching this movie. Just go and watch this movie.",9,24,49,31 October 2013
