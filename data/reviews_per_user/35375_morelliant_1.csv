Black Swan," Masterpiece. Aronofsky, you've done it again.
","Wow. Where do I start? This is a masterpiece. The actors are great, the story is great, the visual effects are BRILLIANT, and for once, I was not bored by the ballet! Natalie Portman was the perfect choice for this role as Nina, a ballerina who strives for perfection as the Swan Queen, and she deserves Best Actress. She captures the naivety and youth of the White Swan perfectly, and watching her slowly slip into madness as she is consumed by the need to be absolutely perfect as the sultry and sexy Black Swan (a role that her character REALLY has to work at) is a disturbing, unsettling, yet amazing film-watching experience. I also must mention Mila Kunis, who played Lily, a fellow ballerina (and a bad influence) who is more experienced and sexy, the perfect choice for the Swan Queen.Darren Aronofsky has proved once again that he can do no wrong. What truly makes this film a masterpiece is not Natalie Portman, but Aronofsky. Subtle foreshadowing and motifs (like a mirror being in almost every shot)and the very dark and sexual tone/theme of this film truly make it one of Aronofskys finest. I cannot recommend it higher.",10,2,5,17 February 2011
