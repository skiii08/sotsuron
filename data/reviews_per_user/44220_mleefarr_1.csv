Hereditary," Sooo Disappointing
","As a hugh fan of horror movies, I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. Oh boy, was I sorry! Way too long, slow and virtually no horror. I'm a big fan of Toni Collette, but even she couldn't save this shambles. Couldn't feel any emotion for any of the characters. I'm really fed up with Hollywood churning out crap movies one after the other and hyping them up to be classics. NOT",1,5,11,27 August 2018
