The Double Life of Véronique," Like an album with beautiful pictures
","*Possible minor spoilers*Hasn't ever happened that you browse an album with beautiful pictures pleasing your eyes, hearing at the same time beautiful music pleasing your ears and your soul? That's the way I saw this film. It is evident that it is entirely dedicated to Iréne Jacob's beauty, who gives a very good performance, perhaps one of her best, if not the best. And she is beautiful indeed! Zbignew Preisner's music excellently rendered by Elzbieta Towarnicka's voice, completes the beautiful images, by pleasing your ears and your soul. That's all. Do not expect any story, because there isn't any. The film is about two women, the French Véronique living in France and the Polish Weronika living in Kraków, Poland. They look alike like twins, like two drops of water. Véronique seems to feel Weronika, like it often happens with twins, however, they are not. Krzysztof Kieslowski's direction is excellent, perfectly rendering this poem of spectacle and hearing.",Null,1,4,5 May 2017
Troy," Such a nonsense!!
","A poor commercial Hollywood production, no matter how big the budget was. I wonder whether any of the people involved therein has the slightest idea about Homer, whose great epic poem (Iliad) they have so shamefully spoiled. Have they any idea about the Ancient Greek World? Awful dressing, having nothing to do with Ancient Greece, showing rather something between Ancient Persia and Turkey. My God, these turbans on the supposed Greek heads!! Absolutely ridiculous! I did not know whether to laugh or to scream out from anger. The awful music and dancing (was it not like belly dance?) recall rather eastern cabarets of Istanbul. The bully Achilles, rather a cow-boy film hero who kills everybody, so far from to be the famous Homer hero. A film that disappoints and get in the nerves of the people understanding something about the issue and especially when they are Greeks. It goes without saying that only the general idea was taken by Iliad. The rest was a shame!! I have been unable to see it to the end. Recommended for people who want to waste their time and money, or like such sort of productions worse than the ones of the 50's!!",Null,4,13,24 November 2005
Fargo," 'Fargo', drama, crime, comedy, or what?
","Or is it a bad mixture of all the above? I saw the film last night and still wonder about. Stupid faces, miserable acting, poor and laughable dialogues, uninteresting and rather badly written story. It's one of the worst films I have ever seen and I strongly recommend everybody to keep off, if you do not want to waste your time and possibly your money. Since it is a true story, as the film informs, one should not make it appear ridiculous.",Null,5,11,2 April 2017
Kingsman: The Secret Service," I am disappointed
","I saw this film last night thinking that it could be a little serious. I am disappointed having wasted my time with a shabby parody of James Bond films. Of course a parody is well come, when it is a real one, with humor and not a bunch of rubbish, like this. What a pity for actors like Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson and Michael Caine to be let in such a nonsense.My vote 3/10",Null,0,2,8 June 2018
Donnie Darko," Too slow paced and weird film
","For about one and a half hour I tried to make out what's all about. Than I gave it up as the film is awfully slow and I got tired. Acting is good, especially by Jake Gyllenhaal, but that was not sufficient to keep me sitting for another half an hour's time or so, watching the same and the same repeated stuff.My vote is 3/10",Null,1,5,26 April 2019
