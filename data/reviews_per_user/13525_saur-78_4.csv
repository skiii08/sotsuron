The Incredible Hulk," powerful action flick...special effects are rock solid
","I have not seen the hulk, the first one but i did not miss anything while watching the incredible hulk. The movie is an entertaining action flick.The story is very easy going, predictable and almost self explanatory. The movie starts with edward norton as part of an experiment which goes wrong and turns him into a green monster.The general who wants to use hulk as a military weapon with the intention of creating more like him, chases hulk. His daughter, Liv tyler loves patrick norton. General has tim roth as the military leader who hates hulk. Tim roth turns himself into abomination with the help of a biologist who is initially trying to cur e hulk. Now in the initial part edward norton wants to get rid of the monster inside him. But later he wishfully turns into one wto stop the abomination.Now the movie has certain clichÃ© where only tyler can turn him back to normal with her expression of love. The director just missed showing her kissing norton to convert him back into a normal person from a monster :-) . The climax has been compromised a little by giving hint of another sequel. Although i liked the final scene where patrick norton is practicing yoga.tyler is lost and ordinary. Tim roth overreacts most of the time. Patrick norton and his avtar hulk are the ones to watch.",7,2,4,24 June 2008
The Bourne Ultimatum," best of the three so far!
","A series coming to a conclusion is mostly a happy ending. All of us who have been on an exciting ride with Jason Bourne so far, reach this thrilling, adrenaline pumping, speed monster ride grande finale.jason bourne gets to know who he was and how it all started. But this not before some amazing chases, mind games and hand to hand combats. The non stop action which has been the hallmark of this series is taken to the highest level in this one.The movie starts in Russia and ends in NYC but not before one has been taken to places around the world. I am not giving any more of the plot away so go and watch it. This one is not to be missed!",9,0,2,20 June 2008
No Country for Old Men," what was it ?
","i came, i read the reviews, i saw it and i am stunned in sort of a wrong way. i still don't know what i saw and i am not able to make heads and tails of it.People have talked highly of this movie but i surely don't think it deserves all that. perhaps one of the worst western i have seen. and as for the plot i don't know even if its worth a mention. I don't even know how to describe what i just saw. Words have never been so tough coming! well i am still all for clint eastwood when it comes to western.well i just didn't get this movie . if you did and liked it...thank heavens!",2,0,2,15 August 2008
The Social Network," The genius unleashed and the dark evolution of the largest social network
","Could not catch this on the theater but got a DVD from a friend of mine and watched it yesterday. The best part is that it talks about a subject that is very fresh and contemporary. Its not difficult to relate to. And this movie throws light into the dark evolution of the social network.Was it the case of plain and superlative genius or was it the technical excellence coupled with the ability to stand over the shoulders of the giants. Whatever it is - this is an unexplored side of a large social mesh that has connected us all. To see it evolve from an idea, the people who carried it and how it has threaded the entire world and tied them together under one roof is a thrilling journey.Don't miss your ticket to this one.",6,0,0,17 April 2011
