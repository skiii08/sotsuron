First Man," Boring as hell!
",One of the greatest achievements of man reduced to bad soap opera drama!!,5,6,9,30 January 2019
Midway," Too Polictically Correct! Made for release in Japan!!
",If you wanted a movie about what the Japanese did to America and the horrors they perpetrated ... that the Japanese would like then this is your movie! Horrible. Acting was average script was disjointed and sometimes pointless. Movie starts with blaming the USA for causing Pearl Harbor! Without CGI there is no movie and the CGI was not really that good.,3,9,33,8 November 2019
