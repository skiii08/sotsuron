Casablanca," Casablanca (1942)
","In terms of classic cinema, 'Casablanca' is easily on the list of top 10 best films ever made. Set during World War II, the classic that is 'Casablanca' is one of romance, drama, and surprisingly witty humor. Humphrey Bogart as Rick and Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa bring to the film an unimaginable amount of believability and on-screen chemistry. The acting is solid, the cinematography is brilliantly beautiful, and the overall plot of the film is both exciting and engaging, making 'Casablanca' the masterpiece that it is. 'Casablanca' is one of those rare films that truly almost anybody could enjoy. Even the most vicious of classic era film haters could find something about this movie that would make them rethink their irrational hatred of an entire era of classic cinema. With remarkably witty dialogue and outstanding performances by the entire cast, 'Casablanca' takes a daring story line and pairs it with the elegant and complicated romance between Bogart and Bergman's characters giving the movie just the right mixture of romance and drama to establish the film as one of the best ever made.",10,2,3,8 May 2014
Apocalypse Now," Apocalypse Now (1979)
","I have probably seen this movie about fifteen times and yet it is still one of the most confusing things I have ever witnessed. Don't get me wrong; I have a special place in my heart for this film, but that doesn't make it any less confusing. Francis Ford Coppola, also known for directing 'The Godfather', directed 'Apocalypse Now' only a few years after the Vietnam war in which it was set. Known for its vivid imagery and often weird sequences, 'Apocalypse Now' will forever be a movie that I can always find something new to love about it. It's just one of those movies that is just so confusing that on some level it just makes perfect sense. I may not have yet achieved that level in which this movie makes sense, but for me that's absolutely okay. I honestly enjoy the fact that this is one of the most trippy, confusing movies I have ever seen. I think that's kind of the point. This movie was not supposed to be about the actual war. It was supposed to be about how crazy the emotional, mental, and physical influences of war were for the people involved. For me, this film is easily one of my favorite war movies because it explores the situation of war in a way that many other war related movies refuse to acknowledge. With the crazy editing and the vivid cinematography, I can personally say that this is probably my favorite Coppola film of all time.",9,0,1,9 May 2014
The Graduate," The Graduate (1967)
","Let's be honest; in terms of cinema, 1967 was a pretty spectacular year. Mike Nichols's 'The Graduate', for example, is very high on the list of best films released in 1967 (or really, ever). This film truly is quite brilliant. Based of Charles Webb's 1963 novel of the same name, 'The Graduate' focuses on the story of a young college graduate who is quickly trapped in a messy affair with one of his parents friends. Not knowing what to do with his life post-college, Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) gets involved with an older woman, Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), and beings a long and complicated process of equal parts self-loathing and self-discovery. Unfortunately for everybody involved, Benjamin quickly falls in love with Mrs. Robinson's much more age appropriate daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross) and now has to face the consequences of telling the girl that he loves that he's been sleeping with her mother and then also tell the woman he's been sleeping with that oops, he's fallen in love with her daughter.As equally interesting as the plot, the way the film was made is just as neat. With witty dialogue and superb acting, the characters were portrayed in a way that was extremely believable. The editing of the movie was also done quite well. With beautiful montage sequences and really cool point-of-view filming, and the addition of Simon and Garfunkel's music to really make the film what it was, 'The Graduate' was created, in terms of both form and content, in a way that is both brilliant and representative of issues of issues, such as self doubt and not knowing what to do with your future, that almost everyone must face at some point in their lives.",10,2,2,8 May 2014
Singin' in the Rain," Singin' in the Rain (1952)
","Easily one of my favorite musicals, 'Singin' in the Rain' is fun, witty, and entertaining throughout the entire film. As far as musicals go, it is difficult to find one more entertaining than 'Singin' in the Rain'. Starring Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, and Debbie Reynolds, this musical focuses around a Hollywood studio during their transition from silent films to 'talkies'. Known for its iconic title song, 'Singin' in the Rain' is just pure fun to watch. With the perfect mixture of singing, dancing, and humor, this is definitely one of the most energetic films to date. In terms of its stylistic format, 'Singin' in the Rain' is brilliantly made. The films' underling plot, after all, is about the progression of film technology in Hollywood and 'Singin' in the Rain' does a great job of creating a realistic representation of that. By using Technicolor the film stood out, not only because of its plot, superb acting, and happy-go-lucky singing and dancing, but because of it's beautiful appearance. In terms of the musical genre, 'Singin' in the Rain' is easily, for me at least, in the top three of best films ever made.",10,0,1,8 May 2014
The Wizard of Oz," The Wizard of Oz (1939)
","If you were to ask anybody, the likelihood of them telling you that they have never seen 'The Wizard of Oz' is slim to none. As one of the most iconic films in American history, 'The Wizard of Oz' is an enchanting film filled with laughter, music, and an intriguing story line that leaves you wanting to join Dorothy and the crew in the magical land of Oz.Brilliantly made, the transition from black-and-white Kansas to the colorful land of Oz is a truly wonderful moment in the history of film. Nobody can forget the moment dashes of color began to fill the screen as everything came to life along the yellow brick road. The characters in this film are somewhat iconic themselves, as everybody knows who the Tin Man (Jack Haley), the Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr), and the Scarecrow (Ray Bolger) are. They are, of course, some of the most memorable characters ever to skip across our screens.The plot never ceases to amaze, no matter how many times you've seen the film. There is always something new, always something you missed, to pull you right back in just as it had so many times before. As one of American History's most classic films, 'The Wizard of Oz' (1939) is a film like no other of it's time. A marvelous cast and an electric plot, there is no doubt in my mind that this film should be at the top of everybody's lists of most beloved movies.",10,3,5,13 March 2014
