Miracle," Dramatic without being melodramatic
","My son and I, both hockey fans who know the USA/USSR game by heart because of HBO's excellent documentary, both agreed that this is an excellent film. Although Disney made it, it is NOT on the scale of, say, the Mighty Ducks. I think the fact they used hockey players who had some acting talent went a long way towards making the film very realistic.Interestingly enough, the film was NOT a USAfest, as some people might think. It's really the simple story of a team and its coach.
My only regret- Herb Brooks didn't live to see the film.",8,0,0,6 February 2004
