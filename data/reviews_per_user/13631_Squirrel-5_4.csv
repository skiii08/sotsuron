First Man," The man behind the mission
","This undoubtedly the best space movie I've seen since Apollo 13.. and I've seen quite a number, as I've been interested in studying manned spaceflight for well over 33 years. I've listened to hundreds of hours of archival mission audio too.I loved how it put a human face on the Apollo 11 mission and the life of Neil and his earlier missions. From his X-15 flights to Gemini VIII and Apollo 11 This is meant to be a biopic and not a film about the moon landing. The filmmakers took some liberties, but this is commonplace in Hollywood. 
The film as the title implies, is about the man, not the mission. This has led to some controversy, most notably (I'm speaking as an American here) over how the planting of the US flag was downplayed in the film, but Neil Armstrong's own family defended this, saying he would have approved since this was a human achievement, not solely an American one. The plaque left on the moon said 'We came in peace for ALL Mankind' (emphasis added) Half a million people from around the globe, including my grandfather, made this mission possible, from tracking stations in Australia, (we'd not have been able to watch in on TV without their help) to German rocket scientists secretly brought to the US after World War II. Neil was always a humble man an eschewed the limelight intensely in his later years, and you can tell that from the film.I saw others complain abut the jump cuts and scenes that made people dizzy. I thought this made the film more authentic. I studied the Gemini VIII mission closely and knew much about the incident featured in the film. It is intense but made almost me feel like I was actually there. 
The musical score was incredible and had some tributes to many other films including the 'Blue Danube Waltz' scene from 2001 A Space Odyssey. The inclusion of a theremin is perfect and gives it an ethereal spacey quality. The sound director did a great job at showing that sound cannot travel through space by having dead silence at parts. The film has some obvious flaws but did a great job at telling the story from a perspective not seen before.Go see it! From all I've read on Neil Armstrong, I learned a new thing or two about him.",8,3,10,13 October 2018
Star Trek," Not a prequel but a full blown reboot. Gene Roddenberry would be appalled!
","If you are not a Star Trek fan you will probably think this is an excellent film. It has intense action sequences, great special effects and good acting.If you are a Star Trek fan like I am, stay home.This film contains massive amounts of retroactive continuity. Things in this film contradict cannon every previous Star Trek film and TV series.Someone at Paramout should lose their jobs over this. J.J. Abrams warned 'purists' to stay home. He should have not used the term purist as that only applies to Trekkies that are complete geeks when it comes to the franchise.He should have warned that most fans would be disappointed.",1,55,118,8 May 2009
Insomnia," The original was better. *MINOR SPOILERS*
","The original version of the film, made in Norway, was far better than this version. The original was easy for Norway to do, Much of the country is north of the Arctic circle with larger towns there (It was filmed in Tromsø, the worlds most populated town north of the Arctic Circle) but for an American film, the only place in the US to do a film would be Alaska where the areas north of the Arctic circle are sparsely populated.The choice of actors was also poor. Honestly, can we see Robin Williams, a comic actor playing the role of a killer? Not me. The American version was too 'Hollywoodized'. Al Pacino tries to make it look good, but I strongly recommend the original. I was lucky enough to have first seen the original almost 2 years ago. I have seen it several times since. Comparing it to the new one. I think they tried to copy the original too meticulously.
*BEGIN SPOILER*Some scenes in both versions were virtually identical. Dormer/Engström taping the window shades down in a futile attempt to stop the midnight sunlight from keeping him awake. Dormer/Engström vomiting in guilt in an alley after accidently killing his partner, the killer escaping through a tunnel underneath the shed.Some scenes were slightly changed to seem more action oriented and less suspenseful. In the scene by the shed, the original had the killer alerted to the presence of the police by the sound a thermos breaking. In the new version, we see a thermos but the killer is alerted due to a policeman's megaphone accidently being turned on.*END SPOILER*I give the effort a plus, but the end result is a poor remake of an excellent Norwegian film.",4,0,1,8 June 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," Incredible! Good special effects and plot
",I noticed some people claiming that the ending was disappointing. Maybe to them but The ending was somewhat unexpected but certainly not disappointing.The special effects are incredible also and there are a few new 'bullet time' effects which are impressive. The live action mix with CGI is practically seamless.This better be nominated for a Best visual effects Oscar® or I will be very surprised.,7,0,0,6 November 2003
