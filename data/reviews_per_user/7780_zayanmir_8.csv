Ford v Ferrari," What a movie
","This is just incredible, from the amazing cast to the score to the sound, this movie is incredible in nearly every category.",8,1,3,22 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Great, just feels crammed, and you fell like you're claustrophobic
","I think it's a great movie overall, it just feels way too crammed like it could've been multiple movies instead of one. I fell like if JJ Abrams had directed Last Jedi this movie could've been better unfortunately not the case. EDIT: the more I think about it the worse it gets, 7/10 for me.",7,6,12,2 January 2020
Warrior," An emotional gut punch
","This is an unforgettable movie about family. The last fight between the two brothers is one of the most gut wrenching things I've ever watched. On the downside, it doesn't dive into some plot points nearly enough as they should. Other than that, amazing movie",9,2,3,4 February 2020
1917," Technical achievement and masterpiece of cinema
","This is just an incredible achievement Sam Mendes pulls off. Not with a stellar cast or massive cinematic universe or anything connecting to it, but with an amazing plot, strong acting, emotion, direction, cinematography, screenplay, and score. Everything about this movie is amazing. The camera work in this makes it all feel like the entire movie in one shot. I don't think I've EVER felt like I was in the movie, with the characters, till now. It is tied for my 3rd favourite movie EVER! This is a must watch that'll blow your mind.",10,5,8,10 January 2020
The Dark Knight," MASTERPIECE
","The Dark Knight is my favourite movie of all time. Amazing acting all around, especially on Heath Ledgers side. It has a really good theme making us wonder who really is hero.",10,1,1,6 October 2019
Joker," Wow
","This movie really blew me away. I was expecting it to be good but, not this good. The cinematography is amazing however, it's Joaquin Phoenixes performance is what seals the deal. This movie is one of the best movies I've seen. 10/10 well done WB, Todd Phillips, and DC.",9,3,5,7 October 2019
Parasite," Great, just a but too over the top
","I think it's a good premise, the cast is great, the jokes land, and you can connect with the character, however the movie is too over the top for me which brings it down. The villain is a person who stayed in another persons secret bunker that the family living there didn't know about and the housekeeper was his wife who fed him, he was doing this because he had to pay off debts and people were coming for him. A bit over the top for a movie about a struggling family who try to find work in a rich persons house by recommending each other and making sure they aren't family. And then the father kills the dad of the rich family because... he said he smelled back, please. I'd give it an 8.5, no higher",9,5,10,21 January 2020
Black Panther," O-VER-RA-TED
","It's a good movie sure but best picture, not really.",8,0,2,8 October 2019
