The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," Works On Other Levels
","To the traditional American movie goer, this is an 'art' film. Such can be an unfair and inaccurate tag but it serves to forewarn the crowd that will demand the standard intro-character-conflict-confrontation-resolution line packed with ordinary devices. I don't pretend to fully understand what the makers of TDLOV had in mind but I very much enjoyed their product. The filming itself was great, beautiful shots of Krakow and Paris along with great camera angles and movement (such must be exceptional for me to even notice!). The heroine is stunningly beautiful and I confess the mere fact that I couldn't take my eyes off of her by itself causes me to give TDLOV a thumbs up. Whether you see, find, etc., a plot, suspense is present, whether for its own sake or not! The introduction of interesting characters is intriguing, even if at least some of them clearly go nowhere. Likewise odd incidents (the flasher!) arouse curiosity if -again- the itch created is never scratched. If SOME theme must be underscored this viewer was/is content with the notion of life's sensation of meaning; i.e., whether meaning is truly present or not.",Null,0,1,28 October 2011
Moneyball," Well Crafted If At Times Tedious
","I understand this film was based on a book and respect the makers choice to be faithful to such. The movie was very well made, paced, scripted, shot, etc. But I could never get behind Beane's character; i.e., I could never feel his drive, be sympathetic, etc. The fact that there was no score to the movie also detracted from my enjoyment. The topic and circumstances just were/are neither important nor serious enough to warrant the moody, agonizing emotional throes we appear to be encouraged to see. Critically, while I believe Beane built a successful team, I'm unconvinced his data-crunching experiment was strictly responsible for such as the success might have been in spite of it.The story, topic, etc., would have made an excellent 90 minute light drama with more laughs and a bouncy soundtrack. Such may have been unfaithful to the book but more enjoyable and less pretentious.",6,1,1,13 October 2011
Frost_Nixon," Not Effective
","Instead of concentrating on the era, Nixon the man or the Watergate affair, F/N decides to be a boxing match featuring David vs. Goliath, with traditional training tactics and theatrics, encounters serving as 'weigh-ins', pre-match jitters, nose-to-nose introduction, cronies in each corner with between round advice, etc. When the action finally starts, our underdog suffers the expected falls to the mat before miraculously delivering a knock-out punch.I must commend the producers for taking on a subject so unusual for a feature length film. What an opportunity to examine Richard Nixon and/or the mood and media of the 70's. Instead the maker's of F/N toss opportunity out the window and present the Frost/Nixon interviews as a prizefight. The result is silly.Our tendency to manufacture 'winners' and 'losers' in political confrontations often buries -if not ignores- the importance and substance of the issues involved. I can appreciate the psychic need to pick a good guy and a bad. Certainly Hollywood has a vested interest in heroes, villains, conflict, etc. But F/N embraces this superficial take to the absolute exclusion of all else. Despite necessary lip service, the characterizations of Dave and Dick are hack jobs and the 70's looks prehistoric.I found the debate scenes dull and the fretting of the sidelines guys laughable. I went home and watched the actual debates from YouTube, which were far more interesting.",5,7,15,18 March 2009
Marie Antoinette," Eye of the Beholden
","This movie is hauntingly good. Sophia Coppola might become (or is) one of our finest film directors.The viewer must accept that the movie is viewed exclusively, STRICTLY, through the eyes and mind of Antoinette. Some reviewers seem disappointed, cheated, etc., because the movie did not cover the broader scope of France, the Revolution, or even the debauchery and treachery of the Versaille society. Rather, it takes a young woman of some intelligence and moral character, places her in extraordinary circumstances and then watches her react. That the results are not sordid, surprising or particularly dramatic is not the fault of the main character but rather the product of her integrity and strength. So instead of a woman who becomes a catty society bitch we have a woman who actively serves the society she joins, enjoying if not overtly recognizing the indulgence the role requires. Instead of becoming a scheming, devious wife she works at and develops a warm, if not entirely faithful, relationship with her arranged and incompetent spouse. Instead of becoming alienated from her upbringing she retains and exercises her maternal and familial roles. Marie can be forgiven if she is neither extraordinary nor controversial, despite being placed in a situation where both such attributes could be (and were) assigned by default.The strength of the film relies on how Marie's point of view is presented. The first forty minutes of the movie has extremely limited dialogue, none of which does very much at all to explain or move a plot line. Rather, we see opulence and splendor. If you find yourself, as I did, overwhelmed and then drawn into the decadence by this mere visual display then, well, that's exactly what happened to Miss Antoinette. Less is more. Hardly a half hour and maybe a dozen lines, we start to feel for Marie, or at least appreciate the boundaries into which she is boxed. The viewer starts to pull for her. But its a fixed game. We know the bottom line and want to tell our heroine but cannot. I had hoped before I saw this movie that we'd get a depiction of the rabble in Paris as well as some period shots of the city; i.e., to match the excellent costume of Versaille. We do not. We do not because Marie never saw such either. Our eyes are not opened because hers are never opened. But in no respect does the film milk the poor little rich girl sentiment. Conversely, a viewer leaves this movie with remorse of what may have been a more full and complete life.",9,5,9,11 November 2006
World War Z," Drags Then Makes Comeback
","I walked into the theater curious about how anyone could succeed in the now overused vehicle of global viral attack in general and zombies in particular. Kudos to the decision to immediately introduce the pandemic, avoiding the slow intro from carrier #1 to the rest of the population. Then WWZ curiously drags with a domestic venue period followed by a darkened screen trip to South Korea that, while ultimately providing key data, has a slow down drag effect on the forward movement. But WWZ picks up spectacularly beginning with the trip to the Middle East. Difficult thing to make such a comeback. There is unnecessary literary dialog here and there; e.g., a 'Join the Team' pep talk given our hero, a pearl of wisdom offered by a Jewish senior, etc.. But the special effects, action sequences and, toward the end, suspense, ultimately won me over.",7,0,2,10 July 2013
The English Patient," By No Means A Great Movie
","Seeing this in the theater over ten years ago I remember thinking that I missed an important subplot. My belief was that I'd overlooked something that justified the adultery, the Count's actions, Carragio's pursuit, etc. I believed that knowing what had evaded me would have created dramatic tension as well as making me see the main characters in a better light than I'd witnessed in my 'uninformed' viewing.Watching the DVD over a decade later, I have exonerated myself. The scenery is breathtaking, the acting first class and the dialog witty. But despite TEP's length, what you see is what you get; i.e., there are no important details or consideration behind the curtain. The Count is, at face, a cold, arrogant and selfish SOB. But beneath the surface he is really a cold, arrogant and selfish SOB. Pardon the sarcasm.Trim TEP down to about 110 minutes and you've a good film. Padded to its book length and its too much for one sitting.",6,2,7,10 January 2009
The Secret in Their Eyes," No Prophet! No White Ribbon
","I've rarely felt so strongly about my opinion (opinions are like belly buttons, everyone has one). France's THE PROPHET should have been a front runner for the Best Picture Oscar, not just the best Foreign Film. Germany's THE WHITE RIBBON is a great film. TSITE is, at best, a mediocre made-for-TV movie. That TSITE beat out, among other films THE PROPHET and THE WHITE RIBBON for the 2009 Foreign Film Oscar is yet another shame upon the Academy (add to MOONSTRUCK and DRIVING MISS DAISY).TSITE is a plodding melodrama packaged as a crime drama. Its two hour length is padded with inconsequential banter among its main characters. It is chock full of awkward, incredible plot devises: Hero 'discovers' killer in group photos; killer bated into confession; killer appears in elevator with hero, etc. Not only is it not in the same league with THE PROPHET or THE WHITE RIBBON, it is not even a good film! JUST BECAUSE ITS FOREIGN DOES NOT MEAN IT IS NOT JUNK.If THE PROPHET had been beaten out for the best Foreign Film Oscar by THE WHITE RIBBON, I'd be in disagreement but would also be at peace. For one, its tough to compare an apple and an orange; e.g., whether one is more 'orangey' or 'applely' can be debated forever. On the other hand, TSITE is full of useless and/or protracted scenes and dialog, tired storyline and subplots, cardboard characters and, especially, contrived sentiment.Life is unfair as is. TSITE's Oscar is a tragedy.",4,2,27,2 February 2011
Juno," Ultimately Explotive
","Certainly its not taboo to make a comedy of a teen pregnancy. Rather, its how its done. This is a serious subject. The makers are allowed to believe that, because of the subject matter, there is a certain portion of the population that they'll NEVER be able to push a teen-pregnancy comedy past. However they appear to have ignored the portion of people (myself included)who can appreciate the human comedy of manners involved, if only a small nod is given to the reality of the circumstances. Instead JUNO goes straight to the folks (read, 'young') who'd find all behavior acceptable and believe in the justification and likelihood of a happy ending for all.The script is hilarious, especially Juno's dialog. Though her witticism, arrogance and intelligence are a bit too unbelievable, such serves as a good set-up for her comeuppance. Therein lies the problem - the ending. No messy consequences here! All characters are served, all is roses. Nothing to it. Back to teen idle. Happy motherhood. Guitar strumming romance.I was a high school teacher who witnessed a rash of teen pregnancies. I've daughters 16 and 18 whose friends were 'knocked up'. More critically, as a lawyer I've been appointed to represent 100's of trouble juveniles, an overwhelming majority being of nontraditional family structure. A birth to teen parents can turn out well but MORE OFTEN THAN NOT results in economic and emotional hardships. I've done two private adoptions; i.e., one of the 'happy' endings. The impact on the teen mother and her parent(s)was devastating. No devastation here.Its a shame. Again the script was funny, e.g. To Juno:'Won't your parents be worry if you're home late?' Juno: What for? I'm already pregnant'. Unfortunately, the outcome is exploitive.",6,3,9,29 January 2009
Burn After Reading," Clever Cohen's Get Away Again
","The Cohens are among our best filmmakers but are getting too smug. RAISING ARIZONA, THE BIG LEBOWSKI, etc., are truly new approaches to comedy. FARGO was a masterpiece injecting a more darker, violent drama than, e.g LEBOWSKI. FARGO also had some vague moral implications, though after NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN its hard to guess whether morality was even intended.But the brothers tend to bite off more than they can chew or, alternately, seem unable to resist a showy conceit of talent. Notwithstanding its charm, FARGO contained scenes like the Chinese American guy's emotional breakdown, which meant less than nothing to the storyline (and certainly wasn't funny). NCFOM was chock full of comedy 'bits', intricate detail and clever dialog: All for their own sake.BURN AFTER READING is great laughs, hilarious scenes, pro acting and script and stars to boot. A movie it ain't. Its many good things thrown up against a wall with hopes that what sticks will make a beautiful pattern. Doesn't work this time. We'll continue to enjoy the sheer film-making talent and devices of the Cohens. Lets hope they get around to organizing a full length idea soon.",5,2,6,29 December 2008
The Orphanage," Spanish Slop
","Within ten minutes THE ORPHANAGE tells us its going to be standard fare with standard devices: Return to a childhood haunt with issues, child to perceive ghosts adults cannot, spooky old person; we've seen it a gazillion times, The ensuing story, plot, etc., is done well enough, with appropriate scares, shots, etc., and is at times entertaining (the seance scenes, however, too loaded with dialog manure). On the other hand there's nothing particularly new or note worthy. THE ORPHANAGE might otherwise get a passing grade except...........The Spanish woman cast in the lead role was an awful choice. Her character admits to being 37, her IMDb bio has her at 42 but she doesn't look a day less than 50, which still might be okay except.........her maternal skills are cold fish. In the scenes with her 'son' I see a woman who doesn't like and/or is unfamiliar with kids. Robin Williams would have been better placed in the role.The creepy old lady's role is ill defined and makes little sense. In the past the heroine and hag are at most 20 years apart but later it looks like this age difference has doubled. Apparently decades ago the hag was able to poison five kids and stuff their bodies away without anyone missing them at the time. Hag inexplicitly then develops a need to recover the bodies for some reason (Hag must have seen THE ORPHANAGE before it was made and learned heroine would develop the psychic skills to find the remains).PAN'S WHATCHAMACALLIT was good work. THE ORPHANAGE is not.",5,4,10,17 December 2011
The White Ribbon," Horrific and Spellbinding
","It takes a good forty-five minutes before this film grabs you but when it does it just will not let you go. It took this viewer some time to recognize the subtle tensions as they exist behind the closed doors of the rooms and houses of this German village, partly because these tensions, anxieties, etc., are -until near the end of the film- almost oblivious to our good Samaritan narrator. In retrospect, when I say 'behind the closed doors' I mean so almost literally as household, bedroom, barn and other doors, gates, fences, etc., (open, closed and/or in the act of opening or closing) appear so frequently in this film that I can't help but wonder if such were not intentional. This is filmmaking at its best.",9,1,5,21 November 2010
The Duchess," Just A Poor Film
","I'm guessing this film was designed as a star vehicle for Miss Knightly. I'm not a cruel person but Kiera simply is not up to carrying such a weighty role. I believe Cate Blanchett, Emily Watson or Gwyneth Paltrow would have each had different takes on the character and come out on top. But KK simply doesn't have or has not yet developed the ability.There's a 1998 film called DANGEROUS BEAUTY set in 15th century Venice which is very similar to THE DUCHESS in that it centers on a women's fixed and extremely limited role in ruling class, aristocratic society (especially the concept of the mistress). DB succeeds because it focuses more on the society itself (not to mention a far stronger female in the lead role).Rather than say that this film is bad, its better said that it is just weak all around. And what an awful waste of Ralph Fiennes, who pretty much just struts around and mumbles when hes not making poor love.",4,3,7,2 January 2009
No Country for Old Men," Curiously Unrewarding
","Be suspicious of a few negative reviews sticking out among overwhelmingly favorable ones; i.e., is this person trying to show how smart he/she is? Is he/she trying to attract attention? I like the Cohen brothers' movies and am generally optimistic about films. I didn't care for NCFOM.FARGO was excellent in part because of the banal evil contrasted against the equally matter-of-fact goodness of McDormand's family, friends, etc. Good overcame evil without fanfare, moralizing or -for that matter- very much thought. Further contrast was provided by Macy and Buscemi's characters, who being lost somewhere south of good but north of pure evil, became doomed.Watching NCFOM, I gathered in the meaning of Tommy Lee Jones opening narrative which laid out the good v. evil motif (if a bit explicitly). Thereafter the theme was supported by little more than cop banter until the end of the film when we get two lengthy and embarrassingly moralizing speeches from the sheriff's friend and family. I'm no intellectual. I can appreciate a movie strictly for style (MULHOLLAND DRIVE) with uneven style (DOGMA) or lacking traditional or cohesive narrative (tons of them). If that's what you set out to do, however, don't paint your film so tediously! Why provide such detailed plot? Why am I fed precious moments of Brolin's fashioning a hook to retrieve the money bag? Why waste minutes teaching us how to self-treat a shotgun injury or where to hide a handgun under a trailer? What am I to do with these details? Why infuse so much deadpan humor; e.g., mother-in-law's back seat rant and Bardem's deadpan monster (this is a relatively juvenile device,see the TERMINATOR). What am I to make of a Texas town entertaining dozens of gunshots and a car crash in the middle of the night with all the townsfolk remaining asleep? If I'm supposed to feel remorse for the futility of goodness I need to see goodness at least FACE the evil. Presently I won't visit West Texas because the lawmen are sipping coffee and the people are zombies.The Cohen brothers are far better film makers than; e.g., Quentin Tarentino, but I saw a parallel with the hype for PULP FICTION, which I abhorred. I'd read a ton of reviews for each movie. Yet none of the reviews where able to tell me, besides the plot itself, WHY the movie was good or what it was supposed to convey. In other words, all the reviews were gushers of praise by apparently hypnotized viewers. I read Ebert's review after I watched NCFOM. Roger's our finest movie critic and a true gentleman. He has obviously read McCarthy and I have not. Usually after reading an Ebert review I realize how ignorant I am, Usually he points out specific things I didn't pick up or of which I am just unaware. I didn't feel that way this time. NCFOM just did not do it for me.",5,11,23,23 March 2008
District 9," Ingenuous!
","D-9 somehow manages to juggle four or five things to incredible effect. Mockumentary is hard to do without becoming preachy or self-serving but D-9 makes excellent use of such. Science fiction means different things to different people (some say there's only been a half dozen authentic science fiction films ever made) but D-9 has to be as much if not more 'sci-fi'than; e.g., ALIEN (films like STAR WARS don't even count). The script and editing were great: Not a wasted minute. The special effects were just right; e.g., not too much or too little. There was humor, though maybe its more appropriate to call it comic relief; as the term was/is truly intended. There's a hero, or rather a main character that goes through a heroic transformation. And I don't care what the snobs say, D-9 is great social commentary, quite possibly because such comes so cleverly disguised as entertainment. I'm so glad that every time I start to believe no one will ever make an exciting movie again, a film like D-9 comes along and proves me wrong.",9,2,5,17 August 2009
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Test of Patience Pays Off
","Yes this movie is overlong and ponderous. I am not unsympathetic to the commenter's herein that the movie bored them. But the finer points of Assn. of Jesse James ultimately overcome such. While I can appreciate the observations that this movie intended to show the beginnings of American hero worship, I think this was merely a beneficial side effect. The Oedipal, homo-erotic undertones of the film were so palpable you could almost see them floating on the screen. I didn't read the book and don't know if such was fiction or nonfiction. Accordingly I don't know who to thank but the director and choreographer deserve considerable praise, as do Affleck and Pitt. Not a single actor overdid his/her role. In effect the tone of the movie was perfect. A good example is the various characters' reaction to the shooting death of Jesse's cousin, which was maybe unlike any movie death scene you have ever witnessed. Rather than callous indifference or emotional venting, the survivors remain poised and dignified and behave like people who recognize death as an ordinary aspect of life. As Robert Ford therein remarks, 'Lets wish him well on his journey'. Personally, I enjoyed the use of the English language, which appeared very carefully crafted to reflect the words, patterns and content circa 1880; e.g., delivered best by Afflect and Sheppard by the railroad at the beginning of the movie. Given the limited commercial viability of Assn. of Jesse James..., we should be grateful the film got made.",8,2,4,4 April 2008
To Rome With Love," Par for Mr. Allen
","It still holds true for me that I cannot go wrong with a Woody Allen movie. TRWL is no exception.Woody Allen has a very distinct style and the viewer must be willing to accept unorthodox points of view from his characters and narrators, as well as leaps of faith for the sake of storytelling. Such is not for everyone. But Woody, rather than attempt to show you how clever he is or feed you some 'in' jokes, seems to sincerely want you to see humor and seems to know that what he finds humorous has a universal appeal; as opposed to cultural, age specific, genre, etc.. I've never agreed that Woody offers only high-brow or East Coast, Brooklyneze humor. Rather, Allen seems to know that humor is often situational or revolves around language. I'm guessing that Woody is truly Old School and believes in an actual obligation to his fans. Doesn't matter, I doubt I'll ever miss one of his movies. That said, TRWL is rather long for a Woody Allen film and suffers a little as a result. The movie has four distinct tales and eliminating one would leave a moviegoer fully satisfied. I'd elect to drop the 'Everyman Becomes Celebrity', not because it is inferior but because it doesn't 'fit' in as well. Aside from a casting choice or two, I cannot complain any further.",8,2,6,19 July 2012
It Follows," Sorry, Just Another Teen 'B' Flick
","My 20 year old daughter loves horror, 'scary' movies and, when her boyfriend's not around, drags me along (I ALWAYS pay, boyfriend often goes Dutch). Read a ton of favorable reviews for this film, almost all stressing the following beliefs; e.g., the script is far superior to the teen slasher/supernatural genre; the acting is much more professional, the effects are better than usual, and the ending is chilling. Here's my take; the script is much stupider than genre; the acting is as if hiring chimpanzees, the effects are few and backyard produce-able, and the ending can't even rise to the level of clichÃ©. IT FOLLOWS is not only not better than the average junk of this genre, it's actually worse. Don't waste your time.",3,7,14,1 May 2016
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Among Best Film Industry Films
","The Movie ('OUATIH') moves immediately into my top five favorite movies about Hollywood and that's a tough class to crack; e.g., Sunset Boulevard, Singing In The Rain, The Player! Always believed Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction to be showy, pretentious nothings, and Kill Bills silly. But with OUATIH this Quenton fellow has made a good film. Shave a half hour by clipping the Where Cliff Lives, Tate at Movies, the Little Girl n' Book, Flying Back From Italy, Too Long in Bar ... and you've got a GREAT movie. The sets and props are stupendous, right down to a case of 6 oz. Cokes. Spahn's Ranch was so scary because QT painted it look so believable. Encounters were great, Cliff v. Bruce Lee, Pacino and Dern turns .. and the ending ...already a legend. Don't miss OUATIH.",9,15,23,11 August 2019
Insidious," Great Scares But Some Fizzle
","Lets face it, its tough to come up with a new horror idea that's remotely plausible. Better to achieve a compromise regarding the suspension of belief or, as does INSIDIOUS, pay homage to other fine movies. This movie borrows heavily from POLTERGEIST, with some nod to THE SHINING and maybe even BEETLEJUICE. Rose Byrne is great, just very convincing, neither too low key nor over-the-top hysterical. Lin Shaye was superb, nothing short of a scene stealer! Barb Hershey -great scream, right from the school of Karen Black! Patrick Wilson's performance is a bit short, maybe a little too passive. Would've liked to have seen Sam Rockwell in this role! But the scares, which are truly an art form, are cleverly conceived and executed - really cannot ask for more in the horror genre nowadays. Unfortunately, the last portion of the film - the 'netherworld' - is under achieving and not up to par with the first 80 minutes. But I must still give INSIDIOUS a thumbs-up!",Null,0,0,30 August 2011
2012," Fun For the Kids
","I had a lot of fun taking my 12 year old son and two of his friends to this movie. 2012 was no more far-fetched than; e.g., Independence Day, The Abyss, Armageddon, The Core.... I could go on and on. Further, the 'Gremlins'-like touches of humor made 2012 go down much easier than the afore-mentioned films, which mildly insult by pretending to be plausible science fiction. I get annoyed reading the showy displays of 'brilliance' by reviewers who point out that the events are ludicrous, melodramatic, over-the-top, etc. OF COURSE THEY ARE. So was King Kong in 1933. Such critics remind me of sullen adolescents who've just learned the moon isn't really made of green cheese. I recommend they have young children and take them to a Saturday matinÃ©e featuring a Jane Austen flick. I'm sure it'll be a swell time for all.",7,2,2,8 March 2010
Room," What An Achievement!
","ROOM is two films, really, complimenting one another and every bit as enthralling in their individual rights. Most impressive about this film is how much thought the writer Emma Donaghue put into her screenplay, not made easier and probably harder by the fact she also wrote the source novel (a surprise and must-read to me!). With help from Director Lenny Abrahamson the film is finely crafted not to waste a word or a moment to embellish the story and suspense. It would be very easy to veer into pathos, melodrama and voyeurism to stir up emotions but such temptations are well avoided. The thrilling scenes in the middle of the film are standing alone worth the watching. The dialog and screenplay skills become most apparent in the second half of ROOM when experiencing Jack's emotional, physical and verbal responses to a world he is unfamiliar with. most apparent in his almost humorous but curiously on-point descriptions of everyday behavior and encounters. I'd have assigned a perfect '10' but for the fact that Macy's Dad's reaction Ma's 'descent' might've been anticipated a bit more. I quibble. Great movie!",9,1,3,23 March 2017
I Am Legend," 'Duh!, Its a genre flick!'
","This negative review is influenced by my discussion on the ride home with my teenage daughter. Says Krissy, 'Duh, daddy, you just don't know a good movie!' I'm amazed at what passes as special because someone spent big bucks on a film and a star. At present count there are a trillion post-apocalyptic movies and a gazillion zombie flicks. You can't convince me this wasn't just another one of such. Also, note the obvious similarities to the recently released '28 Days/Weeks' which is most certainly a apocalypse/zombie film.Love Will Smith and the graphics were top notch. First 45 minute were great. If only the makers'd decided they weren't trying to do something special.",6,0,1,5 January 2008
The Hurt Locker," Burdened By The Oscar?
","Imagine if you had seen THE HURT LOCKER on a rainy day when you had not even planned to see a movie; e.g., your camping trip was ruined and THL was the only thing starting without a long wait. Imagine you'd heard nothing of the film, let alone that it'd won the Oscar for Best Picture.You'd probably think it was a well filmed, great scripted movie with guts to go on location. You'd think that you'd just seen some (relatively) fresh faces who did a great job pulling off first class suspense, edge-of-your-seat excitement and realistic portrayals of human reaction. And you may feel (rightly or not) that you now know something new about the Iraq War.Certainly you'd leave the theater reaffirmed that a gazillion dollars need not be spent to make a great piece of entertainment. But the Oscar?My problem is that THL began to feel very episodic; e.g., as if we were offered one adventure after another without effort - or intent for that matter - to pull the story or characters along. Indeed I still don't know these three guys well, if at all. The movie spoon fed us the 'war as addiction' theme; Subtle it was not.But sometimes I (or you, or many/most of us) are in the mood for a fast ride and THL sure delivers. I'm almost sorry it won the statue. I want to remember THL as a darker horse.",8,4,12,15 March 2010
The Illusionist," Not So magical
","I have read dozens of the comments herein and must agree most with those who felt disappointed. THE ILLUSIONIST is a beautiful period piece, well casted and acted, etc. But the film paints itself into a dramatic corner and then makes a mess of escaping itself.The plot holds no surprises. It is clear that the storyline is about the magician winning back, rescuing, etc., his true love from an unhappy life and evil prince. Nothing new there. Certainly the film could have helped itself if the leading lovers had not consummated their passion so early in the film. There is also a very nice subplot regarding the internal conflict of Giamatti's inspector, who is intrinsically good but who has been corrupted. I call this a 'subplot' because I was interested in seeing on which side of good and evil this character ultimately stood. Well scripted and acted in that regard. It seemed clear to me that the suspense; i.e., the question for which we were being teased, was the great Eisenheim's nature. Had his travels, experiences, etc., effected a transformation? What and where did he learn what he did? Had he sold his soul to the devil? Apparently I am way off base as far as the movie's motives, its main conflict, its intent, etc.. I'm still unsure what the film is trying to suggest. In light of the explanation packaged together in the last few minutes of the film, I think we are being asked to believe that Norton's character was a great magician with deep insight into human nature. If such is the case, no explanation whatsoever is provided for how Eisenheim's tricks are performed. So if we must swallow that Eisenheim can do ANYTHING, create ANY illusion, etc., where is the suspense? Its like the Superman adventure where Superman reverses the spin of the world to turn back time. If a hero is so God-like that he can do ANYTHING why should we be anxious, fearful, curious, etc., about conflict, predicament or dramatic tension? If Eisenheim can perform ANY feat why should we worry about the ending?In light of the awkward explanation at the end, it seems clear that the creators of this movie do not suggest that Eisenheim had supernatural abilities. In retrospect, it might have been a more satisfying resolution if we learned that the magician, indeed, was a member of the dark side; e.g., this may have lent some substance to the Inspector's anxiety about whose side he should have been on. In sum, taking away the mystery about Eisenheim the man and asking viewers to simply take for granted that the magician can do anything imaginable, we are left with a boring story with a predictable ending. That is not magic at all.",5,4,4,22 January 2007
Cold War," Entertaining If Overrated
","European films used to be made in B&W with limited dialog not necessarily out of choice but because of lack of better resources. COLD WAR is made that way to ...., well, look like those old films. Not in itself a fault but COLD WAR does not come close to the artistic level of European endeavors in and around the '60's. There's no background to the main characters that might make me sympathetic or intrigued with the plot changes; some brief moments in the beginning might have achieved such. I can accept a film's huge shifts in time and setting but in COLD WAR the pace is too erratic. Again, why not throw in just moments to cover the in-between years. The ending of COLD WAR is simply too dramatic and abrupt but, worse, wholly inconsistent with the characters portrayed. I know I'm a curmudgeon.

The Dark Knight," Depends on Your Definition of 'Film', 'Cinema', etc.
","My sister goes to the 'movies' and wants to munch popcorn and be thrilled, scared or laugh to extremes. I go to the 'cinema' and want to be impressed, provoked or mesmerized. She's down to earth. My head's in the clouds. She knows herself pretty well. I'm constantly 'redefining'. With her you get what you see. I'm a bit of a chameleon. She loved THE DARK KNIGHT. I couldn't wait for it to end.Many excellent 'movie' things here. The protagonist/antagonist contrast was excellent. Ledger's Joker was truly fun to watch. The 'mood' and pace of the movie were consistent; i.e., always moving evenly without lulls or digressions (hard to do over 2.5 hours). Action sequences were well placed and often thrilling. Acting was very good (and also consistent; i.e. no one over the top). All above thanks to an excellent script and great directing. Not to mention the fine score and camera work.Batman is a comic book hero written for adolescents. Kudos to the movies that used comic book dialogue, pace, music, etc. to bring comic book effect to the screen; e.g., the first Superman, the first Spiderman,the first Batman, etc. Its not a sin to exaggerate the comic book and create a hybrid monster replacing comic book dialogue, brevity, etc.,with Hollywood-enhanced scripting, music, technology, etc. Certainly it makes for great entertainment. But its not art.Farce is classical, sublime themes applied to ordinary, mundane subjects for strictly entertainment, usually melodramatic or comical, effect. A comic book hero is an ordinary subject. No matter how much you multiply the noise, sharpen the action, use clever dialogue, etc., its still farce. Its a credit to comic books that they started many of us to reading beyond empty HARDY BOYS fare (so did MAD magazine). Truly our comic books INTRODUCED us to themes, conflicts, ambiguity, etc., that we hadn't yet experienced. After all, we were twelve years old. I took my 12 year old son to TDK. Had a burger at Red Robin beforehand. I had a lot of fun the first 90 minutes of the film then became very tired (had a long day). My boy loved the movie and I'm so glad he did. Certainly he will move on to elevated levels, maybe become a writer. He will remember TDK like I remembered THE TIME MACHINE. I hope TDK is celebrated like KING KONG, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, ET, etc. Lets not confuse it with CITIZEN KANE, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES, MIDNIGHT COWBOY, etc. I guess it all depends who you want to go to the movies with, me or my sister.",7,1,2,25 July 2008
Into the Wild," Excellent Though Flawed
","I don't blame Sean Penn for not attempting to 'do' Krakauer's book. What made the book so interesting was the author's investigation and guesswork about where McCandless was at given points of time and what he must have been thinking of therein (Chris' notes were nowhere near a diary let alone a narrative of his story). Such might make a good documentary but might not be much in the way of drama. Still, this film inherits Jon K's best intentions toward our young hero. In this sense, both the book and the movie share the celebration of reckless, idealistic but well intentioned youth - along with all its folly, stubbornness, narcissism, etc. Kudos for not going overboard on anti-cultural, ecological themes. Might have been a four star affair if it had left out the 'bad-parents-made-me-do-it' motif.",8,0,1,21 March 2008
Elysium," Disappointing
","Hailed as this Summer's break-though extravaganza may not be saying much in a season of big budget flops. ELYSIUM has received a fair amount of critical acclaim and, yes, it has better acting, plot, writing, etc., than many films of it's ilk. But in the end ELYSIUM is just another post-apocalyptic survival movie. Matt Damon, presently risking over-exposure, does his usual fine role. Jody Foster is perfectly cast and wonderful in her role but her demise is premature and extremely disappointing. The 'baddie' character is ill defined and, frankly, unnecessary. The fight scenes are chock full of the now-overused 'jerky camera' technique. But again, I was led to believe there was something 'special' about ELYSIUM but in the end we've the same populist tripe: Poor is good and virtuous, Wealth is evil and a conspiracy NOTE: Diego Luna is just a treat and would have been better cast in the chief of the resistance role rather than killed off so early.",6,4,8,20 August 2013
Avatar," Fooey to the Bad Reviewers
","For some reason I decided to read the 'Hated It' comments before writing my own. Almost without exception this pompous crowd opined that AVATAR was merely 'eye candy' and nothing else; e.g., so-so script, acting, storyline, ending, etc.'Eye candy' has been an feature of film for awhile now, only somewhere about 100 years, when audiences gasped at the moon beings in ' A TRIP TO THE MOON'. It was certainly scary candy to the early 20th century viewers who ran out of the theater when the train directly approached them on screen. We were still eating movie 'candy' when the Mighty Kong climbed the Empire State Building. The rubber suited creatures in 'THE TIME MACHINE' had me afraid for weeks. I also caught a buzz on the film that journeyed into the human body in a yellow submarine, certainly a thoughtless piece of fluff. Personally my ignorance is demonstrated by having loved, at 12 years old, a'JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH' and other Jules Verne adaptations, not to mention just about any other flick starring dinosaurs, space creatures and dudes from beyond the grave.I might also point out an relatively unknown director named Steve Spielberg who has produced an abundance of mediocre fodder full of tricks and sentimental effects that captivated and pulled tears from a sap like me. It seems you cerebral brainiacs see right through those gimmicks that have me leaving the theater with tears and/or smiles.Why, I should've told my kids to dry those eyes and/or wipe those smiles off their faces and get down to some serious business!Message to the snob egghead crowd who believe themselves above a jolly good time. Stay home. Most of us wouldn't enjoy meeting you anyway. Apparently you were born 30 years old, infertile and over educated. If by some some chance you academics managed to actually parent a pre-teen who you took to the movies and who remained enthralled by AVATAR for the rest of the day, be sure to sit him/her down and instruct your son/daughter that such was just industry junk. I'm sure he/she will be the better for it.PS: To you nerds who believe me a complete idiot, Read some of my reviews on low budget domestic dramas and other stuff. You see, I really want to pretend I'm as smart as you guys. But you know better because I liked AVATAR.",10,34,65,2 January 2010
The Legend of 1900," Could Have Been So Much More
","This flick is enthralling and makes you both laugh and cry. The original and risk-taking 'plot' (maybe 'premise' would be a better word) immediately engage the viewer. The photography is lush, the script jaunty and punchy and the acting superb. Either the rolling piano or duel scenes alone are worth more than many movies in their entirety. But the flaw of 1900 is that we are not given enough to justify 1900's decision to remain on the Virginian. This might have been accomplished by having more scenes with 1900 interacting with the the crew and passengers (instead of just espousing his unexplained insight regarding them). It would have helped immensely too if we could have learned why 1900 developed such passion for the piano, which could have been better developed as an allegory to his life. Please don't get me wrong. If this film had contained the features I desire, it may stand as one of the all time greats. But as it is its merely a wonderful, excellent film.",8,1,3,11 June 2008
The Fountain," An Unfortuneate Miss
","Loved Pi and Requiem for a Dream. Read TIME's favorable review and rented this with lofty expectations. Sorely disappointed.Looking over all these private reviews, most folk either loved or hated this film. I am sympathetic to both camps. The film was a visual beauty and sad even if you were struggling to figure things out. On the other hand, there were tons of plot details thrown in demanding consideration but making little sense.Clearly, the Inquisition/Conquistador portion is Izzi's book and the space bubble travel is the end - or part - of the sequence. But did Tom write the ending?; i.e., 'finish it'? If so, why does Izzi appear in the bubble; e.g., she cannot be a character in her own book! When does Tom learn to accept death? Upon HIS death? He surely has no change of heart during his lifetime and shows no inclination to 'finish' the book! Why does the Mayan priest, a character in Izzi's book see, acknowledge, etc., Tom the Space Traveler as 'Father'? For the first two-thirds of the film, I was struggling with a plot idea that this was science fantasy or science fiction. Since Tom Scientist has found a magical South American substance I was justified in thinking the 'Tree of Life' would become a physical plot devise and its transport in space was akin to the slab in 2001 Space Oddessey. Also that Izzi has actually been the Queen of Spain and lived 450 years before writing an autobiographical book and, finally, acknowledging that death is part of life and accepting such. Tom Scientist's discovery of the magical substance and his obsession with such supports this idea. This, ultimately, does not appear to be Aranosky's intent, though it is a no less cohesive take on what Darin DID have in mind.I can believe some of the user reviews mentioning that film audiences audibly groaned at some points and/or laughed at parts were such was not intended. Mr. Aranosky should not dismiss such reactions, nor the cry that the film is confusing. That is poor film making. On the upbeat, this guy has made some excellent films and certainly will do such again.",6,2,5,4 December 2007
Crazy Heart," So Well Executed
","The keys to this movie are restraint and redemption. It would have been so easy to overdo a character, a scene, a theme, etc. But Bad Blake is not too crazy or wild. Maggie, Colin and Duvalls'characters are just laid back enough to seem genuine. Consider that the fans, sidemen, etc. are given lines and time enough to be authentic (usually the moron masses are treated like props). Its not some dramatic climax or epiphany that turns Bad Blake, its just him discovering what we've been watching for an hour or so. For that reason C-H is not so much an anti-alcohol film as it is about human redemption.Yes the set up is very much like TENDER MERCIES, which has Duvall struggling with recovery. C-H is about redemption. Very different themes.",9,2,3,13 March 2010
The Reader," Should Have Tweaked the Novel
","Wow, what a performance by Kate Winslet. Kudos to the author of the underlying novel for such an original and interesting plot and devices. But I couldn't help wishing to fill in what I felt were missing or weak plot lines. The story centers on; i.e., is essentially about Hanna and her struggle with her disability, Might have been useful to flash back to the war tragedy to depict Hanna's handicap as impacting on her circumstances; e.g. certainly, because of her illiteracy, her occupations called for rote tasks and blind routine (Query: Didn't she leave her ticket punching job because she knew she couldn't handle the promotion?). To see what happened when the prisoners died shouldn't exonerate Hanna but could strongly support her life long agony with her disability. Also, her suicide appeared vague in purpose, although I believe I understand it as her reluctance to face the challenge of the world with her -though now less severe- reading problem.Why so much nudity? Certainly was only a limited factor in the story. Could've made it a PG-13 and I'd have taken my 11 year old son.I complain too much. This was a fine movie.",8,1,1,21 January 2009
Sherlock Holmes," Sherlock Holmes Becomes Batman
","I took my three kids to see this movie and we had a good time. But as their dad I can read their true reactions; i.e., 'good' has several meanings, degrees, shades, etc., and I don't believe they thought it was anything special, extraordinary, etc. My problem was it just was not a Sherlock Holmes film, what with the extraordinary action scenes, the mild humor, and, especially, the diabolical plot line of taking over the world. Not to mention Holmes never had anything approaching a romantic interest.I understand the argument that the film introduced Sherlock Holmes to a new audience and needed some 'jazzing up' to compete with other films. But for those of us who grew up with Basil Rathbone playing Holmes, the subtlety, nuance, and suspense was entirely missing.Next up, Vigil Mortessen plays Tarzan as Spiderman.",6,7,13,28 December 2009
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," But For Excess A Contender
","It is difficult for a film to live up to the amount of critical hype ascribed to BIRDMAN. I certainly cannot say I didn't enjoy the film, I don't want to offer some pretentious insight and I'm certainly not a seasoned theater or movie critic. Allow me to lay it on the line in a straightforward manner: BM should have stuck to Keaton's character entirely; e.g., without the scenes containing daughter, girlfriends, etc. The film could have done well without the weird 'powers' - we get the point that Riggan THINKS he's superhuman, all the mind-over-matter tossing about is distracting. The film would have been fine coming in around 85 minutes, trimming the underwear walk and two of it's three endings. In a nutshell, the makers have a smart product in BM and with discipline and restraint could have easily walked away with this year's Oscar. As it stands, BM gives new definition to ostentatious.",8,1,8,9 December 2014

50_50," Unpretentious and Thoughtful
","We enjoyed this movie for what it was: An examination of the impact of a life-altering event upon an everyday person with minimal melodrama and without the need for any extraordinary plot devices. I was not familiar with Mr. Gordon-Levitt (my children knew him well) but was very impressed as he seemed to detect the tone needed; e.g., he could have easily over-acted in one or more scenes but held back to perfect effect. Both Miss Howard (whose acting I'd never liked before) and Miss Kendrick played their roles perfectly and a big hats off to the 'dad' character (a tough role when you think about it!). I could have used a different 'friend' than Rogan; e.g;. one less designed for comic relief. But Seth was great in the 'I nailed you!' scenes. Good movie.",8,1,2,13 October 2011
Cloud Atlas," A Most Silly Movie
","Scratch beneath the thin pretentious surface of this film and there is absolutely nothing but routine psychobabble about how 'we are all connected', 'we all serve a purpose', 'overcome your fears', yadda-yadda-yadda... Shave off an hour or so of CLOUD ATLAS and it's pure glitz and style are entertaining enough. Add the extra minutes and the film becomes groan inducing (I actually heard a few groans from my cinema seat). One might think that with so much time that CLOUD ATLAS could convey its message subtly, with events and indirect dialog. No chance. We get many instances in which characters 'preach' the message of the film as if to say, 'Hey, let's take a time out so we can explain what this film is about.' My bad. I should have known better. The guys who made this movie made the MATRIX nonsense. People (meaning 14 year old geeks) who liked the MATRIX don't go see THE KING'S SPEECH or THE MASTER. I've no one to blame but myself. PS/ Tom Hanks? Let me say this differently: Tom Hanks?",4,9,24,31 October 2012
Inside Llewyn Davis," Profoundly Disappointing
","The Greenwich Village music scene in the early '60's, by identity a folk revival but really a confluence of so many things; e.g., youthful angst, atomic fears, academia, neo-beat, etc., was full of vitality and greatly influenced the anti-war movement, not to mention the hippie era and the evolution of folk rock. ILD is sadly lacking in anything informing or uplifting and instead offers us a melancholy, older and less articulate Holden Caufield. There are several scenes in the film showing the title character performing well but show me just thirty seconds where Llewyn is depicted as loving - or even liking - music itself. Rather, Llewyn is totally self-absorbed when not pre-occupied with finding a couch to sleep on. One gets the feeling that LD would grab any diversion available and folk music just happens to be the one that is there. The 'cat' subplot is not only pointless but thoroughly annoying. The talented Cohen brothers are in a funk and throwing up (pun intended) well crafted junk. Forget the accolades for ILD. It's mediocre stuff. PS / Dave Van Ronk, allegedly a loose model for the ILD mainc haracter, was an exceptional guitarist; e.g., performing such Scot Joplin instrumentals as THE ENTERTAINER and MAPLE LEAF RAG. The guitar playing in ILD is given zero reverence and I'm sure it was T-Bone Burnett's idea to have the professor friend own a Sears Silvertone to contrast the Martins and Gibsons.",5,17,33,15 January 2014
Her," Enchanting and Thought Provoking
","Such an enjoyable examination of the essence of love, loss, infatuation and reconciliation. Although legitimate science fiction is the plot vehicle, we soon come to understand that such is, indeed, a mere tool for a study of the irrational, infuriating and all-consuming thing we call L-O-V-E. Spike Jones does a fantastic job of getting just the right amount of temper and tone from his actors and his scenes and by no means does this suggest HER is a low-key movie. Mr. Phoenix continues to impress, this time with the ability to pay a character who is, well...., normal. No small feat after having to play Freddie Q. in THE MASTER! Same assessment of Amy Adams, though it must have been just as hard bottling her beauty to play an office drone. HER only suffers by it's whiff of Southern California mindset; e.g., 'We must all follow our personal muse!'. To the contrary, one can live a life of duty and service and still be struck by Cupid's arrow. Nevermind. L-O-V-E is not picky and plucks it's beneficiaries/victims from every walk of life.",9,0,1,28 February 2014
The Great Gatsby," F. Scott Would've Been Proud
","I'm betting many of the COMMENTers herein as well as the Rotten-Tomato critics didn't read the book nor know much about the American Roaring '20's and/or the nature of FSF's popularity therein. It seems to me that many of those that didn't like this new film version of THE GREAT GATSBY fail to consider that maybe they don't like FSF's sentiments. point-of-view, etc., in the first place. In other words, this film may very successfully capture a book, an era and a writer that some viewers simply hold in disdain. In such case, why blame the movie?I concede that the party scenes are over the top. The idea was to display the abandon, recklessness and greed overtaking a new class of Americans at that time. FSF was a proponent of such people. His critics, myself included, argue that he was a sycophant to such folk, displaying a puppy-dog loyalty to their whims and anxieties and mistakenly trying to distinguish their petty domestic squabbles as classical tragedy instead of the mundane human failures they actually were. But FSF wrote so beautifully and whether or not his concerns were misplaced his passion can neither be denied nor unappreciated. He did so by writing simply yet eloquently. Above all he relied on description and evocation of mood, with -unlike Hemingway and other contemporaries- using a bare minimum of dialog. In such case he poetically and beautifully paints an era and it's longings even if he thought he was doing something else. This new version of TGG does a fine job of doing what FSF attempted to do. Indeed, the characters say relatively little regarding their actual desires and absolutely nothing regarding their times, their excesses, etc. That the wild parties, NYC landscapes and non-major cast is done in almost-cartoon fashion seems fitting, as it isolates the main characters and their cloistered lives. F. Scot and Zelda would have loved to see this move almost as much as they'd like partying at the Oscars.",Null,4,7,12 May 2013
