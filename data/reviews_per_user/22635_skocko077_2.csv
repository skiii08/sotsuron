The Lives of Others," Stunning
","This is a movie which makes you think different about people. Story about position of artists in socialistic societies, friendship, love, and most important- about moral. Would you sacrifise whole your career because of someone you dont even know? Because you feel you are doing the right thing? Truth is the most wanted thing in this world, but yet so often unwanted. One man realises that, watching lives of others, he doesent have his own. There are a lot of good people around us, and you can find them in places you wolud never expect to. This movie shows that to us. One of the most important things which I evaluate about movies- this movie keeps your attenition from the beginning to the end. Brilliant acting, scenario, intense emotions. One of my favorites that I have seen in late time, for sure.",10,0,1,12 January 2019
