Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Offensive, Crude and Wrong...I Loved It!
","The Joe Cool Experience: Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan(2006) Starring: Sacha Baron Cohen as Borat Sagdiyev and Ken Davitian as Azamat Bagatov Plot: A reporter from Kazakhstan journeys to American to make a documentary. He quickly tours the United States, falls in love with Pamela Anderson, and offends many people in the process.Openers: First of all, I have not see Da Ali G Show, or any of Baron Cohen's previous characters. I only know him from his role in Talledega Nights. So I went into this pretty uninitiated, having only the trailers(which made me laugh) to go on. Oh and the hype from everyone. Did it live up to the hype? Was Borat indeed one of the funniest movies ever made? The Good: The answer is a resounding YES. This movie is so offensive to so many people, and that's what makes it hilarious. Sometimes you just have to take a step back and not take things so seriously. Not only is the character of Borat funny, but what's especially funny(and shocking) is how the people he talks to actually act. The rednecks at the rodeo, the bigots at the dinner party, even the frat boys all have flaws that are exposed. Maybe that's why they all hate the makers now. They feel they were made to look stupid, and they were, but it wasn't anyone's fault but their own. And I laughed at their stupidity. In addition to the smarter humor of exposing people's ignorance, there is plenty of stupid humor and gross-out jokes for those who like that. And the offensive jokes keep coming. I like the fact that no one is safe. The south, Jews, mentally handicapped, women, Christians, etc, etc. Everyone gets made fun of as Borat is an equal-opportunity offender. The movie is also very quotable, and will stay with you when it's over. Sacha Baron Cohen gives an excellent performance as Borat, who is sure to join the upper echelon of comedic characters.The Bad: The offensiveness can also be a bad thing if you don't like that sort of humor. It may feel a little out of line, but really, once you accept the fact that it's just a movie and not meant to be taken seriously, you may find yourself laughing. You may feel terrible for laughing, but you will laugh.The Ugly: Borat and Azamat wrestle around, chase each other and beat each other up in the nude. With a rubber fist. About as gross as it sounds. Plus there's quite a few penis and scrotum shots and that's just never nice to look at.Final Verdict: With lots of good, and not that much bad...Borat takes it's place as one of the funniest films I've ever seen. All the critics can say whatever they want, but I say that I highly recommend this film, but with a warning: Go in with an open mind, and prepare to be assaulted.Rating: ****1/2 of *****",Null,3,6,15 November 2006
Catch Me If You Can," Really good movie.
","Starring:Leonardo DiCaprio as Frank Abagnale, Jr. Tom Hanks as Carl Hanratty Christopher Walken as Frank William Abagnale, Sr. Martin Sheen as Roger StrongPlot: A true story about Frank Abagnale Jr. who, before his 19th birthday, successfully conned millions of dollars worth of checks as a Pan Am pilot, doctor, and legal prosecutor.Where to begin? I had heard nothing of this movie before I saw the trailer in theaters, and then just had to see it. How does, I wondered, a man become a pilot, a doctor and a lawyer all before his 19th birthday? And when it revealed it was based on true events I became even more interested. What was this story and why hadn't I heard about it? I checked it out and I was blown away.The best thing I think about this movie is the cast assembled. When you have a cast this good you are bound to deliver in terms of quality. DiCaprio, Hanks, Sheen and Walken all come through in their roles and DiCaprio especially blew me away. Before this I had known him as that guy in that chick flick that's set on a boat(which wasn't very good). When it came to playing a smart kid who knew how to con everyone, Leo brought the chops and put on a very engaging performance. Christopher Walken may whore himself out to a lot of movies just for a paycheck, but he does have what it takes and earned his Best Supporting nomination. Martin Sheen does well for the small amount of time we see him. Tom Hanks puts forth his best Boston accent but I don't think he brought it as he normally does.The story itself was a little different from the book(which I read later) but it was still pretty damn good. It hooks the audience right from the beginning with it's premise, and the fact that everything that transpires is (mostly) true keeps them hooked. Between the story and performances, and Spielberg working his usual magic, it all comes together for a strong movie. And again, Williams score always comes through. The title theme gets stuck in my head and I find myself humming it whenever I watch this.What did I not like? Well there were some, awkward moments. I myself felt like the entire Hanratty/Abagnale relationship didn't ring true and didn't really work at times. Whether it was because I didn't see any chemistry between Hanks and DiCaprio or the fact Hanratty is a mostly made-up character, it just didn't work for me. I also felt like Walken's character was just dumped after a strong show. I suppose that's how it actually happened but they wrote him out with one line and not much mourning on the part of Abagnale (who for some reason decides to escape as soon as he hears the news).But even though it's a flawed movie, it's still one of my favorites. If you haven't seen it, I recommend you do so. I don't really hear this movie mentioned in the same breath as Spielberg's other films and that's a shame because while this isn't one of his big budget blockbusters, it's a nice change of pace from all that. It shows that hey, he really can do something different(Schiendler's List aside). Go watch it.Rating: **** of *****",Null,1,3,30 August 2007
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Iconic, Timeless Classic
","Starring: Henry Thomas as Elliot Dee Wallace-Stone as Mary Robert MacNaughton as Michael Drew Barrymore as Gertie Peter Coyote as KeysSo it's safe to say this is one of my favorite movies ever. Any time I'm asked to list them, this ends up fairly high. Spielberg crafted what I feel is his ultimate masterpiece here, and that's coming from someone who was a dinosaur nerd growing up. At it's core, it's a basic story of friendship. A boy meets a strange alien and they soon form a bond. It's the kind of kids movie you don't see anymore, and yet this movie is great for all ages. If you're expecting me to say anything negative about this movie, back out now, because it just isn't going to happen.First of all, what would a movie this good be without a lovable cast? Henry Thomas brings it, even at this young age, as Elliot. He's one of the few kid actors who isn't annoying. Spielberg somehow had the uncanny ability to find child actors who didn't annoy you when it came to the main roles of his movies. Even Drew Barrymore is tolerable in this movie. The cast feels like a family, and relate to each other like one. Dee Wallace-Stone is great too, and the government officials look shady enough that you know not to trust them with ET.So you get to see what happens to this family once this alien visits Earth and decides to be friends with Elliot. The story also works on multiple levels. A story of friendship or a sci-fi tale. Some people even claim it's a religious allegory. I don't buy that but it proves to me that it works on multiple levels for different people. This movie also features iconic scenes, such as the famous flying bicycle ride in front of the moon. Another would be when the government finally shows up at Elliot's house, and they look very menacing in their biohazard suits. ET's goodbye, ET's memorable line, it's all here and it's all as wonderful as it was when it first came out. And with iconic scenes, I would be wrong not to bring up the terrific score by John Williams. Fits the movie perfectly.The man of the hour, ET, doesn't look too shabby himself. Back before they edited the thing with CGI, they used a puppet and animatronics to bring ET to life. And it worked. He moves, talks, displays emotion and acts like he were part of the cast. Why they needed to go back and fix him with CGI is just as puzzling as why Yoda became CG. It's not necessary, the effects they used in the eighties worked. As a kid, I totally bought that ET was real, and as an adult, I appreciate the work that went into making him so lifelike.That's another thing I love about this movie, it still holds up. Instead of showing my kids whatever new penguin movie gets churned out, I'm pulling out ET. It's still a great movie and still brings a certain magic to the screen that few movies can top. ET gets the full monty from me, and that's all there is to it. See this film if you haven't already.Rating: ***** of *****",Null,0,0,25 July 2007
Hostel," Disturbing and shocking film.
","Hostel(2005)Starring: Jay Hernandez as Paxton Derek Richardson as Josh Eythor Gudjonsson as Oli Jan Vlasak as The Dutch BusinessmanPlot: Three backpackers are making their way through Europe, partaking in the sex and drugs in countries like Amsterdam. They are soon told of a Slovakian city where they can pay for anything they want from the girls. They soon become victims of a group called 'Elite Hunting' in which innocent people are captured and then tortured and killed by paying customers. Hostel is an interesting movie. It is directed by Eli Roth, the guy who made Cabin Fever(a movie I loved). This movie had a lot of pressure to deliver I thought. They went and attached Quentin Tarantino's name to it as a producer, talked up how 'shocking' it was and made it seem like Horror's second coming. So naturally it had to deliver or would be considered a huge disappointment, correct? Well I'm happy to report that despite being over-hyped, Hostel does come through and bring the goods in disturbing fashion.This movie lives up to it's exploitation image that the trailers were trying to portray, I thought. There's lots of partying in the beginning which equals lots of drug use and nudity in general. This lets your guard down for what happens later. The whole thing had a sense of dread throughout, especially in the beginning when the characters are having so much fun and you know that something bad is going to happen to them. Then when the horror finally hits we are treated to lots and lots of gore. Severed heads, slashes with scalpels, nasty cuts, severed fingers, cut up bodies, sick hammer shots in which we see a skull cave in, chainsaw action, severed leg, gunshots, people run over, lots of vomiting and more. I haven't even gone into the eyeball scene, which was just so gross it was unbelievable this got an R-cut. I find it odd how people complained about lack of gore when there was just enough in the right amounts here. So in terms of brutality it certainly lives up to how it was played up. None of the torture would mean a damn thing if we didn't care about who it was happening to. Jay Hernandez leads the pack with a good performance as Paxton. He looks genuinely terrified, as opposed to acting like it. And his character even has some decent back story which plays into the decisions he makes. Derek Richardson did good as Josh, and I liked his character. Eythor Gudjonsson played Oli well and he was pretty funny. How could you not love 'The King of the Swing'? Jan Vlasak was kind of creepy as the dutch businessman, but that was how he was supposed to be, so good job. The girls in this movie were hot, and that's pretty much all they were in there for. This movie has some flaws, however. Some of the comedy felt forced. That was part of Roth's problem in Cabin Fever, trying to inject comedy in certain situations where it just didn't work. And in the beginning, we are treated to lots of partying. Then more partying, and more and more and more. I get the fact they wanted to show that these guys are out to party but you know, it just seemed a tad bit repetitive. I wanted to get to what was advertised. Also I'd have to say that parts of the movie were a little predictable, and the ending was anti-climatic. Also, what was up with the kids? I really did not like having them in the movie as this little juvenile gang. Even if I did get where they were going with it, it felt pointless.Other than some hiccups here and there, Hostel does it's job well. It shocks and scares the audience and while it may have been over-hyped, it still lived up to most expectations I had for it. Plus in addition to being shocking this movie actually was pretty scary, as it sure made me never want to go backpacking in Europe...ever, and the audience I was with was definitely jumping when they needed to, and cringing in their seats during the torture scenes. I definitely recommend seeing it.Rating: ***1/2 out of *****",Null,0,0,9 January 2006
Spider-Man 2," Best Comic Book Movie Ever.
","Spider-Man 2(2004)Starring: Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson James Franco as Harry Osborn Alfred Molina as Dr. Otto Octavius/Dr. OctopusPlot: Peter's life as Spider-Man is taking it's toll on his life as Peter Parker. His grades are slipping, his jobs aren't going well and he can barely make ends meet. On top of all that, his long time love Mary Jane is getting married to John Jameson because he can't make a commitment to her. And on top of all of *that*, Dr. Otto Octavius has an experiment go wrong which grafts four additional arms to his body, making him Dr. Octopus. Spidey's life is about to get rougher.So I sat down in my theater for something, I can't remember what, and all of a sudden I see Peter Parker on the screen. I knew immediately what was following. A scene from Spider-Man 2, featuring Doc Ock. As with my feelings when the original came out, I know also got to see a favorite villain of mine hit the screen. So this one had something new to it, in addition to being a sequel to one of my favorite movies of 2002.In a word, this movie is the best comic adaptation ever. No question about it. Batman Begins runs a very close second, but Spider-Man 2 is flawless, in my opinion. And now I'll tell you why.First of all, the story continues to amaze. You continue to feel for Peter and it's like we never left these characters when the movie gets going. The actors bring something new to the roles again instead of just playing on what they had to go on from the original. If there's a new aspect of a character's life, they play it. The main and supporting cast continue to shine in their roles, as they have grown more comfortable in them. We even get some surprise cameos from Cliff Robertson(Uncle Ben) and Willem Dafoe(Green Goblin)!Secondly, we get the wonderful Alfred Molina being cast and playing perfectly Doc Ock. Not only that, but he's far more fleshed out than the comics ever thought about making him. That's right, this would be the second time Sam Raimi improved on the source material(the first being natural web-shooters...yes, I said it). Doc Ock was a bad guy, and you wanted Spidey to win, but it clearly wasn't that simple. He was developed and you knew exactly why he was doing what he was doing, and it wasn't just because he was bad.Third, the Spider-Man: No More story was here, in full! It's one of the comic's best stories, and they don't fail to adapt it here. Also, Peter's love of Mary Jane grows more complicated, as he can't seem to decide between making himself happy and being Spider-Man. Finally, the visual effects and action sequences improve on the original and there's more to see. It's all about the train fight. That scene alone was well worth the money spent to see this(twice!)Spider-Man 2 is still my favorite comic-book adaptation, and also one of my favorite movies ever. It's just an amazing film and a movie I can watch over and over and never get tired of it. Highest Recommendation.Rating: ***** of *****",Null,0,0,4 May 2007
Hot Fuzz," Great Movie!
","Hot Fuzz(2007)Starring: Simon Pegg as Sgt. Nicholas Angel Nick Frost as PC Danny Butterman Timothy Dalton as Simon Skinner Jim Broadbent as Inspector Frank ButtermanPlot: After making the entire London police service(they can't say 'force') look bad, Sgt Nicholas Angel is transfered to Sandford. This is a small little town where the biggest thing to happen is the swan escapes. But soon there appear to be very grisly accidents that Angel is convinced are actually murder. Can he persuade his bumbling staff and new partner to see things his way, and save the day?I was looking forward to this ever since it was announced. Shaun of the Dead was a hilarious spin on the zombie genre and I really wanted to see what these guys could do with the meandering buddy cop genre. All I can say is bravo. This movie not only was as good as Shaun of the Dead, it surpassed it. But before I talk about what's wrong with this movie, let me get into it's flaws, because yes, there are some. Mainly, this movie runs two hours long and close to the middle there is a noticeable lag in things happening. The movie really could have used a trim here and there to tighten up the pace of the movie. And that's really the only problem I had with this movie. It was just too long and stretched out.Now onto everything else. WOW. Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg have done a completely wonderful job in bringing this movie to life. The characters are all completely three-dimensional, which is something that buddy cop movies lack anyway. In addition to that, Pegg and Nick Frost actually bring some acting to their roles and both handle them well. Pegg was hilarious, even though he was supposed to be the straight-man, in playing the tough by-the-book cop. Frost plays his sidekick role to perfection. And the supporting cast all have their roles to play and they do so wonderfully. Another thing I loved about this movie? Edgar Wright chooses NOT to go the PC route. There's lots of gore(including a brilliant impaling scene), and the gore itself is almost over the top with how much blood comes from these deaths. In addition to that, we get swearing priests, a mentally-handicapped guy named 'Lurch' and old ladies get kicked in the head. It's all hilarious and works very well. The final thirty minutes are great, but would be nothing if not for everything that led to them. With the well-written script and well-acted characters, something else is very present. The use of foreshadowing. Pay attention to things said or done in earlier parts of the movie and it makes it that much better when they are used in that last half hour. Which by the way, is very action packed. I'd argue it's more action-packed and executed better than a lot of the genre fare that is out there today. While also throwing out lots of references to films within this genre(such as Point Break and Bad Boys II). Hot Fuzz is definitely the funniest movie I've seen this year, and it's also a good action movie on top of it. I think we can pretty much agree when Pegg, Wright and Frost work together it's gold. I recommend you see this as soon as possible.Rating: ****1/2 of *****",Null,0,0,17 May 2007
Constantine," Decent little action/horror flick
","The Joe Cool Review For Constantine(2005) Starring: Keanu Reeves as John Constantine, Rachel Weisz as Angela Dodson, Shia LeBeouf as Chas, Gavin Rossdale as Balthazar, and Tilda Swinton as Gabriel Plot: John Constantine, a man who smokes like cigarettes are going out of style and generally has a 'don't care' attitude is a supernatural detective who performs exorcisms and sends demons back to hell. He soon learns of a plot for Satan's son to conquer the earth and only he can stop it.Openers: First off, let me say I have not read any stories of Hellblazer or Constantine before seeing this movie. Constantine is originally based on a DC/Vertigo comic book. Apparently that John Constantine is blond and British. So he's not Keanu Reeves. I don't see a problem but that's just me. Anyway let's get to the review.The Good: The best thing about Constantine(and I'm going to get crap for this) was Keanu. The man nailed the part and made Constantine look like a severely cool dude, who won't take crap from anyone and just has his own general problems too. Mainly he's trying to buy his way into Heaven by sending demons to Hell. Because he committed suicide and that's against the rules so he's doomed to go Hell, thanks to the lung cancer(does not stop smoking though). Keanu takes this role and makes it his own. I can't say I related, but I felt for the guy and wanted to see something, anything, good happen to him in the end. But Keanu's not carrying the movie on his shoulders. He's got some talent supporting him. Rachel Weisz carries herself well as Angela. She had a good chemistry with Constantine that thankfully didn't fall into the a-typical 'lead guy and lead girl fall in love' category. Shia LeBeouf surprised me as Chas, mainly because I'm used to seeing him in family-oriented stuff. He did well and I liked his character. Constantine also had the dreary look and feel to it. Hell looked GREAT. Well, in terms of the effects and the look in general...not saying I'd want to stay there. The movie had it's fair share of gore too: A bashed in demon head, organs ripped out of ones body, blood, disintegrating demons and a slit wrist. Special considerations go to Djimon Hounsou(Midnite) and Peter Stormare(Lucifer, Satan, The Devil, etc) for bringing life to their roles when they were on screen. Who knew Satan was a funny guy? The Bad: Tilda Swinton was pretty bad as Gabriel. First off, isn't Gabriel supposed to be a guy? Not that it matters. I just didn't like her character even before I found out more about her. The CGI, while when it small doses was effective got to be a little much. For example Constantine performing an exorcism and seeing a demon in the mirror, the demon looked a little cartoon-like. Same with the ones in Hell. They worked best hidden in shadow. Also seeing a blown off chuck of face talk isn't exactly what I'd call good. Plus running in at 2 hours, this movie can tend to drag or repeat itself in spots.The Ugly: Gavin Rossdale(Yes, THAT Gavin Rossdale, of Bush fame) seemed kind of, well, gay as Balthazar. But maybe that's how the character was supposed to come off('Finger licking good!'). He hammed it up the entire time he was on screen and left me shaking my head. Unintentional comedy at it's finest.Final Verdict: Overall, Constantine was a fun ride and I'd gladly pay to see it again.Rating: **** of *****",Null,3,6,9 December 2005
Brokeback Mountain," Good, But Not Classic Love Story
","The Joe Cool Review: Brokeback Mountain(2005) Starring: Heath Ledger as Ennis del Mar, Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack Twist, Michelle Williams as Alma, and Anne Hathaway as Lureen Newsome Plot: Two cowboys work a summer job at Brokeback Mountain, and forge a close personal relationship. Their secretive bond goes on for many years and affects not only themselves but those around them. Based on the story by E. Annie Proulx.Opener: First of all, if you haven't heard of this movie, you've probably lived under a rock for the past year. This little love story about two guys, caused quite a stir amongst people in 2005. Whether it was the political agendas, religions ones, homosexuals demanding rights or even something as trivial as the results of the Academy Awards, controversy surrounded this movie. Brokeback Mountain, I will boldly say, is probably the most controversial film since The Passion of the Christ. But the big question is that if you take away all the hype, all the politics and everything, does Brokeback Mountain equal a great film? The Good: Ang Lee has one thing going for him. He knows how to direct. Which is good, because of the fact he's a director. There are some beautiful visuals of them in the wilderness, and the story itself is molded together to form a well-directed film that I'm sure will be considered Ang Lee's visual masterpiece. Heath Ledger gives a great performance here as Ennis, who is obviously conflicted by his relationship with Jack and paranoid that he'll be caught by those around him. He works well with his co-stars and the result is a performance that was deserving of it's Oscar nomination. Not to mention he managed to create a voice for Ennis that sounds nothing like himself. Anne Hathaway should also be noted, because between this and Havoc she's really showing her acting chops as far as being outside of kiddie films. She's not in this movie that much because it's not really about her character, but you can tell she's ready for bigger and better things. Michelle Williams also does a good job as Alma.The Bad: Two things really hinder this movie from being a 'classic'. One is the character of Jack Twist. Not exactly Jake's performance of him, just the way the character was written. He just seems over-the-top at times, and really annoying. Not only that but the casting was all wrong as I don't buy him as a roughneck cowboy for a second, even with the mustache. The other thing that really hurt this film was it's first half. The entire time it showed them at Brokeback Mountain the first time, was extremely dull. It seemed like all they were doing was herding sheep and eating beans, with just a little bit of, 'Oh I love you let's have sex' thrown in to get the point across. It took forever to get to that point. Luckily the second half picked up or else my opinion of this movie would not nearly be as favorable.The Ugly: Nothing in the movie really, unless you're seriously offended by the subject matter. In which case, why would you be reading a review of it or thinking about watching it? The Verdict: Brokeback Mountain is a good film, probably in the upper echelon of the 2005 films. The controversy and everything probably over-hyped it to the point where some people think it's better than it actually is. It's good, but nowhere near the 'eye-opening' classic people are claiming it to be. I still recommended to anyone who appreciates a good love story, or a good film.Rating: ***1/2 of *****",Null,3,18,28 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Doesn't reach greatness of the original, or the blandness of it's sequel
","Pirates of the Caribbean 3: At World's End(2007)Starring: Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow Keira Knightly as Elizabeth Swann Orlando Bloom as Will Turner Geoffery Rush as Barbossa Chow Yun Fat as Sao FengI sat down ready to finally watch some Pirates after being left on a cliffhanger for a year(which really wasn't a cliffhanger because they gave away what happens in the trailers). I really enjoyed the first Pirates movie. The second movie fell a little flat with me, but I still enjoyed it. Would this new one go the way of the second, the first, or just be terrible? I was ready to find out.First thing that should be mentioned is the length and tons of plot lines that are throughout this movie. The trilogy really needed an epic finish and that's what happened here. Everything is resolved, all the alliances are finally in place for good, and everything that needs to go down does. This movie is very good at taking all of the things the first and second movies set up, and not only playing off of them but giving them some resolution. I do have some small complaints. First of all, new characters are introduced and then don't have much screen time. Long time characters are killed off(I won't say which ones) after not much screen time themselves. There just wasn't time to explain anything, as they had to keep the movie going, even though it was close to three hours. Some of the dragging parts could have been taken out to develop more, or at least don't introduce the new characters in the first place.My biggest complaint would be that Jack Sparrow is just there now. He was the life of Curse of the Black Pearl, and he started to wear thin in Dead Man's Chest but not quite. It just seems like they could have left him dead and the movie wouldn't have been any different. He doesn't add anything. It's not Johnny Depp's fault, it's the screenwriters. They took an interesting character and made him comic relief. But he's really the only one of the main characters that isn't developed more. At first I hated what that did with Will Turner(Orlando Bloom) in that he really cares only about himself in this movie, but then I realized he finally made the transformation into a full-fledged pirate. Keira Knightly shines here, as her character has transformed from naive to cunning. Even some of the minor characters like Tia Dalma or Davy Jones get more development. Which, going back to my initial complaint, means everyone but Sparrow has something to do.There's wasn't any need for character development or plot exposition, because we know all these characters already so we're ready for a movie that's mostly action-packed. And when the action happens, it's great. A cannon battle while swirling around a maelstrom, lots of sword fights, explosions, and of course Jack Sparrow vs Davy Jones on the top of the ship in a storm. It's all well done and works together. Plus it still has the humor and bizarre scenes that these movies are known for. The special effects help this out a lot and bring these battles to life.Overall, Pirates 3 is something that needed the plot and length, which is something most were complaining about. Those elements actually help, and make this movie epic. While it's not without it's faults, At World's End is still a fun romp at the movies that everyone who liked the first two are sure to enjoy.Rating: ***1/2 of *****",Null,1,2,1 June 2007
Spider-Man 3," Fails to live up to expectations but still very entertaining
","Spider-Man 3(2007)Starring: Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson James Franco as Harry Osborn/The New Goblin Topher Grace as Eddie Brock/Venom Thomas Haden Church as Flint Marko/The SandmanPlot: In a complete reversal of the beginning of Spider-Man 2, Peter Parker's life is looking up! He finally has Mary Jane, Spider-Man is loved by the city of New York, and he's not doing too bad with his money problems. All that is ready to change, however, when a mysterious symbiote from space attaches itself to him. This gives him a new black suit, and a new outlook on life. Suddenly it enhances his darker qualities and he has to find a way to get rid of it. It doesn't help matters when there are three guys hunting for him: His best friend Harry, The Sandman, and later on, Venom.It's been three long years since I've last been on an adventure with Spider-Man. Needless to say, the wait has been long and the excitement was at a fever pitch as I sat down to a midnight showing ready to finally see Spider-Man again. Not just that, but Venom! Everyone loves Venom and to see him on the screen hopefully would be a worthwhile experience. Was it?I'll start on this with the flaws first, to get them out of the way. Raimi seems to have lost a step since Spider-Man 2. Not that I blame him, because after releasing a film that good, I can see how it would be hard to please the audience that well again. He tried to do this by over-filling the movie with a multitude of plots and villains and in the end it seems kind of crowded. The new villains aren't nearly as fleshed out as previously because there simply wasn't time, so caring about them is a little harder than last time.This movie also has the disadvantage of some silliness. There are some lines, and some moments in the movie where I'm not quite sure what they were trying to accomplish. Why does Mary Jane sing? Why is Peter, under the influence of the suit or not, dancing around like a fool? It just seemed unnecessary and I didn't see the point of it at all. The comedy in the first two was intentional but kept to a minimum(Jameson, etc) but here it felt like they were trying too hard to keep the comedy in what should have been a darker movie.When this movie does grasp it's dark roots, it works. Peter Parker, the jerk, is completely what he needed to be and Tobey pulls off a great job in making him that way. The subtle things like smashing Brock's camera or even the bigger things like attacking Harry do a much better job than some odd dance number thrown in. It's obvious they chose this story for the 'Battle Within' subplot and they pull it off here, especially because Tobey is a credible actor and does what is needed and more.The rest of the cast are clearly comfortable in their roles and so they have no more effort to play them, but they still do a good job. JK Simmons returns again and he's always welcome(it's all about that scene with marketing the Bugle), and Bruce Campbell(making his third cameo in a completely unrelated role) is hilarious too. Thomas Haden Church was limited as The Sandman, but because of his abilities he is able to create sympathy(almost out of spite, it seemed) and Topher Grace plays Eddie Brock, and his alter-ego Venom very well(in spite of limited screen-time).While I am mad that Venom isn't on nearly as much as I would like, he still looks great and Topher made him work. I think we'll see him again, in Spider-Man 4(And if you paid attention, you'd understand why). I love the fact they kept in certain aspects to the character, like his weakness, and the fact that he doesn't trigger Peter's Spider-Sense, as well as his origin.The special effects and action sequences were good here again, including a battle royale at a construction site that just takes the cake. You know where the budget went? That final battle. There are so many hard shots and effects there that I can't imagine how much work went into it. Any problems that I had with the movie melted away as that last scene made it worth sitting through silly dancing and singing.Overall, Spider-Man 3 may be the weakest of the series, but that does not mean it was a bad movie. It was still worthwhile, the action was great and I very much enjoyed myself. BRING ON SPIDER-MAN 4!Rating: ***1/2 of *****",Null,2,4,4 May 2007
Zodiac," Great Portrayal of the Zodiac Investigation
","The Joe Cool Experience: Zodiac(2007)Starring: Jake Gyllenhaal as Robert Graysmith Mark Ruffalo as Inspector David Toschi Anthony Edwards as Inspector William Armstrong Robert Downey Jr as Paul Avery Brian Cox as Melvin Belli John Carroll Lynch as Arthur Leigh AllenPlot: Based on real case files and the Robert Graysmith books, this movie went over the entire investigation concerning the Zodiac killer, who terrorized California in the 60's and 70's, but was never caught.I didn't know much about this movie when I saw the trailer. I knew of the Zodiac killer, and I saw the cast list and who was directing it(David Fincher, the man who gave us Se7en). So I was pretty excited about this film and when the great reviews came in, I was even more excited. Could this be the first great film of 2007? Yes. Yes it was.First of all let's get any and all problems with this movie dismissed right now. The movie is a little on the long side, clocking in at two hours and forty minutes. And there will be a point in the movie where you will look at your watch. Some of the material could have been cut out or shortened. But other than the length of this movie, I had no problems with it. At all.That's because what is presented is a detailed and accurate(according to Bob Graysmith, anyway) portrayal of the Zodiac investigation. The Zodiac killer is one of the most infamous because he wasn't caught. And if the facts are to be believed, then it was certainly a long and trying investigation. Which leads to what else this movie was about, and what is said in the time line. There's more than one way to lose your life to a killer. This movie shows how the lives of people involved in the investigation were destroyed in some cases or how people just broke down thanks to this killer running wild. Fincher does an incredible job of showing the lives of the major players in the hunt for the Zodiac.The acting was also extremely top-notch, and I don't think this movie would have worked as well if it didn't. Jake Gyllenhaal comes through again with another good performance. He even gets some laughs because of the quirks of his character. Robert Downey Jr plays an alcoholic Paul Avery very well(let's just stop there and not go into any jokes, okay?). The people playing the police officers, Anthony Edwards and Mark Ruffalo, among others, really got to show us how the case was affecting their lives and luckily they pulled it off. All that can be said about Brian Cox is that he's Brian Cox. What hasn't this man been able to portray? Finally John Carroll Lynch looks and acts creepy enough to believable as a suspect in any murder case, especially the prime suspect in the Zodiac one, Arthur Leigh Allen.The script and lines work and the pacing of this movie keeps you interested throughout the whole thing. You may check your watch once because it's so long, but that doesn't mean you'll be any less drawn into the story. It presents the facts in a way that you are able to put the pieces together yourself, and sometimes you discover new clues along with the characters. Fincher doesn't make things obvious. He could have showed signs and made the characters oblivious, but he didn't. He also could have provided a definite answer to the investigation, but he really doesn't. He shows who the police thought was their prime suspect, but the truth is no one really knew. The investigation is portrayed over many years, so the length of the movie also makes sense because it's covering a very long time-span. That really hinders any true complaints about the running time.I think Zodiac is the best movie of the year so far, and hopefully it's a sign that even more great ones will follow. Great script, great performances, great movie. Highly recommended.Rating: ****1/2 of *****",Null,5,9,4 March 2007
The Prestige," The Prestige
","The Joe Cool Experience: The Prestige(2006)Starring: Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier Christian Bale as Alfred Borden Michael Caine as Cutter Scarlett Johansson as Olivia Wenscombe David Bowie as Nikolas TeslaPlot: Two rival magicians try to one-up each other, especially when it comes to a certain trick called 'The Transported Man', which eventually leads to them embarrassing, attacking and trying to murder one another.Openers: I had been looking forward to this movie for a while. I liked the cast, I liked the director, and the plot sounded very interesting. In an era with remakes and sequels, it's nice to see an original movie step up and show everyone how's it done. And this was original. Did it live up to my expectations?The Good: The acting is wonderful. I've always been a Christian Bale fan, ever since he went insane in American Psycho. He just seems like one of those actors that gives 100% into everything he does and that makes every performance memorable. This one is no exception. He plays a likable character with a bit of a dark side and does it flawlessly. Hugh Jackman, who I haven't actually seen do too much acting(considering I've seen nothing but X-men and Van Helsing) does well as Bale's rival. It's a good performance when I'm able to say 'That's Angier' as opposed to 'What's Wolverine doing in this movie?'. Both of the main actors put forth an engaging show. Michael Caine is, as always, the glue that holds this thing together. Even though he is in a supporting role he does excellently and helps everything move along. This movie also has many twists and turns, which helps a lot.The Bad: I did not like the fact that in the end, the movie almost literally holds your hand and explains everything to you. It's like since Nolan felt he was releasing a bigger picture that wasn't a Batman movie, he had to explain it for audiences. I didn't like it at all. Let the audience figure it out for themselves. It takes a bit to explain every little thing and by the time they do and all the twists are revealed, I was left kind of drained. It just took me out of the movie experience.The Ugly: David Bowie. Who told this man he could act? His presence threw me off.Final Verdict: The Prestige is right up there in the top films for the year. Great performances and a great story, plus awesome effects. High recommendation from me.Rating: ****1/2 of *****",Null,3,6,17 March 2007
Silent Hill," Good Horror Movie In General, Best Video Game Adaptation Yet
","The Joe Cool Review: Silent Hill(2006)Starring: Radha Mitchell as Rose DaSilva, Jodelle Ferland as Sharon DaSilva, Sean Bean as Christopher DaSilva, Laurie Holden as Cybil, & Alice Krige as ChristabellaPlot: A mother takes her daughter to a town called Silent Hill, where they become trapped in an alternate reality. Sharon, the daughter, ends up missing and the mother must search for her in a town where everything is not as it seems, and when it gets dark it changes into something far more sinister.Openers: Just to start things out I am a huge fan of the Silent Hill game series. I was tentative to see this movie because let's face it, video games adaptations have not been kind to the fans. The best adaptations are simply okay(Resident Evil), some are bad but are guilty pleasures(Mortal Kombat), and some are just plain terrible(House of the Dead, Super Mario Bros, Street Fighter, etc). But when I heard who was behind it I gained some confidence in the project. Then they released pictures and trailers and I became very eager to see it. It looked like someone adapted a video game to the screen that not only stayed true to it's source material, but also was a good movie in itself. Did that happen?The Good: For the most part, yes. Silent Hill's biggest triumph is that visually it is amazing. It stays true to the games in that it has a real gritty feel to it. You will recognize a lot of the creatures if you've ever played, and even if you haven't, the monsters are just plain scary looking. They look CGI in this movie but apparently they are actual people with costumes for the most part, so good job. When the town itself is transformed, there are great effects there as well. The story, while having some tweaks here and there, pretty much fit into the Silent Hill universe. So far so good. It stays true to the games. As far as a movie itself, it looks great visually, as I said before. Some of the acting is decent, such as Sean Bean, who only had a minor role here. Laurie Holden was pretty much a perfect choice as Cybil as it looked like she was pulled directly from the original game. She also held up her role in the movie as well. Jodelle Ferland wasn't annoying in her role, which is all you can say for most child actors.The Bad: This movie had it's share of flaws too though. The script had some terrible lines in it, mainly from the fanatical church. Radha Mitchell pretty much annoyed me too as Rose, and I couldn't care too much for her as a result. The plot had some holes, not many but some, and the ending itself was anti-climatic and just took me out of the vibe that I had settled into. Felt like a lot of stuff was cut out(which I read that the original cut was 3 and a half hours so that may be why) and the movie itself felt disjointed in some parts.The Ugly: Good news is there is a LOT of gore. Someone gets their skin ripped off, and there's one big scene with a lot of gore that I won't reveal.Final Verdict: In spite of it's flaws, Silent Hill is not only the best video-game adaptation yet, it's also a good horror movie on top of it. I recommend it.Rating: **** of *****",Null,0,2,28 April 2006
Blades of Glory," Better than Talledega Nights, not as good as Anchorman
","Blades of Glory(2007)Starring: Will Ferrell as Chazz Michael Michaels Jon Heder as Jimmy MacElroy Will Arnett as Stranz Van Waldenberg Amy Poehler as Fairchild Van Waldenberg Jenna Fischer as Katie Van Waldenberg Craig T Nelson as Coach(ha!)Plot: Two rival skaters get into a fight and cause some mayhem, so they're banned from men's figure skating. A loophole shows that they can re-enter as a two-male tandem, but to win the gold medal, they have to go through the Waldenberg siblings.Will Ferrell is sort of a love him or hate him guy. While most people love the roles he's involved with, there are those who do not find him funny at all. The same can be said for Jon Heder. So putting them with a movie made a lot of sense, because lots of people love the both of them. I loved the idea, even if I'm not a huge Heder fan. Will Ferrell as a figure skater? I guarantee that's how the movie was pitched because that had me hooked.Ferrell shined in his role(and not because of the shiny suit either), as he had lots of off-the-wall moments that are normally his style. His character was very Ron Burgundy-esquire which I guess says if it isn't broke don't fix it. He's funny again so it worked. The introspective videos shown about Chazz Michael Michaels were gold.('Personal philosophy: Clothing optional.')Jon Heder as is less annoying here, and actually kind of funny. Good casting as the 'pretty boy figure skater'. The rest of the cast does their jobs well, especially Will Arnett, who says some odd things and kept me laughing.('Yeah, remember how they used to be alive?') Also, we have a Craig T Nelson sighting, and I'm sure someone knew what they were doing casting him as a character known as 'Coach'.This movie does tend to waver as there are some moments where it tries to be funny and falls on it's face. The entire chase scene between Arnett and Ferrell was funny in some parts, but dragged. The romance story that was thrown in felt forced. It didn't really have a place in this movie. This was more about Chazz and Jimmy, and when those two are on screen together(or when Poehler and Arnett share the screen) it works. When they're not, it doesn't. So the two rival teams do have a lot of chemistry. One could say they have way too much chemistry, but that adds to the comedy factor(You'll see.)Blades of Glory is funnier than Talledega Nights, but never reaches the status of Anchorman. It's funny, but it's not consistently funny, and when it's not funny, it is actually kind of boring. If you want a good laugh, wait until DVD.Rating: *** of *****",Null,3,5,7 April 2007
The Hills Have Eyes," Much better than the original
","The Joe Cool Review: The Hills Have Eyes(2006) Starring: Aaron Stanford as Doug Bukowski, Kathleen Quinlan as Ethel Carter, Vinessa Shaw as Lynne Bukowski, Emilie de Ravin as Brenda Carter, Dan Byrd as Bobby Carter, and Ted Levine as Bob Carter Plot: A family on their way to California is taken down the wrong road and is stalked and killed off by a group of inbred mutant cannibals, altered by nuclear testing years before. Who will survive? Openers: Wow. You know I knew going in that there was no way that this movie could be worse than the original, and it actually looked good. And it was! Was no surprise though somewhat as Alexandre Aja did a great job with Haute Tension and I expected more of the same. Since this is a remake, I should go ahead and announce any changes, without spoiling the movie of course. The cannibals are mutants now, thanks to nuclear testing. The events in this one are pretty much the same as the original, only with some pretty cool twists added(like the testing village and the auto graveyard) to spice things up a bit.The Good: The script and acting are worlds better than it's predecessor. First of all we are graced with the presence of Ted Levine, who plays Big Bob. He's awesome in everything I've seen him in, whether it be Silence of the Lambs, the creepy trucker voice in Joy Ride or even Monk. He's pretty good here too, and I liked his character. His constant shots at his son-in-law Doug are funny. The rest of the cast does well too, for the most part. Aaron Stanford does a much better job as Doug than the guy in the previous movie, as he doesn't OVERACT. This movie also features it's fair share of gore and genuinely creepy moments that make you squirm. The make-up effects used to create the mutants(especially Big Brain) are nothing short of spectacular. You can tell a lot of work went into it and it pays off. Some of the mutants are just disgusting, which is how they should be. It takes the creepy factor to a new level.The Bad: This movie isn't perfect. Still going with the previous story, the family is still not that bright. They still listen to the creepy old guy in an abandoned gas station in the middle of nowhere and they go down that road. They still split up and make some stupid decisions. And they still act calm around signs that should be disturbing(again, the auto graveyard!) and make them want to get out of there as soon as possible. Emilie de Ravin and Dan Byrd were annoying as the kids. Especially Dan Byrd. We also get a somewhat abrupt ending this time as well, although with a little more closure.The Ugly: There's a really disturbing scene in the movie that involves the mutants forcing themselves onto two women that made me and from what I saw everyone in the audience pretty uncomfortable. It helps to establish the gritty tone of this movie but regardless, it belongs in this category.Final Verdict: Not only does this do better than the original, but it's pretty good in it's own right. It didn't pull any punches and therefore it became true horror, which is what horror is supposed to be. Horror is supposed to make you scared and uncomfortable. And this does that effectively.Rating: ***1/2 of *****",Null,0,0,21 March 2006
Spider-Man," Delivers a well done comic adaptation
","Spider-Man(2002):Starring:Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/The Green Goblin James Franco as Harry OsbornPlot: You should know the story by now, but nerdy Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider, which gives him all of it's powers. This makes him Spider-Man. Deciding to be a hero after the death of his Uncle Ben, he soon finds his hands full thanks to the Green Goblin, who is Norman Osborn, the father of Peter's friend Harry.I've been a Spider-Man fan for years. I grew up with everyone's favorite wall-crawler. I watched the 90's animated series, I read the comics. Spidey and I have been through a lot together(like the Clone Saga) but when I knew there was going to be a movie? Directed by Sam 'hey I made Evil Dead once' Raimi? I was excited, to say the least. All my childhood memories swelled up and I was a kid again sitting in the theater opening weekend.I've avoided doing these movies simply because I thought I'd be biased. But here I go, attempting to be unbiased. Doing so, I'll list this movies faults first. For starters, the script can be kind of cheesy. There are some lines here and there that can be groan-inducing. It could be added up to the comic book aspect of it. Because if you've read a Spider-Man comic, that text can get silly. Another problem I had was the Green Goblin. Don't get me wrong, Willem Dafoe was wonderful, but that suit could not have been more wrong. It's been compared to Power Ranger villains, and even though it's not that bad(really, have you SEEN an episode of that?), robotic Green Goblin was not the way to go at all.Luckily they had a strong actor in Dafoe to pull off the maniacal Goblin or the whole thing wouldn't have worked. He played crazy well and made Goblin a strong nemesis for Spidey. And what of our webbed hero? The character, along with everyone else, was fully fleshed out and made you care for them. That went a long way to getting you involved in the story.Tobey Maguire does a credible job as both Peter Parker and Spider-Man. Kirsten Dunst is cute and has a strong character. James Franco does well as Harry Osborn. And the supporting cast(chosen perfectly, in my opinion) is really what holds this thing together. JK Simmons as J Jonah Jameson? PERFECT! I never thought Jonah would be my favorite part of the movie but the way he was casted and the way he pulls off the character make him a welcome addition.Last, but not least, the special effects were top-notch. But they'd pretty much have to be to pull of a Spider-Man movie of this epic proportions. The suit looks good, the fight scenes are spectacular, and the movie itself flows together nicely.When everything was said and done and all the webs were spun, Spider-Man delivered a well-done comic adaptation. I'd say Spider-Man is definitely worth your time, in spite of some flaws that were present in the movie.Rating: **** of *****",Null,0,1,4 May 2007
Batman Begins," Batman As It Should Be
","The Joe Cool Review: Batman Begins(2005)Starring: Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Cillian Murphy as Dr. Johnathan Crane/The Scarecrow, Liam Neeson as Ducard, Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes, Gary Oldman as James Gordon, Michael Caine as Alfred, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius FoxPlot: Focuses on the origins of how Batman came to be. This is a complete revamp of the Batman series, focusing away from the Gothic Tim Burton stories and campy Joel Schumacher films. Bruce's parents get killed and he swears vengeance, eventually becoming Batman, who now has to stop a plot by the League of Shadows to destroy Gotham City.Openers: A new Batman movie had been in development for a long time before this came out, but after the silliness that was Batman & Robin no one really wanted to go into that territory again. Probably the same reason it took so long for Superman to come back. Fans really loved the Burton Batman films, even though it did have some inaccuracies(Joker never killed Batman's parents), and generally hated the Schumacher films because well, it took the serious Dark Knight and used it as an excuse to have celebrities act over the top, gave us Arnold, Bat-nipples and George Clooney playing Batman. Basically, if a new Batman movie was to be done, it had to be done right or you could swear off Batman appearing on the big screen ever again. So did Batman Begins help establish a new franchise or does it fall the way of the ones before it? Just before we begin I need to state I am by no means a Batman fan boy, he's not that high on my list.The Good: This film takes Batman into a far more serious tone than any of the films, Burton's original included. Sure there are some bits of humor here and there, but it's doesn't detract from it. This Batman pretty much has everything. Great story, direction, acting...and the casting was just perfect. Michael Gough played Alfred in the original four, and while he did do a great job, it seems like Michael Caine was just an overwhelmingly perfect pick. Adding Morgan Freeman was a good touch as well, and Liam Neeson made for a very strong cast. But with those three, you can almost always expect quality. The questionable ones were really the 'new blood' so to speak. Christian Bale delivers an excellent performance as Batman and as Bruce Wayne. Believe it or not he doesn't just play the same guy only with a costume. He plays two different people which I think is the better way to do it. Cillian Murphy had a big year in 2005 between this and Red Eye, and he does an excellent job as Scarecrow. I wish he would have spent more time in Scarecrow form, but that's nitpicking.The Bad: Katie Holmes does okay, but on average her character just seems like a pointless love interest and really unnecessary. There are other minor characters that really served no purpose in my opinion. With all the different people and plot lines being thrown around, it is a little hard to keep track. But with the over two hour running time, I guess they needed to fill up some space. Which is another problem I have with this film. It is a little on the long side. Fortunately it never gets boring so running time really doesn't play too much of a factor. The Ugly: Nothing of note. This movie never had any cringe-worthy moments.Final Verdict: I can say with a resounding yes that Batman Begins is a great film. Not just a great comic book film, but a good film overall. Bringing the whole cast back for a sequel is very smart(it's already been confirmed) and if you want to know who the villain will be, without spoiling it for yourself, then just wait until the very end of the movie when they announce it.

Saving Private Ryan," This is such a great movie.
","Starring: Tom Hanks as Captain John H. Miller Tom Sizemore as Sergeant Michael Horvath Edward Burns as Private Richard Reiben Barry Pepper as Private Daniel Jackson Adam Goldberg as Private Stanley Mellish Vin Diesel as Private Adrian Caparzo Giovanni Ribisi as T-4 Medic Irwin Wade Jeremy Davies as Corporal Timothy E. Upham Matt Damon as Private James Francis RyanPlot: A squadron of troops is told to search for Private James Ryan, the last of four brothers who have all been killed in Normandy. They face numerous odds on the battlefield to find Ryan and get him home.I knew this movie was critically hailed when I first watched it, but surprisingly I had no real interest in war movies at the time. Sure, it may sound odd but war is depressing, and to watch a movie based on real people getting killed doesn't equal a good time for me. But Spielberg is an excellent filmmaker and the cast is superb, so I finally say down and gave this one a try.Wow. What a drama this was. It goes to show everyone that war is hell. And if you don't believe that statement, watch the first half-hour, which has been commended for it's graphic, gory realism. You leave that first scene feeling pretty worn out, and then you realize that was just the beginning. That's what Spielberg was going for. He wanted you to know that war is rough for the soldiers. He went for a gritty feel that didn't glorify war like some movies, but presented it in it's destructive glory. He even lowered the colors so as to make it feel gray and bleak. That is a great director for you.Direction is fine, but if the cast isn't ready to make you care about who gets blown up, then you probably won't. A great cast was selected here. It was mostly Tom Hanks, Matt Damon and everyone else, because they either were new, or had normally played bit parts. Vin Diesel was unknown at the time. But everyone, including Diesel(I know, I'm surprised too) brings it here. They deliver as an ensemble. You feel that they're a bunch of guys thrown together in this platoon, and they really don't like the mission they are on. It's a great job to everyone involved. You get the younger guys showing what they can do, the veterans(Burns, Sizemore) holding everything down and the main stars doing what they do best.The special effects and score, once again need to get praised. That opening scene would not have been as effective without the gore effects. It's one thing to have guys fall over and acknowledge their dead. It's another to show it in bloody detail. This movie uses gore to it's advantage, and not just as a throw-away device. While other movies are surely guilty of this, this movie is not. Nothing much else needs to be said about John Williams' work on Spielberg films but the score is kind of low-key and haunting here, unlike other previous ones.Saving Private Ryan introduced me into the world of war-related film. It was enough to make me have tremendous respect for the genre. It's one of my favorite films and I can't recommend it enough. That's why it gets the rating I gave it. Go see this if you haven't, and be prepared to blown away, although not in the literal sense.Rating: ***** of *****",Null,1,6,11 August 2007
The Number 23," Paint-By-Numbers Thriller That Fails On Multiple Levels
","The Joe Cool Experience: The Number 23(2007)Starring: Jim Carrey as Walter Sparrow/Fingerling Virginia Madsen as Agatha Sparrow/Fabriza Logan Lerman as Robin Sparrow Danny Huston as Issac French/Dr. Miles PhoenixPlot: A man finds a book called The Number 23 and begins to read it. As he follows the characters in the story he finds they closely resemble his life and he also sees the number 23 everywhere. He soon finds out that the character in the book becomes a killer. Does this mean he will kill too? Is the number 23 really controlling him?I was so excited about this movie when first hearing about it. It looked like a smart thriller and featured Jim Carrey returning to another serious role, which he is good at. But what I got was a contrived mess that seemed like it was rushed and thrown together. Before I go into complaining, I'll just state what I did like about it.This movie had a very strong cast. Jim Carrey and Virginia Madsen carry this movie on their backs, and try to drag it away from the corner that thrillers like this are all shuffled into. I thought the idea was great, and the fact they created lots of examples of how the Number 23 is everywhere(although some of them were reaching...32 is 23 reversed!) helped the 'curse' aspect of the story take hold.However this movie DOES go into typical Hollywood thriller mode fairly quick, with all the minor and the one major plot twist being things that can be seen coming from anyone with half a brain. This looked and felt paint-by-numbers. It's pretty much an example of, 'If you've seen one, you've seen them all'. Only some of the others were done better. The ending definitely leaves a bad taste in my mouth. All the build up and then it ends rather abrupt and anticlimactic. The subplot with the dog was especially stupid and really had nothing to do with anything in the long run.This movie tries to hard to be scary but really doesn't do that. It tries to be funny, and thanks to some moments where Jim Carrey's natural style of humor comes forward, it succeeds. Some of the attempted humor falls flat. It tries to be a mystery, but it's a puzzle that is easy to solve. It seems like on almost every level this movie fails, except for the actor. The actors tried here and that I can appreciate. But when the script is less-than-average the acting can't save it.Overall, The Number 23 tries to be many things and fails. I don't recommend it, unless you just love Jim Carrey and want to see another of his movies. But even then I think you should be able to skip this one and it won't matter much. So do just that, skip this one.Rating: * of *****",Null,1,4,4 March 2007
Ghost Rider," Entertaining, But Still A Bad Movie
","The JC Experience: Ghost Rider(2007): Starring: Nicolas Cage as Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider Eva Mendes as Roxanne Simpson Wes Bentley as Blackheart Peter Fonda as Mephistopheles Sam Elliot as Caretaker Donal Logue as MackPlot: Based on the Marvel comic book. Young Johnny Blaze's father has cancer and so Mehistopheles makes a deal to remove the cancer in exchange for Blaze whenever he wants him. That wacky demon doesn't say anything about his father dying in an accident however, so Johnny goes off on his own. Years later Blackheart arrives to cause trouble, so Johnny is made into the new Ghost Rider to stop him. Can he rid himself of the curse, save the day and still find time to have a meaningful relationship with EVa Mendes and her cleavage?Ghost Rider is an odd film for me. Because it's a bad film. There's no denying that. Some things do work but the majority of it does not and has some serious problems that can't be ignored. I'll go ahead and state that I enjoyed the film. But I love the characters and comic so unless it was mind-numbingly bad there was no way I'd completely hate it. But I am objective so I can also see that there was negative there.To start off, you can tell the creators of this movie(Or at least Nic Cage) loved the characters and wanted to make an entertaining popcorn movie. Ghost Rider is just a bad ass here, getting off some one-liners, stopping some evil, looking awesome in his CGI-induced glory. I loved the big screen portrayal of the Penance Stare. If you have any love for this character then the scene where he rides up the side of a building on the cycle is one of joy. Nic Cage does a fine job as Johnny Blaze, although instead of a tortured soul he kind of comes off as just an oddball. But he's a likable oddball so it's okay. The effects can be off, and downright bad at times(Wind demon especially) but when they work, they WORK. Also you get Eva Mendes showing off her cleavage, some humor and some action. It's a comic movie about a guy who rides around with a flaming skull for a head, so it's a little ridiculous right out of the gate.However the stupidity does go over the top. Examples: Roxanne randomly pulls out an 8-ball while waiting for Johnny to come to dinner. Is it explained that she has a personality quirk that makes her constantly check an 8-ball? No. She just does it and it's never heard of or spoken of again. Blaze as a oddball lends itself to really out there moments like complaining because he can't watch his monkey show when you think he'd have more pressing issues at hand. Also the big evil bad guys are pretty much laughable here. Peter Fonda does okay, but Wes Bentley? Man he was terrible Over-acting constantly, letting off bad puns some of the time and smiling constantly. He did look evil so I guess that's all you can ask. As far as his minions go, they are dispatched easily and you never quite know who they are to begin with. For that matter, why does Blackheart even want the contract of 1000 souls? Why does he hate Mephisto so much? Also, why include a love interest and a police subplot if they are really just there to pad out the story? The love story feels tacked on and forced, and the police are so inept you'd think this was the Naked Gun series. Also, I know the plot is kind of hokey but you could at least make Blaze look like he's suffering once in a while. He's cursed, remember? It's good they say so, because you never quite get that impression.So, as I've mentioned earlier. I liked Ghost Rider. I really did. It was entertaining, and I love the character/comic. But the fact it's a bad movie cannot be ignored and that pains me. Maybe this will get the Director's Cut like Daredevil did and we can see a more fleshed out story, but who knows.

Hellboy," Just A Great Ride From Start To Finish
","The Joe Cool Review: Hellboy(2004) Starring: Ron Perlman as Hellboy, John Hurt as Professor Broom, Selma Blair as Liz Sherman, Rupert Evans as John Myers & Doug Jones as Ape Sapien(voiced by David Hyde Pierce)Plot: Towards the tail end of WW2, the Nazis decided to resort to the occult to try and open up a portal which will bring about the end of the world. The allies managed to stop them but a baby demon made it through the portal. It is raised by Professor Broom and becomes known as Hellboy. 60 years later they're back and it's up to Hellboy to kick ass and stop them.Openers: What a great ride this movie is from start to finish. Hellboy has just about everything you want a movie to have, and yet it's not a typical movie in any sense of the term. It has action, comedy, horror elements and even some romance.The Good: Hellboy is sort of a melting pot of many different genres and that's what makes this movie work so well. It doesn't conform to one type of movie and therefore blows the viewer away from start to finish. Another reason this movie works is Ron Perlman. Make no mistake about it, Guillermo del Toro was 100% right in choosing Perlman and only considering him for the role. I couldn't get enough of him playing Big Red and when the movie was over I still wanted more. And the movie clocked in close to 2 hrs and ten minutes! Some of the supporting cast I feel did their jobs well too. Selma Blair and John Hurt were just sort of there but they didn't detract from the film. Doug Jones can act like a fish freak and could emote without talking. And since he didn't provide Abe Sapien's voice, that's kind of what he had to do. David Hyde Pierce was a good choice to provide the voice of Abe and one of those things that just seem perfect after the fact as far as casting goes. Everything else works too. The action is great(Love the subway fight scene) and the comedy and romance work too, with a few jump scares and emotional scenes thrown in. Honorable mention goes to Jeffery Tambor who manages to be pretty funny in a role that I originally hated but grew to love.The Bad: My main problem with this movie is the character of John Myers. I feel like he was forced onto the audience and really doesn't do much. He was just about as expendable as the other agents looking after HB in my view. Nevermind the fact he acts like a pansy throughout the whole thing. I get the fact he was placed into the movie to be an outside person learning about this new strange world of Hellboy but I still didn't care for his character like I did everyone else.The Ugly: The final battle, although short, relies heavily on CGI and looks kind of fake looking. However it doesn't really take away from the movie and is not that noticeable unless you're trying to find flaws.Final Verdict: I was pretty sure I'd like Hellboy but I didn't think it'd be as good as it turned out being. Now it's one of my favorite movies and I eagerly await the sequel to see HB kick ass once more.Rating: ****1/2 or *****",Null,2,2,29 August 2006
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," F4 Purists Won't Like It, But It's Still A Lot Of Fun
","The Joe Cool Experience: Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer(2007)Starring: Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic Jessica Alba as Sue Storm/Invisible Woman Chris Evans as Johnny Storm/Human Torch Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm/The Thing Julian McMahon as Dr. Victor Von Doom Doug Jones(body)/Laurence Fishburne(voice) as The Silver SurferPlot: Trying to prepare for Reed and Sue's wedding, in addition to adjusting to life as celebrities, the Fantastic Four soon face threat to the entire world. The Silver Surfer, Herald of Galactus, has arrived on Earth and is preparing the planet for Galactus' consumption. In addition to all of this, Doom is back to cause problems. I am one of the few who actually liked Fantastic Four. While I admit it was very flawed, I think the depictions of Human Torch and Thing were right on the money both in look and performance. I had hoped this time around they would up the stakes and give us a better movie, and it turns out they did. They brought in The Silver Surfer, brought back Doom, and added a lot more action. They knew what they were doing. Take what (some) people thought worked, the popcorn like action feel of the first one, and turn it up a notch.Here's what I didn't like about it. The comedy feels forced and doesn't always work. And there's more of it than there needs to be. Tender or serious moments are quickly interrupted with a joke, lest the audience have to actually think or feel with anything that's presented to them. This felt like they were going for a little bit of parody. There shouldn't be that much comedic elements when we're supposed to be in suspense over whether or not the world will end. This movie may not win any awards, but I had a lot of fun and was very entertained. What more can you ask for from summer action fare? Chris Evans once again brought it as The Human Torch, making him just as arrogant as the comics, but at the same time, and I was amazed by this, we see Johnny mature a little bit and have some character growth. Michael Chiklis already explored The Thing the last time, so he was just kind of going by-the-book here and didn't do much. Julian McMahon didn't overact as much, which is all you can really ask. I still don't think Reed and Sue are cast right but we'll ignore that.They change a few elements of the comics, such as Galactus and the Super-Skrull. Galactus is a drastic change from his comic counterpart, but I feel that it works here, and for all we know it was meant to be a glimpse before we get the real Big G. Who knows? Super-Skrull was more of a concept as the actual character did not appear. F4 purists will probably be disappointed at this movie, I'll let you all know that. I didn't read too much F4, so I'm not as upset that things were changed.Overall, This movie had everything it needed to succeed, great action, The Silver Surfer doing his thing and just was a fun ride from start to finish. They succeeded in being better than the original, and out of the three Marvel comic movies to hit this year, this one is the best. Rating: ***1/2 of *****",Null,8,13,29 June 2007
Grindhouse," Just an awesome experience
","Grindhouse(2007)Starring: Rose McGowan as Cherry Darling(Planet Terror)/Pam(Death Proof) Freddy Rodriguez as El Wray(Planet Terror) Josh Brolin as Doc Block(Planet Terror) Marley Shelton as Dakota(Planet Terror/Death Proof) Kurt Russell as Stuntman Mike(Death Proof) Rosario Dawson as Abernathy(Death Proof) Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Lee(Death Proof) Zoe Bell as Zoe(Death Proof)Plot: A double feature. In Planet Terror, a gas causes a zombie uprising, and only a few people can stop the threat of Armageddon. In Death Proof, an insane stunt driver uses his car to kill his victims. Also featuring four faux trailers: 'Machete' by Robert Rodriguez, 'Werewolf Women of the SS' by Rob Zombie, 'Don't' by Edgar Wright, and 'Thanskgiving' by Eli Roth.This one will be long and hard to follow, so bear with me.I know exactly what this movie is paying homage to. As a horror fan, I've spent plenty a time grabbing cheap video rentals of poorly made movies(whether they be slashers or exploitation) and this movie was a huge throwback to not just those types of movies in the horror genre, but in all genres. The poorly made low-budget movies that many people used to watch. So I was excited from the overall idea, not to mention that one of them was a zombie movie. Then the trailers came out and you could definitely see the love for these types of movies that was presented. So I was very excited as I sat down in my seat awaiting this double feature.First of all(although they are in-between the two) let's talk about the trailers. Machete appears first. I've heard rumors this is already in development as it's own movie. It was a fairly decent trailer but nothing compared to the others. They all could easily be made into their own movies. Werewolf Women of the SS had Nicolas Cage as Fu Manchu(in all his over-acting glory!). Don't was a clever play on all the 'Don't' style horror films of the day, like 'Don't Go Into The Basement' or 'Don't Go Into the Woods'. Thanksgiving was the crown jewel of the whole set, playing on not only the slasher genre in general, but especially the holiday-themed ones. Lastly, and I don't know how they did it, but it looked like it was straight out of the 80's.Now onto the movies. First, Planet Terror. This was the best of the two, I'll go ahead and say that. It was an exciting zombie movie, with lots of action, comedy(which was intentional, but back then it would have of course been unintentional), and gore for the masses. I'm talking cringe-worthy gore. Some parts were just *gross*. You can't really complain about the acting, because I think it was meant to be bad. The whole thing was meant to be made with tongue planted firmly in cheek. But Rose McGowan looked like a star here, as she was scorchingly hot(even with a machine gun leg) and Freddy Rodriguez more than pulled his own weight as El Wray. The entire supporting cast was awesome. I was more than pleasantly surprised to see Tom Savini as well. It always pleases me when I see him getting work. He's not exactly an actor, just really cool and very well-known in the horror genre.Death Proof was next, and in my mind they should have reversed the order. With Death Proof being the weaker of the two, and being more dialogue-driven than Planet Terror, I felt if it were placed first the audience wouldn't have felt as left down. Because Planet Terror is action packed, where Death Proof can get a little tiresome. There was just way too much talking. Some of it was plot details that didn't matter, some of it was character development. A big thing that left me frustrated(SPOILER!) was building up a group of characters and then killing them off, before introducing a completely new set of characters. Besides my problems, Kurt Russell shines here as the crazy Stuntman Mike, and it's hopefully a role that will get resurrect his career. He over-acts a bit, but I really think that was intentional. Tarantino does okay with this one, and a reversal in order would have helped, but Death Proof was not as good as PT.In general, the movie has lots of little touches that I liked. The film grain, cigarette burns, and even MISSING REELS. I won't say where, but it's just AWESOME when they happen. The people in the audience booed, but for the right reasons..they were in on the joke. Even the subtle things like the coming attractions graphic, the ads for food, the primitive style logos for Dimension Films, and the panther warning us that his movie is restricted. All of the little touches helped.Grindhouse was an awesome movie going experience. Even with it's weak moments I was still captivated by the movie and it felt like an event. I will recommend seeing this one in theaters, however, not just because it's really good, but it's not going to be the same viewing experience if you wait for DVD. It's one of those movies that HAS to be seen on the big screen. As of right now, this is my pick for best movie of the year.Planet Terror Rating: **** of ***** Death Proof Rating: **1/2 of ***** Grindhouse Rating: ***** of *****My rating aren't average together for the whole movie, keep that in mind.

Saw," Best Horror Film of 2004.
","The Joe Cool Review: Saw(2004)Starring: Leigh Whannell as Adam, Cary Elwes as Dr. Gordon, Danny Glover as Detective Tapp and Tobin Bell as JigsawPlot: Two men find themselves locked in a dirty bathroom, chained to pipes and with a dead man laying between them. One of them, Dr. Gordon soon realizes this is all the work of a serial killer named Jigsaw, who really isn't a killer, but finds ways for his victims to kill themselves. Now they must figure out how to escape, and to avoid having Gordon's family killed before it's too late.Openers: What a blast this movie was. I mean it seriously was just a crazy ride to go through. The movie opened in pitch black until you realize our main guy is under water. He wakes up and the lights come on, he's trapped with another guy in this strange room. It certainly is a surprising beginning. Reminiscent of the Cube movies where they wake up and are locked in a room and have no idea how they got there. But this movie is nothing like Cube. It's very very messed up.The Good: First of all, the Jigsaw killer concept was truly amazing. He actually never kills anyway. Not once. He sets up traps to help them 'appreciate life'. One girl has a device strapped to her head which will rip her jaws open if she doesn't find the key inside of the dead man's stomach. One guy has to escape by crawling through razor wire. The situation the two men find themselves in is that they have to find a way to escape or be trapped, and one of them has to kill the other or lose his family. I thought the voice work in particular for the Jigsaw killer was creepy. And his motives, which we find out in the end, are very unique. The acting was top-notch as well. Cary Elwes has been known to me as the guy from Robin Hood: Men In Tights and The Princess Bride. Up until SAW, I thought he wasn't a serious type of guy. He proved me wrong here, playing a dramatic role perfectly and sold me when he broke down and cried, right before doing something drastic. Another thing this movie has was plot and script. The movie had be locked in from the very opening frame and kept me engrossed throughout the whole thing in it's suspense filled story. Not only that, but there was many a twist and turn which made me think one thing, but then turned around and gave me a truth of something else!The Bad: The first time I watched this I would have said nothing was wrong with it. But upon reviewing I've discovered some problems that bothered me. Cary Elwes is thought to be the over actor here, and I don't agree. Leigh Whannell was very annoying. Danny Glover's character should have been more fleshed out as well, as he was just playing the generic grizzled veteran/paranoid cop. I've seen it before, and am not impressed with the copy-and-paste version here from other more effective roles. Lastly, the movie sorta kinda ends abruptly and I was not okay with that at all.The Ugly: Well it's not ugly as in a flaw for the movie, but this movie does have it's strong share of gore. We get a blown off head, a man DOES have to crawl through razor wire, bloody entrails, a slit throat, lots of gunshot wounds and a amputated leg. Other than that, nothing.Final Verdict: SAW is the best horror film of 2004, regardless of how my opinion may change of it. It's still a great movie, but not as great as I believed it was on my original viewing. Still highly recommended.Rating: **** of *****",Null,0,1,28 February 2006
The Descent," Neil Marshall knows his horror.
","The Joe Cool Experience: The Descent(2005) Starring: Shauna McDonald as Sarah Natalie Mendoza as Juno Alex Reid as Beth MyAnna Buring as Sam Saskia Mulder as Rebecca Nora-Jane No one as Holly Plot: Six women exploring a cave become trapped far underground and soon realize they are not alone as creatures that crave flesh live underground and have discovered them. They must now try to survive and escape the cave. I was looking forward to Neil Marshall's follow-up to Dog Soldiers, because that movie was a fun ride. I had a good feeling about this when I finally got the chance to watch it. This time he takes six women(as opposed to a majority of men in DS) and traps them in a cave with a bunch of monsters that want to eat them. I had no problem with that at all. Why change the basic formula that worked for you before? However The Descent varies because they don't have much room, they can't really see that well, and they don't have very many weapons at their disposal. This makes it tricky as to how many of them survive, if any, and if they do, how they accomplish that. A complaint could be made about the lack of light through a lot of this. There are times when you can't see well. I didn't like it at first, but in reflection I feel that it helps this movie more than hinders it. It sort of places you in the cave with them and when the first creature is finally revealed, you're just as shocked as they are. The first big reveal could not have been shot any better. especially with how they were having to use the night-vision function on the camera because it was almost pitch black in the cave. The darkness adds to the terror and paranoia of the movie. Paranoia is a big theme. The girls begin to question each other in the cave as well and only worry about the survival of themselves and not their friends. I did have some problems with this movie though. For starters, with the exception of three, Sarah, Juno and Holly, the girls are pretty much indivisible from one another. It was hard to tell Rebecca apart from Sam, for example. Not much was done to help that. I also felt the ending was severely lacking. It added an element right at the closing frame that didn't need to be added, period. There was no reason to do it, and I didn't like it one bit. Even with the flaws, however, The Descent was a well-made horror film and a nice follow-up to Dog Soldiers. Neil Marshall knows his horror and I expect we'll see more of the same quality from him in the future. Rating: **** of *****",Null,2,5,13 January 2007
Inside Man," 'My name is Dalton Russell....'
","The Joe Cool Review: Inside Man(2006) Starring: Denzel Washington as Detective Keith Frazier, Clive Owen as Dalton Russell, Jodie Foster as Madeline White, Christopher Plummer as Arthur Case, and Willem Dafoe as Captain John Darius Plot: His name is Dalton Russell. Pay strict attention to what he says because he chooses his words carefully and never repeats himself. Recently he planned and set in motion events to execute the perfect bank robbery..why? Because he can. So now Detective Keith Frazier has to talk him into releasing the hostages, but there may be other matters involved that may hinder that process.Openers: When I saw the casting and premise, I was very excited to see this movie. I'd been a fan of Denzel for several years, and in my mind he's one of the best actors around. Clive Owen I became a fan of after Sin City, and Willem Dafoe was awesome in Spiderman and The Boondock Saints. So I looked at this all-star cast, great trailer and expected to be blown away..was I? Read on...The Good: For the most part, this was a perfect heist movie. There were plenty of twists and turns and while some of them were predictable, others weren't and so the suspense was still there. You sympathized with the bad guy as much as you did the police trying to bring him down. Maybe that's just because both Denzel and Clive do such a good job in their roles, but it was a solid ride throughout that had me eventually wanting both guys to come out okay. Clive Owen does a great job as the leader of the heist, his arrogance is just so great you can't help but like him. 'I'm going walk out the front door of this bank.' And in a supporting role, Willem Dafoe is the glue that holds this together. He doesn't do much in this role but he's good where he is. Christopher Plummer is good as the owner of the bank, Arthur Case.The Bad: I noticed Spike Lee tried to comment on racism with this movie. I appreciate the effort Spike but it's really not needed here. Sure we know that middle-eastern looking people are subject to discrimination since 9/11 and we know that racism in general still exists. They just seemed like trivial segments that didn't actually go anywhere so they were just pointless. Also, as much as Jodie Foster is a good actress, her character was not needed here. Another pointless role. In the end she adds nothing to the overall story and doesn't detract from it either, she's just there.The Ugly: Random reference to a PSP game(50 Cent's Bulletproof) had me cracking up unintentionally. Seriously, does 50 actually make his victims eat grenades in that game? Final Verdict: It has a few hiccups here and there but overall Inside Man is one of the year's top films. It's a great heist move and if you love movies like Heat you'll love this. With an all-star cast and great plot there's no reason you shouldn't check this out immediately.Rating: ****1/2 of *****",Null,1,3,31 August 2006
The Departed," Best Movie Of 2006, Hands Down.
","The Joe Cool Experience: The Departed(2006)Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio as Billy Costigan Matt Damon as Colin Sullivan Jack Nicholson as Frank Costello Mark Wahlberg as Dignam Martin Sheen as Oliver QueenanPlot: A cop goes undercover within the Irish Mafia to gain incriminating information on Frank Costello. At the same time, Frank has someone from his group within the police department in order to keep from getting caught and for information. Sooner or later both cops discover each other's presence in each other's groups and a game of cat and mouse occurs as they try to discover each other's identities.Openers: I knew little to nothing about this movie going in. The only things I knew were that it had a cast I knew I'd enjoy, and a very talented director in Martin Scorsese at the helm. The trailer also looked fantastic. I knew nothing of the movie this was based off of and I didn't know too much concerning the plot. So going into this with a blank slate, I really didn't have any expectations. And the two hours that followed completely blew me away.The Good: This movie has everything going for it. The previously mentioned superb cast, for starters. Leonardo DiCaprio, who I feel is an underrated actor and gets better with every movie, turns in another stellar performance. Matt Damon gives a good show as well. Jack Nicholson plays himself, once again, but he's entertaining and actually a bit more subdued here so I let it pass. The supporting cast, featuring Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin also do a good job. I really liked Mark Wahlberg's show here too. It's been a long time since he's been 'Marky Mark' and he's showing a lot of acting skill in there. The directing was nice, the pacing was excellent and the story was wonderful. This movie doesn't shy away from the red stuff, which is another good thing. Lots of bloody headshots, a fall that ends terribly are some of the highlights. The blood actually adds to the story, rather than detract for the sake of it. Also this movie has a lot of quotable lines, and a lot of tension that will have you on the edge of your seat. I know I was.The Bad: Not a bad thing. Nitpicking, you could say the movie runs long, but you never notice. I couldn't find any faults with this movie. The Ugly: The previously mentioned redness would go here, otherwise this one remains blank as well.Final Verdict: I had to wait awhile to review this just so I could do it objectively. And looking back I still cannot see any faults and think this is just an awesome movie. The Departed is hands down, my choice for the movie of the year. Highest Recommendation.Rating: ***** of *****",Null,2,3,25 November 2006
Jaws," Two-thirds of one of the greatest horror films ever made.
","Starring: Roy Scheider as Police Chief Martin Brody Robert Shaw as Quint Richard Dreyfuss as Matt HooperPlot: There's something out in the waters of Amity Island killing people and eating them alive. Police Chief Martin Brody fears it may be sharks but is told to keep his mouth shut. Soon the creature strikes again, and now he decides to take matters into his own hands and go find and kill what may be the largest shark the world has ever seen.Let's get the problems out of the way first, because I feel as though Jaws, while very decent, isn't as scary as people say it is. Jaws genuinely made people afraid to go out in the water..in 1975. The movie itself does not age well and doesn't hold up to a more modern audience of today, although it still manages to send a chill or two down the spine.Besides not holding up well over time, this movie tends to go too long. Running at a span over a little over two hours, there's a lot that could have been cut out to make it a smooth shark movie. Some of it was character development, and I understand that, but some of it were scenes that felt stapled on or just felt out of place. The scene where the three men sing together comes to mind. Not to mention some of them were repeats of scenes produced earlier. Mainly most of the flaws were in that second half, once Brody and crew go to find the shark.But the first half is one hell of a ride from the quiet opening scene of a teenage girl being attacked while swimming, to the less subtle but more terrifying scene of a boy being swallowed completely while on a raft in broad daylight. Plus the shot of everyone running and screaming out of the water is historic, among other things. Jason or Freddy can't make THAT many people run away from them. Well, Jason did, but it was a bunch of kids. And you could feel sympathy for the creature, it's just doing what comes natural. But they won't let you. This shark will eat you if you go into the water, it's an eating machine!This movie also made me feel for the characters involved. Whether it was the main star, who just wanted to help everyone but didn't have the respect or the support, or the shark expert, or even crazy man Quint. All characters had something about them to make you genuinely care whether or not Jaws had them for lunch or not. It built them all up solidly, even Quint who before he went after the shark didn't have much screen time. This movie, even though it was PG, managed to throw in some gore. It's a killer shark, he's not going to be clean. Gushing blood, severed arm, severed head and a guy gets chewed up. Pretty good for a PG, and quite surprising given the MPAA's strict standards, which were even stricter to horror back then.I would go as far as to say that Jaws is 2/3 of one of the greatest horror films ever made. There are some genuinely terrifying moments, a pretty good adventure story thrown in, but there is 1/3 that could have been cut and just feels unneeded. However, I strongly recommend Jaws, because it's still quite good and this is a historically important film. If you haven't seen it, crawl out from the rock you've been living under and watch it.Rating: **** of *****",Null,0,2,12 July 2007
Halloween," Best Horror Film Ever Made, Duh.
","Starring:Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode Donald Pleasance as Dr. Samuel Loomis Nick Castle as The Shape Nancy Loomis as Annie P.J. Soles as LyndaPlot: Fifteen years ago Michael Myers murdered his sister Judith. He's now escaped and stalking a young group of teenagers in his old hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois. His doctor, Sam Loomis, knows exactly what he is and has also returned to stop him.What could I say that hasn't been said really? Halloween is one of the greatest horror films ever made. Carpenter took a small budget, a simple plot and a cast of mostly unknown people(with the exception of veteran Donald Pleasance) and crafted a masterpiece. With this review it's not a simple task of explaining what's good and bad, but informing you why exactly this movie is so great.Let's start with the script. While it's a basic story(guy returns home to kill people) it works because of the subtleties within. Dr. Loomis is a very well-written character, and gets some good lines explaining why, in his view, Michael Myers is not simply a man, but pure evil. Those lines are delivered excellently by Donald Pleasance.He gives you the very briefest of introductions of Michael, just showing him as some kid who killed his sister, without ever saying why. Then he escapes and you know right then that someone is going to get hurt. The teens he stalks are normal and look like everyday people. People that you could know, in a town that you could live in. Only on this night, evil has arrived. It's simple, sure, but it's the simplicity that makes it so damn scary. Would this have been as frightening if say, there was some giant monster with four arms killing people? Not really. This is a story that could ACTUALLY happen.Carpenter's direction I feel is very top-notch. My favorite shot in the film is when Laurie is in the house, and you see a flash of white in the darkness..while you question what you could have seen, Michael slowly appears and attacks. Other great moments such as the Shape being visible, then disappearing, the killer POV shots and the entire opening sequence all add up to a very good visual style. The cast turn in good performances, including Jamie Lee Curtis who pretty much made her career off of this one movie.What else is there? This movie doesn't rely on blood at all, which is superb. Coming from someone who enjoys his gore, I can say this doesn't need it at all. It relies on suspense and scares, which still can get you today, even if you know they're coming. It has a sense of dread just filling the entire thing and you know SOMETHING is going to kill these innocent kids. The score, which Carpenter himself provided, is haunting and is very memorable. The opening theme is easily recognized for a reason. It's very chilling.You can probably already tell what rating I'm giving Carpenter's Halloween. I'm just explaining why. This movie deserves all the acclaim it gets, and it still holds up today. I couldn't imagine why you wouldn't have seen it(really, I can't think of a single reason). Go watch it again and relive the greatness. It's the night HE came home, after all.Rating: *****",Null,4,6,1 September 2007
Casino Royale," Not Just A Good Bond Movie, But A Good Movie Period.
","The Joe Cool Experience: Casino Royale(2006)Starring: Daniel Craig as James Bond 007 Eva Green as Vesper Lynd Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre Judi Dench as MPlot: In his first major mission, James Bond is supposed to track down a terrorist and gain information on who he works for. When he fails, he has to find another way and becomes involved in a poker game at the Casino Royale with lots of money on the line. If he wins, he'll stand a good chance of capturing Le Chiffre, if he loses, the government will have directly financed terrorism. Can he succeed?Openers: I'm a newer fan of the James Bond series. I haven't seen them all yet, and I just got into them recently. However I do enjoy the films I have seen and came into this with an open mind. I didn't care that Daniel Craig had blondish hair(really, that's a STUPID reason to not see this movie no matter how you look at it) and thought that as long as he was decent that's all we needed. Was Casino Royale up to par with the rest of the series? Read on...The Good: I can't call him the best Bond ever(some already are) because he's only been in one movie and I still hold Sean Connery in high regard, but Daniel Craig puts in a fantastic performance as James Bond. He takes what in all rights should be a very easy clichéd role and does something with it. He gives the Bond character depth that I haven't seen before. I also felt he still had the charm that Bond normally has, only it's a bit more subtle this time around. I also liked the rest of the cast, which included Judi Dench as M and Eva Green as Vesper Lynd. Both do a credible job here. This movie also has a ton of action. The first fifteen to twenty minutes alone(which consists of a chase through a construction site and an attack on an embassy) were great but then the rest of the movie flows nicely after it. The finale also gave me my money's worth, as there's a gunfight within the confines of a building that is sinking into the water! Just great. I also liked the references to the other movies that came up here and there. I loved the opening credits and the song 'You Know My Name' by Chris Cornell as well. Very nice.The Bad: I hated the villain. And not in the, 'he's a villain we're supposed to hate him' kind of way but I felt he was a very weak one and not a good foe for 007. I also didn't like the other random villains that suddenly appear in the last half hour. They weren't introduced at all and they are just there. The movie also runs on the long side, and some bits will feel a tad redundant at times. Yes Bond and his girl are in love, yes they have sex a lot, we GET it. Move the story along. I realize what they were trying to do and I appreciate it but we really don't need multiple love scenes to establish that point.The Ugly: A guy cries blood. Yeah that's pretty dumb I felt. I also didn't understand why Felix Leiter was black all of a sudden. Unless this is a complete Bond relaunch and not just a prequel, how does that happen? If it is a relaunch good for them, but it just threw me off a bit. Final Verdict: Casino Royale is not just a good Bond movie, it's a good movie period. It's a fine action movie, it does have a love story in it, and some tension involved with the gambling. Go see it if you haven't already. Rating: **** of *****",Null,1,3,3 December 2006

","The Joe Cool Experience: 300(2007)Starring: Gerard Butler as King Leonidas Lena Headey as Queen Gorgo Dominic West as Theron Rodrigo Santoro as XerxesPlot: When it's learned that the Persians will invade Sparta and all of Greece, King Leonidas takes 300 Spartan soldiers to battle, against the governments wishes, against a million Persian soldiers.As with Sin City, I hadn't actually read the graphic novel(also by Frank Miller) this was based on before seeing the movie. All I had to go on was trailer footage and so had no expectations going in except that I saw some great visuals. What I got with this movie was an excellent action movie. This movie is what it is, a visually-stunning, extremely violent and bloody war movie. Let's start with the visuals. The same technology for Sin City I believe was used here, but you really can't tell. While that movie felt like a comic book/film noir, this uses it to make everything visually pleasing. The colors are bright and vivid, the action scenes are slowed down for full impact. The slowing down was stupid for some, but I found it to be a nice change of pace from the ultra fast cut-cut-cut fight scenes we're used to lately. The effects also brought some otherworldly creatures to life, making this movie a combination of the true story of the Battle of Thermopylae and adding Greek mythology in there as well. We know that hunchbacks didn't exist and Xerxes probably was not that big, but it all enhances the viewing experience.Secondly, this movie was ultra-violent. It's a war movie so it needed to be. Lots of blood everywhere with things like beheading, impalements, limbs lost, eye damage, arrows, blood everywhere. When this thing gets going it gets bloody and that worked just fine for me. The acting, on some parts can go borderline-cheesy, so that would be one beef I had with this movie. Gerard Butler comes close to that area but manages to reign himself in to provide a solid performance as King Leonidas. The same can't be said for the majority of the other cast. In some ways the absurdity hinders it, and in other ways it helps. It makes it feel like a comic book, with over-the-top villains and lots of fight scenes.I can't go a full rating for this movie, as I just feel it's not up to that standard(due to some lines spoken and acting) but I will recommend 300 because it's just a movie that every one should see. Especially the guys who want a bad-ass action flick.Rating: **** of *****",Null,2,5,22 March 2007
V for Vendetta," A Must-See, Regardless Of Your Political Beliefs
","The Joe Cool Review: V for Vendetta(2006)Starring: Natalie Portman as Evey Hammond, Hugo Weaving as V, Stephen Rea as Finch and John Hurt as Adam SutlerPlot: In a future where America is destroyed and England is the top power, it is run by a totalitarian government, with freedoms taken away and people of different religions, political beliefs and sexual preferences persecuted. A lone man codenamed V uses terrorist tactics to convince the people of England there needs to be a change.Openers: I had heard many good things about this, but also some bad ones. I myself was torn because it was from the creators of the Matrix, but I thought it may be too political for my liking. I am happy to say that V for Vendetta eliminated my worries and was everything I was hoping it would be. It's an action film with messages about freedom and how corrupt governments are bad. Well that's basically the gist anyway. Some people say this movie defames our own US government and some say it glorifies terrorism. I disagree, but I'm not going to get into a political debate as this is a movie review.The Good: The movie tells a very well-crafted story. It shows you how the futuristic government is corrupt, everything from controlling the media to banning controversial works of art, music and literature. Everything and everyone that the leader of the government doesn't like is either banned or black-bagged(arrested). If you don't like it, you're arrested. If you break curfew, you're arrested. In fact there are images here that remind me of the Third Reich(when Sutler is campaigning his troops outside of Parliament in flashback sequences) and the Holocaust. That just shows you what kind of government you are dealing with here. The two main characters and back story for why this all came to be is fleshed out and I couldn't see any real plot holes. Natalie Portman did well, as did the supporting cast, but my main focus is on Hugo Weaving, who plays V. You might remember him as Agent Smith. For someone that can't show facial emotions because of the fact he is always behind a mask, Weaving still manages to emote with body language and the tone of his voice. That takes some talent. He flowed through his scenes with ease and made you care for his character. Portman again did very well, although she did have some trouble keeping up the British accent. Also, the fight scenes are really well-done(considering who directed this it's no surprise) and there is plenty of bloodshed. And, I won't give it away but the final sequence is a sight to behold.The Bad: This movie is not perfect, however. While the story is solid it does not flesh out some of the minor characters as well as I would have liked. The villains are just that, corrupt government officials. I at least would have liked more back story on Sutler. Also, this movie has a flaw in that regardless of whether or not you agree with it's political motivations, it does tend to get a bit preachy. It doesn't fail to hammer the message and by the time the movie reaches it's climax you're thinking, 'Okay, I get it. Corrupt governments are bad.' The movie can have a message, but it shouldn't try to force people to accept it. I would also have appreciated some sort of epilogue, but I can understand why it wasn't included.The Ugly: A guy falls right on his head and neck in a spot that made me cringe. Also scar tissue from being burnt is never nice to look at. I won't say who but it was pretty nasty. Nothing else of note for this category.Final Verdict: V for Vendetta was an enjoyable two hours and certainly a movie I'd pay to see again. Who would think an action movie could be so politically motivated and blend them both well? This one pulls it off. Highly recommended.Rating: ****1/2 of *****",Null,2,5,31 March 2006
