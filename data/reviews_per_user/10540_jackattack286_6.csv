The Ring," Never Fails to Scare Me
","I don't care what anyone says, this is hands-down the scariest thing I've ever seen. And the way it carries out the scares is fantastic. It doesn't give you the usual 'BOO!' to jump you out of your seat. Instead, the film makes sure you're throughly disturbed and on edge and then keeps building the suspense. Without giving any spoilers, I loved the way the movie pulled the rug out from under you with a seemingly happy-all-the loose-ends-tied-up-ending changing into one of the scariest scenes I have ever seen. If Jaws made us afraid of sharks, and Poltergeist of clown dolls, then this is the movie to walk away from scared of static on your television.",10,1,2,1 May 2003
Shaun of the Dead," Smart, funny, gory - What doesn't it have?
","I liken seeing Shaun of the Dead to a life-changing experience - you'll never look at zombies movies the same way again. Following right in the footsteps of such esteemed flicks as Evil Dead 2 and Brain Dead, Shaun of the Dead tells the story of loser Shaun, his nagging girlfriend, his even bigger loser friend and flatmate, and the rest of his friends and family as he stumbles through a zombie outbreak, at times literally. The humor ranges from broad (leafing through albums to decide which are low enough quality to be thrown at advancing zombies' heads) to more subtle touches(As Shaun sits on the bus and observes a pedestrian mysteriously collapse, the passenger behind him plays the techno song Zombie Nation.)The pace is quick, the gore is more than acceptable, and the jokes never misses a beat. If you enjoy movies about Brits beatin' on Zombies just so they get down to the pub, see this movie. And see it even if you don't.10/10",10,0,1,17 September 2004
BASEketball," Very funny, underated movie
","When you see BASEketaball on the shelf at the video store, you may think it looks crude, gross, and ridiculous. You'd be right, but it is also very, very funny. The idea of 'a game where guys with bad backs and knees can compete with guys all hopped on steriods' really works for this movie. Never have I seen some many background jokes going on while the characters are telling theirs up close to the camera. One of my favorites is of groundkeepers chasing chickens on the field after a game on promotional 'Free-Range Chicken Night.' They go through low-tech methods before upgrading to a vacuum that sprays feathers out of its exhaust. If you're looking for a classy movie, skip this one. But if you're willing to sit down and relax with some lowbrow humor - this one's for you.",9,0,1,27 March 2003
Van Helsing," Boring and nonsensical
","Let me start off ny saying that the minute I heard about the concept for this movie, I was against it. Learning that Abraham Van Helsing (the real Van Helsing) was being replaced with 'Gabriel' was a small comfort. Right from the beginning, any source material was thrown straight out the window. Instead of investing any intrest in the main characters, I found myself rooting for the town undertaker/gravedigger who seemed to possess the innate ability to lead every Transylvanian mob. The only positive thing I could say about this movie is that the graphics involved in animating a flying vampiress/demoness have progressed greatly since the days of Sam Raimi's Army of Darkness. In fact, instead of wasting any of your money on this overblown piece of $#!*, go out and rent Army of Darkness. You'll get more that your money's worth with twice the plot! Seriously though, don't see Van Helsing unless you wish to indulge your inner masochist.",1,0,1,7 May 2004
Army of Darkness," One of the funniest, campy-est, goriest movies out there
","Last Halloween, I rented this movie and the original Evil Dead, having no idea what I was in for, and I was not disappointed at all. This movie embodies cheesy, gross horror film violence, and gets the audience to laugh along with it, instead of at it. A fun trip from start to finish, Bruce Campbell never fails to absolutely kick ass. If you see only one gut-splattering horror movie this year, see this one. And then see the other two Evil Dead movies, because they are everything a funny, scary, gross-out horror movie should be.",10,2,3,23 April 2003
Identity," Good solid thriller
","Identity was overall a solid movie, with twist you didn't really see coming. There were a few flaws, however. The movie felt a little light in terms of scares. I wasn't startled enough to stay on the edge of my seat. Also, the movie slowed down a bit toward the end. The best sequences in the movie had to be the opening set up of coincidences, and the ending which came out of nowhere. Not a great movie, but good. And definitely not scarier than The Ring.",8,0,0,27 April 2003
