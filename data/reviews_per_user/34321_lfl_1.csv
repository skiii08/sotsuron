The Ring," What a hyped up film this is..
","Okay, I read some write ups and expected to see a really decent film, plaudits were not that thin on the ground after all.Most people are familiar with so called scary films, they are everywhere, and often they don't work at all, like this one. I had hoped however, I would be in with a chance when I went to see this offering, but in fact, no chance! The whole thing is a mixture of impossible scenarios that totally lack any kind of credibility coupled with a loose story line that never begins to work.Take my advice, keep your hard earned in your pocket and keep it for something else.. Just a thought, maybe some youngsters will get a buzz from this film, if they are impressionable enough, but I suppose even that is not really a fair comment, most young people nowadays are smart enough to recognise a dud when they see one, which sadly, this is.",4,1,2,16 March 2003
