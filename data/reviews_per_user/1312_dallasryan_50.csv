The Lobster," A Weird Delight
","The Lobster brings me back to a nostalgia that I used to find in Terry Gilliam films such as Brazil and 12 Monkeys. A very odd film in a very weird dystopian society. The Lobster is very Ayn Rand like in it's message and humor. A film which questions the very existential nature of one's own individuality. A genius of a film in many ways, zany in other ways and everything else in between for the rest.Colin Farrell nails it in his role as someone who is kind of human, but almost robotic in a robotic like society. Very funny at times and well acted by the entire cast.A must see film for the ages.",7,0,2,6 December 2016
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," What a Great Movie
","Probably one of the best romance movies in years, and maybe the best all time for high school movie romances. Great chemistry, great acting. Logan Lerman is a great actor and will be going very far with his career. His performance along with Emma Watson's are the glue of the film.All around though a very well made movie, it takes it's subtle time with anticipation to make all of those little nuances pay off towards the end.Also not just a great romantic movie, but a very deep psychological look at someone going through the troubles of life and then some such as school, child abuse, mental illness, suicide and suicidal thoughts, and this movie amazingly deals with them on such a true and sincere level, no BS with this movie.I also like the fact that Lerman's character has to take the initiative such as going up to someone and trying to make a friend at the high school football game to having the guts to go out and dance on the dance floor with 2 people he likes as friends. Most films would have the person being shy and then the other person would bring that person out of their shy-box, but in life it never really works like that, if you're shy or not, you usually have to take the initiative, and I like that also about this movie. A great film to watch, you will not be disappointed.",10,0,0,10 December 2013
Source Code," It Works for What it Is
","The Source Code is not bad, but not great either. It works for what it is. It's one and two dimensional in which it only scratches the surface for the subject matter it is speaking about. A much better movie that goes deeply down the rabbit hole on this kind of subject matter and explores limitless possibilities is Mr. Nobody with Jared Leto. Again though, the Source Code isn't bad, it makes for an interesting story. The acting is good by Jake, and Vera, and a little over the top cheesy by Miss Michelle, but still not bad. At one point in the film Jake's character talks about if he can change the train accident from happening would that alter another world and Jeffrey Wright's character said no, in which Jeffrey Wright's character was wrong of course according to this movie. Basically though through the Fifth Dimension, the mind, Jake's character creates a parallel universe and even a multiverse. In the so called 'real' world, Jake's character is dead, Vera's character is probably imprisoned, and so forth and so on. But now in this other multiverse, Jake's character is still incubated, Vera and Jeffrey's character no nothing about any bomb threatening a train, and so forth and so on. Then in the other dimensional world, Jake's character lives happily ever after with Michelle in another man's body. Very smart and great concept, but again, only scratches the surface. Still not bad to watch though.",7,0,0,12 May 2014
The Hunger Games," Interesting Concept But Very Insulting
","I haven't read the book. No nothing about it. Based on what I watched though in The Hunger Games, the concept is brilliant. Wars destroying everyone and everything, reverting back to Roman like times but also having a mix of modern times with Reality TV, having tribute games to satisfy the 'the suffering/the anniversary of when it all ended and/or satisfying the Gods in some sense of the matter', et al. But the big gap in the film, the major gap that is insulting is having kids do the fighting as the tributes, kids killing each other in gruesome, horrible ways. No one in their right mind would accept this and there would have been a lot more riots from the get go then the one that is in the film. Not saying that children/adolescents haven't been executed in time of wars or just killed in wars period, but the point that people would actually want to watch a Reality Tribute TV show about adolescents killing each other is just plain stupid. I can buy that people could be conditioned over time with watching tough warrior adults killing each other on Reality TV, that's why Arnold Schwarzenegger's The Running Man is a good flick because it could ring true. Plus in The Running Man, they are criminals killing each other in the Arena. But with kids being picked to kill each other, no way, there's just some things people would never be conditioned on no matter how much you tried to condition them to accept it, and watching kids kill each other on Reality TV is one of them. It is said that Michael Haneke hates human beings. This may or may not be true. But it has also been said that Michael Haneke was so upset on what movie audiences liked, such as torture films that were glorified to be cool and entertaining. Ergo Michael Haneke made a film called Funny Games. Haneke demonstrates in both versions of Funny Games how unbelievably awful true torture is, that it isn't entertaining or glorifying in any way, so in some sense of the word, Funny Games was Haneke's way of bringing people back into reality and was also in some sense his big F U to audiences who love torture films. My point is, if Michael Haneke was ever to get a hold of directing any of the sequels that were to come for The Hunger Games(which i'm sure there will be a dozen, only until they stop making lots of money), you better believe Haneke would show the true nature of what it would be like to watch kids kill each other on TV. Nothing glorified about it, as was the case with The Hunger Games, Haneke would make us sick to our stomachs the way he did with Funny Games after he was finished doing a Hunger Games Sequel. But of course, Haneke would never get ahold of a sequel to The Hunger Games. That's just a hypothetical. The Producers of these types of movies want to make money and keep people in the dark, not brought into the light.",5,0,2,5 April 2013
Don Jon," The Statement is Great, the Movie, Pretty Okay
","For what the statement is saying about the world is very powerful and true to modern day living. The movie as a whole is pretty okay to good. Great acting all around. Always great to see Rob Brown doing stuff as he's a great actor.Very true statements to where everything is detached anymore and the character Don Jon finds his way back to a humanity that he never quite knew before. I love the line his sister gives in the movie, the only line she has but you cheer when she says it. How many of us would love someone as aware as his sister. Although she's detached, or might I say attached at the hip to her cell phone, however one can't blame her with the kind of non sense family she has to deal with.The ending is sublime, as we all just see where it goes, enjoy the moment with ourselves and each other, and just see where the now takes us in our humanity, not our detachment.",7,2,2,28 February 2014
Deadpool 2," Better than the first
","The role Ryan Reynolds was born to play! Fast, Slick and always funny, in fact laugh out loud funny for a lot of the way through, better than the first. Love TJ Miller, his lines are always funny, but heard he will not return which is a shame. Best line of the movie, 'It's a fanny pack you sick bastard!'A must see for all comic fans, comedy fans and Ryan Reynolds fans. You won't be disappointed. If you liked the first, you'll love this one!",9,2,3,3 September 2018
Midnight in Paris," What can You Say about Allen
","He's brilliant, Woody Allen. He can have so many things going on and make you look at what's wrong with all of them and at the same time be smart about it, without getting too condescending. Midnight in Paris is basically telling you 'come to terms with what you really want, stop the denial, stop fighting what is.' Owen Wilson's character wants to live in Paris. He finally does that. Let's take a look at the Life Lesson 101 this film is dealing with: 1. Would it matter what time period you lived in? Allen is saying no, as Joel O'Steen says, 'Happiness is a choice', almost to the eye of the beholder. Where ever you go you'll be happy or unhappy, the glass is full/half full concept.2. If Rachel McAdams' character had some awareness, she would have realized that Wilson's character was 10 times more brilliant than her one dimensional 'so called' intellectual friend Paul. This is the case with most people unfortunately in relationships, friendships, and families. 3. In order to have new growth, you have to let go of what's dead, in this movie's case Wilson's character lets go of McAdams' character and the United States, and the new growth that comes to him is living in Paris, writing a better book and meeting a new girl who is nice, who doesn't mind walking in the rain and who, I might add, doesn't have a stick up her butt like McAdams' character and her parents. 4. You can learn anything about life from anything and anybody if you're open to it. I believe Woody Allen is saying Read some freaking books because you'll learn a lot about yourself and the great riddles of life through some great books such as books by Hemingway, Eliot, and so forth and so on. This is definitely a movie worth watching for the viewer, to almost find out and to get down to the nitty gritty about what we really want for our individual selves in this life. Not what we think we should do, or what we think is the right thing to do, or what is safe, but just what we really want without worrying about what anyone else will think of us. A great movie to see!",9,0,0,23 May 2012
Hotel Rwanda," What can you say, A great movie!
","Everything under the moon has been said about this movie. The real aspect this film should bring to the viewer is how lucky or blessed we are to live in a republic of the United States of America. If nothing else, this movie should bring some awareness into your life. Don Cheadle's performance is so excellent in this movie, just brilliantly acted all the way around by every actor from top to bottom. It's said that close to 3 million people were killed during all of this in Rwanda. And then 2,000 miles away Somalia was having their ordeal as well during the time that this movie takes place. The film Black Hawk Down shows the struggles 'in a day in the life in Somalia'. Almost a million were killed in Somalia when it was all said and done and overall in Rwanda and Somalia about close to 2 million people went unaccounted for, and I can only guess that probably half of those people were dead and were just not found. A truly great movie that Hotel Rwanda is, so very thought provoking that it will make you think twice about how 'bad' it is where we live(meaning the U.S.) The United States isn't perfect, believe me, but it's truly a blessing to live here, and we shouldn't forget that. And this movie reminds us of that. A must see!",8,1,1,1 June 2012
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Looking at it as a Metaphor
","Everything has been said on IMDb and everywhere else about Return of the Jedi once, twice, a million times, okay maybe not a million times, but I want to bring up something that's only been maybe brought up, say, a few hundred times. Where Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi lead is to a great metaphor on life. My grandfather promised my Uncle, when my Uncle was 15 years old, that he could take the car out to a school dance if my Uncle cleaned the car, cleaned it really good and so my Uncle worked on the car all day, cleaned it perfectly as I'm told from my sources. My grandfather decided it didn't look good enough and told my Uncle he couldn't go,(unfortunately this way of being is my Grandfather's M.O.), so my Uncle took the car anyway and went to the school dance, when he got back, my grandfather kicked him out of the house, and my Uncle has lived on his own since he was 15 years of age. That's who my Grandfather is, in so many ways or words my grandfather is the Emperor, and my Uncle as a metaphor is Luke, and all of us make a choice in life on whether we become Vader or not. You can imagine the hate my Uncle had for my Grandfather, and he doesn't talk to my grandfather to this day, which I don't blame him, I wouldn't either, but my Uncle let that hate go, and even though his life hasn't been perfect, he's lived his life, a good life, and he's been married for almost 50 years now, and I'm proud of him. It wasn't easy for my Uncle though, he could have easily chosen the dark path, a path of drugs, murder, prison, just a path of hatred towards everyone and resentment towards my grandfather for his whole life(believe me, my Uncle has had resentment towards my grandfather over the years, but he let it go eventually, and I don't blame him for having that resentment either).The same goes for Luke, he makes a choice, and it's all about choice, Happiness is a choice, everything is a choice no matter where you been. Some things in life are more messed up than others, and in the end, it's how you deal with them. It's okay to be human and feel anger and sadness, and whatever, but it's how you recover that defines you. I once heard someone say that 'It isn't the easy times in life that define one's manhood, it's the tough times that do.' Luke almost kills his father and becomes evil, going past the point of no return which leads to a bad heart, a victim mentality, and never being able to finally forgive and move on and live his life. Luke is angry, but he ends up doing the right thing, and he forgives his father in the end. Perhaps it might not have been so easy for Luke to forgive Vader if Vader, Luke's father, would have lived, but that's the 'what if' and the 'who knows' which one can't or should probably not dwell on too often. The 'what ifs' and the 'who knows' are out of our control anyway. Luke didn't go to the dark side as he could have easily gone to, but Luke is a good-strong person, he was tested, just like we're all tested in life(I say 'tested' in the meaning of we're all going to go through the ebb and flows of life sometimes, again some greater than others), just like my Uncle, and that metaphor, on top of so many other great things the Star Wars Trilogy offers, is priceless. Again, as so many have said, thank you George Lucas.",8,0,1,11 February 2012
The Best Years of Our Lives," The First of The Best
","I think The Best Years of Our Lives is rightly justified as being on AFI's 100 Best Films list. However, It is a long and somewhat boring movie, but it's one of the first films to really show soldiers coming home back to, well, their regular lives again(The Best Years of Our Lives is the pioneer in that category, which is a very valid and significant topic in history). Going back to the same job, to the family you love, dealing with the same problems and/or new problems as is the case in Homer's situation. Life goes on and stands still for no one. The acting is fantastic in this movie, and it's also very significant in the fact that it is the very first film to ever use a disabled actor in a leading role, that actor being Harold Russell.Originally I thought Russell's performance was perfect except for the fact that he seemed very disconnected to the girl he came back to, and what I mean by this is, it didn't seem as though Russell was connecting the emotion to the scene with her but then I realized that his disconnection was perfect in the scenes with the girl he came back to(played by Cathy O'Donnell). The confusion of what he's feeling is the true genius of his acting with O'Donnell in those scenes, whether he meant to or not, it was great acting and Russell won the academy award that year for best supporting actor.This is a movie that makes you think and that will effect you more(that you will probably realize you like more) as it digests more in your system over a few days or a few months or even a few years. Every one of us can relate in some way to the 3 main characters in The Best Years of Our Lives and I, myself personally, have had a girlfriend just like Dana Andrew's character had in the movie, I mean delineated to the core, so I felt his pain in a lot of ways.Also, I really enjoy the real world feeling this movie generates. It's a real solid script as There are no Cliché speeches given here. Things are dealt with in a real manner, a true to life manner and I respect that about this film.The Best Years of Our Lives is a very significant movie, and should be seen, at least once, by anyone who considers themselves to be a film buff or film historian so that they can truly appreciate the pioneer movie of this kind of material.",7,2,4,17 January 2012
Interstellar," Dream Within a Dream
","The Nolan Brothers, wow, what can you say. Writer's of Conscious, genius what they come up with. Christopher Nolan is so specific and particular to everything to where it makes most of his movies great. There's so much going on in this movie that I would do Interstellar injustice by putting it in a vacuum, so I will simply state that I wasn't sure how I felt about this movie until the last 20 minutes came and brought it altogether where it hit you out of nowhere on how brilliant it was. Amazing how certain films can do that. Lost in Translation and Found are the same way. Not sure how I felt about the films until the very end, and then the ending is what brought it altogether. The ending for Interstellar, Lost in Translation and Found are what made these films beyond great, the ending of these films are what made these films transcend themselves beyond the boundaries of greatness. And somehow Nolan's genius transcends greatness with this film.In a way, Interstellar is almost a spiritual sequel to Inception i.e. 2 days after I had finished watching Interstellar, I had a dream about something in my life that then went to the scene where Mcconaughey's character is crying profusely as he drives forth, leaving his daughter behind. I woke up from my dream and thought about that scene all day, and then thought about how great Interstellar was, and all kinds of different emotions, feelings and sensations were filling my body. As if I had gone through Inception, a dream within a dream. As if an idea and feelings had been put into my head. It felt like Inception. I thought how genius it was for the movie Inception to lead you to Interstellar. I thought perhaps this was how Nolan had been lead to the idea, the concept of it all.",8,0,2,29 June 2016
10 Things I Hate About You," Charisma, Romance, Ledger, Icon Discussion
","I will talk about the movie a little bit in this review and then I will talk more about just Heath Ledger. First off, This is a very romantic and cute movie to watch. All the romance is genuine and terrific. The chemistry is really there with the two different couples(Ledger and Stiles, Oleynik and Gordon-Levitt) and you like the characters, you dislike the bad guys and it has one of the most romantic scenes in history where Ledger's character sings to Stiles' character on the Football field.This is a classic and it's where I first noticed Heath Ledger. This is a movie where the character that Ledger plays should not be liked this much, and Ledger brought this character to such a deep level that only a great actor like Ledger could do. Only time will tell if Heath Ledger will become a Movie Icon, but I think it's fair to say with performances like this one and many others that he had, he most certainly will. I think what makes a great movie icon is the fact that the actor/actress has to be a great actor(with a few exceptions) and they also have to have a lot of likability about them, which co-exists with good acting as well as co-exists with a certain humility about that actor/actress. A few examples are James Dean and John Wayne.People forget John Wayne was a fantastic actor and he was such a cool guy and the same goes for James Dean as well. You could identify with Wayne and Dean through their extreme likability and great acting. Patrick Swayze wasn't the greatest actor but he had extreme likability, and I think over time he'll be a movie icon too. And to kind of give an example more about the likability factor, in Heath Ledger's last film, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, 4 actors played the same character(because Heath Ledger had passed away and 3 other actors did the part to finish up the film). All 4 actors were good in their own way. The 4 actors were Heath Ledger, Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell. Now Johnny Depp will be a Movie Icon, no doubt about that, he already kind of is. But my point is, Heath Ledger was the only actor as the character in the movie, who would really let you in, really let you in to a part of his soul. The other 3 actors were great, but they had some distance to them, you could appreciate their acting, but you couldn't get into them as a person/a human being. Ledger had always been very charismatic with all his roles, and he didn't have distance, he always let the audience in close to him, into his soul almost, into his humanity and you never quite get that from Johnny Depp, Jude Law, or Colin Farell, all great actors, but they're always a little distant in all their roles, with the exception of Farell who will let you in with certain roles he's played. I think Heath Ledger will be a great Movie Icon over time and he is also the big reason why 10 Things I Hate About You was such a great and special kind of movie. Heath Ledger let you into his humanity in this movie, and because of that, 10 Things I Hate About You wasn't just your usual teeny bop, cheesy romance movie. It had some substance, it had some real driven emotions, sincere humanity and love to it. You don't usually find that kind of substance within a film like this one, in this genre, but because of Heath Ledgers performance in particular and the other ones, 10 Things I Hate About You is a very romantic, very special and great movie to watch by yourself or with the girl or guy you love.",8,0,0,30 June 2012
Kung Fu Panda 2," It works
","The first Kung Fu Panda I would give an 8, it's pretty solid all the way around and the concept is a little new and fresh. This 2nd outing of the Kung Fu Panda doesn't have the new aspect to it, and the story is a little lacking, but for the most part, it's not too bad. I like the zen like quality both Kung Fu Panda's bring to the table. The characters are likable and funny and I really give this movie it's 6 because of the theme it has, which is, 'You don't have to condemn yourself for eternity, your past is your past, what you do now is what define's you and makes you who you are.' Both movies have a good feeling of hope and a Zen-Eckhart Tolle like atmosphere. Kung Fu Panda 2 is good for the kids and is a good lesson for the adults.",6,1,2,1 June 2012
Warrior," A Movie For Anybody with a Beating Heart
","If you only like to watch movies that have a dazzling twist at the end or where you really do not know what will happen next, then Warrior might not be for you. Warrior is Cliché in movie terms, but cliché in real life terms too which is not cliché but is. Make sense? Warrior is a movie where you know the direction it's heading in, but at the same time, it's a movie with some very real, disturbing and painful issues going on. The MMA fighting is what's going on on the surface, but beneath the surface, that's where the movie really lies, and that's what makes Warrior a truly great film and above most(if not all)films in this genre. So if a moviegoer only likes movies that dazzle them with a Sixth Sense twist or where they don't know what is going to happen next in the film, then again, that moviegoer may or may not like Warrior and that would be a shame, and quite myopic in my opinion(Although you don't fully know what will happen in Warrior thanks to Tom Hardy's performance as Tommy). Warrior is extremely well acted, it's extremely well edited, the director Gavin O'Connor knows how to time reaction shots exactly where they need to be, because a lot of rooting for the Main Character's is going to be through those precise, calculated reaction shots on the ones that are cheering in the film and because of those perfect reaction shots on the ones cheering in the film, there will be a lot of cheering for us, the ones watching the film. Also, The movie has a great score, every great movie needs a great score or at least one that flows organically well with the movie. The story and some of the lines/dialogue are heartbreaking, and anybody who has ever gone through any rough spots in their life, will be affected in some way by this movie, and you may need a box of tissues because this movie runs through the very highs and the very low's of pretty much every emotion that a human being can feel, and you as the movie watcher will probably be going through all the emotions that this movie evokes out of you, so you may catch yourself getting tears in your eyes here and there, as I did. There are no false moments in this movie, it is what it is, it's merciless and there is no easy way out for these characters. As in life, sometimes things have to come to a head whether we like it or not, sometimes they have to come to a head in order for there to be change, forgiveness, and rebirth which in turn usually makes it all for the better in our lives. The real shame is this movie did not do well at the box office. It had a great trailer that made me want to see it, but unfortunately there are no box office Superstars in it(yet), which is what the masses usually seem to want. The irony is, on AFI's 100 best film list of all time, 42 out of the 100 movies were not box office successes in their time that they came out at, but only as time went by, did they become regarded as 'great films' and 'Historically and/or Cinematically Significant'. Citizen Kane was a box office dud at it's time, I forget, what number is Citizen Kane on AFI's List? ;)..Unfortunately for Warrior, it was a box office dud, and it also hasn't had the campaigning that a lot of these other movies have, that aren't as good as Warrior, that are heavily campaigning for Media Buzz, Golden Globe, Oscar, Award buzz, etc. So again, Warrior got completely gypped out of any Golden Globe Nods, then it got one nomination for the SAG awards, so I can only imagine that it might get one Oscar Nom for Nolte in the best supporting actor category. However, if there was any justice, and if the academy awards wanted to make it up to Warrior with the string of bad luck it's had, they would make it up to this movie for nominating it for the nominations it deserves. It deserves a best film editing nomination, a best supporting actor nomination(either Nolte or Hardy), and a best film nomination. And if the Academy really wanted to do Warrior a full justice, it would give both Nolte and Hardy a nomination for best supporting actor and Gavin O'Connor a best director nomination and finally Jennifer Morrison a best supporting actress nomination as she is highly underrated in this film. To make amends with this film would be to give it 6 Academy Award Nominations. I'm just saying. But with how things go with the campaigning, Warrior might be lucky to get 1 or 2 Oscar Noms, but I hope I'm wrong about that.",10,0,3,8 January 2012
Judgment at Nuremberg," Always Grey, but What's Right is Right because it is Right
","This film shows all the grey in life, and how it truly is almost never black and white. This movie shows the sickening display of people that we are suppose to respect, trust and show a high regard towards, but it also proves that it's a mean and deceptive world, but what can make it right is you, the individual, you have the control to do what's right because it is right. A fantastically acted movie, so many things going on here, but I'll just point out one, the true irony of the fact that the American Judges are judging the German Judges on Trial. Now, there's so much grey going on with the judging of the German Judges and whether the German judges cause was just or not. But Spencer Tracy's character brings up a great and universal point about Criminal Law, and what that definition means universally, whether you're going off of orders or not. And I think we can all agree with what Tracy's character says there about Criminal Law. But the fact that the U.S. Higher Ups start to give the American Judges and the American Lawyers a tough time about finding the German Judges guilty or not, because the U.S. now needs the Germans as America's allies against the Russians, is the true irony. The American judges almost become exactly like the German Judges, just in different circumstances. But Tracy's character stood up for the injustice, and he stood up for the true morals and values of not just the United States, but for mankind and for what he, the individual, believed was right. Tracy's character was the best of them all because he had true moral fiber, and remembered what 'life, liberty and justice for all' really meant. That's why Lancaster's character had such deep respect for Tracy's character at the end of the film. A great movie to see, but not a good movie for viewers who only look and see things as black and white because there will be very many good points on both sides during the duration of this film. So it's good to have an open mind when viewing this one. I'll end this review with a quote from Tracy's character in the movie(a quote of a few great quotes from Tracy's character in the film). '...It's what it stands for, when standing for something is the most difficult! Before the people of the world - let it now be noted in our decision here that this is what we stand for: justice, truth... and the value of a single human being!'",9,0,1,29 July 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Comparing the Two- New vs. Original
","I just watched this new version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Comparing to the original is difficult because both movies are so good in their own way. The Swedish version explains the main story better, and unravels it more like a mystery that you, the viewer, are figuring out with Lisbeth and Mikael, where I felt the new one went to quick over the main story. The Swedish version didn't have the ending which I liked in this new one, but the Swedish version implied a lot of that ending in the 2nd and 3rd films(Except it didn't imply the last 2 minutes of this new ones ending). I thought Rooney Mara was excellent, she looked more like the novel(from what I've heard at least, as I haven't read it), but she still looked too feminine in my opinion, where Noomi Rapace looked more dykie and butch(more manly), but she didn't have as many piercings and she didn't have her eyebrows shaved either, stuff like that. I think both movies were great, but I think Noomi embodied the character of Lisbeth a little better, in my own opinion at least. Both really good movies though. Of course this new one had better sound, a better music score, and better film quality just because it's David Fincher and it's American made, which the Swedish film didn't have that kind of budget so they had to make due with what they had in making the Original. Also in the Swedish one Lisbeth and Mikael do have sex, but she's more disconnected from him with her feelings as in this one, Lisbeth(Rooney Mara) clearly shows that she's falling in love with Mikael(Daniel Craig). Both portrayals of Lisbeth are great in their own unique way and I really did like the ending on this new one a lot, and the finale scene with Stellan Skarsgard as the bad guy was a lot better executed and better acted by Skarsgard as well, than the original. I really love the Lisbeth character, there are not a lot of great female roles for women in Hollywood or Film in general, and I think the Lisbeth character is one of the best female roles of all time, and I think Noomi and Rooney both hit the character right on the mark with who Lisbeth is and also giving that feeling of wanting to be with Lisbeth, having that longing to be with Lisbeth and wanting to know who Lisbeth is, but again, I thought that 'longing for' aspect was better executed with Noomi's performance only because that's how those original movies were written, where this new one is written for Lisbeth(Rooney Mara) to show more of her feelings towards Mikael. One could see the Swedish version for the sheer fact of Noomi's performance, because really it's all about Lisbeth anyway, how interesting and complex she is. Also, the actor who played Mikael in the original, Daniel Craig's part in the new one, I felt the actor playing Mikael in the original was better, he looked more plump, he just looked more like the part and he was more subtle in his performance. Daniel Craig was good, but I feel the other actor in the original was better. In the end, I like the Original The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo a little bit better. Of course, If I would have seen the new The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo first, I would be comparing the original to the new one, instead of comparing the new one to the original. So if I would have seen the new one first, I might have liked the new one better just because that's kind of how us human beings work, we always feel more of an attachment to the first one we see, whether it be the original or remake of that film. Kind of like when we read a book and then see the movie. If we see the movie first and then read the book, sometimes we like the movie better because that's what we identified with first. The Psychology of the human being is interesting. Just like the Internal Psychology of Lisbeth is interesting, no, it's fascinating!!",8,2,7,30 April 2012
Gandhi," Gandhi is Good in a world where we Need to 'Give them Something to Fight About'
","Gandhi was a great movie. It was meant to be during his time that there would be someone like him. That's how it was meant to be. It just goes to show the universal theme, everyone in India rises together and focuses on getting the British out. Once the British are out, then their focus goes to how much they hate each other, the Muslims hating the HIndu's, the Hindu's hating the Muslims as then a Civil War starts to break out. Then let's say those problems get eradicated, then they would focus on which water is better to drink, Dasani or Aquafina and they would have a war over that. That's why those Miller Lite commercials were always so good, where one group of people would say 'Tastes Great' and the other group of people would disagree and say 'Less Filling' and both groups would start an argument chanting their belief, their belief in beer!! . It was, ironically, a very thought provoking metaphor saying 'We all like the freaking beer, but there will always be something to argue and fight about because we're human beings and that's what we do, we'll argue about which species of Cockroach is the prettiest and probably get in a war over that'. That's exactly what it was about in Gandhi, The Wind that Shakes the Barley and in everyday life pretty much. You can't beat everyday life, but Gandhi tried and in the end he did a lot of good, and he definitely went by what he knew in his heart, not what he saw. That was a lot of what he was saying and conveying too, 'Go by what you know in your heart because you can at least control that, if you can't control the rest of it.' Really great movie. Ben Kingsley gave one of the top 10 greatest performances of all time in Gandhi in my opinion. If you've never seen much of Kingsley's work, watch Gandhi first and then watch him in Sexy Beast.",8,1,1,4 May 2012
Gone with the Wind," One of the Best
","What can you say that hasn't already been said. One of the best films of all time. If you count inflation, it's the biggest money maker of all time as well (domestic gross only).Vivien Leigh gives a very powerful performance and in my opinion, one of the greatest, if not the greatest female acting performance of all time. Clark Gable is perfect as Rhett Butler, the role he was born to play. I had the pleasure of seeing this Gem in the movie theater, the best place to see the classics. A must-must see!!!!!",10,2,3,12 June 2018
City of God," So Close to a 10
","All I can say about this movie is you are in for a treat, this is a wild blood bath with a great story, and some fantastic acting. It has a rated R rating which is tough to believe, I would have thought easily NC-17 but nonetheless, the Academy Voters would never nominate a film like this for best film, which is unfortunate. Although it did get nominated for Best Screenplay and Best Directing which it well deserved that at least. It's very well directed and written. It's even crazier that this is based on a true story and that the characters portrayed in this film really existed. City of God is kind of like the Brazil version of Goodfellas, The Godfather and Heat. Hold on to your seat, you're in for a wild ride of a movie!",9,0,2,3 November 2012
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Quentin Finally Gets it Right!
","Tarantino finally gets a specific genre in film cinema correct! Once Upon a Time in Hollywoood hits the mood of life in '69 perfectly, the ambiance is spot on. Quentin pays homage perfectly to Sergio Leone films, Steve McQueen (as Bounty Law is based off of McQueen's 'Wanted: Dead or Alive' series), and to actors in that specific genre i.e. Harrey Carey jr., Warren Oates, etc. But Quentin also shows the actor incarnate in Dicaprio's Rick Dalton. How it is to have success and then to have it slip through your fingers, as every successful actor goes through it. Dicaprio nails it perfectly showing how sensitive and fragile all actors can be. Pitt's Cliff Booth is a dream role for Pitt as Booth is a little off, but super fun and very cool. Margot Robbie is fantastic as Sharon Tate.Also, Quentin does certain filming in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood that mirrors Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West and Once Upon a Time in America. And as Quentin pays homage to Leone and those Westerns, Quentin also pokes fun at them as well, like how a good friend will bring you up, but also bust your chops.An overall brilliant composition of that film genre and time period, leading to a no holds barred ending in which we all would have preferred. This film is brilliantly written and absolutely hilarious, Quentin's funniest film to date (in close 2nd, 3rd, and 4th - Four Rooms, Pulp Fiction, and True Romance).This is truly Tarantino's Opus and it will be nominated for many academy awards come Oscar season. Tarantino nailed it!",9,10,19,21 August 2019
Mr. Nobody," A Modern Day Masterpiece and The Theories
","It's amazing how Jaco utilizes a lot of science theories into a larger than life movie that is a masterpiece, not just thought provoking, but truly a masterpiece. This movie is the modern day 2001: A Space Odyssey. Jared Leto proves the fine actor he is as playing Nemo young and old. So many concepts and theories this movie talks about. With the String Theory, think of guitar strings. If the strings are loose there is no music to be made, but when the strings are tight as can be, music will be made. String Theory is the same concept, when the strings are tight as can be, the theory is parallel universes can be created or something can be made. The spatial dimensions run in length, width, height. The supposed 4th dimension that Leto's character talks about in the movie is Temporal which is time. So all this ties together when Nemo as a boy has to make a choice by either going with his father or mother. Since the boy was never given the mark by the Angel of Oblivion, he can remember everything, he forgets nothing and he can see into the future. During that point of the boy having to make the decision to go with his mother or father, he sees so quick into the future in both directions, what life would be with his father, and what life would be with his mother, he sees it all in that moment of having to choose which one to go with. His seeing into the future both directions are so tight(the strings are so tight), that within his 4th dimension of time, he creates the supposed 5th dimension, the parallel universes. Nemo creates a bunch of different multi-verses and they're real within they're universe. So Now Leto lives a bunch of lives in alternate universes. Who knows if we all as human beings create many parallel universes within a dream that is so intense or a fantasy in our day dreams. Perhaps in our moments when the strings are so tight, we create parallel universes and perhaps there are many versions of ourselves living in multi-verses like Nemo in Mr. Nobody. So with Nemo seeing which way to go, with father or mother, he finds out through his search that in order to be truly happy, he needs to end up with Diane Kruger's character, Anna, because he loves her so(in order to do that, not go with either parent). Nemo finds out if he goes with Polley's character, even though he loves her whether she lives or dies, it will ultimately be doomed, and Nemo himself will ultimately be doomed physically and emotionally if he goes with Jean. But in the end, Nemo loves Polley's character,Elise, but through everything, Nemo ultimately, is truly in love with Anna. Through the Butterfly Effect, Nemo makes little tweaks and changes in order to be with Anna, but he is ultimately doomed whether it be from his innate fear of water or from her ending up with someone else. With any innate fear, it is said what you put in the universe will ultimately come back to get you which is sometimes your worst fears. Just the slightest little things done or said determines whether Nemo will ever see Anna again or whether he will marry Elise or be with Jean. Nemo comes to the conclusion that the only way for him to truly live a long and wonderful life with Anna, he has to have her end up in the chalk line circle that he makes. Through Chaos theory that nothing ever happens the same way, Nemo is not 100% certain that she will end up in the circle, but that is the only way he can truly be with her after his many different multi-verse journeys. As when Nemo is in the purgatory moment where he is watching a video of his older self, he realizes what he needs to do and that it is real, but yet it's not, it's not the reality he wants to be in. So Nemo has to live his life as a wanderer, a homeless vagrant perhaps and when he awakes, Anna is in the chalk circle. All love prevails. Schrodinger's Cat comes into play here, with everything that came into play, Nemo made the probability that Anna would end up in the circle through this and that err lifting the box to see if the cat was there so to say. With Quasi Immortality it has been found that cloned pigs can reproduce human organs, this part is a fact, but not highly sufficient yet.Finally, with the Big Bang theory, in simplest terms it was the expansion of the universe to expand to where we are now. So with The Big Crunch, it is in simplest terms the reverse of the big bang, where everything goes back into a black hole whether it just goes back or whether humans go back in reverse with it according to the Arrow of Time.If one was to go in reverse in the Big Crunch, one would have to be living, as one would have to have neurons in order to do this. If one is dead, there are no neurons anymore, hence, you couldn't go in reverse. So when Nemo dies, he still has neurons in his body as he has 'just' died, so when the big crunch begins, Nemo goes in reverse. One of the best endings, in my opinion, ever, as far as when Nemo starts laughing as he's going in reverse. Truly epic ending to an epic film. Since our multi-verses would produce neurons as well, perhaps all those multi-verses would go in reverse as well in the Big Crunch. But again this is all in theory. But not to Mr. Nobody, he lived it!!",10,4,6,3 June 2014
Drive," 'Anything happens in that five minutes and I'm yours'-The Driver
","What a great movie this was! The chemistry is amazing between Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan. It has One of the best Car Chase scenes because of how it utilizes the power of sound and sound effects. A lot of careful and precise work was put into Drive's Car Chase scenes, and it shows! Drive's Car Chase scenes beat any of the ones the Fast and the Furious movies ever had. For Drive, It's about quality, not quantity like it is for The Fast and the Furious movies. Drive, like Lost in Translation, is poetry in motion, beautiful poetry from beginning to end. The ending of a film is very underrated a lot of times. In any sport, no matter how you start, you always have to finish to get that win. In chess, you have a beginning, middle, and end, and you're beginning and middle can be fantastic or so-so, but if you have set yourself up for a great ending, then you you use that great ending game to your advantage and get the other opponent in checkmate. Drive and Lost in Translation both had so-so beginning and middles. On both movies, at some parts i would say 'I really like this movie' and then at other parts I would say 'I'm not sure I really like this movie'. But if a movie has set itself up for a good/great ending, the ending can make the movie that was just so-so into a great film! Then, when you watch the movie again, the whole movie is great because of the ending(that you know is coming now) that brings it together. Lost in Translation is one of my favorite movies of all time for what it did with it's ending, bringing it together to be great. The same goes for Drive, the ending is very poetic, almost Shakespeare poetic, that it brings the whole movie together, making Drive a masterpiece! The ending can make or break a film.(An example of a movie that started great and had a great middle was We Were Soldiers, really great movie in the beginning and middle and then the last 15 minutes of the film were much too sappy and contrived, making it an okay movie instead of a great one that it should have been). I really like this director Winding Refn too, he's really got some great things he brings to his films(my first of his that I saw was Bronson, also a terrific film). Refn really puts some great music in his movies as well, and he utilizes that great music at the perfect time within his movies. All in all, I loved this movie, Gosling is Terrifc, Mulligan is terrific, Albert Brooks is scary and has never been better, and Ron Perlman has a pretty interesting part too. A must see for all fans of great filmmaking!",10,0,2,1 April 2012
Kick-Ass," Right on the Money
","This movie really did hit it right on the money. It's what Kill Bill wishes it was. If Tarantino would have understood his material, he could have made great movies out of Kill Bill like Kick-Ass, but Tarantino didn't understand the material, therefore you get Operation Dog Dung with the Kill Bill Movies. But Kick-Ass has a story, it has characters you like and that you care about to where everything flows together in the right direction. Kick-Ass has the perfect amount of kid action and grown up action to where Spiderman had the right amount of kid action but not enough grown up action and Watchmen(which was brilliant as well) didn't quite have the right tone for the younger viewers, which is actually fine with me though because I love Watchmen. But if we're talking about the perfect movie in this genre, then Kick- Ass is almost that movie. The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises take the award for best movies in this genre, in my opinion, but Kick-Ass is definitely in the Top 5. Warren Beatty's Dick Tracy had The Citizen Kane quality camera work going for it, and it had confusion in that classic comic book sense but it still lacked in story and was a little bit too much at times, but Kick-Ass has just the right amount of ingredients for not having too much or too less, it's just right. Chloe Grace Moretz' Hit-Girl makes Saoirse Ronan's Hanna look like a sissy. Hanna could have been a good movie, but it didn't have the writing or the budget, but Saoirse was pretty good in Hanna though nonetheless. But Chloe Grace Moretz owned her part in Kick-Ass as Hit- Girl, and no one can touch her in the girl you don't mess with category. Also, I was very impressed with Nicolas Cage in Kick-Ass as well. He hasn't had great part for a long time, for a very long time and his quirky acting and tone was absolutely perfect for his role as Big Daddy in Kick-Ass. Cage is terrific! Kick-Ass is the movie everyone should see. It utilizes everything in the best possible way, from the use of the internet to all of it's characters, and it truly makes you care about all of them until the very end. A must see.",9,3,4,21 November 2012
Ex Machina," We All See Things Differently
","We indeed all see things different in life, but at the same time one is going to see what they want to see. Why does the catholic nun have dreams of Jesus Christ while the Hindu has dreams of Krisna. We practice what we preach, therefore we see what we want to see. How true this concept is in this film. A brilliant film on multiple levels and from what 'I' see, it's a deep metaphor for our creator. This film will leave you with a lot of open ended questions boggling about in your mind about God and humans or maybe it won't (depending on what you want to see). Pretty slick movie all around, very well acted, Alicia is beautiful to watch, and a great overall sound and music score to it. Most definitely worth the watch.",8,1,3,5 October 2015
Grave of the Fireflies," Very Powerful
","A movie that shows a true look at how it was for some children in Japan during the bombings. Some would work and live in the factories, others would remain with teachers and schools, others would move to the country side with groups and stay with teachers, their families or relatives and others would do what Seita and Setsuko did, stay alone, or run away and stay alone. Either way it was not an easy situation for anyone. The fight for food and shelter was very true in its nature.A very sad look on how war can affect a people on all levels. Truly beautiful movie, and the voice of the little girl Setsuko, done by Rhoda Chrosite, is truly what makes this film even the more crushing.The only credit done by Rhoda Chrosite as I have seen, but the voice for Setsuko gives this film it's sad, alarming and dooming nature. Not an animated film for kids in my opinion, a real tear jerker and one not to forget any time soon. One of the top 10 best animated films in my opinion.",9,1,2,9 July 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," Another one bites the dust
","I was thoroughly looking forward to seeing this one by the good reviews I had heard, but in the end, it ended up being like all of the other action films out there. Boring and lacking. I couldn't believe this film had a 170 million dollar budget. I would have thought about a 10 million dollar budget by the looks of the movie. Vin Diesel probably only had to spend about 2 hours in the studio for his part. Easiest 100 grand he probably ever made. The writing was bad, the direction was bad, in part, a lot of the acting was bad because of the bad writing and direction. I like Chris Pratt, I think he's a great actor, but he wasn't so great in this one. I was very impressed by the voice over done by Bradley Cooper, it sounded nothing like him, and it was an impressive voice he did for that character. Honestly, the character that stole the show, and the reason I'm even giving this ridiculous film a 5 is because of Dave Bautista's performance. He was hilarious as his character, and he's the only reason one should see this film. He creates a character that steals every scene he is in, and he's the only one that actually creates a likable character. Yet, he's the only one who had some good lines too.",5,2,6,28 January 2015
Silence," Enjoy the Silence
","Silence. A beautiful film. Scorsese has done it again. One of the best director's of our time. Andrew Garfield is amazing in the role of Father Rodrigues. Garfield's Rodrigues shows us what it is to truly doubt, to go on the journey of the doubt and arrive full circle to a spot where he has to accept his fate. As the pride of anyone, we want to fight back when there is injustice and not give in if it compromises our beliefs or our pride. Silence is stating To truly know God and Jesus, we almost have to go against ourselves, go against what we want to do. Jesus Christ fought against what he had to do until the very end, and then finally accepted his fate and came to a calmness, maybe not necessarily a peace, but an acceptance. Father Rodrigues comes to this same end, he keeps fighting it, but in the end accepts what he must do to save people and to become closer with God/Jesus. From there on out Father Rodrigues must pray to his God in Silence to save people and to save his own soul. He never loses his faith and becomes closer to God and even though he's come to this acceptance, he still feels inside that he's betrayed the lord. A fantastic film of inner struggle, the inner demons and doubt we feel, the Self vs. Self we all have and the injustice of it all.How we all fight ourselves, and go through a spiritual journey with ourselves, God and mankind. A truly moving picture, an expansive film experience. Wonderful acting, terrific sound, amazing cinematography. Surprising that it didn't get nominated for a lot more academy awards. It has been said that in the time when people truly heard God it was the people of the desert who heard him. They heard him in the Silence of the desert. See this film, a moving ritualistic experience with the heart and soul and oneness of God. Maybe not everything will be understood about this film, but not everything will ever be understood about God. If everything was understood about God, he wouldn't be God.",9,5,8,29 September 2017
Once Upon a Time in America," Rough around the Edges, but Nonetheless...
","Sergio Leone is a brilliant director, first and foremost. He has a way with each camera shot. He finds tension and wonderful moments in the most simplistic of moments. He's a genius. Once Upon a Time in America has some of the same delineation as Once Upon a Time in the West, yet it's missing a lot of the magic that makes Once Upon a Time in the West the great film it is. Once Upon a Time in America is a very good film, but not a great one. The ending is splendid, it makes one think Noodles was dreaming the whole thing, however if that were true then the ending would be when Noodles woke up at the Chinese opium den. However, Noodles dreaming would mean that he didn't find the money and that he got it 35 years later, and that doesn't make sense as he woke up, went to Fat Moe's, got the key, found out no money, so on and so forth. No I think him smiling at the end of the film is his way of saying in two ways that now he gets all the mula to himself and also that he's now rid of this burden of loyalty to friends that he feels like he lost a connection with long ago. From the beginning of the film, Deborah(wonderfully played by Jennifer Connelly and Elizabeth McGovern)states that she loves him but she can never be with him because he's a two bit punk(something to the likes of that). How very true. Noodles puts his hand in the pact they make to share the money even though his lack of enthusiasm shows he wants it all. He had a connections with his friends when he was younger, but after prison you feel the connection is long gone and only there out of loyalty from the history they've had with each other. In the end, Noodles is a loner, is a selfish two bit thug, and he hates himself, the only thing that might make him happy is being with his one true love and when she shatter's that dream, he seems to become numb for good. He then ends up raping the only girl he ever loved because he's certain he'll never see her again and that kills him, but also he just has a self loathing that is calm and well executed through DeNiro's performance. It's almost as if Noodles as a kid was Larry Darrell before the war(Larry Darrell is a character from the Razor's Edge), but after Noodles gets out of prison he is a different man, disconnected, just like Larry Darrell is a different man when he comes back from the war. After 35 years Max has believed he has made Noodles suffer by taking all the money, taking his woman and taking it all. Max believes he has made Noodles suffer after all these years. But again, Noodles comes back, calm, disconnected. He's not mad because he was relieved of that burden, he was relieved of being rid of that old life, to where he got to have a new life for 35 years. Noodles was still miserable, of course he still missed them as us humans do with any loved ones, but that had become innate, his numbness and misery within himself. Max is heart broken that it has no effect on Noodles because Max truly loved Noodles. And Noodles had a love and caring for all his friends, but not the way Max did for Noodles. It was a love story among friends, and how that friendship changed after prison(But how it was still always different even from childhood, just changed more after prison). In the end it hurt Max, and he ultimately did himself in regardless. Some terrific acting, a beautiful music score, music, sound, with some great action and brutal fight scenes, the works. If these elements were missing this film would be a 5 at best, but because of the actors and Leone's unique genius as a director this is a very good film and worth the watch. Brilliant scenes all around too, from the phone ringing segueing into another scene to where Noodles watches Max go to the garbage truck as it then segues into young kids riding in cars. Lot of brilliant stuff, but again, lacks the magic of it's more fine predecessor Once Upon a Time in the West.",8,1,4,25 June 2014
Drag Me to Hell," Keeps you on your Toes
","Drag Me to Hell is Sam Raimi at his best. It builds up, has the cheesy yet frightening yet funny yet malevolent story and characters that only Raimi knows how to deliver on. Raimi is one of a kind, a pure gem in the sense of finding everything in between the lines. Drag Me to Hell is a fun adventure of a ride to go on and it delivers to the very end. Alison Lohman was one of my favorites and I miss her in movies and this was one of her last great performances. A terrific actress who I wish we still saw more of. Great timing, great anticipation, worth the watch!",8,2,3,13 June 2018
The Artist," It's Worth a Look for the Dog
","What I liked about this movie was the dog's performance as well as the performances from the two main leads. The Black and white use was perfect, the sound and music score was dead on, and it was a decent little story. Now, to what I didn't like about this film.1. The film is mediocre at best for a silent film. There have been much better silent films, I know my silent films very well, this film is a mediocre one. 2. A huge historical inaccuracy is the studio letting Valentin go, the studio firing him. No studio in their right mind would let their cash cow star go just like that. It just wouldn't happen 'Oh you make us tons of money, buh-bye now. We're getting rid of all of our big stars because people want to see unknowns' Not!! The studio would try to make a transition with him(Valentin) into talking films and if not that studio, another one would have tried. Valentin was basically playing a Douglas FairbanksSr. here. That was very inaccurate and quite stupid on the writers part for The Artist. A simple solution to making this part believable is just have Valentin simply refuse to do talking films as the studio keeps begging him to do them, he keeps refusing until the very end. That would have tied in much better to the ending and it wouldn't have been inaccurate either. And so what if Valentin had an accent. Lots of actors transitioned over from Silents to Talkies with accents such as Charlie Chaplin, Maurice Chevalier(who was french by the way), Greta Garbo, just to name a few. 'In with the new, out with the old story' was so ridiculous, but people in this modern day would believe it because they no nothing about silent films, and unfortunately if they actually had seen some much better silent films, they would realize this film isn't really all that great.3. In Silent films, the actors over do it with everything, expressions, mannerisms, and for the most part this movie hits that on target, but James Cromwell's performance and part of John Goodman's performance can't really ever decide which movie they are in, which is 'are we acting in a silent film or a modern talking film, I just don't know'. The Artist can't seem to decide what it's identity is. Although I really did like both Cromwell and Goodman in this movie, it's just their choices are off and wrong for what The Artist is going for. 4. The young man at the door says 'My dad liked you'. It's been 3 years and Valentin is a Douglas Fairbanks type. This young man would still adore Valentin, not know who he is. It's only been 3 years, not 30.(I also get that it's a metaphor that everyone in Hollywood forgets you quick. But when you're playing a Fairbanks type Idol, they don't forget you that quick, and it's an insulting scene, making this movie more dumb and inaccurate by every minute. That's like Brad Pitt disappearing for 3 years and then some 21 year old girl seeing Pitt 3 years later saying 'Oh my Grandfather liked you'). In Conclusion, I'm not usually a person who cares about the accuracy as I always see each movie as a metaphor as most are anyway, and most films have countless metaphors within the story, put there on purpose and sometimes just accidentally. The problem I have with The Artist is it's paying homage to Silent Films and that era, the last silent film was made over 75 years ago, and when a movie is paying homage to such a significant era, an era which is the backbone of films and movie making, it better get the facts straight. The Artist is a movie that clearly wants and intended to get the facts straight but didn't get the facts straight, not one bit, and it played off the ignorance of it's audience and insulting the intelligence of die hard film buffs like myself as well as probably many film historians out there. You have to get everything right with a movie like this.The politics and the ignorance is what won this movie it's academy award for best picture. I'd like to believe the academy was paying tribute, to the likes of Chaplin, Keaton, D.W. Griffith, Garbo, Fairbanks, for all the awards they never won and also for Singin' in the Rain for not even being nominated for best film, by giving The Artist the best picture Oscar. But the truth is that Harvey Weinstein really backed The Artist and he has the Academy voters so far up his pie hole that they're almost up to the inside of his chest at this point. Weinstein is the current lobbyist with the academy voters. The academy voters play ball and support his constituencies as he then supports theirs as well. You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours, just as in office politics, just as in the presidency and everything else pretty much. You go with the heavy hitters and Weinstein is one of the heaviest hitters right now. As humans, we'll buy into everything, we don't run the media, the media runs us, and they choose what we like. But for the ones that want to get it right, at least in this case, see all the Charles Chaplin films you can see, do some hands on research about the era in which this movie takes place. Much better films about a career going sour are Chaplin's Limelight and an accurate film about the Silent films transitioning to Talkies, and much better too is Singin'in the Rain(which really is smart in the Family Guy type humor it brings to the transition of Silents to Talkies and is fun and accurate in the surface topic of the transition at least).",5,1,4,23 May 2012
La La Land," It's Been So Long, but Worth the Wait
","There hasn't been a great musical, in my opinion, in almost 30 years, but Damien Chazelle delivers an absolute masterpiece of a musical with La La Land. La La Land gets back to the basics of why we love musicals as La La Land feels like Singin in the Rain, West Side Story, Silk Stockings, The Band Wagon, Carousel, and so many other musicals which we all love and cherish. La La Land is unique though as it has it's own voice on how life really goes(also never has their been an opening scene where people are dancing on cars in a long shot, something so new and innovative in musicals, an amazing shot). Life is not always peaches and cream, as this is a musical which will make you smile, smile so much, and it will make you cry for joy and it will make you sad at the end because we don't always get what we want in life as La La Land so cleverly demonstrates. La La Land shows the truth about how auditions go sometimes, and it gives the viewer a first hand look at how difficult it can be for two people to date in the entertainment industry (as why you see some actresses in real life date men outside of the entertainment industry, and vice versa). Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone's chemistry is so beautiful, you smile, laugh and cry every time you see them together in this film, it reminds you of a Rogers/Astaire dynamic, the stuff dreams are made of. It's been so-so-so long since there has been chemistry this good in a musical. Emma Stone has shown the audience what a great actress she is and that she is here to stay. Gosling is Gosling. He's always great. You can't go wrong with the Gosling. I really get the feeling this film is going to win best picture this year at the Oscars and it will be between Amy Adams and Emma Stone for Best Actress. La La Land is a must-must see film! Go see it as soon as you can. You will fall in love with musicals all over again.",10,10,20,20 November 2016
A Clockwork Orange," Kubrick, Ultra Violence and the Special Features
","If 'A Clockwork Orange' would have been done by any other director, you would have said that was the director's best work. But Kubrick was Kubrick and 'A Clockwork Orange' was one of his many great films in which it's hard to say which one was his best.'A Clockwork Orange' is in fact a sleek, ultra violent film which portrays the sexy, cool and violent in a disgustingly likable way. You want to turn away, yet you can't. You want to hate Alex (brilliantly played by Malcolm McDowell, which he should have been nominated for an Oscar for), yet you can't. A magnificent film on so many different levels, only levels in which Kubrick could bring.Lastly, the special features on DVD are well worth the watch. The special features explains that Anthony Burgess wrote the book because his wife had been raped.

Les Misérables," A Movie For Some To Appreciate
","This is a beautiful and extravagant film of many colors and amazement. One of the bottom lines about this movie though is that if one really does appreciate musicals, theater and opera's, then you are in for a real treat as you will probably love this movie. If you're not a big fan of the theater or opera's however, this one might be tough for you to sit through as Les Miserables is about 2 hours and 37 minutes long, and accept for the credits and a little bit of dialogue, about 2 hours and 27 minutes of the film is all singing. It pretty much plays out like the stage version of Les Miserables. Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway own and embody their characters through the passion of their voices and expression of their faces into their soul. Eddie Redmayne and Russell Crowe are nothing to sneeze at though either, as they both give powerful performances as well. And Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter add the right amount of comedy to the film. Les Miserables will be a real treat for lovers of the theater, and perhaps for some others.",9,6,10,14 January 2013
Joker," The Film is a 7, the performance is a 10!!
","Joaquin Phoenix has had a wild and electric acting career and his rendition of the Joker doesn't disappoint. Phoenix's Joker represents all of the sadness and mental illness in the world and how society throws it to the side, like 'garbage.'A character portrayal which displays the origins of how someone with a chemical imbalance can break down and go postal or even tragically participate in mass shootings.The nuances and the idiosyncrasy of the performance is brilliant and tragically sad as this Joker relates to many people in real life. Other films Joker reminds me of is Taxi Driver, and Falling Down.Finally, as brilliant and as academy award winning as the performance is, as this is a movie, it at times glorifies the Joker's behavior and because this movie hits so close to home with a lot of people, I only hope no one goes out and does something bad after seeing this film. There is nothing glorified about this sad and depressed behavior in real life and there's nothing glorified about doing evil things in real life. It's a just a movie.",8,0,2,7 October 2019
Parasite," Karma
","I agree with a lot of the reviews for Parasite. Parasite is a wonderful work of art that is open to many interpretations. One interpretation that I haven't read yet, which I found throughout the film is...karma.The poor Kim family struggles to make it in life. However, the Kim family cuts corners i.e. they lie, manipulate, cheat, etc. And as the old saying goes, 'you only get what you give in life', and that's kind of why the Kim's are where they are. The Kim's are good people in some way, as Mr. Kim demonstrates, expressing his shame about the driver they got fired. The Kim family has a conscience and they have some values, as most of us do.However, if you cheat, lie, deceive--it will always come back to get you i.e. the scene in Parasite where husband Park and wife Park are on the couch thinking of the underwear and they start sexually going at it while Husband Kim and daughter and son Kim are hiding under the table, listening to this. How awful that must have been for father Kim to hear that with his children right next to him. How embarrassed husband Kim must have felt at hearing he smells terrible, from husband Park, in front of his children--and how their was nothing husband Kim could do about it as he and his son and daughter were hiding under the table. The metaphor being that most of us in life can do nothing about it.But the Kim's did manipulate and cheat their way to the top, therefore their karma came back to bite them. And oh how it bites the Kim family in the very end. And it bites the Park family too. As the Kim family uses the Park's, the Park's use the Kim family for cheap labor--which in turn is a metaphor for the class war and for the war of employer vs. employee and how we all except such crummy wages and demands as a part of our society.In one scene, Mr. Kim says, 'no plan is the best plan.' Which is the same as the old adage, 'If you never have any expectations then you will never be disappointed.'Also, you could look at the stone like the story 'The Monkey's Paw.' Just like in The Monkey's Paw, the stone brings the Kim's good fortune...but at what price.Parasite is brilliant on so many levels that it's really a film you need to see two or three times to take it all in. It's a film that demonstrates that there is always someone worse off and Husband Kim gets his ultimate karma by taking the place of the person who was worse off than he was. Karma. It will always get you. And Parasite demonstrates this beautifully.Wonderfully acted and spiritually directed in the genre's most clever form. Parasite is not only a must see, it is a film you will not forget.",9,1,3,7 January 2020
The Iron Giant," The Beauty Incarnate
","The Iron Giant is a fantastic film woven with all of the beautiful tears of life and the monstrosities of mankind. A film that can easily be watched again and again and teach us many lessons each time. A great film, and a sincere tear jerker. You will laugh and cry and see yourself through the Iron Giant's eyes. A must see!",9,1,2,11 July 2019
Step Up," A Feel Good Movie
","Just a really cool-feel good movie for all walks of life, for all ages. You smile at times, you cry at times. You know you're not watching something too deep, but at the same time you really like the characters and care for them. Pretty good acting all around, awesome dance sequences, truly a film that one could even call a modern day Dirty Dancing (kind of). Rachel Griffiths is always fun to watch and you could definitely see the appeal of Channing and Jenna when you watch them on screen. Even cooler watching the chemistry between Channing and Jenna knowing they got married later in life and had a child together. You can definitely understand how this movie spawned a franchise of sequels. A must see for anyone who is a sucker for feel good movies.",7,0,0,5 October 2015
The Wolverine," He is Jacked, Man!
","I liked this movie a lot. It was slick, intense, good action, good acting all around, well directed and one has to respect the decorum of Mr. Jackman. He was in amazing shape for this movie, his chest and abs were insane, and one has to respect that transformation. That's a lot of work physically, mentally and spiritually all around. I liked where the story went, I thought it was the best one out of the X-men series and the last Wolverine movie.You can never go wrong with Samurai's and pretty Asian women either who can kick some butt. James Mangold is a fantastic director and I can just imagine he was fighting the producers to keep that ending out of the movie, I won't say the ending, but it was an ending that took away from the movie and I can imagine Mr. Mangold was furious for having to keep it in there. Good movie all around though.",7,1,2,28 February 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," Nolan is Rising
","Christopher Nolan is becoming a modern day Stanley Kubrick. However Nolan needs to do more films for that to be seen more fully and of course Kubrick was Kubrick, he was untouchable with his films. Nonetheless, Nolan is very detailed/meticulous/precise with everything in his films, from the smallest thing to the most important thing in the film, just like Kubrick. Nolan knows how important good sound, good sound editing and a great music score can be in bringing the film from good to great. I would say 8 times out of 10 if a film has everything going for it, but has a lousy music score, it will be a good film, but not great. And same goes if the film has a great music score, but it's missing good directing or good acting, just some element. The opening scenes in The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises are great and fun scenes to watch over and over again because of the great music score that's going along with the scene. Plus the music score in those opening scenes makes the stakes that much more important. The music score goes with a film like peanut butter and jelly, like a cigarette with an adult beverage. I'm not sure, but it looks as if Nolan doesn't use any CGI in the Batman films either, which makes it more of a long film process for Nolan but at the same time it makes for a better movie too because Nolan is not sloppy or lazy with his action sequences, again, he's very meticulous with everything. CGI in ways has made the process quicker for filmmakers, but at the same time it's made it easy for the filmmakers to get sloppy and lazy and mass produce crap like the Transformer Movies or The Avengers. And yes, I did not like The Avengers, it's like every other mass produced action film, it's sloppy. But Nolan with his Batman movies, the action is very detailed and there's nothing sloppy about the action or the movie as a whole, and that's because Nolan isn't concerned with mass producing something for monetary value, he's concerned with making a quality film. Another thing Nolan does, if you ever notice, each main character from all the Batman movies has their own theme music. The Scarecrow had his, the Joker had his, and Bane has his. Batman has his of course as well. But for a director to give each bad guy their own theme music, that takes careful planning and a lot of patience. Most directors don't have that kind of patience these days, except for the greats such as Spielberg and Scorsese. A big theme from all the Batman movies by Nolan, is 'rising'. From Bruce Wayne having memories of his Dad saying 'Why do we fall, so we can learn to pick ourselves up again.' to the Rising out of the prison in The Dark Knight Rises, it's a continuing theme about rising. Nolan is brilliant in his writing in this sense. Bruce Wayne learns(in all the Batman movies by Nolan) what a recovering addict of alcohol or drugs learns, which is everything in life isn't an all or nothing thing, it's not an event, it's an on-going process and it truly is a journey. You need help from people as you can't do it all by yourself. Bruce Wayne as Batman may get all the glory, but he always gets and has help to get there. Bane at one point in the movie says to Batman 'Victory has defeated you.' Meaning, everything has become an event for Batman now, unimportant, and Batman is kind of like how Rocky Balboa was in Rocky 3 at this point against his first meeting with Bane, which is he's not careful or afraid anymore, he doesn't look at all the factors or variables anymore, he's cocky in his apathy. Bruce Wayne has to learn again that it's a process, that it's always been a process and to truly be happy with what he wants and needs in life he needs to be aware of this fact again. Which he eventually becomes aware of again, and ultimately finds happiness because of this fact. Just an all around great movie though, terrific action, great directing and writing, Tom Hardy as Bane is spectacular, what a great and fun actor he is to watch as well as Christian Bale as Batman and Gary Oldman as the Commissioner. A very fun movie to watch over and over with some deep meaning behind everything that is going on from beginning to end. Also a terrific performance from Anne Hathaway as Catwoman, she really pulls this part off well, very well in fact, I was very impressed with her. See this movie if you haven't yet!",9,6,10,26 May 2013
Ben-Hur," The Pure Essence of Christ is what makes this one Great!
","The Chariot scene in this movie is enough to see it alone, but what makes this movie great and worthy of being on the AFI Best Films List is it's precise depiction of conveying the exact ambiance/mood of when Jesus Christ was around and how he was perceived. We all hear in church about Jesus Christ, read in the bible about him, pretty much everywhere, a person will hear about Jesus Christ, and Ben-Hur captures the very feeling, essence and imagination about how Jesus Christ was perceived and what kind of energy he translated to others during his time. And at the same time what's brilliant about this movie is it's smart in how it conveys all of this by making Jesus Christ a complete mystery. He's a mystery to us in the present day and he is a mystery to all of the characters in Ben-Hur, including Ben-Hur himself. And this enigmatic quality is what conveys the ambiance of Jesus Christ in this movie. Stanley Kubrick never gave away too much in the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, if he would have given up that 'enigmatic' quality in 2001, it would not have been even close to as great as a film as it is. The same goes for Ben-Hur, if you lose that 'enigmatic' quality about Christ in Ben-Hur, the film loses all of it's luster. Absolute brilliance to make Ben-Hur the way it was made. Ben-Hur is about a regular man who lives during the times of Jesus Christ, and it's about the struggles Ben-Hur goes through which we can all relate to. For example, being innocent and kind then going through the poisons of life and getting resentful and angry at later points in our lives to finally and hopefully forgiving, accepting and being at peace with the what is even later in our journey as human beings. But it's about the forgiveness and that's what Christ was about and that's the main theme of the movie Ben-Hur, the Trials and Tribulations of life and forgiveness. 'Jesus Christ died for all of our sins' and if it's tough for you to understand exactly what this statement means, this film, Ben-Hur, will be the closest film you'll ever find to understanding exactly what that statement means.",8,1,6,7 February 2012
Flight," A Very Fine Performance
","What I really like most about this movie is there is no cop out. The flight scene is one of the best ever executed. Another one up their with the ranks of this flight scene is the haunting United 93.And with that, Denzel got nominated for this movie for his speeches toward the end of the film(in my opinion)that in fact brought his character to a full circle. I think a lot of us can identify with needing to spill our guts to someone in order to be free. Denzel's character finally had to spill his guts about all of his lies in order to live again, and I think we all need to do that whether it be with friends, family, or whether it be in front of a judge or jury because I think we all hold many lies within ourselves like Denzel did in this film.I also like the fact that Denzel's character didn't cop out on what he was sentenced for at the end, he said something to the likes of(not exact)'I'm in here for 5 more years and I will never fly again, and that's fair.' That delivery was so honest and profound from Denzel. I think a lot of us like to have a cop out, feel sorry for ourselves and take no responsibility or make excuses for our actions.This performance was an homage to fessing up and taking responsibility for your life. Kudos to a very fine performance from Denzel Washington for making us understand this fact in life.",8,1,2,10 December 2013
50_50," Very Precise
","A film that seems very true and honest to every circumstance that's going on within the film as well as all the emotions anyone would go through if one was afflicted with that unfortunate circumstance. I won't speak for people that have been afflicted with that unfortunate circumstance and who have beat it. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a great actor in the sense that he can switch it up real well playing the white trash guy, the hessian metalhead, or just your regular likable joe as he does in 500 Days of Summer and this film. He plays about half his roles like this film, so you would think you're just seeing Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing himself which is sort of the case, however he goes so deep within the circumstances that he's in, that no matter how similar the character may be from film to film, there is always a distinct difference in the character because again, he goes so deep within the circumstances of what is happening to that particular character he's playing. That is very good acting. To be able to switch it up on one hand and play completely different characters like he did in Hesher, Looper, Don Jon and Killshot, but then at the same time to play similar type characters as he did in 500 Days of Summer and this film, and to still give that feeling that he's someone else in each of these films. He's an amazing actor. And one has to love Seth Rogen, he's so funny. He always brings a different side of humanity to these types of films as he also did with Funny People. Rogen brings true sincere honesty and laughter in the worst of situations to where you don't see Rogen as being a person who lacks compassion, but as a person who has a lot of compassion to give in the only way he knows how to give it. Very good film all around, a good cry at times, and one to remember.",8,0,0,10 June 2014
Green Book," Really Cool Film!
","The Green Book, for me, was one of those films where as I was watching it and after I watched it, I thought to myself 'It was okay.' But after a day or two went by the film really hit me good, and I thought to myself then 'no actually this was a really great film.'
Green Book is a film which really hits you after you watch it. From the images, to the sadness, and anger, to the camaraderie, peace and acceptance. And most of all to the friendship and love during the rough times it was taking place, what a beautiful message the film promotes to all of us. Superbly acted from top to bottom, well written, and well directed as Peter Farrelly steps out of his comfort zone of zany comedy, and makes a warm hearted, comedy-drama (for you Kingpin fans, the road trips in the Green Book will feel kind of nostalgic).
A powerful statement and a film which will put a big smile on your face. In my opinion, some of the best films are the ones which hit you in the heart days after you see it. And Green Book is just that. You will definitely love this film!",9,1,3,10 March 2019
Incredibles 2," Pretty Intense
","I love musicals, but it's nice to watch a disney pixar film every now and then which isn't a musical and that is The Incredibles. Loved the first one, but the Incredibles 2 is even better. It's more intense, the story is better, and it's a real who dunnit (scary and creepy at times) which keeps you guessing every step of the way. A real slick film with the great characters you love and the stuff with the baby is absolute gold. Fun for most of the family although in my own opinion I don't believe this film should be for children under the age of six as it is a little hard core at times. Absolutely loved this film. A must see. Will probably win Best Animated Feature at the Oscars this year. Extremely well done!",9,2,4,27 June 2018
Inside Llewyn Davis," A Very Pleasant Surprise
","I wasn't sure what to expect going into this one, but it is a wonderful characterization of people and life. One of the first from the Coen Brothers that I have seen that didn't have anything to do with stealing money, a robbery, killing, etc. This movie is one of the best from the Coen brothers, very well done. Oscar Isaac is a true talent, I had seen him before but sometimes it takes a role like this to see the untapped talent brought out of such a great and brilliant actor, which Oscar Isaac is proving to be. I look forward to seeing him in more now. Of course Carey Mulligan is always fantastic. This movie is a modern day musical really. No dancing, but lot's of folk singing, some really good songs too. You will not be disappointed with this movie. A true look at how it is for a struggling artist. This is how it is for about 80 percent of artists out there. The other 18 percent hope to get to where the other 2 percent are, that 2 percent being Tom Cruise, Bob Dylan, Picasso, etc.",10,0,1,15 November 2014
True Romance," One of a Kind
","This is one of those crazy sort of movies on a high octane level in between destruction and true love that you just absolutely fall in love with. Every character has something to bring to the table in True Romance. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette's chemistry is out of this world and you fall in love with them the very minute you meet them. Stand out performances from Gary Oldman, Bronson Pinchot, and Brad Pitt. Not a film for everyone, but for the Wild at Heart's, who love a great Quentin Tarantino script meshed with fantastic Tony Scott direction, and outstanding performances from top to bottom, you will fall in love with this crazy, special film!",9,2,2,20 June 2018
Donnie Darko," You Want to Know What This Movie is About, Then Read On
","When I first saw this movie I didn't really know what to think, but as the years have gone by, I've come to like it very much. If nothing else, one has to appreciate the concept and thought provoking nature of this material. A kid basically somehow finds some type of wormhole to where he travels back in time, he time travels is what he does, and the genius of that time travel makes this movie all the more worth watching. Would we forget if we time traveled, if we traveled back in time? Or would we remember? Could we travel forward? If we did travel back in time or forward in time, would it be planned and on purpose, or would we travel back or forward in time by complete chance/on accident? As if it were all just a dream? This movie poses all of these concepts and questions. The creators vision is that Donnie Darko forgets that he travels back in time. That Donnie Darko traveled back in time by complete accident and chance as if it were just some quick snap of the fingers, waking up from a dream or waking up from your therapy session with the Hypnotist. Donnie Darko doesn't know he's traveled back in time, he just believes he's in the present as if nothing ever happened, but yet Darko keeps seeing visions of a Creepy Dark Bunny. He sees this Bunny as if he's seen this Bunny before, Deja Vu, just a creepy dream or remnants from the time travel left in some odd peculiar quadrant that keeps flashing before him? A very thought provoking and creepy movie. This movie will keep you on edge and leave you feeling settled but unsettled at the same time. Of course as the movie progresses, Donnie Darko discovers that he has time traveled and eventually he will sacrifice his life for his loved ones' lives. He kind of sacrifices his life in a different, but sort of same way that Ashton Kutcher's character does in The Butterfly Effect. Donnie Darko kind of has that 2001: A Space Odyssey feel to it. And Also, who doesn't think that there are wormholes right around the corner that we don't know about, right in a forest or in our backyard. I think for the fantasy, sci-fi lover, these thoughts have been thought in our minds before, and really who knows if we're right or wrong. There could be wormholes anywhere really. Who really knows. Anyway, If you like 2001: A Space Odyssey, then you'll probably take a liking to Donnie Darko as well. Also, Patrick Swayze is terrific in this movie in a very weird and disturbing role.",8,1,3,23 October 2012
Shark Tale," A Sell Out Tale
","This movie should be called Cartoon Movie because it's pretty much in the Date Movie, Epic Movie saga genre. If I was going to tell you about this movie relating to food, then if you could imagine a big gunk of 20 grams of Trans Fat smashed together in this block of garbagenated waste, that would be exactly what you get in this movie, a bunch of processed- gooey fat that isn't good for you and that's almost impossible to digest. I suppose Will Smith did this movie for his kids, or perhaps 'to pay the mortgage', but everyone involved in this movie is a lot better than this movie. I'm not sure which Cartoon Movie is worse, this one, or Rio(Cartoon Movie 2). I don't understand why a simple story of sea creatures can't be made, if I wanted to watch an episode of TMZ, I would do just that, but I don't want to watch it in an Animation though. A much better movie for the kids(and everyone) that's entertaining about underwater life is Finding Nemo. If you never see Shark Tale then you're already one step ahead of the game.",3,0,1,28 March 2012
Princess Mononoke," Very Thought Provoking
","It's always a common theme from Studio Ghibli in being that we must respect and be kind to nature, just to love everything that surrounds us from animals to a single strand of grass. That man is bad, but some men within man are good. Always very intuitive movies with brilliant writing and animation from Studio Ghibli. But Princess Mononoke is one of the best in the thought provoking department. Princess Mononoke is never too redundant, it's a perfect balance on all points that it's getting across and at the same time entertaining us to the fullest enjoyment. A real special gem of a movie that will bring the viewer into a touching awareness and a smile after viewing it. A movie for all age groups. Subjectively, I'm still a bigger fan of Spirited Away, but objectively, Princess Mononoke is the best of the bunch.",9,0,1,5 April 2013
High Fidelity," Why We Love John Cusack
","John Cusack was born to play roles like these. He is the 'every man', the guy we all relate to. I think it was fate that Cusack has never gotten married because it's added to his appeal with these kind of down on your luck-likable-lovelorn-schlub characters that he plays. High Fidelity is an honest look at a relationship, at all the different angles, views, Point of views of a relationship. It's honest in its eccentric way by saying the protagonist even messes up, as Cusack's character admits that he cheated on his girlfriend in the film. Most movies would never have the protagonist cheat, most movies would have him/her be perfect, where this is a movie about a real human being, a human being that is likable, but who messes up and throughout his soul search journey he starts seeing all of the things he was doing wrong on, all of the things that are wrong within himself. A movie true to form, in it's eccentric, story telling way. John Cusack is a good actor. He always plays himself (even though he's probably playing different characters , but we always just see him playing himself). I think a great actor plays himself well (meaning 'what if I was in this situation', 'what if i was in that situation' and that's very tough to do believably), but yet he can play other characters too, which I've never seen Cusack play anyone but himself. Cusack is extremely good at playing himself in all of the different circumstances he's in, in each film he's in. And because he always plays himself, I believe that also adds to his likable appeal. He's got extreme likability and we always love to watch him.This is a very good film, with great acting, great music, very funny all around. A must see.",8,0,0,1 June 2015
