The New World," New World-same old rubbish
","As a person that doesn't usually sign up to online forums, comment rooms and such, it took a lot to infuriate me enough to write this report. I paid good money to watch this film, which had the potential to be excellent. Unfortunately, it was reminiscent more of a seventies B movie, than a classy piece of film making. Take an Indian squaw, who spent the whole film wandering around and sighing 'Who am I', and musing the deep thoughts one only reads in arty books, rather than worrying about where her next meal was coming from and a film hero who was next to useless, so bad, I wanted to kill him myself, an absolutely awful set of lines for the cast..........need I say more.We left the cinema an hour before the end, and were by far the first to do so. About half the audience had left before us and the only two left on our row were asleep.I had heard all the critics ranting and raving about this film, well, I have utterly lost faith in them and can only assume they were paid to praise the film, perhaps it would have been better had they been paid for their honesty.",1,3,9,31 January 2006
