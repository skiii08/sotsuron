Blade Runner 2049," A fantastic (unnecessary) sequel
","we have waited 35 years for this movie. So either you watch it because you are a fan of the first one or you watch it because you are curious about what is going to happen/what is it about. And you want to watch it with your no replicant eyes. So please watch.As the tittle itself explains, 30 years have gone by since the original Blade Runner movie; which was set in 2019, which is in 2 years time, and no one believes our world will be like that, but let's get back on track. Year 2049 and we are presented with the same idea as before: replicants are being chased and now not only by humans but by other replicants that are aware of what they are.Following Ryan Gosling's K character we are drawn into a kind of police movie: while doing his duty, K discovers something that was hidden for 30 years and that might change the world, for real. While the movie carries on, we are presented with new characters like Joi, another AI that K is using as companion, which presents some of the greatest sci-fi scenes (like shown in the trailer) and Harrison Ford's character also appears, as the movie poster gave away, and he is exactly like we remembered him but with some wrinkles. One cannot but feel nostalgic. Then the story starts to get complicated and deeper, and as in this kind of movies happens, the audience might have one theory about what is going on but it could not be that, and of course then there is the end, that like the original movie will make you keep thinking about it for a while after exiting the theatre.We are presented with marvelous visual effects that are accompanied but a wonderful movie that it will remind you of 'Arrival' the director previous work as the style is similar. Some of the visuals are really, really, fascinating, everything recalls the original movie but instead of having a dark filter it has a brighter one where the colours are more alive in contract with what the story is telling. The only down I might find in this movie is its length. Being almost 3 hours long you really feel it is that long, something that didn't happen with the previous one, which was 'only' 2 hours long. Some scenes are way too long and maybe unnecessary, but nonetheless they are beautiful.This movie follows the canon of the director's cut, so you better use your memory or either watch it again in order to savour all the tiny (and not so tiny) details that appear on this one. It is a really good movie that maybe we didn't need at all but we are enjoying anyway.",7,4,10,8 October 2017
Your Name.," Your name...?
","The story being with a girl and a boy. One in the countryside and the other in the city. both are connected through their dreams and they are exchanging bodies and of course a bond is made. Then the story changes its path and you cannot feel but drawn into it without second thoughts.Not only the story is brilliant and really, really, emotional, but the characters are really simple, ones that you can feel yourself identified with no matter how old you are. Then there is the music, which is the cause of your almost dehydration but remember, once in a while is good to clean your eyes. Nothing to say about the animation, as this is an anime, and as an anime is simply perfect. It is good to see some brilliant anime movie that is not from master Miyazaki, because personally, is the best movie from 2016 that I have watched so far. You have romance, you have drama, you have laughs, you have fantasy, you have science fiction the perfect combination all together, which is easy to say but not so easy to make.'Your Name' is a movie that spell-bounds you since the first minute, or second. It starts like other movies that have played with the connection between two people via dreams, but in this case more than dreams it looks like they are exchanging bodies. Yes, it's not the first time that this concept is approached but still at the beginning of the movie there is something different, a change in the story that you don't see coming because it is too early in the movie for'that' to happen! And from that moment on you cannot wait to see what is going to happen and before you realize it the movie is over (almost 2 hours of your time well spent!).",10,4,7,28 May 2017
A Star Is Born," A Star was Always Here
","And the Oscar goes to...!!! This is the first thing that will come up to your mind once you have finished watching this treasure of a movie. The second thing is guessing the category, and I bet you will go for all of them.This movie is the fourth version of the same story, where each of the ways it has been told (each one of them) has something different that identifies itself: #1. The original version wasn't a musical, #2. Was something Over the Rainbow, with Judy Garland on it, #3. Felt like you were at Woodstock and rock and rolling and #4. It feels like a real story adapted to today's times.Bradley Cooper directs, produces, writes, acts, sings and performs. He is simply fantastic on his role as a singer who is going through a rough path. That is, until his path crosses with the one of Lady Gaga. Then, you forget about him and sorely focus on her. All your attention is drawn to her, because she is the movie. She is basically playing herself, and it is here, while you are watching this movie, that you truly realize what an amazing singer she is (even more if you are not a fan of her work) and also that she is not a bad actress. On the contrary, she can act, and if you think that as she is playing a singer role it's easy for her, go watch the fifth season of American Horror Story and check for yourself what she can really do in front of the camera.Then (of course) there is the music. The forever actor in this kind of movies. Real, up to date music. It doesn't mind if you are not into country or pop music, you will definitely enjoy this movie and once you leave the theatre, you will go to get the movie's soundtrack as soon as possible. If you still haven't had the chance to watch this film, what are you waiting for? Go watch it, and then you can wait with the rest of us until the Oscar nominees are announced early next year.",9,4,7,28 October 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Join the Rebelion
","First things first: I liked this movie way more than Episode VII. That out of my chest, let's proceed. Since we heard about the project and watched the trailer, we already knew how the movie was going to end, because that is how the original movie starts. And don't forget what appears in the crawl of the original Star Wars movie.So we know what will happen but we don't know the how, which is really important in the Star Wars movies, how the story is told. The story starts presenting the new characters, who they are and their backgrounds. It continues a bit weak for a moment. And then there is the fantastic final part where it really makes you feel like when you watched the original trilogy, eager for more and more.The movie keeps the spirit of the old movies. There are maaaaany references and Easter eggs not only nodding to A New Hope but also The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. So true and devoted Star Wars fans can go on a quest trying to find all of them.Besides the clear references, there are also scenes that are filmed the same way that in the originals movies because the situation that they describe resembles that of the old ones. Yes, we remember that copy paste and do it bigger that happened in The Force Awakens, but this is not the case (thank God!). Although some scenes from Episode IV were, in a fantastic way, reutilized for this one.Another important aspect that was lacking in The Force Awakens was the music. Much better than the one in Episode VII; there are memorable tracks and even references and new versions of classics, like that Imperial March coming back to us. Then we have those CGI that bring back old characters into the story, which might shock us at first but then we get used to them. We might be conflicted whereas we like it or not, but we cannot deny that they are part of the story and we like feeling nostalgic.As for the characters, they are solid characters very well-played by their actors. I specially like Felicity Jones as she is a great actress and here she delivered a brilliant performance in terms of Star Wars.It is needed to mention that if you are going to watch the movie just for some lightsablers fights, you better turn around and there is almost to none Jedis and no sable fights. Remember, this happens way after Revenge of Sith and right before New Hope, so the Jedis are extinct. The movie is more like the Battlefront video game and separates itself from the rest of the saga. But that doesn't mean that is bad, quite the contrary, it is something different that might inspire you as a non Jedi. We must remember that is a Star Wars story, not a Star Wars Episode. Therefore, it might lack aspects like space fauna and as said the jedis, but it keeps having the Force around it, the spaceships, the Empire, the Rebellion, and it is an interesting story to learn as it gives some answers regarding the original movie. Answers that we might not want to know or that we didn't care at all. But answers that are the excuse to make this entertaining movie.You will leave the cinema wanting to join the rebels and fight against the Empire. As that is (sadly) not possible, you will have to settle to rewatch A New Hope, because of course that is what you want to see, how the story continues (although you already know that). And of course once you start with Episode IV, you will have to continue with V and VI.#JoinTheRebelionAnd now we wait 365 days for Episode VIII.",8,3,7,16 December 2016
Passengers," Passengers or extra of sugar with zero gravity
","Let's begin with something really important: trailer do deceive you sometimes and this is the perfect example of expecting to watch a determinate kind of movie and find something unexpected (and not in a good sense).When you watch the trailer you might expect some kind of 'Pandorum' (minus the paranoia and all the horror) but sorry, this is not that movie. It is not an action/adventure movie where people are travelling in a spaceship with a new planet to live as destination and where someone awakes beforehand because there is something big, deep and dark behind it. Instead of that we find ourselves with something completely the opposite: a romance drama.Yeah, you heard me: romance drama. Something that is really good disguised in a science fiction environment, with a background mystery (which by the way is solved sooner than saying Schwarzenegger). For half of the movie, H-A-L-F-O-F-T-H-E-F-I-L-M we are presented with the two main characters and nothing, absolutely almost nothing happens. And I didn't feel so bored since watching the beginning of the last 'Fantastic Four' movie, which lasted also half of the movie by the way. Then something seems to happen but no it doesn't, and then the finale.Although there are two frontlines in the movie and they have chemistry on-screen, the way the story is told is boring and you will find yourself looking at your watch every 5 minutes for the first hour, then you will be happy that something has happened but then the movie is over and time to go home!Titanic on space is what this movie has been called, but remember, Titanic has a good story and good dialogues, this one not so much. If you are a fan of the two main stars you may be excused, even more if you like science fiction. but believe me, you will be quite disappointed about the result. On the other hand, if you miss those 90s romance movies, please go watch it!",4,1,4,8 January 2017
Aquaman," Move over Marvel!!
","DC has finally woken up!!! (But just woken up and they still have a lot to catch up). As it happened with Wonder Woman, there is hope for DC and this movie is a prove that a job well done is possible when on the right hands.The story takes place after the events from Justice League (although it's like the previous movie didn't exist at all, and we are not complaining about it). Plot is interesting, there are no aliens invading us this time, it's purely a survival matter that happens all underwater of our world. Most of the movie is underwater, so imagine how brilliant and awesome the visual effects are. I can only say: give them already their Oscar, please! Amazing. Not only all the animals we see but also the clothes and specially the hair of the main characters, you feel like you are inside a tank of your town's aquarium.All along the movie you will feel like you are watching another movie, because at some point there is a mix of other movies or simply things that will remind you of them, like: Riders of the Lost Ark or Avatar. And let's not forget that Little Mermaid moment with the Octopus playing the drums. Fantastic! Plus the female character reminds us of Black Widow, just kicking asses but with her own power too and she's not just a secondary player. Marvel, please take note on that. It's like a mix of movies, but in a good way. Not for a minute will you check your watch while watching the film.It seems that DC is finally finding their path with the storylines. Aquaman is as Wonder Woman was, a really entertaining movie. It has mythology, it has action, it has a good speed and it has humor. And probably the best visual effects of the year. So what are you waiting for?",8,2,4,23 December 2018
"I, Tonya"," I, Margot
","Why should anyone watch this movie? The answer is in four words: Margot Robbie and Allison Janney. They are the movie. Both of them. One as the main star and the other one giving one of the best supporting actress performances ever. That both of them have been nominated to the Oscar for best in their respective category for playing these roles is not a coincidence!This movie is not the so typical biopic of a sport star (or kind of). We are presented the main characters following some interviews played by the actors (no the real persons) and then we are told their story by them, in not the usual way and that might remind you of many Woody Allen's movies where there are interviews at the beginning. Because the mood is the same: realistic but funny, although what they are explaining is not funny at all. We are presented to the characters and to their past. How they met, what they were doing and what they must do, specially Tonya.Margot Robbie is flawless in this movie. She portrays the main character with such energy that once you finish watching the movie, you only want to search for the real Tonya in the internet and watch her performances; and once you watch them you realize that you already know them, because you have watched this movie. On the other side of the coin is Allison Janney; who portrays Tonya's strict mother and every time that she is on-screen she just simply steals the show (poor bird, by the way). If you are not much into sports movies, just do us all a favor and watch this one just to enjoy these two women doing one of the finest works an actress can do.The movie tells us a story that did happen, maybe not exactly like it is explained here, but it happened not so long ago. It's not easy to explain something like this and get the audience attention while the movie is still rolling, but this movie exceeds in that. We are attached to the screen for the whole movie duration and once we finish we want some more, and we can get more of the real thing, but that doesn't mean it better that the fictional one. A movie to learn something new while enjoying some good laughs.",7,0,1,27 January 2018
Black Mass," Gangsters are back
","Ohnny Depp. Just to see his transformation to play the leading character of this movie is worth your time. Besides the physical aspect, we are so used to seeing him as Pirate Sparrow, here we get the change to see another Johnny, the great actor Johnny. Critics say that is the best work of his career, and it might be true. How he plays Whitey, really convincing and really catchy.Besides him, there is a bunch of good secondary characters like the always amazing Benedict Cumberbatch, who only has to breath to have all of us waiting for him, or like Joel Edgerton, who is really great actor and this role is like a ring for his finger.The movie is a gangster movie, don't expect it to be a kind of 'The Godfather', which is almost impossible to make, but nonetheless it's a well made movie with a real story behind it and worth watching to learn a bit more about it and enjoy good actors on the screen.Review written: 23/10/2015",7,0,0,18 December 2018
Suicide Squad," DC is almost there
","Reason one to watch this movie: just for the fun of it!! The movie is really entertaining and has good humor scenes. But, if you are looking for another Marvel movie, this is not it. This is DC, and it's time that people are aware of it, although comparisons are in order, as always. The movie has rhythm and good action scenes, but at some times the plot is weak, there is nothing new there that could be given to the audience. Nonetheless, that doesn't mean that you won't enjoy it, because you do. And if you didn't like BvS, you will probably like this one better as the story flows faster and is less darker.Reason two: Harley Quinn. Maybe the most popular character in the movie; even more than the Joker, who by the way, is NOT a part of the squad, so don't expect him to appear that much in the movie. She is his girlfriend, and probably she is even crazier than him. Every time that we hear Margot Robbie speak, she really steals the show; she is simply the best with her performance of the crazy girlfriend. One cannot help themselves to look for more information about her and check the Batman animated movies (guilty here).Reason three: the music. The soundtrack is one of the best things about this movie. Old known songs, and not so old, that will transport you to another time while you enjoy the action in the movie. The best example of it the first movie trailer, which got us hooked since the first second. If there was an Oscar category for trailers, this one would definitely take it home.",7,0,0,4 June 2017
Doctor Strange," Doctor Sherlock Holmes
","Another Marvel movie! And as always, this movie is in for a good show, which is what we are expecting, otherwise we would be watching a DC movie. Plus there is Mr Cumberbatch, so silence please.In this movie we are presented with a new Marvel superhero, maybe not that well-known as others, but after watching this movie we won't forget about him ever, ever again. In addition, we will wondering when is he going to appear: Thor Ragnarök? Avengers: Infinity War? Spiderman Homecoming!!??The story is interesting, different from the previous Marvel ones. There aren't weapons or shootings here, but magic, inner power; which is good for a change, and more mysticism, which is really appealing for western people. The way the story is told is pretty good: the path is agile and there is nothing that feels like has been added just to fill time. The performers are all big name actors and actresses, all familiar faces which delight the audience with their characters, but of course, he who steals the spotlight is Mr Cumberbatch. No one would play better Dr Strange than him and we sincerely hope that he will appear in more movies to come.But the main and most important actors of this movie are the visual effects. Something absolutely breathtaking and that cannot make you look away from the screen. If Matrix was a before and an after, this one could be a another milestone in visual effects history. If you ever thing about forces and mystic around you this might be a way to imagine them that is for sure working out.A movie for Marvel lovers and for newcomers. It is entertaining, it is funny and it provides some inner thoughts, plus there is Cumberbitch, so go watch it while we wait for the next Marvel one!",8,1,1,28 May 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," B*** Please
","New year, new race to get as many awards as possible. Having the Golden Globes gone by, now it's time to race for the big prize: the Oscars and this movie is going to be in that race and probably take some awards too, which it has already started to do.The movie starts with a simple concept: a girl was murdered and her mother is tired of waiting for the police to do something, so she comes up with the brilliant idea to use three huge billboards as pressure for the police department to keep moving on with the investigation. Being it a script from director Martin McDonagh, which has us used to interesting ones, the movies doesn't disappoint at all. On the contrary, at the beginning one thinks that the plot is going to one way but is it going to another one and at a different path, and before you know the story comes to an end and you want to watch more of it, see of what happens. Because if we know something, is that no Martin McDonagh movie is predictable.Moving to the amazing cast: Frances McDormand is the movie. She is just so awesome in her role that you completely forget about anything else. Nothing else matters, only her. She does a brilliant performance that will end for sure with many awards on her shelf (she has started to collect them). She portrays this mother who has lost a child in a not so typical way. We are used to witness angry, desperate, moody mothers but in here the sole point is anger. Anger that she expresses in all possible ways and even though it's not something to laugh about, you might find some hilariously situations because of how unbelievable are. Unbelievable in the good sense. And her performance shine anything thanks to a good cast of supporting actors, making a special mention to Sam Rockwell who is the one that keeps the action going on, who spurs the fire.This is a remarkable movie that shouldn't be forgotten to watch nor should we make the mistake of thinking that because it is creating a hype, it is going to be a bad one. It has a wonderful cast and a great plot, that might sound familiar to many other movies but it is not. It will give you a surprise once you have watched it and you will understand why is it going to shake this year's award season.",8,1,5,27 January 2018
Lion," Lion Heart
","This is a movie based in a true story, and although it could get really sentimental, the director has done an amazing work in not falling too much into it but presenting a realistic story that once in a while is good to watch and to remember us that there is always hope in this world.The story and the setting might remind you of 'Slumdog Millionaire', and also Dev Patel who is present in both, but that is mainly because we are not used to watch many Indian movies. While we watch this movie we follow the quest of the main character trying to find his family, which he was separated from as a child and by accident. Almost half of the movie takes place in Indian and we are shown the exact turn of events that happened to the main character as a child, which is interesting because normally it takes only 5 minutes to get the audience into situation but in here,the story is well developed so we can connect with the boy.A powerful cast that provides a powerful performance that doesn't fall into cheeriness or sentimentality. They just show you what they feel and all time remind you that these people exist in real life, that is not just a novel but reality itself. Another strong point of the movie is the cinematography really beautiful and powerful that help the audience to connect even more with these amazing characters and feel like they are present there with them too.A movie to reconnect with the world and to never lose hope no matter what the circumstances are or where you are, no matter who you were but who you really are. Anything could happen. #LionHeart",7,0,0,28 May 2017
Justice League," Stillo more Justice needed to do
","This is the first DC movie where we (finally) get to watch many superheroes together, like with the Avengers, but Marvel/Disney is still many years ahead, sorry.The story picks up after the events described in Batman v Superman, where the seeds for this story were planted. The movie follows a simple plot: somebody evil is recovering some objects that will destroy the world, so the League needs to be reunited. The end. We get to see what everyone is doing before Batman starts recruiting them. Sadly, the way it happens is really flat. Nothing memorable (besides Wonder Woman, she is always memorable). We are introduced to three new superheroes: Aquaman, the Flash and Cyborg, but none of them gets to gain our favor. Aquaman is too much Khal Drogo for our liking. The Flash is the comical relief of the movie, while there are other better funny moments where he is not involved. And Cyborg, well, it's a machine. Period.Besides all of this, the movie is entertaining. Gone is the style of the previous DC movies (sans Wonder Woman) were the story kept going at a really slow pace. Here the pace is faster and we get to see more action. We manage to see again the Amazons, but gone are the fierce warriors presented in Wonder Woman (and compare their outfits) and we also see the Atlantean, not as good as we expected them, more like some kind of mermaids, and we get a glimpse of other creatures But still, there are some good action scenes, specially towards the end, where all the team fights together against the bad guy, who is as forgettable, as the bad guy from Thor: the Dark World. Hopefully in the next movie we'll get to see somebody pure evil.The movie tries to be more similar to the Marvel's ones, but still doesn't quite reach them. Nonetheless, is an entertaining movie, if only to see all these characters together on the screen, both the main ones as for the supporting ones. Just remember, the golden egg chickens are: Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman. The rest is there to give support and create a bigger hype. And needless to say that the Trinity are the best thing in this movie, to finally watch them together and feel nostalgic and younger again.Marvelers gonna hate. DCers gonna enjoy.",7,0,1,3 December 2017
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Harry Potter meets the Great Gatsby
","Harry Potter!!! No, he doesn't appear (sorry), but the magic is there! The movie takes place 70 years before the events in the Harry Potter books and we follow Newt Scamander, author of one of the books mentioned in the Harry Potter books and just as a reminder, Newt is the grandfather of Luna Lovegood's husband. But this is not the only connection with the Harry Potter books and movies, because let's face it, we Potterheads are going to watch the movie (besides the obvious) to discover those connectionsAbove all, the movie is pretty good. Comparisons are unavoidable but let's remember, magic or no magic, this is a spin-off, no Harry Potter in here! We are presented with a new set of characters, some where mentions less than briefly in some Harry Potter book but of course, we remember who they were. You can see J.K.Rowling writing in here (not as in Cursed Child, double sigh) and we must be grateful for that because we all feel like 15 years ago, really enjoying ourselves while watching the movie. For newcomers, this movie is a fantastic way to enter the Wizarding World that you have missing so far!On the other hand, there are some plot weaknesses, which we will obliviate ourselves because we were waiting so long for this moment that it doesn't matter. The movie might be found to be a big long (2h 20min approx), taking a lot of time catching the fantastic beasts meanwhile there was another subplot that in the future will be more important. Here comes one comparison: I had the impression that American wizards are more into action than British ones, but then we must remember something: in this film we see the adult society and in the previous ones it was the school society, so comparing them is like comparing Quidditch with Exploding Snap! There is more action, more magic, more explosions and more adult themes, but let's not forget that this movie is directed to your inner younger self.There will be 4 more movies to come to keep enjoying this new magical era and we are really intrigued to watch them because for once, we have NO reading material!!! Visual effects are one actor more of the movie, brilliant as always. To create all these creatures was a challenge that they did more than succeed as you will be fascinated with them and after leaving the theater you will be looking for the nearest book store to buy the book (if you still didn't have it!). As an extra,you will get goosebumps when hearing Hedwig's Theme; and if you don't, muggle/no-maj you!!Overall we are faced with a really entertaining movie that keeps the spirit of the previous ones. It has new lovable characters, new information for us to enjoy, and questions left unanswered that we hope will be answered in the upcoming films. We have until 2024 to keep enjoying tha magic.",8,1,2,28 May 2017
Jackie," Jackie Portman
","There are more movies about the assassination of JFK than stars. Well, maybe there are not so many but there are indeed quite a few and on the other hand there are not that many focused on his wife, which this film does.This movie follows Jackie Kennedy in the aftermath of her husband's assassination. We follow her story through flashbacks in an interview she gave to a journalist. It's an interesting way to show the story, instead of going in a linear way you see her giving the interview and then see watch she explain in images. There are some scenes that they look like they were taken of the original tapes made at that time, specially when Natalie Portman is on-screen.Natalie Portman is the movie. She is the actor of this movie and she is absolutely brilliant. At some point you might start thinking if you are watching Natalie or the real Jackie. Her performance is flawless and she is the main to watch this movie. To be a witness of her brilliance. Then there are two important actors in this movie: the outfits that they wear, which are exact replicas of the real ones, and then, of course, the music. The music is what gives you goosebumps when nothing else can. Absolutely fantastic.A good movie to watch with the sole purpose to enjoy a good true story and what we didn't see on TV at that time, the other side of the coin, the other half. One biopic worth your time which has been neatly done in not the usual way. A biopic that will allow you to learn more about history and about a woman that became an icon.",7,1,3,31 January 2017

This is probably the best marvel movie ever.After 10 years all comes to this and I must sat it is a good way to end. All good things come to an end and so do the avengers. Now we can only wait and see what Disney will do but nothing will ever be the same.Meanwhile I will sit on a corner a decide what to do with my life!!,9,1,4,26 April 2019
The Favourite," Look at ME (not) !!!
","We find ourselves in the middle of the awards time and therefore we are bombarded with many good promising movies, some of which will be forgotten, others won't. This movie probably falls into the second group, as what won't be forgotten any time soon are the female performances given in it.Three leading females rule the show but one of the three is who really steals it, and that is Olivia Colman, Queen Anne here. Her performance has been receiving many awards and for sure more will come to her. Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz are not left behind in their supporting roles and will join Olivia in many red carpets.What is interesting in this movie is how the story is told and specially how it is filmed. This not the first historical movie that we are presented about this point in British history, but it is a film that concentrates on personal relationships and explains them in a unique way. Director Lanthimos has always a special touch with the camera and in this movie that is one character more.This is not a movie for everyone. It is a movie for people who love good actresses performances and palace affairs told is a particular way. Not for every eye.",8,3,6,18 January 2019
The Lion King," Dehydration at maximum level
","What can I say, I am a huge fan of the original movie and watching this version was a must and it didn't disappoint! I knew what I was going to watch: the same movie made CGI and with maybe slight changes. And that is what I got. What they have done is make the movie more real, where animals behave like animals, not like humans as in the original movie, which was something good as it made the movie more real that expected. In addition, I had the opportunity to dehydrated myself and clean my poor eyes!!!!",8,1,8,20 July 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," The pearl, the girl and the Sparrow
","First of all, you can forget the previous film. As it never existed, but keep in mind the first trilogy, as this movie is kind of soft reboot of that one and we might see some familiar faces on it, and also some similar situations by the way.As we are used to in all Pirates of the Caribbean movies, the action never stops. With long action scenes that never seem to end, with all details under control and crossing paths with all the characters, this movie is a good way to entertain ourselves and feel melancholic about the first (and movie) of all of them. In here different paths find their way to the same solution: they needs to find the trident of Poseidon for different reasons, and that makes all different characters having to work together. Does that sound familiar?Johnny Depp plays again Captain Jack Sparrow and while he makes us laugh sometimes, we are already used to his performance so it feels like there is nothing new in there, specially after five movies of the same. As the new comers are the youngsters who display a good chemistry trough all the movie and that gives a bit of fresh air although we cannot help ourselves to think about Orlando and Keira in the previous installments. Then we have a new villain Captain Salazar played by Javier Bardem who gives great and sometimes funny performance, specially when he goes like: 'Spaaarrrow'', Sparroww', that I cannot help myself but think of Robert De Niro in Cape Fear.A good adventures movies that recovers the spirit of the first movies of the saga and keeps up with the humor that is also always present in these movies. Plus stay tuned for the post-credit scenes, a fan service scene that leaves doors open",7,1,7,29 May 2017

The movie is based in real events which is really refreshing as what we know is the final event, launching a man into space, but what we didn't know (probably) was what was behind it, what aspects made it happen, the people who were involved and as it was 1961 there were not only white men involved but also black women.So we find ourselves in a story about discrimination against not only black people but also women. So these black women not only had to fight because they were women but because they were black too. And it is an interesting story because they are really smart women working at the NASA, something that didn't happen every day. So besides the fight of these women to prove what they were capable of, there is also the final destination, which is something that hadn't been done before. So we are taught a bit of history too.All three main actresses do an amazing job portraying these strong women. I specially like Taraji P. Henson who already got our attention in the show Empire. the main characters are supported by a bunch of well-known actors playing the secondary ones, which only supports more the work of the three leading ladies.An interesting movie to learn more about the people that we don't see in the news, about their hard work that make civilization moving forward, about what happens when you are different and don't have the same rights as the others just because of the color of your skin.",8,4,10,23 January 2017
Logan," Wolverine gets justice (finally)
","Why should anybody watch this movie? Because is the best Wolverine movie. Period. The Wolverine trilogy goes from worst to better, because the world is upside down. With this movie we can properly say goodbye to the character. A goodbye well-deserved and well made.The movie is not the typical super heroes movies and it is not the so typical X-Men movie that we are used to. It takes a while to remember where we are in the scene: is it after The Last Stans? Or Apocalypse? or The Wolverine? One cannot stop asking that at the beginning of the movie, but then our doubts are done. We are presented with an old Wolverine; not what expected since the day you met him and his special ability. The year is 2029 and many things have changed for the mutants. and of course the bad guys wanted to create more and to control more, same old story that keeps coming back, no mater in what mutant year we are.The movie was a bit long for my likening, there were some scenes that could have been shortened or directly cut, specially the fight ones, which more were fanservice that anything else. But still, there were well-played and welcomed. The movie leaves some questions in the air and raises new ones that we probably won't get an answer any soon. As for the performances, we see again Wolverine and Professor X together sharing the screen, which it always means that some trouble is coming, and that we get to see two fantastic actors playing these beloved characters and again and probably for the last time.Finally a movie that gives justice to the beloved Wolverine character and that concludes a trilogy which two first films are forgettable but not this one. A film for Marvel fans to enjoy a different kind of movie than what we are used to.",7,0,3,9 March 2017
La La Land," City of Stars
","All right, this movie is gaining more and more echo sound as days goes by, but for once, all positive reviews, all positive remarks, all praises and compliments are more than well deserved.Since second one you are drawn into the story, into the characters, into the music! This movie is simply a piece of art. Something that needs to be watch and enjoyed at the same time. Many people are no fans of musical movies, but please, give it a chance. Take a chance on it as otherwise you will regret it deeply.The story told is nothing that we haven't seen before, boy and girl meet and they fall in love and make it into a musical. Nothing new in here but! Watch gets our attention is not the story itself, but how it is told. How we follow these characters into their lives. what are they aspirations and where they come from. Something really reachable for us, as we all can be identified with them.Of course the main character of the movie is the music. All songs are really catchy and the dance scenes are simply brilliant, full of color and rhythm. As for Ryan and Emma, I cannot think of a better duo together on-screen. As they have shown in past collaborations together, there is chemistry between them and that is something really important for this kind of movies. Both do an amazing job which is being rewarded thru the awards season that just began.A movie that gives tribute to classic musical movies, both made in Hollywood and not so made in Hollywood. A move that makes you forget about what is happening around you. A movie that tells a story that we all can be related to. A movie that makes you feel. A movie absolutely worth watching and enjoying.You still want more? Watch the fantastic French film 'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg' (1964); the film that inspired this fantastic piece of art that we have today and that is a piece of art itself.",10,6,14,14 January 2017
Don't Breathe," Breath if you dare
","(Good) horror movies are back! Finally! Lately we can enjoy horror (or thriller) movies that really gives us chills, and this is one of them!!More than a horror movie I would say this movie is a thriller movie, because more than getting scared you get stressed out, like really stressed out. The whole movie. Believe me. Yes, the three guys are supposed to be the bad guys as they are trespassing a private property but cannot but feel pity for them when the hunter becomes the prey.The movie has a good rhythm, not for a moment the stress does stop, maybe too much for our nerves, but everything has a reason to be. The only weak point it the reason behind all this (there is always a hidden reason) because is nothing special, kind of expected, but there is indeed a really disgusting situation which I will not mention but if you watch the movie you will know which I am talking about, and it is something that is not so normal.If you want to be frightened, then go watch this movie, there is no alien, no monster, unless you count human beings as monster, which is the sense of all this",7,0,1,4 June 2017
Beauty and the Beast," Tale as old as time
","Well, who doesn't like the Disney classic of 1991? I know, many might think, why do we need to watch another live action remake of a Disney classic? Well, because they know that we'll go to the cinema to watch it, as Disney has been proved right in the last year with: 'Alice in Wonderland', 'Maleficient', 'Cinderella', 'The Jungle Book', and it's only a matter of time before we have: 'The Little Mermaid', 'The Lion King' or 'Aladdin' on the big screen with real actors. So if Marvel is a non-stop machine of superhero movies making, this more classical side of Disney is a non-stop machine of cartoon classic movies.So, the movie is interesting to watch; because of course you will wonder: have they changed the story? Are the dialogues the same? What do the characters look like (in case you are of that minority who hasn't watched any advertising at all). And best of all: how is Hermione, er Emma Watson, playing Belle? So, the movie is not bad, but maybe is not that good, but as said before, is interesting to watch and enjoyable. Maybe a bit too long, and there are many added situations and details that try to give an added value compared to the 19991's one but honestly, it could have worked without it. There is one real problem here: that the classic movie from 1991 was too good, too good, so anything that is being made will be compared no matter what, and if we do compare this one, sorry, but it loses. If the cartoon one didn't exist at all, then maybe our opinions would differ. The plot is exactly the same. Except some updated facts: more feminism, black characters, and even a gay one, which by the way, it's probably the funniest thing of the movie. Then another trouble is that making CGI characters leaves less flexibility than designing it as a cartoon, and that is why all household characters look a bit weird at the beginning, but you'll get used to it pretty fast. Then there are the human actors. Emma Watson nails it as Belle, giving her a Hermione touch of course, that will make Potterheads crazier. Opposite her is Dan Stevens who is most of the movie behind the beast face but his voice is enough for us to love the characters. But leaving the main couple aside, there is another couple that in my opinion steals the show; and those are Gaston and LeFou, which a probably the best characters in this adaptation. Gaston playing a narcissist and LeFou playing the unwanted lover, which is really hilarious and a breath of fresh air.Last but not least, we have the other main character of the movie: the music. Just listening to the first opening tunes gives us goosebumps that we'll reappear at other points of the movie when we listen to the songs we were waiting for, special 'Tale as old as time...'. Plus there are three extra songs that weren't in the cartoon movie that will probably surprise us too. A movie about a tale that we all know about. It might be too long at some point, but nonetheless it's a movie to enjoy with the whole family. It doesn't matter if you were a kid when you watched the original one or a parent of said kit, the tales is the same, what only changes is the way it is told. Just remember, when you get out of the cinema, you'll only want to watch the cartoon one and be five years old again.#BeOurGuest",8,1,10,19 March 2017
Sicario," Sicario lo somos todos
","Many of you might think, oh no, another drug dealing movie about what is going on at the border between the USA and Mexico... and yes, you are right, this is another movie about what is happening but we don't want to know is happening day after day... but let me tell you something, the movie is really catchy and why is that? Well besides how it has been filmed there something different from the others movie: the main character is a woman.Emily's Blunt character is what makes this movie terrifyingly real and to gain our attention among all the movies from the same topic. She is the newcomer in a land of men, as one might say. she is coming from the bureau where everything follows some rules and there is the law. Here she has to learn to not follow said rules and even forget about the law. Time to sort of one priorities.The plot itself is nothing out of the ordinary but it is the actors' work that make this movie one movie to remember (or not to forget). It is really an entertaining movie that gets your attention with what is happening and with its reality that not many other movies can comply. Really worth your time.Review written: 19/10/2015",7,0,0,18 December 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," We are Groot
","Guardians of the Galaxy was a fresh story that we knew nothing about (unless you are a Marvel fan, the you knew almost everything). Now we know these characters and the story continuous keeping the same style of the first movie, but with more laughs than ever.We find our heroes together some time after the first movie, doing their businesses, and for this movie the main plot it's Star-Lords origins, which of course they might not be as they look like. While his background story is interesting, there is a lack of magic like in the first movie, of course it was something new back then and now we have the same. But the movie lacks the kind of action and story that the first had. Plus, this one is really a stand alone movie, not connected at all with the MCU (for the moment). If the movie wasn't there, maybe we wouldn't miss anything of the whole story arcs.Yes, you cannot stop laughing, because let's be clear, more than an action film it looks like a comedy one. Specially with the pair that Racoon and Groot are, once again they steal the show, specially baby Groot. But it's not only Star-Lords parentage that we learn about, we also learn the other backgrounds, which is good, as there were many questions unanswered in the first movie and in this one we get them.As always, the movie is pure a visual effect, which nowadays we are really used to watch, but maybe one of the best scenes is the opening sequence. Then, another detail that this movie has as its predecessor it's the music, that 80s style is really present through the whole movie, and personally one of my favorite ones is during the rolling of the credits, so stay tuned. And don't forget to stay seated until the very end of the movie, as there are not one, nor, two, nor three, nor four, but five post-credit scenes. Yes, a bit of an overload, but there are a couple that looks really interesting..Remember: #WeAreGroot",7,4,6,17 May 2017
The Shape of Water," The Shape of a Fairy Tale
","For once we are presented with a fabulous original fairy tale that is suited not only for children, but for adults too, and it is in this kind of stories that Guillermo del Toro is a master of the universe, without any doubt.The story is set in the 50s in a secret facility where the government makes experiments and also pursues some investigations. We are presented with the main character, Elisa; a mute woman who works as a cleaner and who one day, while cleaning a room with her colleague and friend, meets a creature that will change her life forever. Yes, it sounds like the typical fairy tale, and this is indeed a fairy tale, but as always, what is important is the way it is told because that it what makes a difference and this one, this movie, it told in the most pure and fantastic of ways.We are used to the magnificent visuals that Mr del Toro always provides, and in this one he doesn't let us down. The visuals are simply fabulous: from how the creature is made, to the contrast of colours through the whole movie. While blue is the dominant color of the movie (water is blue, don't forget), there are some brownish and reddish tonalities that simply complete the colour palette. Then, we have a delightful music that transports you to the water. Tt really feels like you are swimming there with the main characters, which is important, as when we are under water we tend to hear less that when we are on the surface, so here the music creates a surrounding atmosphere that isolates us from the rest. We don't care anymore about anything else.But what would this movie be without its main actress? Sally Hawkins has a hard job, as she cannot use her voice to express what her character is feeling, but she has to do it all visually for the audience to comprehend. Needless to say, she is terrific in this role, she is the one that had to play this part, the best choice. Her work is even more highlighted with the help of the brilliant supporting actors that are Octavia Spencer, playing her colleague and friend, and giving some funny moments to us, and Michael Shannon playing the villain, which it always suits him and he never disappoints.This is one of the best original movies of the last years, which have been filled with sequels, prequels, reboots, remakes, etc. It is a breath of fresh air for someone who is a bit tired of all this lack of imagination that is happening lately in Hollywood. A movie for everyone to enjoy and believe again in fairy tales, or to start believing if you didn't before.",8,34,62,28 January 2018
Murder on the Orient Express," Too Much Ado about Nothing on the Orient Express
","If you haven't read the original novel nor have watched the 1974 movie, you will like the movie. But if you are an Agatha Christie's fan or have done one of both before mentioned, there is a high chance that you won't like the movie (as that is my case).This movies highly differs form the original source material. Here we are presented with Poirot solving another case before embarking on the Orient Express. Then we are presented the characters in a very rushed way and finally the crime happens and the action begins. Yes, there is action. And the question we are all asking ourselves is: Since when Poirot and action are on the same page? Since now, apparently. Instead of following the path that the previous (and brilliant) installment did, which is: there is a murder, then we spend the whole movie solving it following Poirot inquisition; here there is too many adding that don't add anything to the story: chases, going out of the train, going back in, questioning this one, questioning the other one, and worst of all: and indecisive and lovesick Poirot. And I can only ask: why!? Why!!!?Then we have the whole cast. It is clear here that they wanted to do as in the old movie, bring a huge international known cast (more or less) and make a masterpiece. Sorry, but nope. Having many movie stars doesn't mean having a good movie, and here we have the perfect case. Personally, none of the cast members gives a good performance of their characters. which is normal, seeing as they changed tha characters and made them less interesting than in the novel.Finally, there is the story. The character introduction is a bit of a mess up, pointing out things about the characters that are irrelevant and adding more things than necessary. Moreover, the whole movie too much Americanized, it doesn't have the tension or the interest that an Agatha Christie work would have: too much action, too many unnecessary kind of cliffhangers and the way of solving the mystery too rushed and too dramatic. Again, unnecessary.The movie will be a unforgettable one with the time. If you really want to enjoy a good work, go watch the 1974's version of Murder on the Orient Express, there you will appreciate what is reuniting a star cast.",6,0,2,3 December 2017
Arrival," A wonderful Arrival
","This movie has been a blow of fresh air. It is not the typical alien invasion movie. If you are looking for some action kind of 'War of the Worlds' or 'Spaceship Troopers' go find something else. This is not your movie. This goes beyond that, to infinity and beyond, as Buzz Lightyear would say.The movie starts with the apparition of 12 alien vessels arriving at different point on Earth (of course one is on the USA, where else?). The military then contact Amy Adam's linguistic in order to help to establish contact with the alien and learn why are they here and what they want. With her is Jeremy Runner's physic helping with the scientific side. So having this established, the movie then flows into a more scientific-human way to approach the issue than what we are used in Mr Bay's movies or as Leeloo from the 'Fifth Element' would say: 'big bada boom'. No big bada boom or booms. The point is understanding what they want before shooting; something we aren't that used to in this kind of science fiction movies.As in all sci-fi movies visual effects are one actor more and in this one the effects are well created and made with extra care. But of course visual effects without music it like a pizza without cheese, tasteless. The music and the sound effects play and important role in this movie because that is what we are trying to decipher: what are they saying. Needless to say both main actors keep the movie at its best specially Amy Adams (when is she going to win an Oscar please?). As usual, she is fantastic and she can transmit to the audience the weight she has in her shoulders as the interpreter between humanity and the aliens. She is THE protagonist of the movie. Nor the aliens and definitely no one else.This movie tries to reach to you and make you think, not only about what would happen if we were contacted or visited from another species from outer Space, but also it makes you think about humanity as a whole, about life, about your destiny. What would you do?",9,2,7,28 May 2017
Life," Alien Life
","This is a fantastic movie. Not only it's entertaining but you are tensed the whole time the movie is on the screen. Something that many of us haven't felt watching this kind of sci-fi horror movies since we watch the masterpiece that is Alien.If you watch the trailer you probably will think it's the new Alien movie, which by the way comes out next month, but that is far from the truth. While it might seem like a copy from Alien, this movie takes another path. A path that feels more real to us because this could happen right now, up there, at the ISS and we wouldn't be aware of it. Not at all. Yes, it is clearly inspired by Alien, but that's it. Not even the creature looks alike, nor the way the story keeps forward. It has its own charm, its own style, and that is something to be grateful for because it makes the audience enjoy the movie, and that is why we go to the cinema in the first place.As any science-fiction movie, visual effects are the main characters of the show and in this movie they are but they don't fully get all our attention because the movie has a terrific cast in it that makes us forget that everything we see is CGI, which is also an added value of it. All the actors are just brilliant. Each of them playing wonderfully their roles and you just can't hate them in some cases, but just feel really sorry for them, of what you know is going to happen to them. but you keep watching to see it happening.This movie is a magnet to the eye and it's not only science- fiction,. because what it depicts, it could really happen anytime. Finding life outside Earth, which it's still being our focus and are fresh news. A really good movie to enjoy and one that won't disappoint you at all.",8,5,11,15 May 2017
Annihilation," Annihilation without Ripley
","This director left us with a wonderful feeling after watching his previous masterpiece 'Ex-Machina'. This is his next work and although it stays short regarding its predecessor, it doesn't leave you indifferent, but it leaves you pondering after you finish watching it.The story takes you to a biologist whose husband went into a mission and after one year missing he returns to her but he doesn't look quite the same. He left on a mission inside an area surrounded by a mysterious light and from where no one except him has ever returned. Therefore, she among other scientists embark on a journey to discover what the mystery is inside the area. This sound like the typical science fiction meets horror movie, and I couldn't help myself but be reminded of Alien. I know, it's not the same, but the concept about horror in space but more like the Prometheus movie is present thru the whole movie.The movie is based on a book and one gets the feeling of it, but also one gets the feeling that there are some changes, although you haven't read said novel. The movie goes slow, and at some points you start wondering what is about, but the more you keep watching, the pieces start to fall into place. The mystery starts to unfold and although at some point the surprise factor is given away beforehand, you still want to keep watching it.In this movie what gets our eyes are definitely the visual effects. They are simply beautiful and the music helps enjoy them more making you feel a peace with yourself but still feeling on edge of what may happen. It's true that there are some aspects of the movie that make you think: why are they doing this? This is not how this should be made? WTF? But above all these tine mistakes, as to give them a name, don't make the movie less enjoyable.",7,2,5,29 March 2018
Minions," BANANA
","If you watched the first two Despicable Me movies you will love this one more (much more!). Cause don't forget, the stars of those movies are these yellow small people! So here you find them as the main characters and the funny begins!The plot is not bad at all. The idea is that they explain us where do the Minions come from and what were they doing before being with Gru. So that means, one funny scene after another. They are going everywhere to find the baddest ass ever, and finally the find Scarlet (voiced by Sandra Bullock, who really gets into character). Then, the fun continues and goes on, and goes on.There isn't much of a dialogue here, well there is, but please let me know if you understand anything that they say about it! Which is even more hilarious cause you might get some words in your language (whatever the language is). So, if you wanna laugh go and watch it, cause remember, the Minions were the best thing in the Despicable Me movies, so now they don't need to steal the show as they have their own one!Just one more thing: BANANA!PS: Stay until the end credits and some more",7,0,0,18 December 2018
Hacksaw Ridge," A hero without superpowers
","Mel Gibson is back! And not in front of the screen but behind it! And we already know that what he does with the camera sometimes is way better than his performances and this film is a perfect example of it.The story that the film is based on is an interesting if not hard to believe story, but it did really happen. Having a good story to make a movie about does not mean that the movie is going to be a good movie, is not the case of this one, as it is indeed a great movie. The story is brilliantly told, we see the evolution of the main character, his childhood, his preparation for war and the point of it all, when he is at war, what he does, how he does it and at some point we learn why he does all this no weapon thing.The camera follows the main actor, Andrew Garfield, wherever he goes. It's a smooth movement that keeps us attached to the main character. Andrew does a fantastic work in this movie, which proves that he is an actor with potential so it looks like that we will hear more from him (and that he has obtained an Oscar nomination for this role just proves it).At some point you will smell in the air a big of 'Saving Private Ryan', because it is how it is made, but instead of somebody trying to find a private and to rescue him, in here is the private who is doing all the rescuing, which is simply impressive when you think it really happened, maybe not that way exactly, but it doesn't make it less incredible.An entertaining movie where you will learn what a real hero is without the need of special powers or spandex outfits. Because heroes really exist and here is an example to learn about one of them while being entertained.",7,2,7,26 January 2017
Alien: Covenant," Give me your Alien money
","It's the first time that we get to see a proper Alien in an Alien movie for 20 years. So curiosity, after watching the trailer, had us attracted to watch this movie; and also the need to get the unsolved questions raised in Prometheus.The action takes place 10 years after the previous movies and where we see the magic equation from the old alien movies: a crew going somewhere and receiving an alert message, so they go to that planet to investigate and they find there one or two surprises. While this might have worked in the first two alien movies (and masterpieces), here there is something missing. The story goes too fast and there isn't any surprises at all, because while we are watching the movie, we are guessing what is going to happen. And that is really a pity.We do indeed get many answers, but maybe they are not what we were expecting (not what we wanted) and the feeling that you have been waiting almost 40 years for this, gives you a strange feeling. Plus, the movie leaves many open doors and raises other kind of questions that we hope will be patched up in the following movie, which by the way you will be left wondering what is going to happen: how they are going to connect this one to the original one.Another problem that I see is that there are too many actors, there are like 15 crew members, which we see suffering one after another. And believe me when I say this is the first Alien movie were I laughed at the fate of some of them, because some situations are a bit ridiculous, pardon me. Maybe with fewer people the repeating idea would have worked differently and even better. Despite that at some point we hear the Alien and the Prometheus theme, we are left a bit cold or feeling nothing like we felt 40 years ago.Although the film shines more light to the Alien story than Prometheus did, it feels like something is missing, which is ironical as it provides many answers, which we have been waiting for since the original Alien movie. It feels just like another action movie, missing the magic of the two original ones (please pretend that Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection never existed).",7,6,13,17 May 2017
The Martian," There is no Gravity on Mars
","First of all, this is no 'Interstellar' nor Gravity' though you might think otherwise... This is a movie about 'could a human live in Mars?'. It's basically a movie about survival and what man has to do in the so red planet. Don't expect any bad guys or action or shooting cause this is not that kind of movie.That said, the movie is very scientifically accurate (or at least they try) and you spend the whole time of it waiting to see how it ends, if it's a success or a failure, if he survives or not... (you will have to watch it in order to know the answer).Matt Damon does an amazing job, although you might think about his role in 'Interstellar' this one has nothing to do with it (NOTHING). Here you can feel his solitude, his longing to survive, and he spends much of the movie doing that, you see what he has to do in order to survive and how he does it. He is the movie.The movie is pretty good and pretty interesting because it makes you ponder if mankind could live in Mars or in any other planet. It's a survival movie.Review written: 10/10/2015",8,0,1,18 December 2018
