The Rock," Welcome to the Rock!
","Connery and Cage seemed mismatched at first, but then made good as a screen team attempting to take down a devious Ed Harris. From Jerry Bruckheimer and under the direction of Michael Bay, the film is an entertaining mix of explosive action, drama and humor.",6,1,2,4 March 1999
The Blair Witch Project," The Blair Witch Project
","Highly intense psychological terror brought to the screen in a creepy, but incredibly inventive fashion. The word that comes to mind is claustrophobic...you feel so drawn to the story and into the piece that you begin to feel the terror yourself. It grabs hold of you and never lets go. Now that's a real horror film right there, folks!",Null,0,1,5 August 1999
Vertigo," Vertigo
","Bernard Herrmann's haunting score keeps you on the edge of your seat in this seamless production from Alfred Hitchcock. Stewart delivers with his usual style and grace, but it is Novak who is especially impressive.",8,2,6,7 April 1999
Scarface," Scarface
","I find myself enjoying this film when I watch it. Well, perhaps enjoying is a bit of an odd verb when you think of the storyline, its characters, the amount of violence and of course, the f-bomb being dropped about 15,000 times. I like Pacino in this film. He shows us the violent anger we didn't see in Michael Corleone. We're Michael would say, 'Never hate your enemies, it clouds your judgement,' Tony Montana's out killing everybody. Now granted, there are moments in his performance...or in the script where you have to laugh. The questioning scene in the beginning of the film is a fine example of this. When asked where he got that scar on his cheek...well, I can't write what he says in the regular version, but I will tell you that on edited version on TNT, it from was 'eating pine apple.' There is a great performance from Robert Loggia. He's the only character I truly believed in the film. Frank was a businessman, not a killer. All he wanted was the money. Greed killed him, as it has killed so many people. I enjoyed the direction Loggia went with Frank. It has carried over his recent work and has made Loggia one of Hollywood's must durable supporting actors. Brian DePalma adds his usual blend of violence, but it seemed that for once, he was trying to make his own film. Not borrowed. No guessing games on who he stole from this time. Although he's blasted for the film's content, it is a new beginning to his career which took off, but it was really 'The Untouchables' that made me consider him a serious director.",Null,99,169,24 March 1999
Gremlins," Gremlins
","Appealing comedy/horror about a cute, fuzzy animal that multiplies into into an army of mischievous and repulsive creatures. All hell breaks loose! The film is entertaining for all ages. Followed by a sequel.",8,0,2,14 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Phantom Menace
","Limited thrills and excitement in this highly anticipated return to the phenom (conglomerate may be more appropriate) known as Star Wars. Lucas is big on effects, effects that were exciting 20 years ago, but are now outlived and overworked. Phantom Menace is short on story as well. It just doesn't have the same appeal as the original. The cast has its mix. Neeson and McGregor are effective as Jedi Knights, while Lloyd suffers horribly from the obvious clash in acting styles with the more able Neeson and McGregor. Portman is dull as Queen Amidala, but then again, Queen Amidala is dull. The rest of the characters lack the appeal and fun of the original players. Jar-Jar Binks has its moments, but his character seems more into the schtick and not into the major focus of the story. While I did not find the character annoying, I did find him quite pointless to the scope and theme of the film. Darth Maul was quite menacing to look at, so why wasn't he given any significant dialogue? He was quite imposing and added to the only exciting aspect of the film, a superb fight sequence that was obviously given much attention; too bad I cannot say that for the rest of the film. Wuth this return to Star Wars, one has to ask director Lucas this question: Why make this movie? Money? For the countless numbers of fans who sat up until and well past the midnight hour to get tickets to the opening show? Who knows? It will make money. Lots of money. All I'm saying is that if you're going to bring back the thrills from 20 years ago...do that! Bring back the thrills. Bring back the characters we love. Frankly, I could care less about the development of Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader. George? Get to the good stuff. You got two more films to go...don't disappoint.",Null,1,4,1 June 1999
The Sound of Music," The Sound of Music
","Radiant version of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical with Andrews singing and acting with such vitality and beauty that one forgets the mishaps with the film, most notably the length. Too long!

Raiders of the Lost Ark," Raiders of the Lost Ark
",Exciting adventure classic that is a great homage to the adventure serials of the 30's and 40's. Ford's characterization of rough and rugged Indiana Jones is a national treasure as is this first of an amazing series of motion pictures.,10,0,2,27 May 1999
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Raiders of the Lost Ark
","Speilberg and Lucas' homage to those classic adventures of the 1930's and 1940's is an interesting mix of adventure, suspense and humor. Ford is perfect as our hero and he is given support by a fine supporting cast, including Rhyes-Davies, Freeman and Karen Allen. In the 1980's, Indiana Jones became an even bigger hero than Superman. He had that charm. He had that style. He had that look. He still has all of that and much, much more. The film is always worth a few more viewings. Followed by 2 very successful sequels.",10,0,2,6 April 1999
Spartacus," Spartacus
","Epic that meanders at times, but is still impressive because of the superb performances of Douglas, Olivier and Ustinov. Dalton Trumbo's script is a plus also and Kubrick pours everything into the piece. It does run long...very long, but still memorable.",Null,1,2,28 May 1999

Spectacular sound/visual effects and the rousing score of John Williams lead us through this masterpiece.",8,1,3,24 August 1999

","Entertaining film based on the huge SNL skit about pop culture sponges Wayne and Garth who sell their basement cable-access TV show to a city slicker, well played by Lowe. Has loads of fun with itself, never dispensing the fact that it is indeed silly! Chris Farley appears in a small role.",Null,2,5,25 July 1999
The Big Lebowski," The Dude Abides!!!
","No movie has entertained me more in the last year than this film. It's delightfully written, directed with poise and acted with extravagance and excellence. I do admit that this is a film that I had to see six times to get. Every time I watch it I learn something new. The genius of the film lies within a game I think the Coen brothers play with their audiences. There are the touches of the masters in many of their films. In 'The Hudsucker Proxy,' it was Preston Sturges and Frank Capra. In 'Raising Arizona,' I felt a touch of Sam Fuller. In this film, I felt many touches of greatness, but more specifically I felt John Sayles or even John Cassevettes in spots. The camera was manipulated beautifully and I felt a tinge of their talents lurking in at many a turn. The performances are astounding, especially Goodman as the deranged bowler still living deep within the jungles of the Vietcong. Huddleston is also quite wonderful as the title character. Turturro gives a fine cameo as 'Jesus,' coupled with a rousing and humurous version of the Eagles, 'Hotel California,' done in Espanol. I hope this is a film that is looked at with more seriousness. It is, once you dig deep, a fine piece of filmmaking.",10,225,374,24 February 1999
As Good as It Gets," Touching or Tragic?
","Are we bothered at the end of the film that nothing is really resolved between Melvin and Carol? Melvin will still be an obsessive compulsive and Carol will still be taking midnight trips to the hospital with Spencer. I find that to be an incredibly tragic element to the film. The fact that both characters found each other is touching, but Brooks structures it to show us that while there are happy endings, there's still reality.The brilliance of the film also lies within the simple fact that this is not a comedy. While Nicholson has many snappy one-liners and insult jokes at the expense of Greg Kinnear's Simon, the film is still as tragic and as deep as one of Shakespeare's sonnets. When Nicholson learns that Verdell is to be taken away from him, he's lost something that he has grown attached to and for a man in his position, it is loss at the deepest level. Verdell represents harmony for Melvin. Melvin is in harmony with the world when Verdell is around. There is a kinship between Verdell and Melvin that is quite lovely, but also quite tragic. As the film progresses, Carol represents harmony, thus their strong relationship emerges. Both Melvin and Carol are two lost souls searching not for the right answers, but for a place to start the search for the right answers.",9,2,5,24 February 1999
Citizen Kane," Citizen Kane
","Powerful motion picture that grabs you from the opening shot right to the close. Welles is amazing as director, writer and star of this astounding motion picture about Charles Foster Kane, (based on newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst) whose idea of news opened the floodgates for giants like Winchell, who made their own news. Kane made people, but also broke people as well. It's a shattering study of greed, torment and mental anquish; all brought to us in realistic fashion with a superb script and top notch support from Moorehead, Cotten and Warrick. Snubbed by Oscar in 1941, the film only won for its taut screenplay. A haunting film that will continue to be studied by film students, directors, actors and historians for years and years to come.",10,1,3,9 June 1999

Batman Returns," Batman Returns
","Solid return to the Caped Crusader with Keaton taking on DeVito's divine Penguin and Pfieffer's sexy Catwoman. Burton succeeds once again, as in the original, with the help of, once again, Danny Elfman's musical score and grand support from Walken, Gough and Hingle.",8,1,3,30 June 1999
Batman Returns," Batman Returns
",Fine return to the Caped Crusader as he now takes on Penguin (Devito) and Catwoman (Pfieffer). Burton directs with the same touch of darkness as the original and it comes off perfectly. The series should have ended with Burton and Keaton's departure.,8,1,3,16 June 1999

The Natural," The Natural
","This is a film that whisks you right off you feet and keeps you in the air throughout the entire thing. Every camera shot is timed. Every angle is covered. Every chord of music from the great Randy Newman is majestic. Redford is the Arthurian like hero of the New York Knights who 'lived for a dream that wouldn't die.' The lighting is also quite wonderful in the film. It captures Redford like it has never captured him before. We see the age. We see the lines, but we still admire him. We still dream as his Roy Hobbs does. Dream stories make great motion pictures. It gives us something to dream of.",Null,1,2,16 April 1999
Home Alone," Where Did That Sweet Kid Go?
","A fun family film for the holidays. Macaulay Culkin stars as a young, inadvertently left behind at Christmas when his parents go on holiday, who foils some inept housebreakers, played delightfully by Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci. From the great John Hughes, this one is still nice to pop into the VCR at times just to ask yourself, 'What ever happened to that handsome little kid?' Catherine O'Hara, John Heard and John Candy co-star.",9,2,4,2 March 1999
The Hustler," Newman, Scott and Gleason Ignite...
","Robert Rossen carefully directs this film with every ounce of poise one can muster. There's not a dull moment within the entire picture. It's filled with exciting characters, fine editing and a compelling story that'll shock and thrill you. The cast is incredible, as to be expected with these names: Newman, Scott, Gleason, Piper Laurie and Murray Hamilton are crystalline in their performances.",Null,32,52,3 March 1999

","George Lucas thrills us once again in his third installment in one of the greatest sagas in film history.

The special effects are as riveting as ever, as are the cast of regulars Ford, Fisher and Williams.",9,2,4,24 August 1999

Malcolm X," Malcolm X
","Washington is brilliant as Malcolm X, but Spike Lee's direction seems strained and forced. The film runs entirely too long and you find yourself looking down at your watch after the first 2 hours. Although long winded, it's still very entertaining with Albert Hall and Al Freeman Jr. in stand out supporting roles. Lee himself has a small part but does nothing with it.",Null,2,7,30 March 1999
Taxi Driver," A Pure Shocker!!!
","A masterpiece filled with the fantastic score of Bernard Herrmann, the exquisite direction of Martin Scorsese, the chilling screenplay of both Scorsese and Paul Schrader, and of course, the performances of an incredible cast. DeNiro, Foster, Keitel, Boyle and Sheppard are all amazing in their roles. DeNiro is magnificent, but it is Keitel who truly ignites the screen with a role, that according to Keitel himself, was mostly improvised. He was originally set to play the Albert Brooks (also good) role, but Keitel wanted the pimp and that's what he got. To compare this Keitel with the Keitel in Mean Streets shows a great range on the part of the multi-talented actor.The film is violent yes, but Scorsese almost makes it art. DeNiro's Travis Bickle is as twisted as the mean streets he meets every night, but he makes him someone we feel sympathy for. The scene with director Scorsese is quite amazing itself. Scorsese shows some acting ability here that an actor/director like Tarantino wouldn't know if it jumped up and bit him in the behind.One of the most chilling climaxes I've ever seen...One of the most compelling films ever made.",10,0,0,3 March 1999

","An amazing film with a great pace, superb direction by Zwick and an outstanding cast of Broderick, Freeman (in his best role) and Oscar winner Washington. There is the great music of James Horner to lead us into battle and the battle scenes are exquisite. One of the most important films ever made.",9,1,2,20 March 1999
The Godfather: Part II," The Godfather Part II
","I have to agree with Robert Towne when he said this film is one of the greatest achievements in the history of screenwriting. When the camera follows DeNiro as he moves from rooftop to rooftop, falling into the abyss filled with crime and corrpution, it will affect him and his family forever. DeNiro is slick and smooth as the young Vito Corleone. The rise of Michael Corleone's power is superbly captured by Coppola and delivered with cold hearted villainy by Al Pacino, in his finest performance. Strasberg is also solid in his performance of Hyman Roth. It's nice to see him put that 'method' to work. The only one who feels out of it here is Duvall who seems to be simply going through motions. It may have been that Tom's character is also given limited depth within the script. It is a superb sequel, argued by many to be superior to the original.",10,7,11,21 March 1999
10 Things I Hate About You," 10 Things I Hate About You
","Flat film that has no real point other than to show a new twist on the classic Shakespeare comedy. It's dull, with only a few laughs, compliments of Miller and Krumholtz, who are the only entertaining elements in the entire thing. As for the poor writing and amateurish direction...Well, you see where this is going. All the main leads are not actors, but models who think they're going to be the stars of tomorrow. They have a long way to go.",Null,1,3,4 April 1999

","Highly charged action thriller from Luc Besson that explodes onto the screen and delivers from start to finish.

","It's sad that Tom Cruise had to ruin the whole film by talking. The boy still hasn't learned how to act. When Newman isn't on, it's dull. The script is pretty thin.

","An asteroid threatens the Earth and only Bruce Willis and his band of oil riggers can save the world. An entertaining, but cheezy film. It's more entertaining when Ben Affleck isn't on the screen.

North by Northwest," Mason Steals the Film...
","James Mason steals this Hitchcock classic as a slick and oily villian trying to bump off star Cary Grant. Mason shines in these kinds of roles because of his sharp wit and fiery demeanor. He never gets mad, he just hisses at you, like a snake. The auction scene is an example of Mason's power in these roles. The rest of the film is also exciting with Grant mixing humor and intrigue to find the answers. Saint is sensual in her role. It's those eyes. Martin Landau is also menacing as Mason's henchman. One of the finest in the many great Hitch classics...",9,1,2,5 March 1999
The Shining," What is Brilliance?
","What is brilliance? Many will think Welles, Ford or Capra. We know the films and their honors. Are they truly brilliant achievements? To say that Stanley Kubrick is an odd director would be a gross understatement. He's known for his treatment of actors and his treatment of script. But we also know that the man gets results. Dislike him or revere him, he is one of the finest directors of the 20th century. This film is probably his biggest undertaking. It may be appropriate to say that this is his biggest commercial success or his only commercial film. 'Clockwork' and '2001' did very well at the box offices, but they are hailed as critical and artistic pieces. This film is a horror film. No point in denying what it is. It falls into the category of the Jason's, the Michael Myers and the Freddy Kruger's. But...it also stands right next to the Damein's, the Exorcist's and the Serpent and the Rainbow's. It blends both styles of horror together and creates a feast of fear that one can sink their teeth into over and over again.I can watch Nicholson's over the top performance over and over again. It's one of the most challenging roles in his career. Many critics pose that the character's anger was poorly developed and motivated. I would disagree on that notion because going into the film we know from the meeting with Ullman that this guy is not right. I was not bothered by that. It's sort of a twist. It adds mystery . It poses the question: Who's really evil?...Jack?...or Danny? There were scenes that I actually felt myself rooting for his character, because he represents a hidden rage within all of his. We cannot deny it. To show that on film...that's brilliance!",8,1,4,24 February 1999
Judgment at Nuremberg," Judgment at Nuremberg
","Stanley Kramer's most important film is an intense film about Nazi war criminals on trial. Tracy is energetic as one of members of the tribunal. Widmark and Schell (Oscar winner-Best Actor) go nose to nose to find the truth. Lancaster is intense as one of the criminals. Clift and Garland ignite in key supporting roles. The film runs a bit long, but it's still highly effective and gripping.",Null,4,6,25 March 1999

","Satirical comedy that stars Groucho as a wisecracking ruler of little Freedonia who torments and insults folks like Louis Calhern (over in neighboring Sylvania) to the point where where war will run rampant...and it does. Features wonderful parodies of 30's musicals. (Groucho's entrance music is priceless.) Chico and Harpo add to the menace in memorable scenes with vendor Edgar Kennedy, who is beautifully befuddled. The famous mirror scene that usually gets more laughs in Bugs Bunny cartoons, gets plenty rolling in the aisles here. The great Margaret Dumont co-stars as Groucho's constant punching bag and she never misses anything; a twitch of an eyebrow...a grunt... Majestic! This was the Marx Brothers best play on words film. Features the song 'We're Going to War,' which helps the film reach its rousing conclusion, but not before we see Harpo do a splendid rendition of Paul Revere.

Schindler's List," Schindler's List
","An intense and moving motion picture that shocks, astounds and amazes in all of its 3 hours and 17 minutes. Liam Neeson is superb as Schindler, a womanizing bastard who profiteered off the sweat and tears of countless numbers of Jews at the start of the 1940's. As time went on, he saw the demise of the Jewish to Nazi rule and took a stand to save as many as he could. He ended up saving 1,100 Jews and he is considered, to this day, a savior. Neeson's transformation throughout the course of the film from Nazi supporter to Savior of the People is a poignant journey of soul searching. When you watch the piece, you may wonder, 'Is he changing because he's out of money? Does money truly matter at this point anymore? I think many would agree that Schindler had an awakening and that saving the people and himself was his destiny. He found peace with himself and with God. Steven Speilberg gives us a story that he has never imagined he could bring to us. He brings real life horror. A horror many people cannot confront as a survivor, let alone as an actor. Every actor should be commended for their courage in telling this important story. I am not Jewish, so all I can feel is sadness and sorrow for the tragedies that took place, but I cannot the anguish the countless families have felt for decades over the loss of parents, grandparents and children alike. With an intense screenplay from Stephen Zallian and cinematography and art direction that is the finest in years. Ralph Fiennes is outstanding as the Nazi soldier who treats Jews as cattle. The scene where he awakes, picks up a rifle and commences firing on a Jewish woman standing alone is true horror. Through the course of this film, I turned my head away countless times, not knowing what made people do what they do. Was their hope? Hope. That seems to be the key word in describing this movie. Hope is what Oskar Schindler gave 1,100 Jews. He gave them hope. He gave them life!",10,9,14,25 March 1999
Dog Day Afternoon," Dog Day Afternoon
","A very funny film when you watch closely. Pacino's Sonny is a complete idiot. He goes in to rob a bank with no real thought how he's going to get out with the money or if he's going to make it out alive at all. No planning. No idea how to deal with the situation. Don't have any intention of killing anybody. Don't even know why they're robbing the bank in the first place. That's what makes the film a masterpiece. Lumet and Pacino are poking fun at the Fox-TV phenom called 'America's Dumbest Criminals' : These characters who rob banks or 7-11's, get in a bind and then turn the entire ordeal into a tragedy about their lives and their hopes and dreams...not of the people being held up at gunpoint. That's brilliance!",Null,0,3,24 March 1999

","Splendid adaptation of Peter Shaffer's play about Mozart as a vulgar, clownish musical prodigy, played brilliantly by Tom Hulce. Mozart aroused envy in mediocre composer Antonio Salieri, played by opulent grace by Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham. The film shines in all areas, with special attention to be given to the production designers and set designers who recreated this wonderful era for us, if only for a few hours. Milos Forman's direction is amazing, as always.",9,1,3,12 May 1999

The Graduate," The Graduate
","The sequence where Hoffman asks Buck Henry for a room is still one of the funniest scenes ever. It's been said that Nichols' direction to Hoffman was that he should look as if he's asking for condoms. It's wonderful! Hoffman filling out the register, messing up and crumbling a piece of paper into his pocket and starting over is right on the money. It's a perfectly timed sequence with no one playing it too heavily. That's how the entire film is. The film is funny because it seems to me that no one really takes themselves too seriously. Maybe it's the rich and wealthy who feel that way. In any case, the performances are outstanding.  Bancroft is shocking and seductive as the mischievous Mrs. Robinson. Katherine Ross is still one of the most beautiful women ever. The sequence in the bar when she's crying is a perfect shot of her beauty. Hoffman is damn near perfect as Benjamin, even though the original idea for the character was someone resembling a Redford or George Segal. Hoffman's Benjamin is a loner in need of something. Direction. Love. Guts. All of those things.  I'm not so sure that Ben can truly love anything. It looked as if he had a lot of growing up to do. Who knows if we'll met Ben and Elaine again. What about Mrs. Robinson? It sure would be nice. Who knows?",10,1,2,23 March 1999

","Insanely off the wall comedy from the Farrelly Brothers that delivers from start to finish. Wonderful early sequence with Keith David as Diaz's father busting heavily braced Stiller's chops. Stiller's zipper scene goes down as one of the funniest and most painful things I have ever witnessed on film. Diaz is divine the woman of Stiller's dreams...Dillon is hired to find Diaz...He falls in love with her and gives Stiller a bum story... Lee Evans, a pizza boy, is in love with her too... then Brett Favre comes into the picture.  Every scene has something memorable from Dillon's attempts at reviving a dog to Stiller's 'pre date entertainment.' A classic that doesn't take itself too seriously.",9,50,68,13 June 1999
A Clockwork Orange," Kubrick's Artistry At Work...
","One of the most horrific, but gripping films ever made. Kubrick injects enough sardonic humor and grisly menace to make a viewer go in five different directions by the film's end.

","Still one of the funniest films ever made. Lemmon and Curtis are a perfect match as musicians on the run as witnesses to the St. Valentine's Day Massacre...dressing up as women. I love the story about how both stars tested their 'get up' out by going into the ladies room in their costumes. Both stars have said that no one even questioned it. That's how perfect they looked. Monroe, when she knew her lines, is quirky and delightful as Sugar. Wilder and Diamond present the first of two consecutive great works on their hands here. This classic was followed by 'The Apartment,' which also starred Lemmon. This film was made into a musical in the 1970's with Tony Roberts and Robert Morse. The musical was titled 'Sugar.'",10,4,6,23 March 1999

It's a Wonderful Life," A Great Influence...
","No movie ever made has influenced me more than this classic. I had the honor of doing a play version of it about 5 years ago. I had seen the film thousands of times, had loved it, but I never really knew what it meant. During the course of the production, I suddenly felt alive. I felt that I wasn't having enough fun. I felt that I wasn't doing enough in my life. Crazy things, like kissing my mother or my father. I hadn't really hugged one of them in a while. It makes you think. It's more of a thinking person's film than a mere Christmas film. If you think it's just a Christmas film, I insist you watch it again and again, until you get the message.Stewart gives the finest performance of his career, in one of the most difficult characters ever portrayed. A character all of us are familiar with...a person looking to find himself/herself. It's the great struggle for finding what it is in life you really want to do. George Bailey teaches us so lessons throughout the film and in the end he teaches us the most important lesson of all, that life, although a long and winding road, truly is (for lack of a better word) wonderful...",10,345,388,4 March 1999

Nicholson's brilliant. Said before. Louise Fletcher gives the finest performance in her long career. Been said thousands of times.

","One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people 'will' be talking about in 50 or 100 years.",10,806,979,25 March 1999

Say what you may about it, it works! It's a heck of a lot of fun and the cast is enjoying themselves through the entire film. The outakes are quite amusing as in DeLuise's campy role as 'Captain Chaos.' It's an entertaining film for anyone that enjoys fast cars, quick laughs and some pretty ladies.

","I really like Michael Mann's 'return' to his Miami Vice roots with this entertaining police-drama. While many dismiss it because of its length, I contest that it moves quicker than any three hour plus film I've seen in recent years. Pacino plays the hot shot 'Sonny Crocket-like' cop on the hunt of a master thief and criminal, played by Robert DeNiro in a great plum of a role. Mann's film is interesting because like the classic 1980's drama, it shows both sides of the story. The cops and the robbers. It shows that outside of their work, there is more to life than busting people or killing people or money. DeNiro's Neil has nothing because he's never known anything but treachery and fear. Pacino's Vincent is the same thing. Failed marriages. Failed opportunities. All that both of these men have is their work and they're damn good at it.The film moves at a super pace. Every cast member has their moments to shine and there's plenty of guest stars to this drama: It's nice to see Jon Voight again. Ashley Judd and Val Kilmer are both fine. Michael Madsen is menacing as a member of Neil's gang. This film has all the elements of good drama, tough action and edge of your seat suspense, with a pleasing conclusion. It's also nice to see two giants like Pacino and DeNiro go head to head with one another. Their coffeeshop scene is perfect. Wes Studi, Mykelti Williamson and Tone Loc co-star.",7,0,1,24 March 1999
