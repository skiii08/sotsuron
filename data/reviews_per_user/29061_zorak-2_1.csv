Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lucas still has a few more things to learn about writing.
","This movie was great.  The fight scenes were amazing, along with the special effects, but there was plenty of stuff the movie could have done without. First, the annoying Jar Jar character, and his whole race.  All they are is the digital, modern day equivalent of the Ewoks.  For a Star Wars movie, there was too much (attempted)slap stick humor, and it sort of ruined the tone of the movie.  Well, somebody has to say something bad about this movie.",5,0,1,30 May 1999
