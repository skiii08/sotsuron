The Blair Witch Project," A Treat for Film Students
","There is nothing worse than watching a movie with film students. They not only complain about technical aspects, but they usually think of the way they would have shot the same script. For four years working at the Havana Film and Television School, I went through this, and I suppose I caught some of their 'disease.' The consequences of this 'film alphabetization' came to the forum while watching 'The Blair Witch Project.' I remembered the students' approval of something good, as well as their loud reactions, their laughter and booing. At the same time I was questioning the film during the whole projection. This does not mean I did not find it an interesting film experience (I saw it in a theater, and I was the only customer). Quite the contrary: it is an original cinematic concept, an intelligent reflection on fear, and a good definition of horror as nothing but a state of mind, related to ignorance and darkness. However in too many occasions more than I can remember right now-- the situations were barely credible on technical and dramatic grounds: for example, would you believe someone lost in the woods (Heather) would keep on taping images while discovering that another person (Mike) has thrown their only connection to civilization --a map-- to the river? Well, Heather shouts at Mike like hell but she never stops gazing through the visor of her video camera! She is one of the most obnoxious characters ever to appear on a film (see during the first part, how she does not let her interviewees finish their sentences), not only for her bully ways but also for her obsessive recording of a 'documentary.' She is not a filmmaker; she is just a student working on a project, because of which her life is in danger. Before the resolution, there is a brief moment when Heather and Mike are alone in the darkness, inside the tent, when it seems improbable that the recorder would be registering sounds. And on top of that, we are not told that this is the edited and Dolby version of the found footage, a fact that predisposes the 'film alphabetized' viewer to distance himself/herself from the film, and smile at the naïve opening title. But it is a remarkable film nonetheless, although the overrating affects the objective appreciation of the filmmakers' good work.",6,1,2,25 November 1999
Blade Runner 2049," Gone with the Sheep
","You can add all the tags you want (Tech-Noir, Cyberpunk, Dystopian, Mystery, Thriller, Romance, Psychological Drama, etcetera, etcetera) but beneath all the visual adornments, this is predominantly a prolonged melodrama. At 156 minutes, the Rutger Hauer/Daryl Hannah type of replicant is sorely missed, and it does not have the poetry, novelty or force of its predecessor. You have instead a couple of gratuitous scenes pretending to be funny (as the one featuring 'Elvis Presley'), a mini-battle 'a la Star Wars', and what is worse... almost all the plot is too predictable. Thirty years later androids no longer dream of electric sheep but visual effect galore and prepare for revolution (lol), to illustrate the weeping tale of a man searching for momma. Or so he thinks. Ryan Gosling (as in many films) is beaten to death, but he just goes on as impassible as replicants should be. Watch it.",5,4,6,9 April 2018
First Man," Is This Cinema?
","Poor Ryan ... I admit that the first time I saw him, he passed me by unnoticed, although not the movie. I have always remembered Craig Gillespie's «Lars and the Real Girl», but now I realized that the man acted so well, that he is diluted in the story, as an integral part of the story of the country boy who falls in love with a doll. It was Nicolas Winding Refn who pointed me to Gosling as if saying, 'Look at this Canadian, he's a very good actor.' Then we had to put up with his dancing, singing, whining, whistling, directing movies (the most notable 'Lost River', if you did not see it, you blinked) and committing sacrilege with «Blade Runner»... That is fame. Ryan Gosling is a face and body for mega-products, as good as Colin Farrell or Tom Hardy. However, did Little Ryan make his homework and read «First Man» script well? It seems he did not, but well... he wanted to be king, he has to throw kisses! You'd better be more cautious than he was, and look the other way. «First Man» is a bad, dull, overlong and propaganda illustration of NASA official reports, that were adorned (with no good results) with technical data, a big dose of Biopic 101, a bit of fairy tale and too much domestic/jingoist melodrama. So the 'first moon landing' or whatever that was, ceases to be a polemical issue and becomes a compilation of close-ups of shoes, sand and stairs against dark landscapes: of course, this meant that the filmmakers could not even think of using the controversial film that some people say Stanley Kubrick did. Look, I am going to give you a little advice: better watch Georges Mélies' «Le voyage dans la Lune». It is shorter and more fun. But, of course, Ryan's fans are fools, so we go to see him and we find this mammoth of shuddering metal, stunned sounds, allusions to the Cold War and a 141-minute lament for a lovely child that died in the first 10 minutes. We deserve it for being fools.",3,0,2,30 November 2018
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Almost a remake of 'Star Wars' (1977)
","Twenty-two years after `Star Wars', George Lucas almost remade it with `The Phantom Menace': an invasion, a royal female in distress, two rescuing heroes, training of a young recruit, funny puppets, war scenes and a final prize-winning ceremony, with the added attraction of a sequence where Lucas' fascination with car races is evident. A too schematic and fragmented belligerent fable, a science-fiction tale with its feet sunk in the prosaic troubles of post-capitalism, this pre-sequel of the saga had the advantage of counting with two generations of fanatics, with trade-mark atmosphere, situations and characters, with a consolidated popular tradition, and the always efficient special effects machinery. Nevertheless, under the light of the school created by the 1977 film, this fourth part had all the look of one more from the bunch it originated.",1,3,7,10 September 1999
The Sound of Music," The Sound of Music
","There was a time when saying you had enjoyed 'The Sound of Music' was considered un-hip. It is still considered corny by many, but at least, compared to the stage version, it is a masterpiece. I finally saw a theater production, and could not believe how poor the text by Russel Crouse and Howard Lindsay is. Ernest Lehman really did a genial screen adaptation, eliminating songs (can you imagine Baroness Elsa singing about a marriage proposal?), relocating 'My Favorite Things' to the storm scene, turning 'The Lonely Goatherd' into a puppet show, or taking 'Do Re Mi' out to the Alps and the streets of Salzburg. Not much was added concerning the social and political aspects of Austria during the years of the Nazi regime (which probably would have given a greater resonance to this tale of personal struggle against totalitarianism), and very little was taken from the real Georg von Trapp, a ruined aristocrat, or Maria, who was the real stern, rigid parent that turned the family into a musical act for survival. Nevertheless, other aspects of the production augmented its entertainment value. After making the horror classic 'The Haunting', director Robert Wise surpassed his talent for transferring musicals to film, making the Rodgers & Hammerstein play less stage-bound than his work on 'West Side Story'. Both are industrial films, done under Hollywood's zero-degree style of film-making, but Wise did give a fresh visual treatment to the musical, airing an old property, and guiding Julie Andrews to give the best performance of her career. Finally, what I find more interesting about 'The Sound of Music' is its sociological value. When it was released, it had a sedative effect on the hearts and minds of almost the entire world population, who was witnessing new cracks in the U.S. empire: the questionable presence of American troops in Vietnam with a generation of young Americans killed for expansionism and not democracy, the violent deaths of major figures of its political and cultural scenes, the racial struggles, the emergence of the 1960s counter-culture, the raise of violence and death on the streets... Solidarity, love, basic family values, and especially music, were sort of rediscovered in 'The Sound of Music', turning it into a mega hit, and its soundtrack into a best seller.",10,1,7,18 June 2006
The English Patient," Endless Map of the Human Heart
","If you are not into necrophilia that strange erotic passion for corpses, that has inspired better films, such as 'Psycho'- you may need the patience of a phlegmatic Englishman to enjoy 'The English Patient', the never-ending motion picture by Anthony Minghella, writer-director who made an excellent debut with the wonderful and supernatural romantic comedy 'Truly Madly Deeply', which not too many people saw, because somebody had the not so bright idea of calling it 'the intelligent version of 'Ghost'.' According to Aristotle's definition of drama, drama is action, and action is change: if someone changes in this movie, it is the jinxed Canadian nurse Hana (French actress Juliette Binoche), and this is the story of her exorcism. If this coming and going from scenes in the present to the recent past, has any sense between scenes taking place during the last days of Second World War, when Hana takes care of a burnt count (British actor Ralph Fiennes), and scenes of his past, in which we learn that he is a Hungarian archaeologist who discovered a cave with little drawings, that he wrote a book without adjectives, that he collaborated with Rommel and that he had an affair with a married English woman--, if this jumble has an end, it is to free Hana from her evil spell, haunted by death and bad luck. Hana's lover dies in the first reel, and her best friend, another nurse, is disposed of after a few minutes of projection, when she dies on a mined road in Italy. Hana decides to stay in an abandoned church with the count and a good amount of morphine, to wait until the count dies. In the meantime, he remembers, remembers, remembers and remembers, in one of the most repetitive and boring scheme of cinematic flashbacks in recent years, in a story overloaded with subplots, maps, recognition flights, spying, colonialism, drug addiction, panoramic views of Africa, and clothes, cars and planes from the 1940's, probably placed there for us to say 'Wow, great production design!' or 'Great production values!' This paraphernalia makes little else but divert the attention from Hana, the only character who goes through a true process of change. But the development is diffuse and distributed among too many flashbacks, and the film loses cohesion and focus. If the flashbacks are highlighted by the presence of British actress Kristin Scott Thomas as the attractive and interesting Katherine, the count's lover, unfortunately she dies too soon, when she spends too many days in the desert, in the cave with little drawings that her lover found. When the count finds her body, he lays by its side, cries and then, taking it in his arms, goes to the exterior and makes such a strange face, that one does not know if it should be taken as a great romantic scene, if it is because of the sun on his eyes or due to the decaying body's odor. All of this is supposed to be based on true facts, according to Sri Lanka writer Michael Ondaatje. I tell you, you really need English patience! While Hana, faithful to her death passion, falls in love with Kip (Anglo-Indian actor Naveen Andrews), a sikh expert in detecting mines, risking his life from day to day, all kinds of characters appear and disappear from the frame, as the ones played by American Willem Dafoe, German Jürgen Prochnow and Italian Nino Castelnuovo, in case you did not know this is an international super-production (that was advertised with an 'independent' tag Independent from what?) Poor Ralph Fiennes, as the toasted count, spends much of his screen time under a latex mask, with convenient white veins that shine in night scenes. Although the movie has good intentions and fine scenes especially those related to the romance of the count and Katherine-, and in spite of the many Oscars it won (it was not a very good year in Hollywood), for your own good, you better make a trip to the nearest cemetery.",2,5,11,22 October 2000
The Babadook," The Babadook's at Home
","'The Babadook' grows on you. I saw it one night, and thought it was just OK. But next morning, reconsidering the tedium I experienced in a few spots which I thought were mere horror film clichés, I realized they really were psycho-plot points, and my appreciation for the movie changed considerably. When we remember those moments as well as a couple of scenes that seem incongruous or unresolved (as when the mother finds a photograph in which the face of her husband has been scratched and, after facing and shouting to her little son, their relation goes from tender to wild and back) , you know that the movie is not only telling you a horror tale (because the Babadook is certainly an entity freely moving in the shadows of the house where the protagonists live, and in their neighbor's home) but also paints a frenetic psychotic portrait, since the beginning when the little boy warns his mother of the intentions of the evil presence. Produced in Australia and directed by Jennifer Kent, many persons find a connection between the movie and Polanski, Tarkovsky and even 'Home Alone, but as other reviewers elsewhere do, Andrzej Zulawski's 'Possession' and Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining' were the two movies I thought of. In both films and 'The Babadook' there is a strong connection between horror and the psychological disintegration of the leading characters, which in the end denies all Aristotelian progression and undermine whatever happy ending you may imagine. Essie Davis as the mother and Noah Wiseman as the son (I hope he does not turn into another case of child actor going bananas) are very good, and illustrator Alex Juhasz' concepts of the Babadook and its book are really outstanding. A fine cinematic experience.",9,3,5,24 June 2016
Brokeback Mountain," Cowboys Also Cry
","'Brokeback Mountain' was released six years ago, and although I found it a deceitful concoction when I first saw it, I had never wrote anything about it until today. I doubted my first impression, because of the many prizes the film had won and the possible validity of the argument that 'so many people cannot be wrong'. But yes, many people may be simultaneously wrong, if one just thinks of all those who thought that our planet was flat. The film is not without values, mainly for responding to the need of visibility of the homosexual population: although it is not a self-representational product, it is a valid effort to make a vehicle that is neither a comedy of mistaken personalities nor proselytizing pornography. The film also celebrates physical love in open spaces, intimacy in communion with nature, something that has been mostly enjoyed by heterosexual couples stranded in paradise islands 'a la Blue Lagoon'. The problem with 'Brokeback Mountain' starts with the artistic resources used to validate the sick behavior of a man, and have the approval of the audience, so everybody would enjoy a nice, long cry for the last 30 minutes. If it is only for the good use of very manipulative melodramatic effects, the script deserves all the prizes it won. In my case, I cannot help wondering if it is ethical asking of us, out of compassion (more akin to sentimentality than true pity), to side with Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger, in a great performance), a monster who, by the end of the film, has left behind a long chain of broken hearts, including a dead man: Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal), supposedly 'his true love'. For almost 90 minutes, 'Brokeback Mountain' elaborates a character's biography to justify the reactions and answers of this being with such a peculiar name as Ennis Del Mar (maybe that's where it all started). An orphan raised by his brothers, taken out of school and a virgin, he has his first sexual experience with young cowboy Jack, without ever forgetting a childhood incident, when his father took him to see the dead body of a homosexual cowboy that was murdered by emasculation. Ennis hardly moves his lips when he talks, he is in constant denial, he is violent, paranoiac, possessive, jealous, he does not know how to dance (I remember in my old Psychology text books, that in the old days dancing was a requisite to reach maturity!), he does not travel, he is reduced to his little world, is afraid to face his own life and destiny ('Leave Texas', advises Jack to deaf ears), he imposes his rules in their relationship, and ends alone and a fetishist. On his part, Jack, a promiscuous alcoholic, is murdered, surely by any of those men he would pick up in the streets to satisfy his unsatisfied sexuality. The succession of traumatic events obviously turns Ennis into a suitable case for psychological treatment, and to take it out on him would be as vile as his own acts. However this is fiction unceasingly asking that we spectators opt for false compassion, as a result of manipulating elements to make him seem only a victim. With the possible exception of his daughter, all the women in this film are either passive, gooey, negative, or weak. Ennis treats them all badly, without even having to touch them. His wife has the good sense of asking for a divorce, but she lives in resentment for all the abuse she was subjected to. Outside his hometown, Jack's mother has her own husband to treat her bad, and Jack's wife is a cold, calculating woman. Ennis' marriage life is hell when compared to his lyrical escapades with Jack to Brokeback mountain: the babies constantly cry, a night of fireworks with the family ends in violence, the presence of his daughters create a little chaos in a supermarket; while in Jack's place, the relationship with his father-in-law explodes. In two or three occasions when Ennis' sickness is evident, the script 'cures' him, as in the climatic scene when Jack, a few months before his death, rebels against the life of sex three times a year. Ennis threatens him, they embrace and then cry, with their knees on the dust. Suddenly and with no cinematic differentiation, a flashback shows them tenderly in love, sweetening the violent and dramatic moment that has just taken place in the present. It is necessary to stress that Jack is as sick as Ennis, but his drama is secondary, a mere cue in Ennis' psychological map. In short, this story of a peasant whose stubbornness and neurosis turn everybody's life into a mess, seems to be the closest to what the Hollywood industry would give us homosexuals on our own sexual orientation, and to what any audience would endure as 'serious drama' on the relationship between two men: an aseptic film about sex (more than love), with little eroticism, where the only nude scene is by a woman. As Robert Altman used to say, the best part of a story begins when the motion picture is over. So quite probably in imaginary sequels, Ennis' daughters, as products of such a dysfunctional family, would become a transsexual and a vengeful prostitute, while Jack's son, with a similar background, would become the town sissy or the new diabolic politician of the state. There were other American films in 2005, more attractive than this one, and more deserving of our free time, as 'Sideways', 'Broken Flowers', 'Syriana', 'The Squid and the Whale', 'The New World', 'Sin City'... On the homosexual subject there have been productions from all corners of the world, including 'Plan B' from Latin America, 'Happy Together' from Hong Kong, and so on. All of them are far more interesting than 'Brokeback Mountain'. A lot more.",3,0,8,9 June 2012
Match Point," Allen in 2005
","There was a time when Woody Allen could get away with anything he did, no matter how failed it was. Audiences as well as critics adored him and his cinema, for undeniable masterpieces as 'Manhattan', 'Annie Hall', and 'Crimes and Misdemeanors', and favorites as 'Sleeper', 'Broadway Danny Rose',' Radio Days', 'Hannah and Her Sisters' or 'The Purple Rose of Cairo'. But things have changed, and even if repeating himself is a sign of authorship, it seems he has few new things to say. This is a reflection on luck, but the complications of the plot are resolved with resources from 'Crimes...' that worked very well in 1989, but this time they seem preposterous, while the Bergmanesque ghosts are an easy way out to the complications he concocted. As Scorsese, he is a good director, and both craft fine products. But quite often today they seem pointless.",6,1,2,8 July 2011
Cloverfield," Very good
","A slight problem with films like 'The Blair Witch Project' and 'Cloverfield', whose stories we see through the eyes of someone behind a camera, is that it is improbable that in situations of such a stressful nature anyone would keep on registering the events, even in fantasies like this one, which are ruled by parameters far from the realistic. And, as in 'Titanic', most of the events would probably happen in darkness... It is obvious that nobody would like to watch a dark screen while people shout, but just imagine the real events of the Titanic tragedy, deep in the dark, and in a chilling ocean... This is hard to convey cinematically. This said, 'Cloverfield' is one very good motion picture, dark, pessimistic, terrifying. You may think I am pushing things too far, but for me this is a most telling metaphor of American people's fears, (the more so with the action taking place in New York), just as the Godzillas, Mothras and Rodans were projections of the Japanese panic after the atomic bomb experience. The film has a by-the-book script with plot points where film industry lawyers unwittingly want them to be, a love story that (not surprisingly) is the raison d'etre of the whole enterprise, adequate rhythm, little music, and it is short as it has to be, before a know-it-all starts making 'Cartesian' demands.",9,0,1,7 July 2011
Lost in Translation," Sofia's Laughter
","I still believe that Sofia Coppola did an effective acting job in 'The Godfather  Part 3'. Not that I am crazy about her acting abilities, but although she was resourceful, Sofia was treated so viciously by viewers and by most mainstream critics, that she must be laughing out loud now that she knows better, especially with the reactions to her second movie. People have loved this film, but in my case I think it's a fine movie that's overrated. Sometimes it's just plain blank, with a couple of sequences and many single shots that could have been left out of the final cut. It is a joy to watch Bill Murray in an excellent performance, and seeing Scarlett Johansson grow from the days of 'Eight Legged Freaks', but after a while the Japanese jokes become tired and the emotions between their characters become redundant. It may be new to those who have never even considered the possibility of establishing a relationship like the one described here, of friendship between a man and a woman and an older man and a young woman-, but not to those who have always respected the opposite sex on the same level and as their complement. It could have been a better film with 20 minutes less.",7,0,0,23 February 2004
Apocalypse Now," Coppola's Masterpiece
","Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece was a great ending for a golden decade of American cinema. In the 1970s there was an atmosphere of tolerance, open-mindness, and progressiveness among the studios that allowed the making of major films by a few of the best directors that the United States has ever had. I am not a historian, but all the events that preceded the decade (a few being the violent deaths of major figures of the American political and cultural scenes, the racial struggles, the emergence of the 1960s counter-culture, the increase of violence and death in the streets...) seemed to influence the vision of filmmakers who were willing to dare, be different, and create entertaining and intelligent motion pictures. Coppola's film is a strange blend of humanistic thinking and skillful film-making, following the parameters of war and adventure films, and at the same time subverting them with its flowing reflections on the value of life, the reason of death, or the ethics of war. It is also a passionate work, made against all odds, chronicled in the 1991 documentary 'Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse'; a motion picture that went beyond any previous reflection on the Vietnam war ever to reach the screen. This may not be the definite Vietnam motion picture, but dealing with it Coppola defied the formula of classic melodrama found in two Vietnam movies made simultaneously, 'The Deer Hunter' and 'Coming Home', or in latter ones as 'Platoon' and 'Casualties of War', before Vietnam became the starting point to make products of any genre, as horror in 'Jacob's Ladder', or comedies as 'Good Morning, Vietnam', among the more respectable. Coppola had the courage to take that economic and political conflict as the background of a search for answers to questions faced by any man every day of his life, without betraying the dramatic consequences of that war.",10,3,3,2 July 2006
District 9," Mellow Yellow
","In 'Esthetic and Ethics', a very interesting section of French script doctor Miguel Machalski's book, 'The Screenplay', the author reminds us —one more time, because it is often forgotten— that every product of cultural consumption contains ideology. In 'District 9', director and scriptwriter Neill Blomkamp tries to cover all bases: what a better center of contradiction, abuse and progress than South Africa, to place a suspended spacecraft above Johannesburg, where whites, blacks and aliens are all victims of the big businessmen of the planet, rulers of the World Organization of Nations (or something like that, a construct that is behind the omnipresent weapon factory MNU), and, after a discouraging ending, Blomkamp adds an even more pessimistic post scriptum, about the growing number of marginalized aliens on Earth, and the trial of the protagonist's assistant, for revealing secret MNU information. But as Machalski adds, 'Silence speaks volumes', and besides the denunciation of world powers, organizations of united nations, and weapon manufacturers (generally, lumped together), there is no mention of the worldwide audiovisual industry, the biggest power on planet Earth, capable of the unspeakable —for being impossible to measure. Beyond this, the film is attractive during the first hour, with a style that mixes techniques of musical videos, TV reports and documentaries, and benefited with a cast of practically unknown faces that do not distract from the story. But around minute 64, the memory of 'Enemy Mine' surges, and we go back, once again, to the 19th century melodrama, secure, comforting, conformist and reinforcing the status quo.",6,1,5,7 July 2011
Batman Begins," Batman Bond
","In future releases, we may finally know why Daffy Duck is mean, learn of the dysfunctional family of Charlie Brown or discover the psychological traumas suffered by Olive Oyl during her youth, thanks to some filmmakers' urge to turn icons of popular culture (as comic book heroes/heroines) into cinematic 'human beings' (resembling old movies more than real life), and eventually into myths of an apocryphal North American saga. Many Batman's fans were pleased with this incursion into the rules of the 19th century novel, declared it a masterpiece and the final word on the darker aspects of Bob Kane's creation. To me what Christopher Nolan, David S. Goyer and Christian Bale successfully achieved is taking Kane's universe out of the world of dreams and turning it into a melodramatic and fascist action movie of the latter days of American imperialism, without the previous films' campiness, high aesthetics or humour. Now we have a masochist psycho as the winged hero, a Batmobile of the globalization era, a gun supplier a la James Bond's 'Q', and a sect of terrorists who babble Buddhist ideas but reject compassion. Although the terrorists want to destroy New York (here called Gotham City...) because they have made corrupt empires fall since the good old days of Constantinople, they look like today's Masons deciding the future of the world's economy in a secret room of their loggia. All this flirting with today's world affairs, more than pleased audiences, moreover because as an action movie it's above the standard. As a Batman product, though, in my case I prefer Tim Burton's superior diptych.",4,4,10,20 January 2007
The Favourite," Yorgos, please come home!
","I have witnessed how the careers of non-American filmmakers who were once nonconformist, critical and rebellious, changed when they received awards from Los Angeles, New York and, to a lesser extent, European film festivals. I am not questioning the awards, for I believe that when someone deserves a prize, it is fair to grant it. The unfortunate thing is that, to guarantee a position in the factory of mainstream cinema, some filmmakers who previously questioned the bad side of 'what is established', become submissive and conformist when they receive Oscars, Globes and other awards; others lose the strength of their radical positions, while a few renounce the cultural force that their first films had, which were made in their homelands.Two illustrative cases are those of Spaniard Pedro Almodóvar and Mexican Alfonso Cuarón. In the first case, although the man from La Mancha preserves the 'Spanish cultural brand' that has made his cinema always attractive, his recent films conform to a catalog of common places in melodrama, applauded by a group of moviegoers who never saw his imperfect and corrosive, passionate and exemplary cinema that he made in the 1980s. Then there is Cuarón, the traveler who, from his applauded debut in Mexico jumped to Hollywood, to little princesses, Harry Potter and Dickens, recovering his original cultural stamp each time he returns to Mexico, although «Roma», his 2018 movie, shows him as an orchestrator of an excessively elaborate exercise for the Netflix era. Both men are talented and know their trade, there is no doubt about it, but from «Matador« to «Hable con ella» there is an abyss, similar to that between «Sólo con tu pareja» and «Gravity».Now the 'evil eye' has touched Greek Yorgos Lanthimos. Here the transformation breaks one's heart. He even poses differently for the photos now: from those, in which the daring novice appeared in the projections of «Dogtooth», to those of Yorgos 2019, it has rained a lot. He already directed Kidman, Farrell, Weisz, because he also has talent and know his trade, of course... If in the next installment of the Oscars to 2018 films, I had to choose between Cuarón and Lanthimos for the Best Direction award, I would give the prize to the Athenian.It is true that «The Favourite» is the kind of costume piece that the British have been making for centuries with their eyes closed. They are perfectly assembled, resplendent and cold, whoever makes them, including Taiwanese Ang Lee. This version, however, is more passionate, Mediterranean and some features of the Lanthimos of «Dogtooth» and «Alps» persist, as postmodern licenses in language, in a few scenes such as dance, and in the use of music. It also has three performers at the peak of the acting profession (Emma Stone, Rachel Weisz and Olivia Colman) to illustrate this historic portrait of the struggle for power, tinged with eroticism and opportunism. The stories of women in love have always sold a lot. Both men and women lose their composure with an erotic triangle of women, especially when one is Queen Anne of England with her sufferings of gout.And, yes, concessions to fashion are welcome to develop a career in the West and guarantee a job. But the court intrigues extended for two long hours... and I, at least, could not help thinking 'Pity of Yorgos ...!' A fact, in my opinion, very important to take into account: unlike his four previous features ('The Lobster' and 'The Killing of a Sacred Deer', in addition to the two already mentioned), this was not written by Lanthimos and his co-writer Efthymis Filippou. It is a pity.",7,2,6,9 February 2019
Seabiscuit," Seabiscuit
","A fine combination of personal stories, American folklore and old nationalistic fervor, that updates the strategy of a Frank Capra propagandistic melodrama of the 1940s with a stronger sense of realism, provided by the historical facts read by narrator David McCullough. In many instances, Randy Newman's score overdoes the sentimentality, but the strong characters of the three men –Seabiscuit's owner, trainer and jockey, respectively played (very well) by Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper and Tobey Maguire, sometimes even jeopardizing their rapport with us, the audience– resist trivialization. Fine support by players Gary Stevens, Michael Angarano, and Eddie Jones, but Elizabeth Banks does almost nothing in an underdeveloped role, and William H. Macy is just comic relief. Also good work by cinematographer John Schwartzman, and the art direction department.",8,1,3,7 July 2011
City of God," City of God
","Some people have complained of the 'Hollywood treatment' this story (inspired by real events) received, and it can't be denied that most of its stylistic flourishes resembles senseless action films. Somehow, though, the violence depicted in the movie has no ultimate sense, no other purpose than to follow the flow of daily life in the slums of Brazil, even more when it has been decided to disconnect the events from the social and economic structures of the Brazilian society. (Compare this movie with Héctor Babenco's 'Pixote', and you'll see the difference.) It is obvious that some persons who are not aware of those conditions may find the images too raw or blame them on the characters' psychopath behavior. But then (I hope) neither we find reasons for the behavior of Quentin Tarantino's or John Woo's characters only on individual psychological terms. In the end, it's such a harsh reality that the cynicism of the filmmakers and all their flashy and effectist resources (like the change of music and the introduction of a strobe light in a party, just before one of the less repulsive young criminals is killed) end buried below the piles of dead bodies of Brazilian children and adolescents.",6,3,6,22 December 2003

Get Out," Deja-vu Science-Fiction Tale
","Since the independent filmmakers of the United States presented in 1986, for the first time, their award called Independent Spirit (or, in its short version, Spirit), when Martin Scorsese was honored for «After Hours», the Spirit became the maximum reward of the 'other cinema', of the cinema away from the mega-industry of Los Angeles, in a kind of Oscar of the 'liberated' of the Hollywood dictatorship. From that date, the award distinguished good filmmakers ignored by the 'Academy', such as Robert Altman, John Sayles and Todd Haynes, and many others who later became 'officialized', such as Tarantino, Nolan and Aronofsky.To be honest, today in 2018, there seems to be not much difference between one cinema and the other: the film that won the Spirit for Best Film of the Year is not far from the gore aesthetic present in the Oscar-winning film as the best . While «Get Out» is not as whiny as «The Shape of Water», but a more forceful and 'virile' drama with some denunciation, both films are science fiction products that take the path of extreme and bloody violence to lead us to the conclusion. Both films also have in common an Afro-descendant, obese and comical character that plays a decisive role in the plot: in the amphibious fable it was Zelda as played by Octavia Spencer, and here, LilRed Howery as Rod, an airport investigator.In the film, a white girl invites her black boyfriend to spend a weekend at her parents' house, and the poor young man falls into a terrifying intrigue, surrounded by sinister Caucasian beings and three African-Americans who look like zombies, though as charming as the 'Stepford wives'. Little by little the intrigue is revealed, although one suspects from the beginning who the villains are - in part, due to the stereotyped performances of some interpreters in key parts of the story.They say that the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay usually indicates what was the true best movie of the year, according to the 'Academy.' This year this indirect recognition was given to the director and scriptwriter of 'Get Out,' Jordan Peele. The film does entertain and is effective (thanks also to a careful soundtrack and very good music by Michael Abels), but if you expect a lot from it, you may be disappointed.-------------------------------------
P.S. The garden party reminded me of a similar scene in 'The Stepford Wives'. Just as Katharine Ross and friend Paula Prentiss are observing the guests, so does Daniel Kaluuya. As a matter of fact, both Ross and Kaluuya play photographers. And when the Nanette Newman robot malfunctions because it drank too much wine, that is similar to Lakeith Stanfield's 'epilepsy' crisis.",6,1,1,14 March 2018
The Piano," Erotism and Culture
","The first known woman director in film history, Mme. Alice Guy, died claiming she was also the first person to ever shot a fiction film, a credit usually given to Georges Méliès. Since Guy's first movie, 'La fée aux choux', in 1896, to Jane Campion's 'The Piano', a complex story of women in films is still in progress, from Guy's pioneer efforts to today's on-going fight against sexist role assignment to female workers in film industries, a fight against stereotyped participation as script girls, costume designers, or make-up artists. Many may become accomplished writers, editors, producers or directors, but many others can remain in the dark, even after obtaining a degree of success, as Dorothy Arzner in the 1930s. With her 1993 masterpiece, a century after the invention of several devices to register moving images, New Zealander Jane Campion made a full circle of cinematic melodrama, bringing us back to its origin, heavily influenced by the 19th century novel, with a twist: Campion took the classic model of representation, and used its best resources to tell a story from the Romantic era, enhanced by a contemporary point of view. Two currents meet in this beautiful motion picture: first is eroticism, powerfully claiming for women's rights to decide about their bodies and sensual options; and second is culture and its decisive role in people's lives. Scottish Ada McGrath (a magnificent Holly Hunter, winner of multiple international awards for her first-rate performance) is a frail individual, surrounded by patriarchal violence and a wild environment, and although she struggles for her rights to the extreme, in the end she is seen --in the last, poetic submarine shot-- tied to her piano, suggesting our inner fixation to the cultures that mold us. 'The Piano' shows the potential of an old formula in the hands of a clever and sensitive filmmaker, transcending the limits of melodrama. It opts for simple entertainment, avoiding emotional traps, and it also pays tribute to primeval cultures, when one compares the rigid 'occidental' debarkation of Ada and her daughter Flora in New Zealand, to the beautiful Maori farewell ritual in the conclusion.",10,2,7,20 January 2007
Midsommar," The Bawling and the Insipid Stud
","«Midsommar» identifies with a widespread definition among Northern filmmakers that art, while larger and more spectacular, is better, as witnessed from Griffith to Linklater, through Gance, DeMille, Lean, Bondarchuk and even Coppola, along with all the rest. Immersed in music to provoke emotions that the images do not transmit by themselves, it is a film of excessive duration to tell an essentially simple story of fanaticism, cultural shock, materialism and primitivism in a hippie-like community in Sweden, with two pathetic leading characters who have traveled from United States to Scandinavia, and that, at least on my part, did not have my sympathy and did not allow me to connect: a woman who does not stop bawling, clinging to the memory of dead relatives, and a man who, in the end, is nothing more than an insipid stud. Along with the decent photograph of Pawel Pogorzelski, embarrassing and sometimes laughable incidents accumulate: the mating of the flabby stallion with the Swedish little virgin, the millennials' reactions to the sacrifices, the collective hysteria of the community in the Loudon nuns' style, the fake anthropological approach to the story, the bear costume... I don't know why I thought it was a very strange crossing of «Boyhood» with «The Blair Witch Project», «The Wicker Man», «Private Vices and Public Virtues' and «Triumph of the Will». Proceed at your own risk, considering the film has legions of fans, but if you ask me... how I regret having lost those three hours of my life!",2,7,12,6 December 2019
The Artist," Help yourself
","Last night I finally saw 'The Artist' and after the easy digestion of this lite soufflé, here is what I typed: the concession of the main award from the American film industry to a French motion picture as best production of 2011 should not be seen as a cordial action whereby a national film form (specifically, American cinema in general) recognizes the art and skill of a foreign film form, but rather as the assumption by certain sector of French filmmakers (among them M. Michel Hazanavicius, director and writer –surely not 'author', as Truffaut and Rohmer would claim– of 'The Artist') of the way Hollywood makes, feels and shoots films, even if Oliver Stone says (as he told me in an interview) that 'Hollywood' is only a construct. After heatedly arguing with the American negotiators to reach a version of the GATT acceptable to both Europeans and Americans (in which the memories of Beaumarchais, the French playwright, and British queen Anne were evoked, as Europeans defended their notion of copyright), it was agreed that film is something more than entertainment, so funds and incentives were guaranteed to continue the European production of motion pictures that express national cultures, and counteract the slow transformation of spectators into exclusive consumers of American products (thanks to monopoly), while their brains become smaller, very much in the way of the incredible shrinking man, with the small difference that as he got smaller his cosmic conscience grew. I think that the American negotiators accepted the deal because they knew that in the end many filmmakers from all over the world would end up making movies 'a la Hollywood', in accordance with the so-called zero degree style (also ambiguously termed 'classic representational model'), as evidenced by 'The Artist' and 'Buried' from Spain, 'Night Watch' from Russia, and 'Acquaria' from Brazil. Of course every viewer will experience something different when watching 'The Artist'. For me, Mr. Hazanavicius, a former publicist with no outstanding work in his previous filmography, made a tiresome and innocuous movie. Tiresome because its predictable and clichéd story has been told a dozen of times, and innocuous because it is lightweight, because it is not in anyone's way, it is just there, a pretty centerpiece. It is possible that he did not pretend to make a masterpiece. I do not know his intentions, but because the film has been exaggeratedly praised it becomes more obvious that nothing was done that had been not already tried, tested and found effective: above anything, to narrate in black and white with images and inter-titles, and to use musical paraphrases to supply depth (which, to be honest, this story does not need, for everything is intentionally superficial). It is truly a merit that Hazanavicius has seen so many Hollywood movies, because he knows which are the best resources to evoke a time and a way of making films, contrary to many new filmmakers who are satisfied with Disney, 'Star Wars', 'The Matrix', 'The Lord of the Rings', and films by some weird director recommended by one of their teachers (while they refuse to see Ford's 'Stagecoach') An rehash of 'A Star is Born', Hazanavicius' film mixes a bit from 'Swing Time' with many other film quotations that the Hollywood specialists will recognize, and a climax strangely edited to the cue that Bernard Herrmann wrote for 'Vertigo' (curiously titled in French by the composer, as 'Scène d'amour'). We will have to wait for Michel Hazanavicius' future films to see what is behind this lustrous façade, bathed with 107 awards! But who cares the world is crazy, full of nostalgia, covered with the gimmicks of the old Californian movies. If you take it like that, then you can enjoy 'The Artist', a little pill that is easily swallowed, without fatal consequences.",3,2,6,16 June 2012
La La Land," Romantic Sweet
","When I wanted to see «La La Land» in a movie theater, I found no company to go with and I let it pass. I asked my friends and they answered, 'It's pretty, but not like the musicals of the past.' Then it won 261 awards and 193 nominations according to IMDb.com and I stopped asking... I finally saw it two days ago and I understood them. Yes, by parts it's pretty, but the problem, in my opinion, is that it tries to be like old musicals and that format changed, evolved, because the world changed and the perception and appreciation of art advanced, and because shows became more eclectic and media stuff (as illustrated by that 2001 spawn called «Moulin Rouge!»). The naive (and perhaps a bit silly) world of «Top Hat», «Meet Me in St. Louis» and «Finian's Rainbow» no longer exists; and people care very little for products as «West Side Story» or «The Sound of Music» that solved their sociological, economic and ideological issues with someone singing «Somewhere» or «Climb Ev'ry Mountain».I felt it since the film began, when car drivers stuck in a traffic jam and under a hot sun, sing a little song that, in the harsh reality, would translate into insults, curses and maybe blows. However, I followed the game and began to like it, the more so when the plot antagonized two realities, two personalities with two very different goals. Ryan Gosling plays the pianist Sebastian, a musician who is trying to rescue forms of cultural expression from oblivion or extinction, anguished because jazz is dying and he does not have a space of his own to practice it and spread it. Emma Stone is Mia, a girl who is after that old aspiration of actors since the early 20th century, who lined up to enter the 'factory of dreams' (or nightmares, you name it) that is the cinema of Los Angeles - which is not the same as the cinema of New York or Texas.Immediately, my identification was with Sebastian, although as a theater person I understood Mia. However, it did not take too long before the character disappointed me: Mia has no assistance to stage her show and only gives one performance of her monologue because the opening night was not what she expected and returns home. I have seen openings with fewer people than those who went to see her. In addition, to make matters worse, in one of the most unlikely dramatic (and ridiculous) turns of the plot, some producers propose her to make a film about her ideas. Of course, this may happen, no one denies it, but director-screenwriter Damien Chazelle does not let us see what she did on stage, so we can say, 'Sure, such a good actress deserves that opportunity.' But no, we must imagine that the monologue was great, although, truthfully, at that point of the movie Mia has not shown any trait of genius.To be fair, Sebastian does not either, but his character has conviction, strength and determination, and he has his great 'commercial moment' before Mia's, when he plays with a standard band a bad song in front of an entranced crowd shouting and dancing to the tune. Luckily, the pianist reacts and says, 'No, this is not my thing'. Count the awards that Emma Stone won, and those Ryan Gosling got and you will know this world goes only wants «The Voice» and «American Idol»... All in all, I admit that Mia's option is valid, there are many people who want to be the art world and have families. To the effect, the presence of Tom Everett Scott, a nice actor who plays her husband, helps a lot, but Chazelle (and Stone and Gosling in their performances) insinuate sadness and regret for what could have been but was not, as each followed their dreams.In short, this central conflict between art and personal fulfillment is adorned with musical numbers tinged with romanticism that work very well (those that my friends call 'pretty') or are very cheesy (like the dance by the stars in the Observatory Griffith) and overloaded with special effects. I guess many miss the expertise of Gene Kelly, Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire when dancing, or the voices of Julie Andrews and Mary Martin. But the earth trembles and the hurricane is coming, so nobody has time for the la-la-la of this romantic comfit.",6,0,0,6 November 2017
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Pasolini and 'Salò'
","I saw 'Salò' for the first of more than 10 times in 1975, when I was 24 years old and lived in San Juan, Puerto Rico, one of the few places in the world where it was not banned upon its release. As I have often said, 'Salò' is the movie that changed my relation with films, when I became conscious of one of cinema's most important characteristics, called 'impression of reality', and learned how different film languages, with all their techniques, effects and punctuations, can manipulate people's emotions.I believe that since Pier Paolo Pasolini wrote 'Teorema' (the long poem), he was convinced that sex was the most effective weapon against bourgeoisie, as had been stated by people like Wilhelm Reich or indirectly by the Marquis de Sade, a bourgeois himself (please, correct me if I am wrong). 'Salò' seemed to be his definite demonstration of such assumption, although I wonder how would have been his next film, 'Porno-Teo-Kolossal', an erotic-theological super-spectacle he was preparing with playwright Eduardo de Filippo and actor Ninetto Davoli (notice a hint of the reverential in the frame's compositions of 'Salò', which resemble religious tableaux.)As a reaction to a consumerist society sunk in terrorism and political crisis as was Italy in the 1970s, Pasolini created this parable of power, using Brechtian techniques and taking full advantage of the depth of field, to shock audiences accostumed to as he said- 'cowboys and Indians and Sophia Loren' (who reportedly left the movie house in revulsion). It's not easy to grasp in a single viewing all the connotations of a film that was attacked by both right and left, a movie about ideological perversion, genocidal sadism, pandering masochism and the transformation of human bodies into objects, a motion picture that addresses the fascist we all have inside, and that - after so much pessimism - gives us an image of 'hope' (sort of) in the final scene in which a young guard teaches another one to dance!Impressed by a film that had an essential bibliography in its credits, I was in awe in 1975. In any case, I wrote a positive review in a Puerto Rican newspaper, and after a couple of months it resurfaced and had a second run in an art house. In 1977 I returned to Panamá, where I wrote film reviews in a local paper and where 'Salò' had not been yet released. In the summer of 1981 I led a group of Latin Americans in Paris to catch a show of 'Salò' at 9pm, after missing it twice due to our confusion with nights that seemed to be afternoons, so bright at 8pm. This time I was surprised to discover Pasolini's humor amidst the horror he described. Back in Panamá, the manager of United Artists brought a copy from Santo Domingo and asked me to help him to get an exhibition certificate for 'Salò', which he feared would also be banned in Panamá. With a couple of special screenings (I even had an argument with a priest who arrived late to a projection and stopped it to give a little speech against Pasolini, but who ended defending the filmmaker when the film was over!) and articles by other film critics, 'Salò' was finally released in Panamá. Unfortunately, it played in a cinema specialized in pornography. At that time, I was the program director of the University of Panamá cinema and I rescued the film, which was exhibited for a month in the campus.A couple of years ago I heard a wise final word about Pasolini's masterpiece, from a friend, filmmaker Orlando Senna. He said (more or less) that it would take a long time before 'Salò' were 'assimilated by the mainstream'. Maybe it will happen, as abstract expressionism was seized by the cultural elites and official ideologies, and devoid of its subversive charge. But judging from the reactions it still causes in 2003, that time still seems to be far away.",10,21,35,4 May 2003
The Shape of Water," Salty Water
","Let it be awarded all the prizes in the world that people want to give it, but by the moment the Amazonian entity is taken out of the Pentagon-financed experimental hall, 'The Shape of Water' loses much of its magic. It becomes an unnecessary brutal and violent actioner, with a touch of Hollywood silliness for good measure, as the singing-and-dancing parody of 'Cheek to Cheek' -which by the way seems a more appropriate fantasy for Giles than Elisa. Greeks were not fools when they established the rules of tragedy: they avoided the display of gruesome details on the stage, not for aesthetic reasons, but because tragedies were neither lessons on anatomy nor autopsy tutorials. Gore sells, but in my opinion, it belongs to other kind of movies, and seems out of place in a fantasy like 'The Shape of Water'. I am thirteen years older than Guillermo del Toro, so I immediately recognized many of his faces, from Elana Eden in «The Story of Ruth» to Carmen Miranda, to describe the world of Elisa Esposito (wonderful Sally Hawkins, who merits all awards bestowed upon her). His references are also familiar to me, especially «Creature from the Black Lagoon» and its sequel «Revenge of the Creature», which precedes all those movies in which US military men and women want to get hold of all the E.T.s, Starmen and whatever weird but wonderful cross their way. For me what really counts is the love story, spiced with Cold War antics and military bullying, but even the romance goes over the top (for examples, in the second love-making scene, or the 'Cheek to Cheek' parody) and it never recovers, since we all know the ending from the start, in the main title sequence. Production design is good, Alexander Desplat's music does not add anything to his prestige, and casting is adequate. Michael Shannon shines as usual. However Octavia Spencer, doing what is expected from her, has to deal with the stereotype of the fat and funny black woman that goes all the way back to the origins of the cinema of Los Angeles; and Richard Jenkins also plays the stereotype of the funny and old homosexual man. After watching it, I gave it four stars, then the day after it lost one... I do not think it will go any lower. It does not matter that a creature from sweet water, requires salt on its bathing tub. See it.",6,3,5,17 February 2018
Mystic River," Dave's Story
","Dave (Tim Robbins) is, for me, the real center of this movie. The film starts with the description of his traumatic childhood experience. It's Dave who represents the lost innocence of people who blind themselves in front of the fragmented state of their community, who cannot justify violence and death (for survival?) even if they hide behind patriotic icons. It's his calmness, his embracing of family values in the middle of chaos, that is so moving. I really had a hard time witnessing the incestuous affection Jimmy (Sean Penn) had for his daughter, following his 'investigation' and accepting his final 'mistake', while Dave had all my sympathy. Although it seems Eastwood was more interested in Jimmy's character, 'Mystic River' is a good movie with a first-rate performance by Robbins. Unnecessary music (by Eastwood) overemphasizes the drama, as if trying to turn it into a Greek tragedy.",8,0,0,22 December 2003
The Departed," Long ago and far away...
","It is sad that some filmmakers are forgotten in their prime when it comes the time to give out awards. If they are lucky as Robert Altman, they receive a lifetime achievement award, but it is embarrassing when they get one prize as a kind of consolation reward, after being ignored for their best works. This is the case with Martin Scorsese who finally won the Best Director Academy Award for this boring and sanitized re-telling of 'Infernal Affairs', a 2002 Chinese violence film. One person though is outstanding, and was ignored at prize time: Leonardo DiCaprio as the young man trapped inside the bad guys' playground. I give it five stars because Scorsese has not lost his know-how, but the great stories of yesteryear, the innovative techniques of the past are not here. This is unfortunately mainstream cinema by a once-unconventional director. Editor Thelma Schoonmaker tries hard, but even she cannot equal her work in 'Raging Bull.' What we have is a re-cycling of Scorsese's aptitudes, in function of a tiresome and mean story for the macho man who ask his macho woman for a beer while he watches a football game (or this movie.) I at least do not need this kind of stories today (unless they have a sense of humor, as the Chinese do, or the characters are treated as children, as in Hawks' 'Scarface'.) Do yourself a favor and plan a retrospective of Scorsese's best at home, renting 'Mean Streets', 'Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore', 'Taxi Driver', 'Raging Bull', 'After Hours', 'The King of Comedy', 'Goodfellas', 'The Age of Innocence' and 'Bringing Out the Dead.'",5,1,3,29 June 2007
The Witch," Bloody Recruit
","I am surprised to read that this has an 'awesome look', with details 'as exact as it was back then'. Being Robert Eggers an art director and costume designer, one of the things that struck me is that the wardrobe looked as if coming directly from a tailor shop or laundry (starch included), that it was not aged as much as needed, and that it looked too clean for working peasants (especially for the father who was the farmer). And to say that things looked 'exactly' as they did in the 17th century is a silly sacrilege, a most fitting word for the occasion, when one decides to write a few lines about a motion picture that narrates a folk tale dealing with religion, and loaded with terror elements. I think that if writer-director Eggers had circumscribed his screenplay to folklore with its natural horror edges (a bit in the line of the wonderful 2000 Czech film 'Kytice'), 'The VVitch' would have been a better movie. There is also a more realistic approach to the tale, within the frame of a psychological drama with supernatural elements (in the line of the fine 1961 production 'The Innocents'): superstition and religious belief erodes the basis of an English family that has migrated to North America, and the story slowly builds to tragedy. But Eggers fell into the traps of tired formulas of new American horror films, including omnipresent music, false build-ups of tension through music and sound (as if a tsunami were coming!) that lead to nothing for dramatic purposes, evil represented by a botox-ridden woman with low cleavage, a bit of pedophilia, and silly special effects –the ending is the best example, from the moment the main character takes her bloodstained dress off and sits at the family table, to the gratuitous final witch dance and ascent. In the end it seems a bloody, stupid way to recruit a new witch: was that entire massacre necessary to add a new girl to the coven? Let's hope that next time Robert Eggers decides to make things simpler, asks someone else to write the script, and a composer that knows when to stop, for Eggers shows a good hand for directing actors, and a good eye for composition and framing.",4,1,2,23 April 2016
Parasite," Family Affairs
","Winner of the Palme d'Or for Best Film in Cannes 2019, to say «Parasite» is to speak of five shining stars in the cinematic firmament. When you have to spill blood in a film, you have to dose it with genius, hit the target and know where and when to spill it with cunning and, above all, understand well why we spill it and get the viewer to understand that reason as well.Don't get me wrong «Parasites» is not a bloody drama, but a beautiful film that with humor and gravity touches the three classic themes of art: it is a tragicomedy about love, life and death, it is a film about the joy of living, about survival, about the family of the 21st century, but not like the concept of family defined and defended by many, that sick, stifled definition, confined to religious dogmas and eulogistic of expired and obsolete values. It is about real and living families of the planet in 2019, many dispossessed and a few privileged, in a game of services and currency exchanges, in the last days of capitalism with its agenda of violence, horror and death.Although director Bong Joon-ho has already made about ten feature films of various themes, I only know one of his films, the cult fable «The Guest», a horrific science fiction tale about the relationships within a poor and dysfunctional family of Seoul, that is put in check when a monster generated by the toxins thrown into the Han River by an American scientist, kidnaps a young member of that family nucleus. Again, in «Parasite», Bong addresses the family issue, opposing a poor family made up of the parents and two children, to a rich family with the same number of members. The moment they cross roads is the basis of the story. A third component, personified by a housekeeper, gives an unexpected twist to the story and leads to the violent climax, which is not the end of the fascinating story; at this point of the story, it still has another 15 minutes of history to tell, until the sad final close-up that ends this work.When I watch films like 'Parasites' my heart skips a beat, I wish that people would have access to a wide and cultured film offer, that we all could see works like this instead of consuming the despicable L.A. garbage that the cinemas offer, week after week, freezing the reasoning of people from the whole world; or having to wait for an exclusive film festival to project them fleetingly, and to be subject to serials of thrones and other lousy dishes. As soon as «Parasite» appears through any of the windows we have today to watch movies, don't miss it.",10,17,26,5 December 2019
The Dark Knight Rises," Another entry to my list of 'less useful reviews'
","This formulaic idiocy could have been directed by Leni Riefenstahl, but I do not believe that --in the end-- an intelligent filmmaker as Leni, as Fascist as she was, would have admitted the absurdity of this neo-Fascist script. Back in 2007, after I saw 'Batman Begins' (2005), I wrote that «In future releases, we may finally know why Daffy Duck is mean, learn of the dysfunctional family of Charlie Brown or discover the psychological traumas suffered by Olive Oyl during her youth, thanks to some filmmakers' urge to turn icons of popular culture (as comic book heroes/heroines) into cinematic 'human beings' resembling old movies more than real life), and eventually into myths( of an apocryphal North American saga.» After five years, nothing has changed. In their third bat-installment, the Nolan brothers still make a big effort to convince us of the credibility or the potentiality of a tale like this... But when somebody escapes from a prison of maximum security, it seems rather weird that the first thing he does is wearing a costume... A pity that 'comic book' characters have lost the 'comic' element and become so dull, sour and psychotic, in the futile intent of making them go through a formulaic 'character development' process, with epidermic psychology of tired melodramas of yesterday.",2,4,11,7 January 2013
Gladiator," White Elephant
","In the 1960s, Steve Reeves would have killed John Drew Barrymore after 80 minutes (the necessary time to tell such an inane story), and 'The End' ('Fine' is more appropriate) would have appeared on the screen, as Reeves kissed Mylène Demongeot, Chelo Alonso or Scilla Gabel in the hereafter. The production would have cost 1/200 of the 'Gladiator' budget, and you would have left the cinema feeling as silly and empty, but not as cheated, as after seeing this 'white elephant'. Unfortunately, this never-ending melodrama has been hailed as a masterpiece by the lovers of over-amplified sound effects, boringly fake visuals and gratuitous violence; and as in a Roman circus, it has been crowned with awards that make it look worst than it is. They all have shown more inspiration than the filmmakers in tracing a parallel between the Roman empire and the present one. What a shame.",3,3,10,28 May 2001
Donnie Darko," Donnie
","Fascinating as it opens and develops, 'Donnie Darko' works as an effective study of a section of the young's inadequacy in crucial years of self-search, while it entertains us with time travel folklore, Psychology 101 and paranormal occurrences. With all this information added, the film moves to a satisfactory surprise ending, but it leaves situations (the never-fulfilled descent into the cellar) and references without explanation (the allusions to Frank during the party), a few characters go to limbo (like the Chinese-American girl, Cherita Chen) while others are simply wasted (the professors Pomeroy and Monnitoff, played by Drew Barrymore and Noah Wyle, or Grandma Death, a nun turned into a sort of Stephen Hawking.) The DVD release includes scenes that were cut from the final edit, which may explain some of the dark aspects of the story. Still, this is a better film than the average psychological thriller, with very good performances.",6,0,0,2 May 2004
