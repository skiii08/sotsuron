Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A Great Finish To A Great Movie! (SPOILERS!!!)
","'Kill Bill, Vol. 2,' is a great movie. I expected it to fall flat, since 'Vol. 1' has pretty much all the violence and blood. Instead, we are given a character study of those that remain: We find out why Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah, managing to be beautiful and wicked at the same time)has lost her eye, the REAL story behind the massacre that sent The Bride (Uma Thurman, kicking much butt, yet showing a softer side.)on her quest, the depth of Bill's (David Carradine)feelings toward her, and the real name of The Bride.Carradine comes off as Caine(From 'Kung Fu'), falling into the dark side. In the first movie, Bill was voice and shadows, but in the film, once you get to know him, you kind of understand why he did what he did (That doesn't condone what he's done, mind you), and the regret that he has felt ever since.Two questions have popped up, though:1) The bitterness between Bill and Budd. They had a falling out years before. Was it in regard to The Bride? It's never discussed.2) Elle Driver. Is she dead? There is a possibility, seeing that there's a deadly snake in the trailer, that she may be dead. But you don't know. Maybe she'll pop up in a sequel, if they ever do one.One other thing...How did the Bride choose Tommy? You never really find out much about how they hooked up or his feelings about having another man's child. It would have been interesting if it would have been explored more.Otherwise, it was a great way to end a movie.",9,0,1,12 August 2004
Vertigo," Hitchcock and Stewart deliver a Classic
","I have been a die-hard fan of 'Vertigo' for over 10 years, having seen it over again and again, but up until now I could not put into words about how I felt about the film until now. And so here I go, pulling you the reader of this review into a story of obsessive love and serious phobias.As the film opens, we see Detective 'Scottie' Ferguson (James Stewart), in pursuit of a criminal with a fellow officer. As he tries to jump across a roof, he slips and falls, hanging on for dear life. The fellow officer, in an attempt to help him, falls to his death. It seems that he has acrophobia, which causes his vertigo and forces him to retire from the force, feeling guilt about the officer's death. Sometime later, while visiting with his former girlfriend Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes), Scottie tells her about Galvin Elster (Tom Helmore), a former college friend that needs his help. It seems that Elster's wife Madeleine (Kim Novak)is acting a bit strange: she goes into trances and disappears for hours without being able to account to her whereabouts. Scottie at first doesn't want anything to do with this. One look at Madeleine however changes his mind. From the moment he lays his eyes on her, he's hooked.While tailing her, he finds that she is obsessed with an ancestor of hers: an ancestor that went mad and killed herself. Scottie manages to save her from such an attempt (She tries to drown herself in the San Francisco Bay). He starts to fall for her HARD.During an attempt to help her at the San Juan Batista Mission, Madeleine runs from Scottie and up the tower. Scottie, unable to continue up the tower because of his acrophobia, can only watch in horror as Madeleine falls to her death. The death of the woman that he had fallen in love with is more than he can bear and it drives him to a nervous breakdown.Sometime later, Scottie, still haunted by Madeleine (And visiting some of her haunts)sees Judy Barton (Novak again), who looks remarkably like Madeleine. Scottie soon becomes obsessed with turning Judy into Madeleine (Even having her sit by the fire the way Madeleine did). Scottie is so desperate to reclaim the love he had for Madeleine that he is oblivious to the deceptions that have been surrounding him: He is truly falling in love with an illusion.All the parts of the film work wonderfully, from Saul Bass' opening titles to Bernard Herrmann's incredibly haunting music. But it is Stewart and Novak that bring the film it's life. When Scottie looks at Judy emerge out of the bathroom as his lost Madeleine, the green light makes her look as if she is truly a ghost, returning from the dead to once again love Scottie.If you have never seen this film, then you are missing one of Alfred Hitchcock's classic films. This is truly a classic film and a must have in your collection. You will absolutely fall in love with the film.",10,18,28,15 September 2005
Alien 3," A very big downer, but...Check Out The Assembly Cut
","-------SPOILERS AHEAD!!!! I'M SERIOUS!!!!------When I saw this movie in 1992, I was depressed for a long time. For a while, I was angry at the way that the series had ended (That was, of course, before 'Alien Resurrection'). Over the years, however, my tune has changed.For a long time, I could not watch 'Aliens' because those that survived that film (Hicks, Newt and Bishop, as well as Ripley), were killed at the beginning of 'Alien 3.' Ripley ends up on on a maximum security prison, populated by male prisoners. None of the men, who are some of the worst criminals (Rapists, murderers, child molesters), are happy to see Ripley. However, she's the least of their problems when an alien pops up on the planet. Seems that the alien hitched a ride on Ripley's EEV. It also seems that one of her worst nightmares have come to light, when she finds that she has been impregnated by the alien.This is not as bad a film as first thought. Poor David Fincher, who has practically disowned the film, has been given a bad rap. The film's core message is about loss. Ripley has lost much since the first film: She lost her friends, daughter (See 'Aliens' Special Edition for info on this),surrogate daughter(Newt),years and even Jones (The cat). Plus, her worst fears have come to light. She knows that she's going to die, to lose her life. The question becomes this: If you are going to die, what are you going to do with what time you have left? Will you give up or go out fighting? The film basically establishes the well-known stages of death by Dr. Elizabeth Kubler-Ross: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Ripley goes through these emotions in such a quick space of time that one barely notices.I recently saw 'The Assembly Cut' of 'Alien 3,' and I must admit that it improves on the original in many ways. Loose threads were tired up in this version (Such as the fate of Golic, who seemed to have simply disappeared without any real explanation) and more character development (The prisoners prayer meetings). The fate of Ripley in this version was slightly less painful than in the theatrical version. You can see what Fincher's vision was, and if the studios didn't butt in, who knows what would have happened with his career. Would 'Seven,' 'Fight Club' or 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' have been made if this film was a success? You may never know the question, but this is still a good film to watch. Watch the 'Assembly Cut' and 'Theatrical Version' back to back and judge for yourself.",9,2,4,20 December 2003
Requiem for a Dream," Haunting Performance by Ellen Burstyn
","'Requiem For A Dream' is haunting, brutally honest and raw. The four characters in this film have dreams: Harry (Jared Leto) and Tyrone (Marlon Wayans, in a surprising dramatic turn)want to make the big time, making lots of money and having a good time doing it. Harry's girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly)wants to succeed as well. They do this by selling heroin, making lots and lots of money.Meanwhile, Harry's mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn)is a widow who spends her days sitting outside with her elderly friends and watches the Tappy Tibbons show. She soon gets the opportunity to appear on the show and,wanting to wear a red dress that she wore years ago, starts taking pills to help her lose weight. Soon, these four people take the proverbial highway to hell: Their addictions start to slowly destroy their lives. Harry and Tyrone are so heavily addicted that they soon lose their money; Marion soon becomes a drug whore to sustain her habit, and Sara becomes incredibly shaky and paranoid (Her fridge is always after her). Their dreams are long gone. The only thing that is important is to get their next fix.All of the performances in the film (To this day, I am shocked by Marlon Wayans performance. Riveting!). But it is Burstyn's performance (Sadly, she didn't win the Oscar for it) as Sara who draws you in. You can understand the reason for her addiction: she is old, alone and fat. She gets an opportunity to be happy again in the form of the pills. But she pays a steep price for her happiness (As do Harry, Tyrone and Marion).If you want to scare someone who has a serious drug problem, then this film will do the job.There is also an unrated version (Which is just a tad more shocking). A must have in your collection.",10,0,1,15 October 2005
Star Trek," Roddenberry's Vision in Another Guy's Hands
","A part of me resisted watching JJ Abrams's take on Gene Roddenberry's classic series. Being a fan since I was a kid, you get used to seeing William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and Co. saving the universe. To me, seeing the series in someone else's hands seemed wrong.After watching the movie, I was glad that I was wrong. In a way, it is a tribute to Roddenberry and the show. Many die-hard fans may stay away, but it should be given a chance.I had to admit that the special effects, music and plot were fantastic, but it was Nimoy's role as Spock that put a lump in my throat, especially when he meets his younger self (Zachary Quinto, which give Spock a deep edge).All I can say is to give this film a chance.",9,1,4,7 June 2010
Monster," What A Serial Killer Did For Love
","'Monster' is based on the true story of Aileen Wuornos, the prostitute that turned serial killer in the 1990's in Florida. As we first see Aileen as a girl, you get to understand her past a little: molested as a child and treated with cruelty while growing up, which leads her into prostitution by the age of 13. We cut to Aileen (Charlize Theron) years later, working her trade in Florida. She seems on the brink of suicide until she meets Selby (Christina Ricci), who is living in Florida because her parents sent her there because she kissed a girl. Aileen falls deeply in love with Selby and wants to keep her happy. However, since she doesn't have any job skills other than being a hooker, she continues to do what she knows. It's during one night when one of her johns become brutal that Aileen begins to kill.Shelby soon realizes the scope of Aileen's crimes, but is torn as to what to do. And Aileen world is getting out of control, killing johns in a way to lash out at her horrific past and to keep Shelby happy by robbing them of their cars and money.This film pretty much is a twisted love story: Aileen finds true love with Selby and does anything to keep that love from slipping away, even if it results in someone's death. And Shelby clearly loves Aileen, although it can be said that she may love the freedom that Aileen gives her (She runs away from her relatives house to be with Aileen because her relatives are trying to 'cure' her from being lesbian).Theron's performance won an well-deserved Oscar. She is frightening and loving at the same time. Ricci's performance is also right on the mark. And it was nice to see Bruce Dern's performance as Thomas, the only man that seems to treat Aileen with kindness (Even trying to help her escape). This is a can't miss film.",9,5,6,17 October 2005
Dawn of the Dead," Interesting Re-Telling Of A Classic (SPOILERS!!!)
","I just got home after seeing 'Dawn Of The Dead,' and I immediately rushed to the computer to place my thoughts on this site. After being stoked for the past few months and after watching the 10 minute clip on USA, I settled into the seat and watched, transfixed at the screen and watched the fun begin. It is a very good film (Although the camera-work made me a bit dizzy and the sound system gave me a severe migraine)with an interesting story. No need to re-cap what it's about, but I will tell you that the humor is really on target (Especially the celebrity look-a-likes that get bumped off), the zombies are incredibly SCARY! (The thought of those things running after me scared me so much that I had to look over my shoulder on my way to my car), and it wasn't too heavy on gore (Just graphic violence). The ending reminded me of 1979's 'Zombie' (Those who have seen this film will understand). One word of note: watch the final credits! My one gripe is with Matt Frewer, because he really wasn't in the film that long (At least 5 minutes). Other than that, this was a truly excellent film. I HIGHLY recommend the unrated version, with the bonus footage and the behind-the scenes stuff. For fun, watch it back-to-back with the original version.",8,0,0,30 March 2004
Shaun of the Dead," Bloody Funny
","'Shaun of The Dead' is an incredibly funny comedy/horror film in which an unlikely hero is born out of incredibly ugly circumstances.Shaun (Simon Pegg)is a loser: his co-workers at the appliance give him a hard time, his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield)dumps him, and his life just seems to not have any focus. His only friend is Ed (Nick Frost),who speaks his mind just a bit too much. It just seems that Shaun's life can't get any worse.Until the zombies invade.At first oblivious to everything (walking to the store as zombies are walking everywhere), Shaun and Ed wise up and plan on getting his family and friends to a safe place. However, things don't go as planned. Not only do they have to deal with the zombie invasion, but they have to deal with everyday issues (Which Prince album should be used to throw at the zombies? 'Purple Rain,' 'Sign O' The Times' or 'Batman?').This came out during the time when zombies/undead ruled the box office (The remake of 'Dawn of The Dead,' '28 Days Later'), and it is an incredibly funny. The most hilarious part has to do with Shaun and Co. have to practice being zombies ('Who died and made you f*****g king of the zombies?'one of the guys said about his imitation)and as they're walking through the crowd, Ed gets a call on his cell phone and talks to his friends as his friends (And zombies)look on.Shaun looks and acts like the unlikeliest of heroes, and he manages not only to become the leader of the band (despite constant complaining from one of the group members), but he manages to save the girl and keep his best friend (In a very weird way).A film that should not be missed and a must have in your collection. One of the best horror spoofs in years!",10,0,1,18 June 2006
The English Patient," Painfully in Love
","'The English Patient' is, without a doubt, one of the saddest films that I have ever seen. That's not to say that this is a bad film. It is just that the film deals with painful love. The kind of love that can destroy those around you as well as yourself. Juliette Binoche (Her incredible beauty stole the film, as well as the Oscar), plays Hana, a nurse toward the end of WWII who is in charge of a patient, who is horribly burned in a plane crash. Hana, who is deeply hurting from losing a loved one (friends and lovers seem to die around her, making her feel cursed)sets up shop in a villa and cares for the mysterious patient. The patient, Count Almasy (Ralph Fiennes), is actually holding a lot of secrets, including an affair with Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas), whose husband (Colin Firth) works for the war effort. Almasy's and Katherine's affair starts a spark that slowing begins to destroy everything and everyone around them. It happens so gradually that no one sees it until it's too late.In the course of the movie, lives change. Hana begins a relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews) while at the villa, while a mysterious man named Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe) is having conversations with the patient...who know exactly who he is and what secrets he is holding.The film is a beauty to behold. The colors, the scenery, the acting, is very beautiful. The film will have you in tears (especially the end), so please have tissues in hand.",10,2,5,19 July 2004
Hostel," When People Make Incredibly Bad Choices
","'Hostel' is Eli Roth's follow-up after the uber-creepy 'Cabin Fever.' It even follows the same theme: when people make incredibly bad choices.In this case, we follow the exploits of Paxton (Jay Hernandez),Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson)and Josh (Derek Richardson), 3 college grads that are determined to have sex with every woman in Europe. It is during one of their barhopping tours that they meet Alex (Lubomir Bukovy),who recommends a hostel in Slovakia where all of their sexual fantasies will be fulfilled.As the saying goes, 'Beware of Greeks bearing gifts.' It seems that the guys soon become nothing more than an experiment in sadism: people are kidnapped and brought to this hostel in order to fulfill the twisted desires of their incredibly rich clients, who can kill another human being in which ever way that they want. And it can get incredibly nasty and bloody.The film starts off slowly. It doesn't get bloody until about the second half of the film. And many of the scenes of torture are suggestive in nature (One unfortunate soul is about to get their toes clipped, but the viewer never sees this). Incredibly unsettling and will make you hide behind your hands an awful lot (I freely admit that I had to do this several times). What makes it unsettling is that there may be a real possibility that situations like this exist.This will creep you out.",7,0,1,9 June 2006
Blade," The Best of The Trilogy
","'Blade' is the best of the series and loaded with action and martial arts. Blade (Wesley Snipes)came from an unusual birth: his mother was attacked by a vampire and dies giving birth to him, resulting in Blade being half vampire/half human. With his mentor/weapons master Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), Blade is on a mission to hunt and destroy vampires that run the city. Seems that these are not your typical vampires: They're like the Mafia. Lead by the Elder vampire Dragonetti (Udo Kier, who seems to make a career out of playing bloodsuckers), the vampire organization has their fangs into many different pies, and also own the cops. Of course, Dragonetti's pain in the neck is Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff, playing it cool), who believes that humans are their meal ticket and shouldn't be coddled. Frost is also digging into the legend of La Magra, the blood god that will pretty much wipe out humanity, and Blade's blood is the trigger to releasing La Magra. Blade, with the help of Karen (N'Bushe Wright), a scientist that helps Blade by creating a neat weapon to fight the bloodsuckers off, goes into battle, but not before he discovers a secret connection between him and Frost.Action packed and loaded, and interesting twists to vampire mythology (When disposing a vampire to the sun, Frost and Co. watch by wearing heavy sunblock and motorcycle outfits. Clever!). Snipes does the action thing pretty well.",8,0,1,30 June 2005
Spider-Man 3," Too Many Villains Syndrome
","Well, it finally happened.Spiderman 3 fell to what's commonly known as 'too many villains syndrome.'Don't believe me? Check out any of the Batman movies, especially Batman and Robin. There's too many villains, and the plot suffers because they try to accommodate the villains.In this case, Peter Parker, aka Spiderman (Tobey McGuire)has to deal with 3: The Sandman (Thomas Hayden Church), Harry Osborn, aka Green Goblin (James Franco)and Eddie Brock, aka Venom (Topher Grace). He also has to deal with the jealousy of Mary Jane (Kristen Dunst), who is going through a hard time. Most of all, Peter has to deal with his fame and the liquid creature that turns him into a dark figure and also a bit of a jerk to boot.The film has some disturbing scenes, such as Peter walking down the street, trying to look sexy and suave.Some of the plot points make no sense whatsoever, and it's a shame that Sam Raimi would let this hit the screen. It's heavy on great special fx, but incredibly light on a credible story. And what was the point of Bryce Dallas Howard being in the film other than eye candy? Again, it reminded me of Elle McPherson and Vivica A. Fox in 'Batman And Robin,' a pointless role with no real meaning.It's the most disappointing entry in the Spiderman series.",4,2,5,12 May 2007
Blade II," The Return of The Daywalker
","'Blade II' is an interesting turn in the series, and more graphic than the first film. Blade (Wesley Snipes)has managed to find Whistler (Kris Kirstofferson), who supposedly died in the first film (He was attacked by vampires and then shot himself), but he also finds out that he is being hunted, but for reasons he didn't expect: The Vampire Nation need Blade to help THEM. A mutation has struck within the vampire community that turns them into creatures that attack not just humans, but also vampires. Those that get bitten and survive turn into one of them, called the Reaper. A very reluctant Blade soon joins forces with the Bloodpack, lead by Nyssa (Lenore Varela)and Reinhardt (Ron Perlman, a bad ass as always). With no trust on either side, they go on the hunt to wipe out the creatures.With cool direction by Guillermo del Toro, this is an improvement over the first.",8,0,13,30 June 2005
Top Secret!," Painfully Funny!
","'Top Secret!' by the guys that brought us 'Airplane,' (And individually would surprise us with films like 'Ghost' and 'First Knight.')is a worth successor, almost surpassing 'Airplane' as the funniest of the 2.Nick Rivers (Val Kilmer) is a very popular singer who is one of the headliners of a festival in East Germany, which uses the festival as a cover for world domination. When Rivers meets up with Hillary (Lucy Gutteridge), he is drawn into The Resistance, a group with colorful names (Chocolate Mousse, Deja Vu, Latrine). The leader of the group, Nigel (AKA The Torch), is a former love of Hillary's, which complicates things.Never mind the formula plot, though.The film is played STRICTLY for laughs, and the laughs hit you hard and fast. So much so that you can't recover from painful laugh attacks. It's hard to pinpoint which scenes are funnier, so I'm not going to try. Omar Sharif, Peter Cushing and Michael Gough actually have some pretty funny moments in the film.",10,2,5,11 April 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," Other than great SFX, the film ended with a whimper, not a bang.
","I was pretty disappointed in the final chapter of 'The Matrix' saga. It seemed that the people behind the film was more into putting together action and not enough plot or story. If you plan on seeing this film, watch the first 2 BEFORE you do, otherwise you will get TOTALLY LOST in what is going on. Best part of the film was the action scene between Neo (Reeves)and Agent Smith (Weaving, who pretty much makes up for the disappointing film). Mary Alice takes over as The Oracle (Gloria Foster died during production). The film gets really depressing (Why was Trinity's death so long?). It seems that a lot of the story just drops off, never to be picked up. All in all, a sad way to end the saga of Neo and 'The Matrix.'",7,0,0,6 November 2003
The Caine Mutiny," Classic Performance By Bogart
","'The Caine Mutiny' is one of Bogart's many great performances. As the new commander of the mine sweeping ship called the U.S.S. Caine, Queeg seems to be tough as nails. But we soon realize that the cheese is slipping off Queeg's cracker. As Lt Maryk (Van Johnson), Lt. Keefer (Fred MacMurray) and newbie Ensign Keith (Robert Francis)watch, Queeg seems to be riding the paranoia bus, tearing the ship up for a nonexistent key that he believes has been used to steal some frozen strawberries, causing a slight accident with a tow target while dressing down Keith for allowing a guy to have his shirt hanging out and playing around with a pair of metallic balls. Maryk is wary enough by Queeg's actions that he ends up reliving Queeg during a typhoon (Queeg's cowardly behavior causes the ship to nearly founder).Maryk and Keith is brought on trial for mutiny, with Lt. Greenwald (Jose Ferrer)defending them. The scene in which Queeg takes the stand is absolutely stunning, in which we watch Queeg's madness brought to the surface. However, it is Greenwald's speech to the officer's of The Caine that brings the most shock: That it was Keefer that stirred the pot that brought the mutiny to a full boil.All of the performances in the film are first class, even though some of the scenes with Francis and May Winn should have been left on the cutting room floor. Despite this, it is Bogart, Johnson and MacMurray that makes 'The Caine Mutiny' the classic that it has become.",10,0,2,9 April 2006
The Thing," Still Creepy After All These Years
","John Carpenter's adaptation of 'The Thing,' is a gore-fest from start to finish. Since it's release in 1982, viewers are still amazed at the special effects, which still hold up pretty good.In the Antarctic, a group of researchers are thrown into a horrific nightmare when a dog shows up, being shot at by a group of Noreigians, that REALLY want the dog dead. Later, the group of researchers, lead by MacReady (Kurt Russell), stumble upon a spaceship at the Noreigians camp, with other information: a creature that can become anything or anyone it chooses. This really becomes evident when the dog, which is in a kennel with the other dogs, shows what it REALLY is, in one of the most disturbing scenes in movie history (And still creeps me out!).Soon the researchers begin to suspect each other, knowing that the creature can assume ANYONE'S identity. Paranoia and distrust runs rampant, as one by one the creature begins to take over each of the group members. In one memorable scene, a blood test is used to reveal which of the members is the creature. You get so caught up in who you THINK is the creature, that when you find out the truth, you really are shocked. The film has you on edge from start to finish, although there are some unanswered questions (What exactly happened to Nauls?)that I wished were explained.The Thing itself is a nasty piece of work: This creature can inhabit every square inch of a victim's body (even the blood). Each incarnation of the creature is as graphic and as disturbing as the last. And the atmosphere in the film makes the situation even more unsettling: The group is in the middle of nowhere, with temperatures below freezing and dropping each and every second. Their modes of transportation are destroyed and no one can trust each other. They are trapped with not just the creature, but with their own understandable paranoia.2 of my favorite lines: Wilford Brimley,as Dr. Blair, going insane and screaming 'I'll kill you!' and David Clennon, as Palmer, when he sees his friend's head turn into a spider creature and walks away, says 'You gotta be f***ing kidding!' Great movie to be included for Halloween, or when you just want to have a good scare.",10,0,1,9 April 2005
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Please, Don't Come Back!
","'Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines' is depressing and loaded with flaws.@@@@@@@@@@POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!!!@@@@@@@@@@Many points in the film did not pan out: John's 'death' by The Terminator in the future, Sarah's Death (How could The Terminator possibly know about the details?) None of which is explored, only mentioned and died out. The 2 bright spots of the film is The T-X (Loken), who looks hot and deadly at the same time, and the return of Dr Silberman (Boen), even though it was brief (And he being in a state of denial over what happened in T2). Other than that, this is not a good way to end a series (They should have left it alone with the 2nd film, but that's Hollywood for you), and I hope to God that they will end it here!",5,0,1,2 December 2003
Apocalypse Now," Redux It Again!!!
","**********SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!**********I have resisted watching 'Apocalypse Now Redux' since it was released? Why? Because, being a fan of the original version (And saw both versions with the different endings), I was afraid of being disappointed.I HATE it when I am WRONG!!!This version, though longer, is even better. The inclusion of the French plantation inhabitants provided a bit of relief, and answers a question that had nagged me for years: What became of Clean's (A very young Laurence Fishburne)body? The conversation regarding the war in Vietnam being a wasteful war strikes home in the current war in Iraq. The mission still remains the same: Captain Willard (Martin Sheen)has been given a task: to 'terminate' the command of Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando at his most intense), who has gone insane in the jungles of Vietnam . He hitches a ride with the crew of a patrol boat. The crew (Albert Hall, Frederic Forrest, Sam Bottoms and Fishburne) deal with the situation in different ways (Bottoms seems to be high all through the film, which he REALLY was)as they travel into the depths of hell to get to Kurtz, who is worshiped as a god by the inhabitants (Including Dennis Hopper as a photojournalist who is really out there).The most famous scene of course is when the crew encounters Lt.Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall)who blows up villages while Wagner's 'The Ride of the Valkyries' is blasting through the speakers of the attacking helicopters. That scene alone makes you wonder if the war in general was pure madness: Kilgore becomes more concerned about surfing than doing his job.For those who are still avoiding seeing this version of a classic, put your fears to rest and rent it tonight.",10,1,2,2 September 2004
Van Helsing," For True Universal Monster Buffs Only
","'Van Helsing' uses a lot of old Universal Monster film bits in the film and the film will appeal more to those who may appreciate the genre. However, the film is mostly a CGI fest, with a plot that can be considered laughable at best.Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman)works for the Vatican to rid the world of monsters. Van Helsing is also considered a murderer as well by outsiders. Van Helsing is also a bit of a mystery: He has been alive and around for hundreds of years, and has no clue to who he really is (or was). The Vatican has a mission for him: To go to Transylvania to stop Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh)from conducting experiments in which a vast amount of his 'children' would be brought to life (He and his 3 brides are dead, so none of their children can live without some help). To do this, he needs Frankenstein's monster (Shuler Hensley)to achieve his task.Van Helsing, despite his skills, needs some help. He gets this in the form of Carl (David Wenham) a friar who works with the Vatican and provides the weapons, and Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale), who comes from a long line of monster hunters who cannot enter heaven unless Dracula is destroyed, and whose brother Velkan (Will Kemp)has become a werewolf.The film has long stretches which can bore you to tears. I'm not saying it's completely bad, it's just that the film has a lot of wasted potential. You see parts of a good old fashion monster mash on the screen and wish that it could have been better.If you grew up with the Universal Horror Classics (Especially when they would put the creatures together in films like 'House of Dracula' or any of the 'Abbott and Costello' monster films), then this may remind you of days long gone. Otherwise, you may end up getting disappointed by what's on the screen.",6,2,4,3 August 2005
Dark City," Truly 'Dark' Indeed
","Alex Proyas seems to do his best work in the dark. In his previous work, 'The Crow,' the story takes place in a dark city in incredibly dark times, with very few shots of light. In 'Dark City,' we get this in spades. The city has no name and it is ALWAYS dark. No one is really disturbed by this except John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell), who wakes up in a bathtub with no memory of who he is...and a dead woman in the apartment. He soon realizes that nothing is what it seems. At the strike of midnight, everyone falls asleep except him. Time just stops. Then, The Strangers arrive. With their dark clothes and dead pallor, they control the inhabitants of the city, switching their identities over and over in an attempt to determine the human condition in order to save their race. They also have an ability called 'tuning,' which can alter the landscapes, making it as they choose. It also seems that Murdoch also has this power (Although how he obtained it is never clearly explained), and is soon a part of the Strangers plans. While trying to avoid The Strangers, he is trying to avoid the police,who believe him to be a serial killer. On his tail is Inspector Bumstead (William Hurt),who is slowly starting to have his doubts about Murdoch, and is wondering why his predecessor seems to have gone mad while trying to solve the murders. Also trying to find Murdoch is Dr. Schreber (Keifer Sutherland), who works with The Strangers, and who has a hidden agenda that may/may not help Murdoch. Jennifer Connelly plays Murdoch's wife Emma, who soon becomes a pawn in The Strangers attempt to capture him.An excellent film, but it leaves a few unanswered questions (Exactly WHERE did the inhabitants of the city come from?). Some viewers may notice interesting similarities between this film and 'The Matrix, which was released the following year. Good performances all around, especially Jennifer Connelly. I've always found her to be a beauty, but when she is in the club, singing those ballads, her beauty really shines. Also of note is Richard O'Brien as Mr. Hand. As he becomes immersed in the human condition, you can almost feel how he longs to be human (Especially when he looks at the picture of Connelly and talks to her). On a more personal note: there's something about the way he says 'surrender.' Whenever he says that, it just sounds sexy!",9,1,2,28 April 2005
The Usual Suspects," Mind Boggling Good
","'The Usual Suspects' is one of those examples in which you can't take things at face value.As the film starts (Which takes place 'last night'), we see Keaton (Gabriel Byrne)on a ship, bodies all over the place. He looks up to see that a figure is standing there. He address the figure as 'Keyser' before he is shot. The ship explodes, sending a nice fireball. However, there is one survivor: a cripple named Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey)who is telling the story of the events leading to the ship explosion to Agent Kujan (Chazz Palminteri), who has an ax to grind with Keaton.We then cut to a few weeks before. Keaton, along with McManus (Stephen Baldwin),Fenster (Benicio Del Toro) and Hockney (Kevin Pollak)are taken in for questioning, along with Kint, about a stolen truck. Hot under the collar for the arrests, they decide to get even by exposing a bit of NYPD corruption and get paid in the process. However, it seems that they soon end up in even worse trouble.It seems that at one time or another, each of the guys have stolen from Keyser Soze, an underworld figure that is just as mean and rotten to the core as the 5 guys (After all, he did kill his family rather than let his enemies get to them). No one knows who he is or what he looks like (He works through buffers, so no one knows anything about who is giving the orders). He is also incredibly feared, and has a job for our 5 anti-heroes: they are to board a ship to steal nearly $100 million in cocaine. Clearly a suicide mission, they have no choice but to follow through, especially when Soze's lawyer Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite)explains quite calmly (Even when threatened with death)just how high the stakes really are.However, it is the final minutes of the film that will have the moviegoer shaking their head and saying 'What the HELL?' This is a must see film and it put Bryan Singer (Who has done the XMen films since then)and Kevin Spacey on the map. Dark and full of twists that make a pretzel look straight, 'The Usual Suspects' is something to watch on a stormy evening.",10,0,0,17 October 2005
District 9," Sci-Fi as Social Commentary
","'District 9' is more than a sci-fi film with aliens, good guys/bad guys, and lots and lots of guns and violence. It's a film that deals with the issue of race and illegal aliens and how they are treated.In this case, the illegal aliens traveled a LONG way to get here.As the film opens (which has a documentary/reality show feel to it), a spaceship is floating over South Africa (Johannesburg to be more specific)and has been in that position for over 20 years. The aliens that arrive are forced to live in inhumane (pardon the pun, but you get the point) conditions in an area called 'District 9.' No one particularly wants them there and they treat the aliens with contempt and horrific violence. Gangsters take over the area and use the aliens' love of cat food to make life even worse for them.Into the picture arrives Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley), a geeky official that pretty much got the job because his Father-in-Law is head of the corporation known as Multi-National United (MNU). Wikus is in charge of relocating the aliens to District 10 (Another 'settlement' area)and is doing his best to look macho and give a presence of strong authority (and is not doing a good job of it, from the looks of things). As he's trying to do his job, he gets a dose of some funky looking liquid. Once the liquid hits his skin, life as he knows it changes. He slowly starts to change into an alien and he soon goes on the run after MNU decides to use him to unlock the secrets of the alien weaponry (humans can't use it, only the aliens).'District 9' is Sci-Fi as Social Commentary. A corporation that will do anything (including sacrificing their own)to dominate and control. Aliens forced to live in shantytowns (references to South Africa's history with apartheid)and subjected to intolerance. Wikus sees this through (literally) new eyes, and he changes. He becomes stronger for it, and it makes for an interesting ride toward the conclusion of the film.I loved the film, and the film takes a misstep or 2 (the alien gun issue is my sticking point). It's worth a look.",9,0,5,23 July 2010
Batman Begins," A New Spin on The Batman Mythology
","'Batman Begins,' under the direction of Christohper Nolan (Memento), breathes new life into a franchise that was nearly demolished with 'Batman And Robin.' Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne/Batman is more dark than Michael Keaton's version. Bruce clearly has issues with bats and the death of his parents (His fear of bats caused him to want to leave the theater the night his parents where killed). Gotham City is a cesspool of corruption, with gangster Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson)running the town. During Bruce's journey, he is soon trained by Ducard (Liam Neeson)to perfect his fighting skills. Working with a cult run by Ra's Al-Ghul (Ken Watanabe), he starts to take shape into becoming The Dark Knight.Returning to Gotham City, Wayne sees that things have gotten worse. With the help of Alfred his butler (Michael Caine),Luscious Fox, an employee of Wayne Enterprises (Morgan Freeman)and the assistance of a policeman named Gordon (Gary Oldman, playing a good guy for once), the legend of Batman grows. However, with Falcone and The Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy)trying to run Gotham City, it's not an easy task. Plus, there is an unexpected wrinkle in the mix as well.With the exception of Katie Holmes as Wayne's childhood friend (And prosecuting attorney)Rachel Dawes, all of the performances are first rate (Particularly Oldman, with a bit of comedy relief). It is also interesting in seeing how the Batcave and The Batmobile had evolved (The Batmobile looking like a huge ATV). There is lots of action from start to finish, and a glimpse of things to come (Particularly a playing card with a joker on it!). I am looking forward to what comes next.",10,0,0,30 November 2005
Saving Private Ryan," One of Spielberg's Most Haunting and Visually Stunning Films
","'Saving Private Ryan' is one of Steven Spielberg's most haunting and visually stunning films. As the film opens, you see an elderly man (Whose identity is not revealed until the end), standing at a headstone, in tears. Why? You soon understand the story as we go back in time.It is D-Day, June 6th,1944. You are soon caught up in the battle on Omaha Beach. And it is INCREDIBLY bloody. Soldiers are shot, drowned, blown apart or on fire during the battle on the beach against the Germany army. One of the soldiers fighting is Capt. Miller (Tom Hanks, in one of his best performances), who fights bravely, but you can see the terror that engulfs him. His hands say it all: an uncontrollable shaking.Soon after the battle, Miller is given a mission: seems that 3 of the killed men were brothers. A fourth is behind enemies lines and needs to be rescued and sent home to America. With his team members accompanying him, Miller starts his search for Private Ryan (Matt Damon).This is not an easy mission. Every single man knows that they may not survive the trek through the countryside of Normandy. Pvt. Reiben (Edward Burns)believes that Pvt. Ryan is not worth saving, at the cost of their lives. But with courage and determination by the team (although some members do lose their lives), they find Ryan. However, Ryan refuses to leave because a bridge in a bomb shattered town needs protection from the German army. With the assistance of the surviving team, they take a stand against the army. It is at this point that the surviving team members understand the importance of a lingering question through the film: will their sacrifice make a difference? By taking a stand to defend the bridge, the answer is obvious: yes.The performances of the actors are powerful; Including Hanks, Burns and Damon, you have Tom Sizemore, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel and Jeremy Davies. John Williams, who always works well with Spielberg, provides a powerful score. The battle at the beginning of the film is one of the most heart wrenching scenes in cinematic history (And is not for the squeamish). It is a very moving film, and you will need plenty of tissue before you watch it.",10,20,39,30 June 2005
Schindler's List," Heartbreaking
","**********POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!**********To this day, this film has made an impact on me. It shows how the one man can make a difference.Oskar Schindler(Wonderful performance by Liam Neeson)is not a saint: He is a lousy husband, a womanizer, drinks too much, and has no luck in business. Poland provides the stuff of his dreams. He opens a business and makes money, he has a nice house, nice clothes and money. Unfortunately, it comes at the expense of the Jews of Poland. He uses their labor (They don't get paid for the work they do for him) and their homes(A Jewish couple was forced to leave their home, which Schindler eventually takes).Amon Goeth (A Chilling Ralph Fienes)arrives to create a forced labor camp outside Krakow and proceeds to 'liquidate' the ghetto. This part of the film is incredibly brutal: men, women and children are shot to death throughout the ghetto as a little girl in red (Equally chilling, since the film is in black & white)wanders through the horror. What Schindler does at this point in time, watching the little girl in red, is to become a hero. He begins to use his wealth and power to save the Jews that are working for him. However, when the labor camp is closed and the Jews are marked for Auschwitz, he comes up with a plan: Buy the workers. With the help of his accountant Stern (Brilliantly played by Ben Kingsley), he creates a list of the workers, a list of people to be saved from the gas chambers of Auschwitz. From start to finish, this film is a history lesson. You see the good the can happen (The change in Oskar), as well as the evil that men do (Goeth's morning 'target practice' on the labor camp workers is horrifying). Spielberg created a masterpiece in film making, as well as an object history lesson of the Holocaust. Have the Kleenex at hand whenever you watch this film.",10,10,15,22 January 2004
Men in Black II," Not Bad, But Not Good, Either
","The sequel to MIB finds Agent Jay (Will Smith)getting rid of another partner (Linda Fiorentino's was zapped between movies and is back at the morgue). Jay clearly doesn't want another partner. However, with the arrival of Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle), Jay has to find the only person who knows the reason behind her presence on Earth: Kevin Brown a.k.a. Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones), who works at the post office. Problem is, Kay's memory was erased in the previous movie, and Jay must bring it back, save the MIB, which Serleena has under siege, and save the world.This was an o.k. film with a lot of interesting bits and pieces (Especially the little cameo by Michael Jackson as an alien representative), but the film falls flat too many times and too many plot holes (Where did Johnny Knoxville's character go? He just disappeared!). Stick with the original instead.",5,1,2,13 June 2005
The Evil Dead," Watch Out For That Tree!
","Sam Raimi took off and running with his first feature film, 'The Evil Dead.' Shot on the cheap, Raimi still managed to scare his audience, and the film is a cult classic. 5 young people are on a little trip to an isolated cabin. While checking the cabin out, they find a tape recorder and a book. Not leaving well enough alone (This is a horror film, after all), they play the tape, which explains that the book is a 'book of the dead,' which contains incantations that allow demons to possess the living. The spell which is translated on the tape releases the evil that's in the forest. Trapped in the cabin, each of them soon becomes possessed by the 'evil dead,' which torments and brutalizes the remaining survivors, until only Ash (Bruce Campbell)remains. Ash has to try to survive the night and avoid his friends, who want him dead.The film is pretty graphic: people getting chopped up because that's the only way they can be stopped, one poor individual gets stabbed in the foot with a pencil, and there's lots and lots of graphic gore. But the most incredibly graphic scene is when one poor girl gets raped by the forest (you have to see it to believe it).Even after over 20 years, this film is still unsettling (And I have a VERY hard time watching this at night). If you're like me, then you might want to watch it in the light. Otherwise, go ahead and take a chance. But remember, I warned ya!",10,1,3,13 June 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Bloody Fantastic! (Spoilers Ahead!)
","Saw this last night and had to watch it again the next day. What can I say except 'WAY TO GO, QUENTIN!' The Bride (Beautiful Uma Thurman), on her wedding day, gets beat up and shot by her fellow assassins,known as the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad(DIVAS), lead by the wicked Bill (David Carridine). The guests, including the groom, are killed, yet The Bride survives and is in a coma for 4 years. Waking up, she sets a plan in motion to seek out and kill those that tried to kill her. The film is a tribute to the old school kung fu movies, anime and even 'spaghetti westerns' (The Bride's name is not revealed until part 2). Like Tarentino's 'Pulp Fiction,' it is out of sequence, jumping back and forth. Daryl Hannah's Elle Driver, although not in the film that much (Her best work will be in Kill Bill Vol. 2), is wicked. The best parts include The Bride's battle with Copperhead (Vivica A. Fox, kicking some serious ass), her fight with O-Ren Ishii (Cool as ice Lucy Liu) and her gang at The House Of Blue Leaves (Nice name! And what's up with the guy that looks like Charlie Brown?), and O-Ren's origins(Nice anime!). None of the people involved in this revenge film are saints (The Bride is an assassin, after all), and you actually end up feeling a tiny bit sorry for the assassins (Especially Fox's incredibly violent death in front of her daughter), but that's what happens when you live this kind of life.To get the full feel of the film, watch it back to back with part 2. Hopefully, they'll put the film back together the way it was supposed to be.",10,0,1,20 April 2004
The Last Emperor," The Boy Who Would Be King
","'The Last Emperor' tells the real life story of Pu Yi, who was the last emperor of China before it became a republic. Pu Yi (Played as an adult by John Lone)is brought to the Forbidden City as a child and is made emperor. From that moment he becomes a prisoner of circumstance: He cannot leave the palace and even though he is still the emperor, his power is limited to the inhabitants of the Forbidden City since China is ruled by a republic.Pu Yi wants desperately to escape to the West, starting a new way of life (Going to Oxford is one of his dreams), but he instead escapes into marriage with Wan Jung (Joan Chen) and takes on a concubine (Secondary consort is her title) as well. When he is thrown out of the Forbidden City, he sees a chance to follow his dreams, but instead becomes a puppet for the Japanese, becoming emperor to the republic of Manchuria, resulting in his arrest toward the end of World War II. This results in a new change as he is re-educated and spends his remaining days as a gardener.Directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, we witness the sad tale of Pu Yi, an Emperor with no power, only used as a symbol. He had no control of his fate, and was a puppet since the age of 3.Worthy performances by Lone, Chen and Peter O'Toole as Pu Yi's tutor. Winner of 9 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, it is a sight to watch and a gripping story to listen to.",10,1,1,6 April 2006
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Incredibly Disturbing, But Rather Fun!
","'Charlie And The Chocolate Factory' sticks closer to the book than 'Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory,' with Gene Wilder. Sweet lovable Charlie (Freddie Highmore)lives with his parents (Helena Bonham Carter and Noah Taylor)and 4 grandparents in a literal broken home (Made with doors and full of holes). The family is destitute (The father works at a toothpaste factory putting the caps on the tubes, and they eat cabbage soup all the time). Being a fairy tale, their luck will soon change.An announcement is made throughout the world that Willy Wonka (The amazing and creepy Johnny Depp)is opening up his chocolate factory to the holders of 5 golden tickets. Lucky Charlie gets hold of one of them and, with his grandpa Joe (David Kelley)at his side, they go off on an amazing adventure.The other 4 kids are obnoxious as hell and you are really glad that they get what's coming to them.Depp looks a bit like Michael Jackson in some aspects (And this comparison seems to be getting bigger by the minute). The back story on Wonka's childhood (With a nice performance by Christopher Lee)which fuels his chocolate obsession,is a bit touching (Especially when they reunite at the end of the film). There are a couple of musical numbers with the Oompa Loompas (All played by Deep Roy), which are a bit creepy but oh so funny! Tim Burton seems to be back in form (Planet of The Apes knocked him down a few pegs)and it's good to see him back. Danny Elfman's (Who is long overdue for an Academy Award)music is haunting and delightful to hear (He also sings the songs).Fun to watch, and you will have a song on your lips and a taste for some chocolate.",8,1,1,28 July 2005
Grindhouse," Nasty, Dirty, Creepy Fun by Rodriguez and Tarantino
","Growing up in the era of the grind-houses, I was waiting with baited breath for the collaboration of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino's tribute to the era. In 'Grindhouse,' we are given 2 movies, plus 'trailers,' which are directed by such filmmakers as Rob Zombie ('Werewolf Women of the S.S.'), and Eli Roth ('Thanksgiving.'), which are so interesting you wish that they were actual films (And I would REALLY love to see 'Thanksgiving!').Of the 2 collaborations (Tarentino's 'Death Proof' and Rodriguez's 'Planet Terror'), it's Rodriguez who brings the best to the dinner table. In 'Terror,' A town becomes a battleground when a chemical causes a zombie outbreak. You got some rough and tough women, including Rose McGowan (As Cherry), who battles the zombies with the use of a machine gun leg. There's a hell of a lot of gore in this segment, so you may want to watch this on an empty stomach (Especially the segment which includes a cameo by Tarentino).Tarantino's 'Death Proof' has Kurt Russell as a former stuntman who REALLY loves his wheels, and is not above bumping off a few women to prove that his wheels are death proof. It takes a while to get to the action because of a bit too much dialog, which makes this segment drag.Don't be confused by scratches and missing scenes, because it's what gives the film its charm.The film didn't do so well when first released, some saying that it should have been broken into 2 segments. I disagree on this, because it defeats the purpose of the grind-house experience. Watch the WHOLE film and enjoy the ride.",9,2,5,21 April 2007
Saw," Creepy!
","'Saw' is a morality tale to the extreme. The question 'What would you do to stay alive' is constantly posed through the movie. 2 men, Dr. Gordon (Cary Elwes) and Adam (Leigh Whannelle, who also helped with the screenplay)wake up in a room, each with a chain on their foot. A creepy voice tells the doctor that he has to make a choice: Kill Adam by 6 or his wife and child will die. Through a series of flashbacks, we find out that Dr. Gordon was originally a suspect in a series of grisly murders dubbed 'The Jigsaw Murders.' Funny thing is, the victims aren't murdered, but are manipulated by the serial killer to do themselves in. Many of the 'murders' are graphic (This one individual had to climb through heavy duty barbed wire in order to escape). Danny Glover plays a detective that becomes obsessed with the case (And has his own battle scars dealing with the killer). The ending is jaw dropping and you just KNOW that a sequel would have to be made (TOO many unanswered question!). By the time the credits roll, you wonder if YOU would do the same to stay alive.For true horror buffs and for those who want a good scare.",8,4,9,3 March 2005
Up," 'Up' took my breath away!
","Pixar has had the magic touch ever since 'Toy Story' was first released in 1995. Since then each film has made it's mark in cinematic history, each having a different feel and style, but leaving a lasting impression in a movie-viewer's heart and soul. 'Up' is no exception. I laughed and cried (A LOT of crying, I'll admit)as I watched this incredibly heartwarming story.Carl(Ed Asner)lives alone after his wife of many years has died. Forced to give up his home and move into a retirement community, he decides to run away...and take his house with him. His goal: To reach Paradise Falls in South America, where he and his late wife had always plan to go (And both their childhood dreams). With the help of a LOT of balloons, and the unwanted assistance of Russell, who is trying to get his badge, Carl gets to South America. He also discovers that Charles Muntz (Wickedly played by Christopher Plummer), a disgraced explorer from Carl's childhood is trying to capture a rare bird that will bring him fame and restore his damaged reputation. With the use of his talking dogs, Muntz will stop at nothing to reach his goal.'Up,' only the 2nd animated film to be honored with an Academy Award nomination ('Beauty and The Beast,' another film that made me cry was the first)is a wonderful work of art. The animation style has changed since Pixar brought 'Toy Story' to life. It's more realistic than the previous films that they have made. And as I said, it has a wonderful, magical story to it. Who hasn't wished that they can make a childhood wish come true once childhood has slipped away? It's great for all ages (Some parts make spook the little ones), and another Pixar classic. And I am not afraid to admit that I sat and cried all through the ending credits.",10,1,3,13 June 2010
The Legend of 1900," Better Than I Thought It Would Be
","I stumbled into this film while watching IFC a few months ago. To my surprised, I became glued to the television. 'The Legend Of 1900,' which is the title that it was given when released in the US, is about a infant found on a ship in 1900. As his friend Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince)tells his story in a series of flashbacks, we discover that 1900 spent his entire existence on the ship, being raised by Danny (Bill Nunn). 1900 (The underrated Tim Roth)is also a very good piano player, his music inspired by what he sees and feels. Yet for all his talent, he never leaves the ship. We soon find out that the ship is soon to be blown to bits. Max thinks that 1900 may still be on the ship.This is a great film, and the music is pretty cool. The 2 best parts of the film is the piano duel between 1900 and Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence Williams III). Watching their fingers fly on the ivories is hypnotic! Also when Max and 1900 play the piano during the storm, the piano cruises around the halls of the ship, leaving you feeling like you're on a roller-coaster.The saddest part is when Max does find 1900 and he explains why he has never left the ship. Part of me could understand his hesitation to leave: His world was the ship, the only place he had ever known and loved. You know that he will die when the ship blows, but his reasons actually sound sane.Worth checking out.",7,2,5,24 March 2005
Pulp Fiction," Cheeseburgers, Foot Massages and A Mysterious Case
","'Pulp Fiction' is a incredible film by Quentin Tarantino, fresh from 'Resevior Dogs.' The film has several stories, but the common thread is Jules and Vincent (Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta), hit men that work for Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). Jules is one cool s.o.b. Don't believe me? Catch the scene when he mentally tortures the guys that betrayed Wallace: He takes a bite out of one of the guy's burger and takes a sip of his soda, all the while getting ready to kill them! Later, Vincent takes out Mia, Wallace's wife (Uma Thurman). Vincent makes it clear that it is not a date, but you can tell that they have feelings for each other. The 'date' ends on a low note when Mia OD's on Vincent's heroin (She being a coke head, thought it was coke). What follows is one of the most disturbing scenes in cinematic history.Butch's story soon follows. A washed-out boxer, he earlier promised Wallace to take a dive in the ring. Butch betrays Wallace and decides to skip town with his girlfriend Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros). But she forgot his watch, which was an heirloom from his late father (And delivered to him when he was a boy by Christopher Walken, in one of the most not-funny-but-you-laugh-anyway scenes). Determined to get his watch Bruce ends up in a situation along with Wallace that has shades of 'Deliverance' all over it.Other scenes throughout the film include Jules and Vincent racing the clock to clean out their car (Due to Vincent accidentally shooting a guy in the head) with the assistance of The Wolf (Harvey Keitel) before Bonnie, their friend's wife, comes home; 2 would be robbers (Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth)discussing the benefits of robbing a restaurant, and the mystery of the briefcase (What's in it is never revealed, but it is enough for it to glow!).Pure classic film, loaded with violence, but insightful (The discussion of cheeseburgers really is interesting, as well as the difference between particular types of foot massages!). Tarentino brings out the best work out of his cast, but it is Jackson as Jules who steals the film (His speech before he kills the guys in the apartment STILL sends shivers down my spine).

Psycho," Serious Mother Issues
","Alfred Hitchcock had created a classic film about a young man with serious mother issues. As 'Psycho' begins, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh)is desperate to keep hold of her boyfriend Sam (John Gavin), who is struggling to keep financially afloat (Alimony and paying his father's debts). She decides to help by stealing $40,000 from a client of her boss. Skipping town, she stops at the Bates Motel during a stormy night and meets Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), who is devoted to caring for his mentally ill mother. But it soon becomes apparently how ill she is when Marion is brutally stabbed to death while taking a shower.Soon on Marion's trail is her sister Lila and Private Detective Arbogast (Martin Balsam). With Sam on board, they soon find out the secret of Norman and his mother.Perkins could never escape the role of Norman (He eventually came back playing Norman 3 times), and you can understand why: under that sweet facade is a very unstable individual. The film works on 3 levels here: Hitchcock's direction, Bernard Herrmann's music and the performance of Perkins. The infamous shower scene still pulls a punch (And caused Leigh to swear off showers for the rest of her life).If you haven't seen this, give it a look. Avoid the horrible remake at all costs.",10,0,1,24 October 2005
Rosemary's Baby," Prepartum Crazies or Good Old Devil Worship?
","Roman Polanski's adaptation of Ira Levin's novel follows very closely to the book (About 95%, I think)and he does a wonderful job in doing so.Rosemary (Mia Farrow)and Guy (John Cassavetes)are a young married couple. Guy is a struggling actor, always looking for a good break, but Rosemary is supportive. An apartment opens up at the Bramford (Or known as The Bram) and they decide to take it, even though their friend Hutch (Maurice Evans)tries to talk them out of it. Seems that The Bram has a rather black history in which strange occurrences happened, including a man named Adrian Marcato, who claimed to have conjured up Satan. Of course, being young people, they tend to ignore his advice.Soon, Rosemary meets her neighbors, The Castevets. Minnie (Ruth Gordon)is incredibly nosy and Roman (Sidney Blackmer)is warm and caring. Guy soon takes a liking to them. Rosemary however finds them to be a bit smothering, especially since a young girl that stayed with them leaped to her death. Then, Guy gets the break that he wants when the actor that beat him for a starring role goes blind. He then tells Rosemary that they should have a baby. Rosemary loves this idea, considering that she always wanted a child.On 'baby night,' Rosemary passes out after having dinner (With dessert by Minnie). She then has a nightmarish dream in which her neighbors are chanting and she is being raped by the devil.From this point on, Rosemary's Baby takes an interesting turn.Soon after finding out she is pregnant, The Castevet's recommend Dr. Saperstein (Ralph Bellamy). Later, she starts having pains that increase and she is eating raw meat. Her friend Hutch falls into a mysterious coma after looking into info about her helpful neighbors, and Guy seems to not look at her.She also begins to suspect that her smothering neighbors are a little too interested in her baby. And soon she finds out that her neighbors are witches. Are her fears genuine, or are they caused by what Guy calls 'Prepartum Crazies?' All of the performances are stellar, especially Gordon (Who won an Oscar). I guess my only beef with the film involves actually seeing Rosemary's Baby (If you've read the book, then you get a really nice description), but maybe some things are best left to the viewer's vivid imagination.",10,4,6,31 July 2005
War of the Worlds," Spielberg's Vision of H.G. Wells Classic
","Kudos to Steven Spielberg! He has created, yet again, a science fiction classic!Working again with Tom Cruise, he creates a new spin on the H.G. Wells 1898 classic, updating it to post 9/11 society.Ray Ferrier(Cruise)is not an attentive father or husband. When his ex-wife (Miranda Otto)brings their 2 children over to stay with him while she's going away, his messy apartment and empty fridge shows his lack of caring. His son Robbie (Justin Chatwin)would rather steal his car and listen to his IPod than be there. His daughter Rachel (Dakota Fanning)is wise beyond her years and seems to try to tell her father just how to connect with his own son. Sounds like it's going to be a terrible weekend.Until the lightning strikes. To Ray, they seem cool, until they soon find out that these are not ordinary lightening strikes. With the strikes, everything goes out and nothing works at all: cars, watches, and cell phones included. One strike leaves a nice size hole in the center of town. But everyone soon discovers what's inside that hole: alien ships that have seemed to have been buried in the earth for a VERY long time. And they come with the sole purpose of wiping out humanity and taking over the Earth (You know, the typical Alien vs. Humans mantra). And they do so with a vengeance. When their beams hit people, they turn to ashes, their clothes floating into the air.Soon, Ray and his kids are on the run in the only working vehicle, trying to stay ahead of the alien ships.This film has a lot of 9/11 references (floating clothes and papers, ash-covered people, signs of the missing). Robbie's reaction to the invasion is not unlike the reaction of those after 9/11: a determination to go to war against the enemy that has caused death and destruction to his world. Tim Robbins brief role mirrors those who will defend their world at any cost, even if their methods border on paranoia.The look of the alien ships are faithful to Wells' word, a massive tripod with heat rays. And the sound that they make will send shivers up and down the spine.John Williams's score is incredible (And a compliment to Spielberg, as always). One of the must-sees of the year.",10,4,7,7 July 2005

Coaxed by Jeremy for one last bit of fun, the crash the wedding of the daughter of William Cleary (Christopher Walken)a politician.

To make matters even worse, John has fallen head over heels with Claire, who is engaged to Zack (Bradley Cooper), a real jerk that has a controlling nature.Even though it is predictable (It would only be a matter of time when their cover is blown), it more than makes up by how the predictability is turned on its ear.All the performances by the cast is funny, especially Vaughn, who pretty much steals the film from everyone. Even better is Will Ferrell in a small role as Chazz, the man who gave the boys their start (And now does his act at funerals!). Interesting cameos also by Senator John McCain and James Carville).",10,2,4,6 November 2005
Army of Darkness," An interesting end to the trilogy
","'Army of Darkness' starts with poor Ash (Bruce Campbell again), being carted off as a slave. He explains what got him in this mess. Him and his girlfriend Linda (Bridget Fonda) travel to a deserted cabin, where they find The Book Of The Dead and a tape recorder. Playing the recording releases the evil that lives in the forest, which takes Linda and possesses Ash's hand, which he cuts off. Skipping the main story of the 2nd film, Ash is pulled into a vortex and ends up in 1300 A.D. The people, especially Sheila (Embeth Davidtz), distrust him right away and throw him into a pit, where he defeats a monster. Proving his worth, they send him on a quest: to retrieve the Book of The Dead, which can send him back to his own time and help them defeat evil. Through Ash's bungling, he releases the Army of Darkness, lead by his evil twin, which soon kidnaps Sheila and plans on conquering the town people.An interesting end to the series. There's no graphic violence as in the previous 2 films of the series (Although there is some light scares in it), and is heavy on laughs (Lots of Three Stooges references), and uses interesting references (Any fan of 'The Day The Earth Stood Still' would pick up on the words that Ash uses). This is the tamer of the trilogy. The saving grace of course is Campbell, who seems to enjoy playing the punching bag in these films.",8,2,4,13 June 2005
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Oldman Breaks Your Heart
","'Bram Stoker's Dracula' is as close to the novel that we'll ever get. Under the direction of Francis Ford Coppola, we are given an interesting twist to the story and a motivating factor as to why Dracula became what he was.The film opens with Dracula (Gary Oldman) about to go into battle against the Turks. His wife Elizabeta (Winona Ryder) fears for his life, knowing that there's a good possibility that he won't come back from this battle. We witness Vlad the Impaler on the job (in an interesting use of shadows, by the way), striking down his enemies in the name of God. However, his devotion to God turns nasty when he returns home to find his wife dead (She threw herself into the river because of a phony message from the Turks saying that her hubby was dead). Knowing that suicide is against God's law and that she will be damned, Vlad isn't a happy camper. And he shows it by denouncing God and cursing himself in the process, refusing to serve the God that had betrayed him.The next thing we know, 400 years has passed, and Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves) kisses his fiancé Mina Murray (Ryder again) goodbye, heading to Transylvania to do business with Count Dracula. Harker doesn't even care much that previous real estate agent, Renfield (Tom Waits), went insane and is now locked up in the loony bin, eating lots of bugs.Harker's trip is strange (wolves, blue flames, creepy coach driver) and his stay at Castle Dracula doesn't make things easier: watching a potential client leave the castle by scaling down a wall will do that to a person). Plus, Dracula's brides make a play for him (Oh yes, a LOT of sexuality is in this film).Mina during this time is staying with her childhood (and wealthy)friend Lucy (Sadie Frost). Lucy is pursued by 3 prominent men: Quincy Morris (Bill Campbell),Dr.Jack Seward (Richard E. Grant) and Lord Arthur Holmwood (Cary Elwes). But it seems that Dracula wants to have a little taste of Lucy as well, practically raping her in the form of a wolf when he arrives in England. His sole purpose is to get with Mina, who is the spitting image of his late wife. However, with the arrival of Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins, who seems to still have a little bit of Hannibal Lecter trapped inside of him) and Jonathan's escape, things get a bit complicated.I absolutely adore this film (except for one thing that I will later explain). The music by Wojciech Kilar is haunting (My favorite piece is 'The Brides.') and the costumes by Japanese designer Eiko Ishioka is incredible (And won a deserved Oscar for her work). And the craft-work of Coppola shows throughout the film.The cast is excellent, with one exception: Keanu Reeves. Although it seems that he is really trying, he keeps slipping in and out of his English accent as badly as Kevin Costner's in 'Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.' But it is Oldman as Dracula that shines. Dracula truly loves Mina. When Mina leaves to reunite with Jonathan, Dracula's emotions tore at the heart. After all, how many of us were broken up when the girl (Or guy)of your dreams dumped you for someone that isn't as cool as you? (Come on, Jonathan was as stale as year old crackers). The scene when Mina finds out the truth about Dracula is just as heartbreaking. Despite what he has done, she still loves him. Dracula loves her, but doesn't want to subject her to his fate ('I love you too much to condemn you' he cries). Her answer is priceless: 'Then take me away from all this death.' Even though this may be classified as a horror film (After all, stakes and be-headings happen a lot in the film), the heart of the film is the love story. Who hasn't done something incredibly stupid for love?",9,1,3,22 December 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Ends In A Bang! (Spoilers, are they!)
","'Revenge of The Sith' is a welcome reward for the countless fans that had to sit through the garbage that was 'The Phantom Menance' and 'Attack Of The Clones.' From the moment the music explodes on the screen, the moviegoer is immediately drawn into the story by a single word: 'war!' A HUGE battle is going on among the stars and we see Obi Wan (Ewan McGregor)and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen)are on a mission to save Senator Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid)from General Grievous. Once that's done, Anakin is reunited with Padme(Natalie Portman), his secret wife, who announces her pregnancy.Then, things start to get dark.Anakin has dreams of Padme dying in childbirth. He is ordered by the Jedi Council to to watch the Senator, who they suspect is shady. Feeling ignored by the Jedi Council, and fearing for the safety of Padme, he is ripe for manipulation. With promises of power over life and death, and convinced on the evils of the Jedi Council, Anakin takes the steps toward the dark side.Anakin Skywalker's transformation into Darth Vader begins.This film is action packed, from start to finish. It is a very visual film. Your eyes suck in everything from start to finish.Best scenes: 1) The opening battle. So many ships and explosions as Obi Wan And Anakin race to save the Senator. Once they are on the ship, they have to deal with droids, Grievous, Count Dooku (Christopher Lee, whose role resembled a cameo), and crashing ships.2) Obi Wan and Grievous fighting. Obi's 1 light saber to Grievous's 4! 3) Senator Palpatine and Mace Windu's Battle: 2 things of importance happens here: you understand why the Emperor looks the way he does, and you see the defining moment when Anakin becomes Darth Vader. Anakin's actions leads him to the point of no return.4) Plan 66: The moment that this is taken into effect, the film really turns dark. The Jedis are slaughtered (With the exception of Yoda and Obi Wan, of course). Watching Anakin/Vader marching into the temple, knowing what he is about to do sent shivers down my spine.5) The battles: You alternate between Palpatine/Yoda and Obi Wan/Anankin. With John Williams's wonderful 'Duel Of The Fates' playing in the background, you know that fate is about to take place: The destruction of the Republic and Anakin, and the birth of The Emperor and Darth Vader.Finally, the defining moment: The birth of Leia and Luke, and the first breaths and voice of Darth Vader (Welcome back, James Earl Jones, we missed you!). You finally understand why Darth Vader is how he is. Like Faust, Anakin sold his soul to the devil (Palpatine)for love. And the price was incredibly high.Thanks to George Lucas for finally giving us the film that we wanted.",10,4,17,1 June 2005
Ray," Excellent and Connvincing Performance By Jamie Foxx
","From the moment 'Ray' begins, you get so caught up in Jamie Foxx's award-winning performance you forget that he is playing the late, great Ray Charles instead of him being Ray Charles. Charles is a musical genius that is haunted by the drowning death of his little brother. As his fame takes him to new highs, his life is spiraling out of control. He constantly cheats on his devoted wife (Kerry Washington) with back up singers, among them Margie Hendricks (Regina King). Also, his dependency on heroin threatens to take away his freedom.All of the actors, especially Foxx, did an incredibly fine job and director Taylor Hackford should be congratulated for not giving up when others turned him down.",10,1,2,25 March 2005
Halloween," The Night William Shatner Came Home
","'Halloween,' the classic bogeyman thriller directed by John Carpenter, still has the ability to play on the fears of babysitters and children 20 plus years since it was first released.When the film starts, we see a young girl being stabbed to death by someone in a clown mask just after she had sex with her boyfriend on Halloween night. We soon learn that the murderer was 6 year old Michael Myers, her own brother. Years later, Michael escapes from the mental institution where he was being held and heads back to his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois. Wearing a mask (Actually a altered William Shatner mask), Michael is on a new mission to kill and terrorize his hometown. On his maniacal radar is Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), who is babysitting 2 kids that night while her 2 friends (Nancy Loomis and P.J. Soles)have dates. Her two friends end up dead, and Michael is on the hunt for Laurie. But Michael's doctor, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence)is on the hunt for him, knowing Michael for the monster he really is.Everything in this film works. All the performances are spectacular, especially Curtis, whose portrayal of Laurie got the crown of 'Scream Queen', and Pleasence as Loomis (A play on a character in 'Psycho,' which starred her mother, Janet Leigh). But it is Michael in the William Shatner mask that makes the deeper impression.",10,0,1,23 August 2005
Blade Runner," The Final Cut is Worth Another Look
","For a time, I thought that The Director's cut was the best. The original theatrical version with the narration by Harrison Ford, who plays Decker, sounded a bit like Ford was unhappy and bored. Plus, the 'happy ending' didn't wash at all with me. And I let the original review stand.Until I recently saw The Final Cut. This was just so incredibly beautiful! I've watched it again and again over the past few weeks.It is 2019 Los Angeles, which resembles a mix of Asian culture and Detroit factories. A group of replicants, led by Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), are on Earth. Since they are illegal on Earth, they are tracked down by Decker (Ford), a 'blade runner,' whose job is to 'retire' (Clean way of saying execute)replicants. Replicants are sort of hard to detect because they look and act human. But they have one flaw: they only last a few years. Batty wants more time and seeks out his creator, Tyrell, to demand more time. Meanwhile, Decker is intrigued by Rachel (Sean Young, looking very beautiful), who is one of Tyrell's creations and has no conception of being a replicant.The final cut fixed a few errors in the original version, and added bonus footage, giving the film an even more impressive look.Finally the intriguing question that the film raises: is Decker himself a replicant? The dream sequence and the gift that Gaff (Edward James Olmos)leaves at the end of the film would suggest that this is a possibility (My personal feeling is that he is), but then, this would lead to even more questions, wouldn't it? It's a visually stunning film (You sort of get caught up in the scenery)and the music by Vangelis is even more stunning. It's amazing how the Final Cut looks with the latest technological breakthroughs. It's worth the look.",10,0,1,2 April 2005
X2: X-Men United," Superior To The Original
","'X2'(Or 'X Men 2')is one of those rarities in which the sequel surpasses the original. After an attempt on the President's life by a mutant, a war between humans and mutants is on the verge. Stoking the flames of hatred is General Stryker, who uses the situation to forge ahead with his own agenda: the total annihilation of the mutant species. This film is much darker than the first film (Jean Grey's increasing powers, Cerebro being used for a weapon of mass destruction against the humans AND mutants). Ian McKellan almost steals the film (Favorite line? Before he disposes of a guard in his plastic prison,with the help of Mystique, he says 'Mr. Laurio, never trust a beautiful woman, especially one that is interested in you.'). However, it is Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler and Kelly Hu as Deathstrike that pretty much take the film.",9,0,0,28 January 2005
The Sixth Sense," The Infamous Twist of M. Night Shyamalan
","'The Sixth Sense,' introduced the world to M.Night Shyamalan and his infamous twist. You know the kind: where you are still sitting in your seat for moments, shaking your head and wondering how you couldn't see it coming.The film starts with Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis),a child psychologist who is celebrating with his wife Anna (Olivia Williams)on winning an award. Their celebration is cut short when Malcolm is shot by Vincent (Donnie Wahlberg, in a creepy performance), who accuses him of failing him and turning him into a freak.Sometime later, a disillusioned Malcolm meets Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who seems to have some problems of his own. From one point of view, he is seen as a disturbed kid (cuts and bruises, and disturbing drawings). However, we soon discover the reason behind his behavior: He sees dead people (One of the most quoted lines in film history here!). He is terrified by what he sees (especially when the people he sees have died violent deaths)and doesn't know how to handle it. He can't even explain what is going on to his mother Lynn (Toni Collette), who is trying desperately to help him.For a while, Malcolm has his doubts. And his relationship with his wife since the shooting has gone downhill, but after listening to an old therapy tape with young Vincent, he begins to believe Cole.With his help, Cole learns how to deal with his gift and to help others. By the end of the film, Cole communicates his secret to his mother and Malcolm communicates with his wife, but when this is done, lives will be changed forever. And both scenes are so incredibly powerful: Cole's conversation with his mother brings me to tears, and you can see the weight life off him when he shares his secret to his Mother.And this is the moment when you are still sitting in the chair, shaking your head in total amazement.This is an excellent psychological horror film and all of the performances (Especially Osment)are incredible. You get scared and teary eyed at the same time.",10,1,1,1 August 2005
Final Destination," Don't Watch This Before Your Flight!
","******POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!!******'Final Destination' is surprisingly good and rather graphic. The first few minutes grab you and won't let go. Alex and his classmates are on a trip to Paris. Suddenly, he gets a vision of the plane crashing. After he gets kicked off the plane, along with several other students and a teacher, they witnessed the plane exploding. Soon after the crash, the remaining survivors are soon killed off one by one. The reason? Seems that Death is a spoiled sport. First of all, if you plan on taking a flight to anywhere, you might not want to see this if you haven't already. Second, there is a LOT of graphic deaths in this film (A particular death involving a bus is a shocker). Some of the plot is a bit thin, but there is a lot of recurring themes (The use of music by John Denver, who died in a plane crash is very creepy). Some of the deaths are creative and the plane crash sequence is incredible. They've made a sequel (And there are plans for a third), but stick to this version instead.This is a pretty good film and worth a watch on a Saturday night.",8,0,2,25 December 2003
The Truman Show," Truman's Adventures in TV Land
","When we first meet Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey), he just seems like and ordinary, chipper guy, living an ordinary life. Married to the beautiful Meryl (Laura Linney)he seems to be just fine.But as he leaves for work, a piece of lighting equipment falls from a clear blue sky. You soon realize that Truman's life is far from fine.And that is the premise of 'The Truman Show,' directed by Peter Weir. Truman wants to leave his town of Seahaven and see the world, but he slowly realizes that the town doesn't want him to leave. And with good reason. He is the star of an incredibly popular worldwide show, only he doesn't know this.His whole life, from womb to man, has been televised. Created by Christof (Ed Harris), the town people (Including his wife and parents)are actors, each one of them manipulating Truman's emotions and responses. Christof even creates a way to keep Truman from leaving: His 'father' died in a boating accident, causing young Truman to be afraid of water.But as much as Christof can try to control Truman, he fails. Truman becomes rebellious, trying desperately to escape his existence. More importantly, he is in love with a girl named Lauren(Natascha McElhone), who he met in school, but was taken away (She tried to tell Truman the truth).In one of the film's most dramatic scenes, Truman has escaped the town by sailboat, conquering his fear of the water. Christof, playing God to the end, calls upon the elements to stop him (sun, storms,lightning), trying to crush the very thing that he created. When Truman reaches the end of the line (In the form of a sky blue wall), Christof speaks to him from the sky as like the voice of God, trying to coax him to remain.In a world in which every network has at least 1 reality television show, 'The Truman Show' is not as effective as when it was first released. However, you may say that the film may have brought home the point that we as viewers are fascinated with watching someone else's life unfold in front of our eyes.Carrey's performance is incredible, clearly showing he has dramatic range. It's too bad that he can't do this more often, but audiences prefer him to make them laugh instead.For the longest, I had a huge beef with the way it ended, in which Truman walks through the door and out of the show forever. I had wished they could have shown us what would happen after he left. However, I finally understood why they did not. Truman had been trapped by fear (the fear of water, for example). When Christof talks to Truman, trying to convince him to stay, he tells Truman that the world he is about to enter is different from the world he is leaving: the real world is full of lies, deceit and horrors. Truman's world is a place where none of those fears exist. When Truman steps through the door, going into the real world, you realize that Truman has truly conquered his fears after all. He steps into this brave new world, unafraid of what will happen to him. Still, it would have been nice for us to see him reunite with Lauren/Sylvia. But deep down, you know that they will. Great film to watch.",9,1,2,1 August 2005
Ran," Incredibly Visual Masterpiece
","By the end of his life, Akira Kurasawa was losing his sight. However, like Beethoven when he was going deaf created beautiful music, Kurasawa created beautiful cinematic imagery.Such is the case with 'Ran,' Kurasawa's version of King Lear with a samurai spin. The use of colors is absolutely magnificent.Lord Hidetora Ichimonji (Tatsuya Nakadai)wants to spend his remaining days in peace and comfort and gives his three sons his kingdom, hoping to be welcomed as a guest. Even though his 2 older sons tell him everything he wants to hear, his youngest displeases him by telling him that he's making a mistake, that his 2 brothers would say anything to get what they want from him. Angry and hurt, he banishes his younger son and gives his kingdom to the 2 remaining sons.And this is where things go to hell.Lord Hidetora realizes that everything that his youngest son told him was true: His older sons not only treat him with an appalling lack of respect, but they conspire to take everything from him. This drives Hidetora to madness and sets off a chain of events in which Hidetora's past and present collide, leading to war between those involved.The scene in which Hidetora, slipping into madness as his kingdom is taken from him, flames surrounding him, is incredibly haunting.The battle scenes are so incredible, that you can't take your eyes from the screen, even to blink.For those who haven't seen any of Kurasawa's films, or haven't gotten into Shakespeare, then this is the film to start with. Even after over 20 years, the film has not lost any of its impact. Highly recommended.",10,4,9,14 April 2007
Jackie Brown," Grier and Forster Shine in Tarantino's Flick
","'Jackie Brown,' which is Quentin Tarantino's 3rd flick, pays tribute to 70's blackploitation films, even using 70's queen Pam Grier in the title role.Grier plays Jackie Brown, a 40-ish airline stewardess who works for a crappy airline service. She also runs money from Cabo to the states for Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson), a shady dude that sells guns. She soon gets busted by ATF Agent Ray Nicollete (Michael Keaton). It seems that one of Ordell's associates, Beaumont (Chris Tucker)dropped her name to get out of an arrest of his own. Knowing that Ordell will kill her (Like he killed Beaumont after he bailed him out), Jackie uses her skills to outsmart him.With the help of Max Cherry, the bail bondsman that picked her up from jail (Robert Forster), she plans on stealing Ordell's money (a total of $500,000)from under him and the feds. However, Ordell's girlfriend Melanie (Bridget Fonda)also wants the money, trying to get Ordell's friend Louis (Robert DeNiro)in on the deal. And so the game is on, with half a million dollars up for grabs.Tarantino has created a great movie. Those familiar with blaxploitation and 70's movies will really get something out of it. All of the performances are great (And Jackson excellent as always). However, it is Grier and Forster who really shine. The scene in which Max is waiting at the jail to pick up Jackie is a prime example: As she walks toward him, fresh out of jail, you can see the exact moment when Max falls for her. And falls HARD. Tarantino's use of music is also key: Max plays 'Didn't I Blow Your Mind This Time' over and over because he first heard it while having coffee with Jackie. A sure sign that Max is intrigued with her. By the end of the film, you want them to get together. They are just such a sweet couple! Even if you're not a Tarantino fan, you will still love this film. A must have.",10,1,3,19 November 2005
Sin City," Nasty Noir
","Frank Miller's 'Sin City' is a series of graphic novels which revolves around the inhabitants of Basin City, a cold and murky city in which law and order barely exists, and violence is an acceptable way of life.Under the direction of Robert Rodriguez (With Miller and 'Special Guest' Quentin Tarrantino on board as well), 'Sin City' has been perfectly adapted from page to screen, with a cast of actors that amaze as much as the colors and scenery.There are 3 stories in the film, but each one connected in its own way.1) This story, which is the longest of the 3, centers around Marv (Mickey Rourke), a not-so-handsome brute whose fling with a woman named Goldie (Jaime King)ends with her winding up dead and Marv on a bloody path to vengeance, which leads to (Kevin) Elijah Wood, a silent-but-deadly guy that has a peculiar diet.2)Dwight (Clive Owen)helps the ladies of Sin City when a hero cop he accidentally bumps off (Benicio Del Toro)becomes more trouble dead than alive. With the help of Gail (Rosario Dawson)and Miho (Devon Aoki), Dwight has to fight the gangsters that want to take over the ladies' territory, Manute (Michael Clarke Duncan)in particular.3)Hartigan (Bruce Willis)is a soon-to-retire cop (Heart problems)that is determined to solve a case involving Roark Jr. (Nick Stahl), the insane son of Senator Roark (Powers Boothe), a corrupt politician. Hartigan saves a little girl named Nancy from him, but his career is destroyed in the process. Roark Sr., bent on revenge, makes sure that Hartigan is imprisoned for crimes he didn't commit. Hartigan, knowing that Nancy will be killed if he reveals the truth, stays silent. When he is released, he must save Nancy (Jessica Alba) from Yellow Bastard, who is determined to make Nancy scream.The film is a nasty bit of noir: deep and rough narrations,incredibly brutal violence, sexy women that can hold their own against anyone,and bare flesh. Although the film is black and white, there are scenes where color seems to burst through, practically glowing.This is not a good one for the kids, so you might want to avoid letting them see this",10,1,3,29 November 2005
Evil Dead II," Another Walk Into The Woods
","'Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn' sort of re-creates the first one (Because they couldn't get the rights to the first one, they had to do it this way). Ash and his girlfriend Linda go to the cabin and find the Book of The Dead and the tape recorder left by Professor Knowby. Playing the tape, the evil is unleashed and Linda is soon possessed by the demons. Ash ends up killing her, but he soon becomes possessed by the evil and has to cut off his hand. Meanwhile, the cabin has some company in the form of Annie, the professor's daughter, their assistant and 2 country folks. Soon, they become trapped by the evil in the forest, as well as Annie's mother, now possessed, who is down in the cellar.The second entry in the series is not as graphic as the first(One unfortunate soul ends up swallowing a flying eyeball), and plays it mostly for laughs (Groovy!). Consider it 'horror lite.' Still, it is a good follow up to the original. The ending, of course, leaves the possibility of a sequel (See 'Army Of Darkness.').",9,2,3,13 June 2005
