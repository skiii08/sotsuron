The Legend of Bagger Vance," Redford shows his best
","I was attracted to 'The Legend of Bagger Vance' because I had heard Will Smith had done a nice acting job it in.  I was more than impressed.  Will Smith, along with Matt Damon and J. Michael Moncrief, worked wonders with their roles and made this film a real winner.  The film made the sport come alive even to those, like me, who aren't really that big of fans.  I was very impressed with Robert Redford in his director's role.  The script was interesting and it had plenty of funny and warm scenes.  The combination made it a film that my whole family enjoyed (which can be a very difficult task).  I would definately recommend this film for viewers of all ages!",10,0,1,27 April 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Pure Intensity - not a disappointment
","There was a lot riding on this movie, and I set myself up for a potentially huge disappointment - but George Lucas didn't let me down.  From the first to the last minute, I was in a trance over the film (which I saw in it's digital format).  It was very intense at times, and it had the most intense battle scenes that I've seen in the Star Wars series.  There were lots of twists and many surprises that really added to the film.  I was stunned when I first read paper reviews of the movie that gave it low ratings.  With so much hype I think the reviewers were just sippin' on the haterade just wanting to call it a flop.  Whatever - Star Wars is cashing in again - with a grand performance.",10,0,0,24 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Stunning performance!
","The Fellowship of the Ring was an intense 3 hour ride through the world of J.R.R. Tolkien!  The movie didn't skimp on Tolkien's actual work, and the brilliance of the filming and acting helping to give a true portrayl of Middle Earth as J.R.R. Tolkien might have imagined it.  This is by far one of the greatest films that I've ever seen.",10,0,0,20 December 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," Great fight scenes interupted by a bad movie
","Like most viewers of the film, I was absolutely awed by the intense fight scenes in the movie.  Unlike some, I was not really bothered by certain fight moves looking fake or anything like that.  I felt they were beautifully produced, and the result was outstanding.  Unfortunately the few great scenes were interupted by an annoying little thing called the rest of the movie.  Hardly ever have I seen such pointless dialouge go on and on and on.  There was simply too much talking, and not enough plot variation.My three issues with the movie were the following - 1) A highly random dance scene, which looked like some sort of hip-hop music video (in the mud) placed in the center of a rather serious/intelligent action movie.  Cool for a video, but misplaced in the movie. 2) too much talking for a movie of this sort 3) the last 20 minute of the film felt like it was being fastforwarded.  I felt that they spent way too much time on the first couple hours, and then tried to cut down the last section of the movie which to me was the most interesting.
A decent attempt at a sequel for Matrix, but it failed in too many department for me to give it a good score.  4/10 for great fight scenes, nothing else.",4,0,0,24 June 2003
