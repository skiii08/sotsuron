The Devil's Advocate," A very well executed film with interesting ideas and themes.
","I thoroughly enjoyed this film as an artistic view on the dark side of humanity. It explored themes of morality and temptation and free will. Keanu Reeves plays Kevin, a successful lawyer that's never lost a case that is offered a job at a powerful firm in New York, Charlize Theron plays his wife Mary Ann, and Al Pacino plays Kevin's boss and mentor who is revealed to actually be his father and Satan himself.The more successful Kevin gets, the more he tends to end up abandon his wife. The film brings the idea that we are tempted by Satan to commit evil acts. But he doesn't control us and make us do these things, rather he tempts us with promises of whatever we desire, or whispers ideas into our heads and we do evil things in reaction and of our free will. Which I found to be a powerful message. The idea of the big, cold New York City being the 'devil's land' or 'the city of Babylon' was a nice touch.People may have a problem with the nudity, but I was fine with it. It was an important part of the story. The female body and sex is shown to be another aspect of temptation.So the whole point of the movie is, the devil exists and pushes humanity to do whatever we want for our own selfish desires, but at the end of the day what we do is all of free will. We have free will to give in to the temptations, just as we have the free will to resist and try and stay as morally good as we can.My only problem with this film is Keanu Reeves. He was very good in this film, its just emotion was needed in a few scenes. Especially the death of his wife. He is crying and screaming as she dies in front of him, yet the very next scene he is walking down the hallway with his emotionless face and mono tone voice again. Dude, your wife just died. I would still be in a little moment of shock and sadness. I would just break down in tears a little here and there as it hits me over and over that my wife is dead, my voice would be in different tones. Nope, he is back into the usual emotion again, with barely any sadness under his monotone voice and facial expressions.Other than that, Al Pacino is amazing, Charlize Theron is also good. A very good entertaining flick, with a dark atmosphere and a powerful message on the deep root of evil in humanity.",8,0,1,22 October 2017
Suicide Squad," An entertaining but messy film
","I was super excited to see this movie, only to be disappointed. The good things about this movie are the portrayals of Deadshot, Harley Quinn and El Diablo. They were the highlight characters of the movie and the only ones given the spotlight. Well except El Diablo. I loved the humanity of Deadshot and the insanity of Harley Quinn. The action sequences were quite good. Only good. That's pretty much the only good things.There are many bad things about this movie, and we'll start with characters and writing. Deadshot, Harley, El Diablo and the Joker are the only characters that I genuinely liked. Some of the others were useless to the plot and are given no character development.Enchantress was a horrible choice as the villain, she should have stayed as part of the squad. The plot of the film is the squad being sent out to stop Enchantress from wrecking havoc in the middle of the city as she is busy making a weapon that will be used to wipe out mankind. No reason, no good enough reason on why. The reason Enchantress is a horrible choice is because she is an all-powerful witch with godlike powers. Considering how powerful she is, she is an unrealistic villain against the squad. Only El Diablo realistically had any chance against her. Had a better mission been chosen against a villain that could actually be taken down from this squad, this movie could've been better.Joker was also a disappointment. I like the modern gangster take on him, but that's all he is in this movie. He isn't insane enough, and a force of chaos. Just a love sick gangster. His relationship with Harley also should've been a bit more abusive. His subplot in the film wasn't needed. Taking Joker out of the film, and keeping him in the flashbacks could've given more time on fleshing out the other characters. Hope they do better with Joker's character in future films.The first half although better than the second, spent too much time explaining backstories of some of the characters through flashbacks. Bad characters, boring plot, wrong choice of villain and many writing and editing problems, rather than focusing on the squad working together and letting them be criminals who save the world by doing bad things for the government.Other than that, an entertaining film but just a mess.",6,1,3,13 August 2016
