"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Nice movie, breezy I would say
","Nice movie, breezy I would say. The music was very inspiring and well chosen, it completed the British atmosphere. Hank Azaria plays the American jerk very well, on a totally opposite role than, let's say, the professor from Friends, and the marathon scenes kept the audience tense, waiting to see the outcome of the situation, since it didn't seem clear if the movie would make a turn in the plot or not. Loved Dylan Moran, the same mad genius as always, in fact found out about the movie looking for things he had starred in. Together with Harish Patel, the guys form a nice buddies group. Thandie Newton had a somehow decorative role, but she fits in nicely, and the kid is funny, and at that moment had funny teeth:) Light family movie for a Sunday afternoon or so. Liked it.",Null,0,1,17 October 2010
Source Code," This movie is good...
","...even though it is unclear if it is good by intent or by incidence.The best part was the reversed Nirvana, in which the better for a soul being would be not to completely cease existing, but to remain forever inserted in a reality as created by his best dreams. The scope is not to rid oneself from all attachments, but to unify the source with the best particular manifestation of those.Great! As for the soldier twisted plot, i do not see it as the centre idea, maybe if we shift the soldier term to the less material idea that in a way we are all soldiers, but somehow it is unclear in which army:). but I'd rather leave that alone, it seems nonessential and somehow propagandistic compared to the other part, about how we live our lives and how we could actually live them, maybe...'Everything is gonna be OK'",Null,0,1,14 June 2011
Bridesmaids," Finally I laughed as I used to do at comedies in my childhood
","Definitely, people nowadays are growing more and more different and apart; otherwise I couldn't explain why this movie has so contrasting reviews on IMDb whilst other movies tend to polarise the opinions. I found myself wondering how do those who hated it look or feel or think - maybe it would have been useful if they had offered examples of what they consider good comedies... Or maybe it's just the people involved in the movie that provoked the rebellious reactions? I did not know who directed the movie or that Kristen Wii is a SNL regular. And I enjoyed the movie as it was, not very elaborated but alive, kind in a surprising way. A zillion kudos to Kristen Wiig - I for one loved her character! Brought a lot of optimism and compassion in a world obsessed with perfection, rules, the right look, relationship, job...the right everything. The gross moments did not seem artificial, one could laugh at them shamelessly because the action slowly build up to them. And they were decent, I've seen comedies with out of order icky situations and it did not feel that bad way here. The character is great: we have a loser who cannot stop herself from saying the most daring truths in the face of strangers or friends and who can accept herself and go on with her life as it is, even when things go from bad to worse. Oh, I miss the times when people like this roamed free, and they were not relaxed only if they were stupid enough not to realise how inadequate they were!The others are also good, kinda cooky but still plausible. I know: in a particular way, the movie manages to be innocent, fresh, childish. Which is rare nowadays. Maybe I was heat struck (the negative reviews really made me wonder), but it sure felt that way to us. I recommend watching it free of analysis, comparisons and antipathies.",Null,2,4,13 September 2011
The Adjustment Bureau," A movie who wanted much, but settled for less
","I guess casting is for the viewer like naming a new baby for the persons who meet the baby: one cant's compare what it sees to what might have been. The movie it is what it is with these here actors. But this movie just gave me the feeling of bad casting. The actors are too sturdy, too... something for their parts. Maybe it's the subject's fault, all that talking about adjustment made me wonder how would it have been if someone would have adjusted the cast.Besides this sensation, the idea is interesting, yet it fails to create an atmosphere, an universe. Matrix had that, for example. There are no important buildings, places, landscapes that would fix the cornerstones of such an universe. It's a miss.I also resented the sharing of human history in slices, out of which some were watched by these agents, others not. Sounded too manipulative, why assume again that the humans by themselves are bad and only guided by mysterious others can be better? Why not the other way, since it's fiction? The bad humans idea is so used that it's all worn out...I cannot compare it with the written story(never read it), so I will not judge the book from 1954, but the movie from 2011. And for this age, the ending is also a fail: announcing the winners like in a game show, talking about fighting for the free will, it's all so old and corny.We have the 'fabric of our universe' idea, the 'guardians' or 'watchers' idea, the multiple choice destiny idea, not many of them logically explained, even in a fictional way.And what's with the hats? We have them at René Magritte, we have them in Fringe..now here. Anybody care to explain more about the hats obsession or symbolism? These being said, I had the impression of a movie who wanted much, but settled for less.",Null,1,2,24 March 2011
Rio," The colours are only the painted ones
","The movie is a colourful one, but unfortunately not in a metaphoric manner. The only excitement remains in the shades of blue, red and so on taken from real life jungle birds. And it is watchable, one can give it that, but also forgettable.The action is cliché-istic, the idea of fear of flight was used for penguins and reindeer, and the plot to make it fit for a parrot is a bit forced. The humans are the geeky boring figures that seem to come most handy to the scriptwriters lately. The bullied child, or the fat child, and the mature geek...haven't we had enough of that? It does transmit the idea of love, sort of, maybe even coin a tear on this subject to some more sensitive viewers, but bearing in mind that it is hardly a movie for adults, what is this intoxicating children with love stories that actually happen much later in life? Do not take this for a prude affirmation, but rather as one pointing out that new good ideas are hard to find, as it seems.Plus, what could have saved the movie wasn't there. They placed everything in an exotic country, but the atmosphere is lacking. It is as if they read some tourist leaflets and put them into the picture. Let's throw in some smugglers figures, some famous statue, a busy local market and a beautiful rich residence area...that will do it! The samba was, as one character said, boring, because it felt like old and recycled. The carnival of Rio was all over the place, yet it did not seem to be 'there'. If they went cliché-istic, for example, why didn't the girl dance on top of the carnival cart, but came down and produced a stumbled ballet that went away almost unnoticed? The parrot (Blue - what a creative name, btw), was cute as a baby parrot, parrot-y as an adult and the humans dressed up as parrots were freaky:). The aftertaste of this animation is that of a spineless one, but then, a lot of those have seemed to meet the ovation of the critics and most of the public in the last year, so nothing new here too. So far this year I liked Gnomeo and Juliet more that this.",Null,0,0,9 May 2011
Inception," Something is missing...
","Call me 'dumb', I do not care, because I have my own mind and experience and I know by now that I am not. My only reserve is that maybe I should see it twice, or that this is not the moment for me to have seen it( As is with reading books, today one can't stand it , tomorrow it makes perfect sense). Apart from this, a movie being an experience destined to consume itself at the maximum in one 'kick', after this Inception experience, I feel that something is really missing here. What is the idea of this movie? What is it trying to express? In what system of beliefs is all this taking place? Because, apart from the famous cast, the good performances, the special effects that are everywhere and the incessant and disturbing gun noises, I do not see what am I supposed to get enriched with through watching this movie? OK, the idea of conscious dreaming is centuries-old, so is the idea of 'staging' the life or the universe(no need to mention the link to Matrix, etc), but who would be the 'dreamer' if we extrapolated to our lives? Because the thought of a world meant just for corporations and 'important' individuals, I do not like. So, in a person's life, any person, how are the Inception ideas fitting in? Are we to look and see who 'dreams' for us, and the movie couldn't put this idea bluntly? Are we dealing with an explanation for wave function collapse, controlled consciously by some skilled to do so and implementing during our sleep? I feel the need to say, 'please explain yourself'. One cannot mount such a giant of a movie (publicity, effects, cast and so), and in the end leave you with a bigger blur than before such ideas occurred. I would say it is either a case of snobbish commercialism that is not backed up by enough understanding and research, or a case of intricate mind and ideas that have no clarity in expressing themselves. It is an exercise for the brain, I give it that. But in the light of too much gratuitous violence, too less contoured universe of the movie, too crowded action, too soapy emotional effects (the passed away wife, the uncommunicative rich father) and too high praise that it deserves (c'mon, this is the new Matrix? Are we going back as the time goes by?, I feel deeply not pleased.",Null,28,52,1 November 2010
Rango," Hideous western spoof
","Amidst the other ugly animated characters of this movie, Rango, the self-made hero of the 'west' almost looks less crocked and annoying.The fake hero plot is old, we've seen it in animated movies too, like Chicken Run. The liar with a potential good heart returns to save the city...The rotten leader who sells out his people is not a bright and blossomy idea either, only in this here movie, we have the tortoise, usually an animal of wisdom, representing the corrupted character, in a rather uninspired association made out of negligence or just to avoid a more clicheistic animal.The rest of the fauna is not so detailed, but they are all an ugly bunch, even the hero's girl is one uninspired piece of animation. The humour is as dry as the desert, the western genre a bad choice, are they trying to revive it or what? The music certainly is reviving a lot of previously heard vibes. The violence is present, in the dialogues as well as all the killing, fighting and frightening stories of the West. The rattle snake is so horrible that it suffices to make the kids have nightmares for at least one year. The movie should have a warning that specifies it will introduce such ugly images.Hated it and even more hated it for the viral early promos which falsely gave the impression of a nice retro-themed movie, with a funny wacky chameleon. Well it is not, we can barely remember that Rango is a colour-changing lizard, it is not funny at all, not even wacky, more like lame mixed with ugly sad life enquiries like 'who am I?'I would answer to that: an animated chameleon in bad bad movie, sheriff.",Null,1,6,29 May 2011
