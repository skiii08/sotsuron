Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Damage control was done very well after the Last Jedi.
",I will admit I have been pretty put off by The Last Jedi for the last couple of years. I went into the theater with somewhat of a bad attitude but as a minutes went by I really started enjoying this movie. After I left I could honestly say this was a great movie considering how much damage control it had to do after Ryan Johnson's whole mess. I will say that this movie would have been a lot better if it didn't have to compensate for the mistakes of The Last Jedi but all of these one or two star reviews are a little cynical and a little much I think. You can kind of compare Star Wars Canon has become almost a religion too many people figuratively speaking of course but because there's such a high standard put up in everybody's mind it's very hard to put together something that everybody is going to love. I will say The Last Jedi was legitimately a bad movie but this film really makes up for that mistake. If you haven't seen this movie quite yet stop reading the reviews from cynical Star Wars nerds and just go judge it for yourself. I think they wrapped this up the best they could and I think they did a good job.,8,4,11,28 December 2019
