The Incredible Hulk," Liv Tyler Disappointing
","The movie was good... the action was 'Incredible', but I swear if I hadn't been there with friends I would have walked out. Liv Tyler is definitely the weak link in this film.I loved her in the LOTR's trilogy, but she completely blew this part. Jennifer Connally has her beat by a lot shot.Apparently they told Liv not to speak but to 'coo' and 'whisper' the lines and I've got to say that got old really fast! I think she screamed once or twice... the rest was the 'seductive coo' which really had no place in this film. It works for some parts... but not for the Betty Ross part. Connally had it down without making you gag.If they do another... I'm praying for a cast change for the Betty Ross part.",7,5,11,13 June 2008
