Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Grrrreat!!!!!
","This movie is visually stunning!!!! It might not be the best plot ever, but it still has some great moments and Lucas managed to give you the chills. It's the movie to see this summer and the one you got to buy as soon as it's on sale!!!",10,0,0,20 May 1999
