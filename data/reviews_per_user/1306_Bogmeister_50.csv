The Blair Witch Project," Here we go, a walkin' in the woods
","By now, everyone and their grandma has heard about this super-cheap project that ended up making millions upon millions in the summer of '99. Now it's out on video and that's where it really belongs: it was mostly shot on HI8 Video, with some 16mm film. Watching it, especially the beginning (before the 3 characters go into the woods), I am reminded of similar video footage I took on a couple of past road trips; you know what I mean? - stuff taken from a moving car; people walkin' around not really doing anything. The difference is, of course, I didn't make $140+ million off of my stuff. Silly me. As a film, it's a mixed bag. The 1st 20 or so minutes, as I mentioned, are nothing more than a boring home movie. But then, the tension starts to mount - and I'm not really sure why: is it the jerky hand-held camera movement? The 'real world' sound effects? After all, one is supposedly watching real stuff, not a make-believe reel movie. That was the whole hook of the project - the thing that drew so many people to it (I believe the technique is called 'cinema verite' - a French term for realism). And, true to form, the film doesn't really 'end' - it just stops. There are no spelled-out answers in the end, forcing audiences to make their own conclusions (I did). But, also in the end, I don't think this will take its place among classics such as Night of the Living Dead[68] or even The Evil Dead[81], because the thing's a triumph of marketing, not cult horror. It's clever, it's creepy, it's unique. But it's a manipulation designed to draw grosses, not gross out people in a new exciting way (the R rating is for foul language). OK, I bought the DVD.",6,0,1,22 July 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The Bride Ends Her Rampage; We Applaud
","The 2nd half of Tarantino's tale of bloody revenge doesn't have the spectacular battles, except for a one-on-one in a trailer, but it more than makes up for this fact with a sublime quality only possible from a master filmmaker. The wronged Bride (Uma Thurman) succeeds in tracking down Bill (Carradine), after a couple more confrontations with ex-compadres. The picture is also filled out with more detail of events prior to her coma, enriching what we already know about all the characters. Think about a half-dozen of your favorite films which never had sequels, which had characters you wish you could see more about. All of a sudden, here it is - volume two: the mysterious faceless Bill is revealed early in all his glory. As Bill, David Carradine strolls into the picture with all the grace and steely charm of a lost king, returned to show us all how it's done. As he says near the beginning, 'I'm the man.' That might sound trite and funny coming from anyone else; here, he makes you believe it in the same second and proves it throughout. By the end, he really is a scary son of a gun, without even having to kill anyone on screen.The whole picture comes across as a more mature, polished upgrade of the exciting volume one. It doesn't get a full 10 stars from me due to Tarantino's indulgence in dragging out certain scenes (the one with Bill's brother's boss harassing Budd could have been accomplished in half the time). But Tarantino makes good use of the secondary characters played by Hannah and Madsen. Hannah comes across as a more spiteful version of The Bride and just as tough. As with many players who enter the Tarantino universe, this may be her best role. Madsen, brought back from his breakthrough in Tarantino's 'Reservoir Dogs'(92), seems very at ease as the self-destructive Budd. And then, of course, you have Gordon Liu as the master - unforgettable! But it's still up to Uma to carry the show, which she does. Tarantino really gets the most out of her when she needs to explode, whether in anger or outrage, or just about any strong emotion; she does it with a suddenness that startles us - towards the end when she bursts into the room where Bill is waiting and sees what she sees. Her entire body seems to convulse and we're all heaving with emotion right along with her.",9,0,1,15 August 2005
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A longer time ago,a more boring movie
","Otherwise known as 'Star Wars-Episode One' - the 1st chapter in what is now planned as a 6-part movie series. The 2nd chapter arrived in 2002. So all we have here is basically an introduction to a 12-hour movie. And boy, do we feel it. The plot has something to do with heavy taxes being perpetrated by the nasty 'Trade Federation.' Two Jedi Knights are dispatched to negotiate. It doesn't go well. We are (re-) introduced to R2D2 & C3PO (who is being built by young Annakin Skywalker, the future Darth Vader - Eegads!). In the end, we have a huge battle on 3 fronts, highlighted by the light-saber duel between the 2 Jedi knights and Darth Maul - a Sith Lord. Why are they all fighting? And why not send 4 Jedi knights or 6, to simplify matters a bit? All the escalating problems in the next two films could have been avoided if the so-called wise Jedi Council distributed their warriors a bit more efficiently, rather than being stuck in this '2' mode. To me, the most interesting aspects of this flic is making the various connections between this movie and the ones already made which take place in the near future. For example, there is the other Sith Lord (the master - they always come in twos ... say what? - if you know they come in twos, then send four..never mind), who is obviously the evil emperor from 'Return of the Jedi'(83), and played by the same actor. Then there's the hint that Annakin did not have a father - what's all that about? And these microscopic beings that live in everyone's blood symbiotically? Hah? Like 'Star Trek the Motion Picture'(79), this film is easier to watch a 2nd time around, when one can relax and not worry about missing a line of dialog which explains half the plot. The obvious weakness to the flic is that after writing it, George Lucas doesn't have much directing to do: what's left is for his FX technicians to plan the high-speed action races, create the many creatures, and visualize the city-scapes on several worlds. By Golly. And I didn't even mention Jar-Jar once.",6,4,8,23 July 2005
The Ring," Want to Die, Watch the Video
","I'm not really sure why The Ring was the huge success it was. It's not exactly a horror original as many feel it to be. Besides being based on 'Ringu', how about a similar urban legend such as 'Candyman' from 10 years earlier? And the distorted faces on photos & video, we've seen that before. There's even a similarity to the doomed characters in 'The Omen' way back in '76, whose deaths were foretold in photos. But all this may be irrelevant as The Ring uses the best elements of horror and makes them its own. Perhaps the most frightening element, at least on first viewing, is the suggestion this could really be; the viewer even notices a slight video static before the movie proper, on the FBI warning note on the DVD, for example. It's a clever tactic to send a shudder early on.The main power of the story is that it's a journey of discovery - some dark discoveries, to be sure, but compelling nonetheless. You're drawn to be a witness to the main character's journey. It's almost playful at first - rumors, gossip; she listens, a bit bemused. It's a slow, gradual rise in the dread. Naomi Watts has the task of tugging us all along with her and she's very good. You see that slight terror and disgust in her features when she first views the tape and you feel sympathy; you know things will continue to get worse. The countdown to doom, day by day, is also nothing new, but that doesn't mean it can't be effective. And it's strengthened by the increasing knowledge that this is a doom one cannot escape; no running away, no weapons will help. The photography also helps in creating a very oppressive atmosphere. Some of the scenes also remind of Kubrick's 'The Shining' from 1980; it's a mood of steadily oppressive horror. All this works when you first see the film; on 2nd viewing you know who will or won't die and the viewing experience is rather empty. So watch it a second time. It'll get rid of the shudders.",8,0,1,26 August 2005
Se7en," A Pound of Flesh - and much more not less
","This picture wants a piece of all of us and it gets it. It's relentless in what it depicts and I think it's one of those cases when the overall result somehow surpasses the original intent of the filmmakers, however great that intent was. It's an unflattering depiction of our society, a picture of the world which happens to be the point of view of a serial killer. His world is dark, but made so by the so-called human beings infesting it - all the banality, the apathy, the self-interest of our species is on full display here. The city in this film is in a state of perpetual decay; all we seem to see are rotting walls and buildings on the verge of crumbling. But this is just a surface corrosion, a reflection of what really ails all of us, which is the corruption of our souls. The serial killer is just a natural extension of society here. It comes as no surprise that he exists. We've made our hell on Earth and the killer is just one of the elements existing to fall neatly into place in the center of it all.Under the guise of a police procedural, director Fincher and the screenwriter unveil this grim world for us. This was not a reworked draft which fell into the common pitfalls of a standard chase at the end or a last minute rescue. No, none of that same old Hollywood stuff here. The nasty foreboding probably surfaces around the time we get to know a little about young detective Mills (Pitt) and his pretty wife (Paltrow), through the eyes of hardened veteran detective Somerset (Freeman). It's hinted that the young couple have recently moved into the big city from a more rural area, into the typical squalid apartment lifestyle prevalent in this grimy city. Maybe some alarm bells go off in the back of the audience's mind by this point: we don't think this couple should be in this city. What in the blazes are they really doing in this hellhole? Why didn't they stay where they belonged, close by that high school where they met? Pitt is pretty good as the less experienced cop, not too intelligent but struggling anxiously to be in the big leagues. He does OK, but the film belongs to Freeman, who cannot strike a wrong note as the older weary policeman. This becomes the essential Freeman role, that of a man who perhaps has seen too much in his lifetime, but his keen intelligence cannot allow him to simply give up and throw in the towel, no matter how close he gets to that point. Freeman manages to convey a poetic disposition towards decency and civilization, as with most of his roles, but it's never more effective than here, when the entire world assails him with barbarism and anarchy.It's little surprise that much of the style of this film was copied over the next few years, including even the unusual credits sequence. The bulk of the film details the serial killer's masterpiece of murder, a pattern following the seven deadly sins. While interesting in itself and grisly in the depiction of murder as an artistic creation, we realize by the climax that it was all simply a preparation for the truly horrific crowning achievement of killer John Doe's final act. It's a shock at the end which still sends shivers down my spine no matter how many times I watch it. Perhaps meant for repeat viewings after the initial shock, the film serves to remind us we live (or just exist) in that chaotic charnel house we usually try not to think about. When all the surface gloss is peeled away and we gaze with unfiltered eyes at the unpleasant truth laid bare before us, we see John Doe smirking at us, holding a box.",10,0,0,5 February 2006
Fight Club," Club for Film Freaks, not men
","What most people who have not yet seen this flic do know ...it has to do with a men's club started by the 2 main characters whose members beat each other up. Obviously, there is an inherently violent structure to the film. The theme, on the surface, is that modern men have none of the outlets of the past (war, survival, the hunt, etc.) on which to test themselves, i.e. to vent their natural aggression. The result is a nation full of frustrated human time-bombs, many ready to blindly follow a charismatic leader (Pitt) into anarchy & terrorism. Anarchy, to be sure, is a troublesome subtext, but Director Fincher expands on the groundwork laid out to pose a more complex dilemma: namely, that our modern world of advertising and corporate suffusion may produce a new breed of man - one who is halfway drawn into a surrealistic dreamworld to escape the rigors of reality and who will eventually strike back at the world which has affronted him - with apocalyptic vigor. Fincher employs a few seldom-seen cinematic tricks to convey this surrealistic vision, including brazen attempts at subliminal imagery as a parody form - though most of the film turns out to be a dark comedy, anyway, at odds with the serious nature of the story. Somehow, it works. I'm also drawn to the film for repeat viewings due to the unusual stylistics but am resistant, as well; this could be because the subject matter is at odds with the style, producing a confusing reaction in the viewer. There is also a surprise twist near the end, which has been apparently a well-kept secret, since it took me off-guard - and I'm the one who figured out 'The Sixth Sense'(99) halfway through.I'd like to veer off on a tangent I normally don't in my comments and mention the video version of this film on the DVD. First of all, the DVD of the film itself has 4 alternate audio commentary tracks - a record - including by the Director, all the main actors, the screenwriter & novelist. There's a 2nd disc in the package which details the evolution of the film with everything from promos to behind-the-scenes FX tests. This is the DVD format used to its full potential; by the time you're finished with it, you'll feel as if you were part of the film's crew.",9,1,3,23 July 2005
Spider-Man 2," The Spectacular Sacrifices of Peter Parker
","The writers and filmmakers of this sequel to Spider-Man(2002) are to be commended for at least one thing: they actually advanced the story of Peter Parker and his acquaintances. The characters progress forward, a novel concept these days, and so this is not just a rehash of the first Spider-Man movie. I believe the writers, perhaps with director Raimi's input, consciously made this decision, so that we have that sense of actual changes happening to the hero and his supporting cast. It's staggering to think they spent $200 million on this but I guess that's what you need to perfect the computer FX - Spider-Man now looks realistic in every shot, not just 75% of 'em.It really is two years later from the end of the 1st picture: Parker (Maguire) juggles college, part-time jobs, and super-heroing - all not very well. With only 24 hours in a day, why should this be a surprise? Something's got to give, and it turns out to be super-heroics. The central theme continues from the first film, that Parker sacrifices pretty much everything to continue in his role as mankind's helper - until, that is, psychological blocks in his mind cause his powers to peter (no pun intended) out. The story is based a lot on the key issue, #50, of the comic books, from the sixties, as well as Annual#1, in which he seems to lose his powers. The introduction of villain Dr.Octopus in issue #3 is also pivotal. Doc Ock (Molina) is another revelation here - they gave him a wife here, contrary to the books - but this turns him into a sympathetic figure, despite his raw power and the havoc he causes. As Stan Lee himself would say way back when, the most interesting villains are the tragic ones. Molina's final scene is truly haunting, as a result, and trademark Raimi.Also continuing from the previous film is the unrequited love for Mary Jane (Dunst). But, this thread definitely advances leaps & bounds by the end. I hope they continue in this vein in the 3rd film. I hope there's a marriage by the end of that 3rd pic and things don't just stagnate. I hope Harry's (Franco) story evolves and maybe concludes. This could be the makings of a really great trilogy. The writers also pulled a daring stunt in having Spider-Man's identity revealed to so many people throughout the film, but it all works in underlining the enormous sacrifice required by Parker on a daily basis. Above all, it helps if you don't have just a faceless super-hero.",9,1,2,3 August 2005
Blade," Fighting Modern Vampires in the Big City
","It's a glimpse into how Hollywood works and thinks that, with all the primo Marvel super-heroes to choose from, even including 2nd-tier heroes like Luke Cage & the Panther, the first successful big budget Marvel film is based on an obscure supporting character from the little-known 'Tomb of Dracula' comic book. The key to the success was upgrading the Blade (Snipes) character to be a cool bad-ass in the big city, with neat weapons and wardrobe, not to mention super powers lacking in the original comic book version. On initial glance, the movie could be a standard action thriller from the nineties, but director Norrington imbued this with enough style and mythology to make this a cut above most of those. Rather than an old Gothic atmosphere, everything points towards the modern, the sleek. The actual 'Dracula' character isn't present; instead there's an entire secret cabal of vampires, ruling in secret - for one reason or another it seems all of the police force is employed by them. There are different 'grades' of vampire in this story - those born as vamps and those turned. The so-called pure bloods form a ruling council. They exist in an unspecified truce with human bigwigs i.e. politicians - which comes as no surprise, I suppose - all bloodsuckers would support one another, right? Also borrowed from the comic books is the villain vampire Frost (Dorff), portrayed as an elder man in the books, but here a turned arrogant punk aiming to change the status quo. The more interesting aspects of the story have to do with the internal conflict among the new age and the older generation of vampires, not the usual battles between humans and vampire monsters. Blade himself in not really human, being a kind of hybrid, having the strengths of a typical vampire and none of their weaknesses (sunlight, garlic). His fights are martial arts-influenced, with the added FX shots of his opponents disintegrating as a fatal blow is struck. Some dark amusement is provided by Donal Logue as Frost's no.2 vamp, never quite getting that killing blow from Blade, just losing a limb every other scene. Logue and Dorff, tho, never seem quite in sync in their scenes together, with Logue stressing the humor and Dorff playing it very straight. But they manage, in conjunction, to provide the necessary menace for Blade and his allies to stand against.The film veers a bit into inane territory for the climax, when Frost is planning to unleash something called 'La Magra' on the world, which I believe was meant to turn everyone into vampires. Instead of the planned 'blood god' FX, we get a souped-up version of vampirism in Frost and some extra martial arts effort from Blade to wrap things up. Snipes is stolid as the hero, letting loose a grin every now and then when the prospect of graphic violence rises up. He and fellow vampire-killer Whistler (Kristofferson) are supposedly close friends but you get the impression they're together only because they both hate vampires. It's a rather somber unemotional world they both exist in, with nothing more than resolute soldiering a guiding force. Blade would continue to soldier on in two sequels.",7,1,3,4 February 2006
The Mummy," Last word on the Mummy,until it returns
","Colorful, old-fashioned, full of adventure. Yes, all these describe this big-budget re-make of the old Universal flic; what a difference 67 years make. A box-office winner, this capitalizes on the current FX capabilities to display almost anything one can imagine (as long as you have the money): wanna show a locust invasion? No problem. A 'living' sandstorm? Okey do-key. Essentially a horror comedy, the minor horrific elements are offset by a tongue-in-cheek attitude; probably the creepiest sections for the audience have to do with the marauding hordes of beetles that scour the insides of the burial grounds and have a tendency to get under your skin. The monster of the title (played by South African actor Arnold Vosloo, who has no English lines) is more like a force of nature, with many supernatural powers, who needs to feed off the life-essences of various victims to regenerate himself, uh, itself. The movie has some great on-location desert photography, with the whole thing having a 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' feel to it. So, why doesn't it rate higher with me? There is a word, I believe it's 'derivative,' which can also be used to describe this romp. When 'Raiders..' came out in the early eighties, it was fairly original, even tho it was based on old-time serial pics. By the late nineties, this scrambling from one peril to the next is not. This is also a primary example of computer FX used to such excess that nothing resonates with any real impact on the viewer. Since the story is set in the 1920s, I could hear in 1999 the wheels turning in Hollywood executive heads regarding a sequel set in modern times. But, that didn't happen - the sequel moved ahead only a few years, to even better grosses. Now, THAT'S Hollywood. Uh, The Mummy Returns Again?",6,0,1,22 July 2005
Constantine," We Get it: Angels are just as insecure and petty
","The fanbase for this latest attempt at summarizing chaotic existence dominated by God, his Angels and the Devil comes from readers of DC Comics Vertigo line, where-in sincere attempts at adult storytelling surfaced following in the footsteps of Alan Moore's groundbreaking work on the old 'Swamp Thing' comic book series, which gave rise to the 'graphic novel' term, rather than the standard 'comic book' label. Moore developed his own take on theological discussion, creating intricate modern mythology using established comic book characters; his was the benefaction on the series this film is based on. Everything was there for the taking and just needed to be ably translated into film form.An immediate setback is the casting of the still boyish-looking Keanu as the self-destructive weary title character. Everything from his mannerisms to his forced approach to depression rings false; when he pounces on another in a long line of cigarettes, you just think 'fake.' Constantine should appear and behave even older than he actually is; instead, he seems younger. I don't have a problem with cute little jokes, as in the lettering on the taxi he exits near the beginning, but when he proceeds to struggle with some demon (imitating classic scenes from 'The Exorcist'), no sense of horror is conveyed, just a lapse into parody ('hey, dude, get outta that girl's body, OK?'). Unfair? Maybe. Or maybe I'm tired of excuses made for Keanu, who really needs another 30 years of life experience to project what's required here. But that's just a guess; probably nothing would help. Unfortunately, Rachel Weisz is another actor who just leaves me cold. As we're supposed to sympathize with her and root for her protection from dark forces, this creates another serious drawback to the story. The two main characters are the weakest links in the picture.So where does that leave us? The finale. Most of the picture is forgettable, a plodding by the motions until the revelations of the final 20 minutes. As mentioned elsewhere, some elements of this story bear an uncanny resemblance to the more eclectic 'The Prophecy' from 1995 (not 'Prophecy' from '79, a whole other monster story). By chance or design, the angel Gabriel here (Swinton) actually adheres more to the description of popular lore, being essentially female. But Swinton scores another coup, projecting an otherworldly persona (she's now the 'go to' actor for inhuman beings, as in the Narnia movie later in the year), as easily as Keanu fumbled his attempt at gravitas. It's the plot of 'The Prophecy' transposed to the final revelatory minutes of 'Constantine' which at least makes for interesting, even repeat, viewing. And why stop with one petty, misguided angel? May as well throw in the latest interpretation of Satan (Stormare), here a somewhat immature sourpuss, into the mix. Stir. Result? Constantine outsmarts them all? Tell me another one.",6,0,4,28 December 2005
Troy," Return of the Epic
","I'm not sure why there's a large camp of people who've seen this and regard it as one of the worst movies of 2004. Usually, these are brief, offhand remarks, and don't explain the reasons for this antipathy. I do agree there are definite flaws. Most detractors (and even some fans) believe Brad Pitt was miscast, but I wouldn't go there. Pitt's Achilles is a curious mixture and can be divided almost squarely in two: half the performance is just fine; the other half is not so good. It all depends on what scene we're talking about. An example of the negative is when Achilles and his men are in their boat, on the verge of reaching the beach of Troy. Achilles makes a brief statement to his number two to fight for him. I think Pitt's intent was to make Achilles super-casual in moments like these, when everyone else is tensed up. But it just doesn't work; his line reading reminds me of an office manager asking his assistant to buy some more paper clips. However, there's something to be said for the view that Pitt was born to play this role. There's no getting around the fact that, physically, he is ideal. And, there aren't too many actors, whether thru presence or sheer egomania, who can stare down an entire army and make them feel small. The film, as a whole, is filled with such moments and it's a compulsive re-watching experience, not for the obvious 1000 ships sailing in, but for seeing mythical characters come alive and interact on screen for you. And for, oh yes, seeing Achilles down a giant warrior now & then. Now, as for GOOD line readings, I must mention the actor who impressed me the most - Brian Cox as Agamemnon, the 'pig of a king.' His performance was flawless and his was as a magnetic presence (in some ways, more so) as Pitt's Achilles. The actor Bana was excellent as the strong, heroic Hector and Gleeson great as the brutish King Menelaus. Sean Bean seems well suited for these epics and is very smooth as the legendary Odysseus. O'Toole brought in his usual class as the elderly King Priam. I've missed the Epic; I'm glad it's back.",8,43,84,18 July 2005
Ed Wood," The Glorious Film Career of That Director Ed
","Ed Wood is neat stuff, especially for those with fond memories of all those low budget monster pictures from the fifties. But, it's not restricted to just those fans; as a movie biography, it's accessible to just about anyone. The bio contains many cases of dramatic license being taken with the real Ed Wood's life and that of Bela Lugosi, but it all fits neatly into place. Their lives were touched by a bit of the fantastic, after all, and this picture emphasizes the idealized versions of events in our memories as much time passes by. Wood (Depp) is a 'never say die' fellow: despite a lack of talent, no money and even bad luck, he manages to persevere through several writing/directing efforts, all the while jumping back into the game when it seems he's played his last card. Just when it seems he's growing despondent and is finished, something galvanizes him to tackle another feature. You can't help but root for the guy. You can't help but laugh along with a studio exec who can't take Wood's work seriously but, at the same time, you want Wood to continue putting out these lame efforts. Hey, at least he's doing it, right?The viewer really can begin warming up to the picture as Wood begins assembling his 'posse' of actors and production people. Besides Bela (Landau), this includes wrestler Tor (George Steele), stage entertainer Criswell the prognosticator (Jones), strange actor Bunny (Murray) and, later, TV host Vampira. They bond together into a sort of team, even heading out on dark night missions to 'borrow' props from other studios. Though seemingly outcasts from normal society, they're comfortable with themselves; if you aren't, well, that's your problem. I guess that includes Wood's transvestism, which isn't shied away from. Wood's directing techniques, as played by Depp, are flat-out hilarious. I was especially appalled, in a good way, by how he directed Bela & Tor to get through a door. The cast is pretty much perfect. Landau just nails the Bela Lugosi role (he won the supporting actor Oscar), lending much poignancy to the famed actor's twilight years. When Wood gets around to creating his most famous movie, 'Plan 9 From Outer Space,'(1959) there is a sense of history being made. Was it about as bad as a movie can get? Yes, but it's still legendary. The audience has a front row seat to witness a legend being created right in front of them.Filmed in atmospheric black & white, the entire film has a bittersweet taste to it by the time it runs through a brief 'after-history' on the main players. Most of them are deceased by now, of course, and their 'careers' never really improved later. But they all had the pleasure of actually working on a movie set, as a sort of odd family. I felt I'd just seen something irreplaceable - a glimpse into a decade when dreams could be realized on the silver screen, flawed as they were. Very flawed, yes. Well, no one's perfect, are they?",9,0,0,8 January 2006
X-Men," Mutants struggle for their place in World
","This adaptation of Marvel's mutant super-heroes took many by surprise, building & improving on the success of the first Blade(98) film and paving the way for the most successful Marvel adaptation, Spider-Man(2002). Like the better adaptations of comics properties, this found the core element which defined X-Men's success, especially since 1975, when the books were revamped: a minority within the human race, persecuted by the majority, struggling to overcome prejudice and ignorance.X-Men, as a comic book, began way back in 1963, but the film depicts a mixture of characters from the sixties and later ones introduced in the seventies. Chief among equals is Wolverine, a loner and anti-hero who may go either way in choosing between 2 sides of the mutant camps, one led by Professor X (Stewart,the benign faction), the other by Magneto (McKellen, the radical side); or, Wolverine may choose neither - he is a loner, after all, and the true X-Factor in this intrigue. The film scored a triumph with casting Hugh Jackman as this bad-tempered mutant in the 11th hour: he was an unknown, complementing the strengths of Wolverine's own character, and fit the role splendidly. He brings a much-needed energy and intensity to the entire picture.Many viewers regard the sequel, X2, as even superior to this intro, which may be true, but there's a raw energy here that cannot be duplicated in a sequel. Here is where a strange new world was first brought forth to an audience, a 'near-future' where fantastic beings were a somewhat natural outgrowth of mankind's evolution (if you discount possible influences of the atomic age, which isn't mentioned here). The creation of a whole new world landscape is a daunting prospect, but director Singer and the writers pull it off, using the established comics lore instead of disregarding it.Of the other characters, McKellen shines as the main villain, making Stewart appear stiff by comparison. Magneto's is a tragic history as shown, more complex than most comics' villains, but he's also a super-powered terrorist and does not engender much sympathy. His henchmen are all fine, with the blue-colored female shape-shifter standing out a bit. Of the heroes, Rogue (Paquin) has the most interesting role besides Jackman. The one area the filmmakers failed in is the Jean Grey/Cyclops romance. This relationship, evolving over the many years in the books, had the capacity for great things on film - Scott & Jean were meant for each other, soul mates if you will. None of this comes across in the film; Jean is made the older woman for some reason, and Marsden, miscast as the brooding Cyclops, lacks any depth. Halle Berry, probably criticized most as Storm, isn't really given a chance to be good or bad in the role; most of the time, you just stare at her apparent beauty.It was a pretty exciting film. It could have been much worse. All comic book fans at least breathed a sigh of relief afterward.",8,0,0,31 July 2005
The Terminator," Relentless and Unstoppable, all you need is Love
","An instant classic, The Terminator succeeds on so many levels, it's still a benchmark with which to test other films, whether they be science fiction, action thriller, horror, romance or even comedy. We begin with the title character himself, uh, itself, essayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger. No one can deny this film has a sense of humor when you first see Arnold strolling in the nude toward a trio of punks. Keep in mind, these are the sort of punks you hope you never run across at night, but, in the next moment, you feel nothing but sympathy for them and now Arnold is the source of a kind of horror. It unbalances an audience (seeing this for the first time) but it's done with such confidence, such smooth panache, you're caught helplessly in the undertow of this film's wild yet controlled progression.You're with Arnold, and Michael Biehn, and Linda Hamilton, and you're overwhelmed by how the story unfolds, presenting concepts of a dark, ugly future while the action gets better & better with each scene. One should realize at this time, over 20 years later, that a good portion of the audience had no idea that Arnold was a robot (ok, cyborg) for the first half hour of the picture when it was first released. To them, unless they read a secret paragraph in a sci-fi magazine, Arnold was just a creepy human killer from the future. This was just another brilliant stroke by writer-director Cameron who, forced into creative decisions by a low budget, transcended all expectations of what a sci-fi B-movie should be. The script never lets us down as far as the Terminator character - it continually proves to be as Biehn describes it - remorseless & unstoppable. The story fools the viewers not once but twice by massacres which happen in places designated 'safe' (the disco and, more so, the police station). By the end, you're as exhausted as Linda Hamilton.When the film veers towards the romance, it's not at all awkward, it's inevitable from the desperate circumstances. Like two souls trapped in a war only they understand, the time-crossed lovers seem thrown together by cosmic forces outside their control. We all seem to sense their time together will be brief, very brief - it's both a very touching and intense moment. In the end, the film proves to be flawless in execution - every scene works and builds on the previous scene. It's astounding how many things could have gone wrong, such as Arnold's rumored initial role as the hero. Hell, this even has Dick Miller selling guns. You can't go wrong there.",10,2,3,7 August 2005
Blade II," Blade & Vampires & Reapers & Tigers & Bears
","When you do a sequel, one option to not simply repeat the events of the first film is to up the ante. In this follow-up to the first Blade(98), we not only have the standard vampires to contend with, but a new threat called Reapers, which feed on vampires, just as vampires feed on humans. There is also an elite group of bad-ass vampires teaming up with bad-ass Blade (Snipes), though you tend to forget they're vamps at this point; they come across as a new team of super-heroes. Of course, sooner or later, vamps tend to revert to form, but there's less of the standard bloodsucking and more of the standard martial arts swordplay. The plot is a bit more complex than the 1st pic, with some backstabbing and counterplots revealed late in the game. The new monsters, the Reapers, a more extreme version of vampirism, provide the horror angle.So, in all, you end up with a film with numerous genres mixed together to form an unusual super-hero horror soufflé. You need only be familiar with director del Toro's monster picture 'Mimic'(97) to appreciate the flavor he strives for. Like his previous film, this is heavy on grotesque creature visuals, quite unusual even in this day and age, but usually covered in a familiar slime. The combo of computer FX and advanced puppetry is admittedly impressive, though some of the long shots of creatures jumping from wall to wall become cartoon-like. Snipes as the hero is more relaxed in this 2nd go around, and they brought back Whistler (Kristofferson), supposedly killed in the 1st flic, a somewhat contrived plot turn. Perlman as another vamp overplays his hand a little, but del Toro was right to bring him along for 'Hellboy' a couple of years later. The climactic fight is pretty brutal, with both combatants showing off their superhuman abilities to the extreme. By the end, however, you may wish Blade had focused more on his life mission instead of reacting to the machinations of others throughout most of the story.",6,0,1,17 February 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Attack of the Middle Movie
","Stuck between The Phantom Menace(99) and Revenge of the Sith(05), this one-sixth of the Star Wars saga may end up being the most forgettable of all. There are no scenes which seem to stand out and at least embed themselves in the memory. Phantom Menace may have been a bit slower going but at least you had the devil-like Darth Maul killing a Jedi Knight and the first glimpse of a planet-sized city. The climax here is still my favorite sequence of this film, with Chris Lee showing off his still-formidable chops, but this doesn't say much for the rest of the picture. Annakin Skywalker has grown up from a cute little boy of Phantom Menace into a pouting young man (Christensen), mentored, with difficulty, by Obi-Wan Kenobi (McGregor). The Jedi Knights (led by Yoda) deal with mysterious plots to create an army of clones, which are scheduled to fight some war for some reasons unknown. Annakin learns about loss, in a couple of different ways, and begins a slight turn towards the dark side, in the form of vengeance. It looks like Christensen was instructed to act younger than he is because that part does work out - he comes across as very immature. Meanwhile, the clone army wears the same stormtrooper white armor we all first saw in Star Wars(77 aka A New Hope), which means they were all clones...? Darth, where are you when we need yuh? The pic is naturally hampered by being the middle one in the 2nd (1st?) trilogy, with no real beginning or ending. All you can do is look forward to Darth Sidious doing his thing in the next installment.",6,0,3,23 August 2005
American Pie," American dreams of idiotic teens
","I viewed the 'gasp' unrated version of the high school sex comedy which renewed interest in 'Porky's'-style bathroom humor. My guess is the 'extra' scenes involve Nadia-the-foreign exchange-student's striptease while spied on by the Internet. But other than that, there's very little nudity or simulated sex on screen. In fact, just about all the risquÃ© stuff happens off-camera: you hear various noises, someone bursts into the room, they gasp at what they see, but YOU don't see it. A famous early scene has a guy with a boner - but it's covered with a sock. All the bedroom scenes near the end when the guys finally get lucky are also demure, as the females are all strategically covered up. Then, of course, there's the infamous 'guy-making-it-with-a-pie' scene. It's just stupid. The entire movie is rather odd. It's almost like watching a TV sit-com show which contains some gross, raunchy ideas. All the kids, especially the males, look like they fell out of a cutesy '80s TV show. They all talk and act like kids from the '60s or '50s. Sure, they're obsessed with sex, but so were kids in the '50s. Then there's the requisite toilet jokes, including the 'guy-has-to-take-a-nasty-dump' scene (in the girls' bathroom, in this case). In the end, we have a typical coming-of-age tale. I suppose when you get to be a certain age (like me), you realize this type of stuff is recycled by Hollywood every 20 years or so. They hype it quite a bit, of course, and teens & young twenty-somethings flock to it thinking it's something which has never been seen or done before. In a sense, maybe they're right. Kids today, like any day, don't believe anything valid existed more than 10 years back. Everything is NOW-NOW-NOW, with no thought to history (or film history). Ironically, it probably would have been better if everyone had forgotten that 'Porky's' and its sequels had ever existed, but somehow or other, someone manages to dredge up the excrement of low-class material which used to elicit howls of laughter from brain-dead teens (now long gone) for the current masses.",5,3,5,23 July 2005
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Same Make, Same Model, New Director
","The 2nd sequel to the original '84 sci-fi thriller and follow-up to the '91 sequel was a long time coming, perhaps a few years too long. That could be the main reason the Linda Hamilton character is missing. They managed to eke out a respectable big-budgeter still superior to most of the other action thrillers coming out in the nineties, and especially nowadays, but right off the bat it lacks some of the innovations in the previous sequel. Arnold just duplicates his cyborg character from 1991, perhaps even a bit less human in quality. The new TX super-villain, in female form, is just a bit more advanced than the T-1000, with fancy new weapons and an ability to control other machines (wow, who saw that coming?). The first few minutes essentially duplicate the beginning of the '91 film. The writers seem unable to come up with anything new at this point, even though they had a dozen years. I was dismayed to hear the TX utter one of her first lines and realize it copied one of best lines in 'The Hidden'(87), which itself emulated the first Terminator film. Or, she's just copying the T-1000. Same difference.Another big drawback is the central character of John Connor (Stahl). You get the sense that if he wasn't forced into his destiny as a military leader and messiah, he'd end up as a typical loser in a dead-end job, if not homeless. It's as if he's given up or something; where is the kid who could out-think most adults in the previous movie? I guess it's fashionable to create these loser-type characters in Hollywood's screen writing 101 classes who then do a miraculous turnaround, but it's also tiresome. Connor obviously feels something bad may still occur, otherwise he wouldn't be living 'off the grid.' Shouldn't he be using his brain and talents to keep track of developments in advanced computers which may pose a danger? This seems a motivation not thought out, as in the previous 2 pictures; does he think Judgement Day will happen at the start of the film or not? Of course, it's revealed his mom passed away not long ago, which may explain his despair, as Arnold calls it, but it's never delved into.All that being said, Stahl does a pretty good job of conveying the world weariness associated with someone too young to have so much baggage. You warm up to his character very quickly and are following along through his eyes most of the time. Danes is surprisingly energetic in a role she nabbed in the last minute, I hear. And Loken as the new Terminatrix? She sure has the look; I suppose it's interesting to see a female figure with so much power. The FX are consistently impressive. Mostow is a very good director, and this film could be a case study of seeing the difference between a very good director and a great director (James Cameron). It's fascinating to wonder how much more, if anything, Cameron could have done with the existing material. As mentioned, this film lacks some of the surprises and suspense of the first two; for example, there's never any doubt as to who is the heroic cyborg and which is the nasty one. Mostow basically steered a straight course toward the one point where the audience is unclear of what may happen, the very conclusion. There is where you may find some surprises.",8,0,1,7 August 2005
The Shining," The Last of the Classic Horror Pictures
","Kubrick's version of Stephen King's horror novel heralded the end of the classic horror run of films, such as the original 'The Haunting'(63), 'Rosemary's Baby'(68) and 'The Omen'(76). After this, it was all slasher stuff copying 'Halloween'('78,itself a classic now) and garish cheap crap, followed by the digital age of superficial horror begun in the nineties (capped by last year's 'Van Helsing' - humph). Yes, this is way before digital, so the twin ghost girls, for example, are not computer FX creations; they're real. Their 'reality' results in a more chilling depiction of ghosts than would have been possible with ethereal software versions. When they show up a couple of times during the film, it's very creepy.You may wonder at the lengthy shots of expansive wilderness that dominate the beginning of the film - they're both majestic and eerie. And they explain that this really will take place in the middle of nowhere. The haunted hotel, the Overlook, is about as far away from the rest of the population as can be. Most of the film is about just 4 characters: Jack, his wife Wendy, son Danny, and the head chef who comes back to try to help. They're isolated from the rest of the world and the film points out that, maybe, large buildings such as this are not meant to be so empty. Remove enough of the living beings meant to reside there and other forces will move in to fill in the empty gaps. Oh, of course, malevolent forces - this is horror, after all. The film builds slowly, but doesn't really speed up as it nears the finish; it's a classic mood of steadily oppressive horror and continues to take its time even as Jack finally reveals his true crazy nature. Most, if not all, of the scenes are played out as very lengthy for a typical film, with one continuous shot carrying the weight in some cases. It's a far cry from the fast cutting prevalent in today's movies.Nicholson was accused of hamming it up back when this opened and he does, for the most part. But there was probably no better way of playing the role. He's over-the-top bonkers madman and any other method would've been boring or, at best, pretentious. Duvall was an odd choice for leading lady; in some shots she looks very haggard and unpleasant, as if Kubrick purposely chose unflattering angles and lighting. But you wonder if these shots are the way Jack sees things; his world could be all ugly from his perspective. She also reads many of her lines in a flat dull tone, a sharp contrast to Nicholson's antics; her very calm manner in the first half makes her terror in later scenes more jolting. The best scenes are actually between Crothers & Lloyd, where-in the meaning of the 'Shining' term is explained. Crothers becomes Lloyd's spiritual father or grandfather, replacing the evil dark father, Jack. They also provide a great set-up for the most evil room in the hotel, #237.This film was not very well received back in '80, mostly due to the changes Kubrick made to King's story. But now, with the passage of years, it stands on its own (and #75 in the IMDb top 250 as of this writing!). The ending especially, seemed anti-climactic and unexciting. But, it all seems appropriate now. Jack, during his whole wretched life, was running away or after something, never catching it. Consumed by his demons and those of the hotel, he ends up frozen in place, nowhere, as was always the case with him. And now he's just another ghost haunting an isolated hotel - a very unusual way to end up and, if you really think about it, the most chilling aspect to the whole story. Rumor has it that an alternate planned ending had Jack's frozen head split open and worms pouring out. Horrific in a way and, if this was made only several years later or today, I guess that's the ending we would have been stuck with.",8,0,1,25 November 2005
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Still Unstoppable, Still Relentless
","The first Terminator pic was a modest success at the box office in 1984; by 1990, thanks to video, millions of people were anxious for a sequel. James Cameron granted their wish and again exceeded expectations. This sequel is 10 years later, based upon the age of the central character (played by newcomer Ed Furlong). Cameron had a budget of over a dozen times the original picture and used it all to great effect. Notably, this was an early use of computer FX which are prevalent today; back then, they were simply amazing to behold (this was before even Jurassic Park '93, and each instance of their use was startling - we weren't used to it). Most of them revolved around the T-1000 super-villain (Patrick), a revolutionary approach to depicting a fantastic menace. Arnold was back as another durable cyborg, but seemed quaint & outmoded as the picture progressed.The film was another impressive progression of action and suspense, interlocked with the theme of nuclear holocaust. More than just building on the threat of nuclear annihilation from the 1st pic, the picture throws the concept at the audience with some striking images. It slows at about the halfway point when the heroes evade the pursuing super-killer for a time, but then you see that nuclear bomb going off, still about the best such depiction ever seen. Just when you think you can relax for a few minutes, a city blows up. By this time, the definitive version of this film is the 'extended' cut Cameron presented a couple of years later. The extra scenes accentuate the plot and don't slow the story down at all.Like the best sequels, it presents characters which progress and advance. This is especially true of Linda Hamilton's character; she's really lived those past 10 years and is a much older & stronger mother figure here, coarsened by ceaseless struggle. She really does turn out to be the mother of the future, as mentioned in the original pic, obsessed with saving us all from a nuclear winter. Arnold, of course, has to play a more human-like cyborg, very different from the mono-syllabic droid he interpreted earlier. The film pulls another fast one in the beginning, still keeping the audience guessing as to which is the heroic protector, Arnold or the T-1000 (the T-1000 actually seems more human than Arnold in the first 20 minutes). When the hero turns out to be Arnold, the viewer claps in appreciation for a fine role reversal. We had to wait another dozen years for the next one, but it could never be as good as this.",10,7,10,7 August 2005
Being John Malkovich," More than we need to know?
","A frustrated puppeteer gets a new job in a building with a '7-1/2' floor, where the ceilings are too low and everyone has to stoop down. He finds a hidden entry hole in the wall and, crawling in, finds himself sucked into the head of actor John Malkovich (playing himself), feeling & hearing everything the actor does. After 15 minutes, the puppeteer is suddenly spat out on the side of a New Jersey road. You would think it can't get any weirder than that, but the story actually comes up with a plot to explain why all this is happening (which may or may not be good - I sorta liked the mystery behind this odd stuff). Soon, the puppeteer (Cusack), his strange wife, and a cold fish co-worker (Keener) hatch a plan to charge people $200 a pop for spending 15 minutes inside Malkovich's head (it always comes back to plain old capitalism, don't it?). The story progresses on for further twists until it reaches the stature of an odd mini-epic, despite obviously BEING low-budget (the lighting, in particular, stinks in places, tho this may be on purpose). I can understand why this almost won the Best Screenplay Oscar: the makers took the potential of the premise as far as it can go, but most 'mainstream' viewers, as I've read elsewhere, will find this baffling: What is the point? What is it really all about? Well, it may be worth the rental just to watch Malkovich hamming it up as a sideways version of himself, tripping on the twilight-zone-like nature of the story and reinventing himself for the camera. But, I also see visions of writers holed up for a week, writing non-stop, taking the story in directions based on frantic brainstorming. That's not bad, but did we really need to know any of this, this result?",8,1,2,23 July 2005
Spider-Man," The Amazing Heroics of Peter Parker
","It's amazing that now, only 3 years after it first opened, Spider-Man the movie has already reached legendary status. But, it's not really a surprise, because the film utilized all the legendary aspects of the comic book character as presented since 1962. It's also amazing that I'm old enough to have started reading his adventures in the late sixties, when he was a relatively new super-hero. He was already famous by then, however, as the mythical qualities of the hero who sacrifices all his personal comforts for the good of humanity had propelled him to the forefront of modern super-heroics.This quality is very evident in the film's story thrust. It seems as if the entire world is against Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire). Even when he first dons a mask to enter a wrestling match and no one in the vast audience there knows who he is, they're all shouting for his downfall. Even his uncle (Robertson), one of the only 2 people in the world on his side, seems to turn against him just before he's killed, though that's more a function of Parker's immaturity. Someone in Parker's place could (and should) very easily turn into a major villain with a major chip on his shoulder. One could argue it's easy to become a hero if you have a billion dollars (Batman) or be invulnerable to harm (Superman). Parker has nothing and he bleeds profusely in this film. None of this deters him - he is so focused on his mission, a life mission which has him looking forward to a lonely and painful journey for year after year.It's also painful to see the unrequited love for Mary Jane (Dunst). MJ in this version is a combination of both the Mary Jane & Gwen Stacy characters of the books. Rightly so, as the flip MJ of the sixties wouldn't have been a good love interest. The bottom line is do we care when the villain drops her to her possible death near the end (an eerie recreation of the most tragic instance in the books). Sure we do; she's the hero's girl, she deserves happiness (she does have a miserable existence, to some extent). All the other characters are well-drawn, as well. Harry (Franco) craves his father's respect; Aunt May (Forsythe) struggles with various pains associated with one's twilight years; even Osborne (Dafoe), who is merely driven insane by an experiment - he twitches in megalomania and is truly creepy. Then there's Jameson (Simmons), transposed faithfully from the 4-color pages - he's a caricature, sure, but that's what happens to someone who wraps himself in his work. They become the work; selling papers - printing ink is in his blood.Would this film have been as successful if not faithful to the character? I'm not sure, but it's hard to imagine a 2nd weekend of $70 million in that scenario. The filmmakers, director Raimi in particular, stuck to the core of Spider-Man. The one big deviation, his organic webbing, was just another intelligent decision (a high school kid developing a product beyond all the high tech companies? uh-uh). It even served as a metaphor for Parker's teen-age development. A funny thing about Maguire, too. A few months before the picture opened, I saw his likeness on the poster of another film and I thought immediately - that is Peter Parker!",9,0,1,31 July 2005
Zulu," How the British Ruled the World
","A magnificent recreation of one of the most incredible battles in history, Zulu depicts how less than 100 British soldiers held off an army of 4000 Zulu warriors. The battle follows a previous one, less than a day before, in which about 1200 British soldiers lost. This film really gives new meaning to the saying 'keep a stiff upper lip' - or 'never say die.' The British soldiers here, led by Lieutenants played by Baker & Caine, know full well the force coming against them; they know what has already occurred. By rights, they should beat a hasty retreat before the approaching army arrives. The film never delves into the reasons, psychological or other, of why the commanding officer is determined to remain, beyond just the statement that he holds the 'queen's commission.' It's a question that baffles the missionary (Hawkins, usually the stiff English officer in other films) who begs them all to leave. The film seems to say, when the moment comes, no man really knows what he will do until it is upon him. Here, the soldiers find out very quickly what they're made of. Cy Endfield, the director, manages to build some heady suspense before even the awesome battle scenes. The soldiers hear a strange sound in the distance, 'like a train' notes Caine. Now we no longer need wonder what 8000 feet on soil sound like. And it's not just the suspense; the drama here is very effective. There are numerous sequences where Endfield manages to drive home a point that sticks in your mind for days - maybe years. Who can forget that simple act of turning over a wagon? The photography is superb, capturing the vastness of the area, and should be seen in widescreen glory. I've seen this film many times as a kid and, of course, these were standard TV showings; I didn't know better, it was one of my favorite films of all time, regardless, but it's twice as glorious in proper aspect ratio. I even had the privilege of seeing this on a theater screen once about 20 years ago and I was suitably blown away, even knowing the story beforehand (nowadays, a DVD on a big screen TV is your best bet). The musical score is perfect, as well. I can't imagine the film with anything different.When the fighting begins, it's really breathless; by that I mean, there is one central action set piece when many of the Zulu warriors break through the ranks and threaten the inner compound, including the officer in command. I always have to hold my breath during this sequence, even though I've seen it 20 times, it's that good. Every time a Brit soldier falls, I think, my God, that's a good portion of the entire defending force! They can never make it! Yet, they do, several times. It's a relentless depiction of war battles, never equaled (as in 'The Alamo',1960, another historical depiction of a small group against a much larger force - it's good, but not even close). Somehow, Endfield and whomever helped choreograph the action scenes managed to weld together the perfect combination of huge crowd battles and singular confrontations where it becomes a little personal.All the actors are first rate. Caine is terrific in his first major role. Baker is very solid - has to be - as the one in command. Booth - I know his character may not be historically accurate - but he's the most colorful, and when he explodes into full-fledged heroism, it's something to see. And Nigel Green as the sergeant - THAT's why the British ruled the world for a time! In fact, all the supporting and minor roles are filled out excellently; this was when script writing had to be extra professional. The much later prequel had no hope of comparing to this masterpiece, but even that film was well done. Yes, I'll say it one more time - this is a masterpiece.",10,153,175,6 August 2005
The Game," Play to the End of Your Life
","The Game weaves its way into and around your brain, challenging you to figure out the puzzle. It's a rather unique film experience because of that no-holds-barred challenge - it challenges you to figure out what's coming next, in a direct way not many other films attempt. It's a thinking person's film; whether it's actually intelligent or not probably depends on the individual, but I'd like to think it's pretty smart. Also pretty smart is the character played by Michael Douglas - business smarts, that is. Douglas was near the end of a roll playing businessmen, began in Wall Street(87). He becomes involved with an odd company, CRS, introduced to him by his younger brother (Sean Penn in a small role). What begins as amusing distraction for his orderly world soon turns sinister.The film points out that people, especially smarter people whom you'd think don't need amusement, all need some kind of distraction. Isn't that what we're all doing essentially during our lifetimes - finding different means of distraction before the inevitable end? And aren't those distractions just a means to avoid thinking about that end? Douglas may be closer to that end than he thinks here. As the toying escalates and becomes dangerous, the viewer may think this has the makings of a slick, if standard, thriller, but that's not the case, to everyone's credit. You reach a point, however, when certain incidents demand suspension of disbelief, no matter how much you trust the filmmakers. How far can a man fall, for example, before you start to think there's a limit of how much I can buy into here? How much can be allowed, how much power can you allow for the puppeteers before a line is crossed? It crosses that line with me towards the end but reaching that point was an interesting experience, something I can say about too few films.This was Fincher's middle film in his personal great trilogy, caught between 'Se7en' and 'Fight Club.' If there's one other minor quibble I might voice, it's that his stylistic flourishes are missing in this one - it's comparatively straightforward, even with the Super-8 type flashbacks, and I would have to rate this a smidgen below the other two. However, if I had to pick one to watch over and over, it would be The Game.",9,48,65,10 August 2005
Back to the Future Part III," Back to the Past,then the Future, Again
","For my comment on the 1st 'Back to the Future,' I mentioned how there aren't too many time travel movies because all the good premises have been used up in a select few sf films ('The Time Machine,' etc.)... This is never more evident than here, the 3rd & final chapter of the McFly clan and Doc Brown, where-in new cast member Steenbergen essentially duplicates her role from 'Time After Time' of '79. Once again she is visited by a time traveler (the Doc in this case) and gets swept away by him in grand fantasy fulfillment. Or was this all a sly nod to her earlier film role and that film? In any case, some of the stuff with changing photographs and repetitive motifs (Marty/Fox waking up as Lea Thompson hovers over him) begins to get stale and it's just as well this was the finale. Most of the film takes place way back in 1885, where our heroes need to figure out a way to get their 'time-vehicle' up to 88 mph without fuel.Halfway through, I began to compare this effort to low-end time travel movies such as 'Timerider' (also a plot involving going back to the old west), which is not a good thing. However, this benefits from the engaging characters we've come to know in the previous 2 films and a lot of silly wordplay on the 'Clint Eastwood' name, which is worth a chuckle. To me, one of the more clever scenes was a pay-off on the foreshadowing of a famous scene from an actual Eastwood movie ('A Fistful of Dollars' I believe). But almost all the interaction with the western characters was like from some average TV episode, including all the dumb conflict with yet another incarnation of Biff (Wilson), here a foul-looking gunslinger. The romance angle is sort of sweet and the climactic action on the hurtling train is well done, as expected. The final little whammy with Doc & his bride is not too surprising, but I found it interesting no explanation was offered for Doc's triumphant return (wait, that hover-board from the previous film - is that how he did it? - great scott!). The end could have been a set-up for a series titled something like 'Adventures in Time with Doc Brown' but maybe it's just as well nothing like that happened.",7,0,0,14 March 2006
The Evil Dead," Here we go, to that cabin in the woods
","From such humble aspirations and low-rent resources, near-greatness is achieved. 'The Evil Dead' takes its place alongside another seminal horror classic, 'Night of the Living Dead'(68) as one of the most influential groundbreaking spikes of terror ever committed to film. With nearly no money, using 16mm film, Raimi and his crew devised a non-stop relentless barrage of horrific images and building dread. The film actually shows some influence by the afore-mentioned earlier film. It takes place in a very isolated location, a choice spot selected by the filmmakers. The setting manages to be very creepy from the outset, before anything even happens. I never really thought of the woods as creepy until I saw this pic. Well, maybe I did, but this is the picture that confirmed my fears.There is a limited amount of characters, reflecting the tiny budget, including a very young Bruce Campbell, who's still very active as a 'B' movie actor. If you've never seen this film, your first thought is that the group of 5 young people, stuck in a cabin in the woods, will be attacked by exterior forces from outside. In one sense, some of this is the case, but the story amps up the horror when the threat manifests itself from within. The story just gets more and more ugly and disgusting, to the point where most viewers will be shaking their heads in disbelief near the end point. But it's not disbelief in the story - you have that sensibility going in - it's a difficulty in grasping the extent to which the filmmakers went to. What were they thinking? you might think to yourself; what a bunch of crazed lunatics. Some of the FX at the end, resembling limited stop-motion animation, may not look too impressive but, by that point, most viewers are already impressed.",8,1,3,25 September 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A Roaring Rampage of Destruction
","An elite assassin (Uma Thurman), after waking from a 4-year coma, takes bloody vengeance on those who wronged her. Said assassin had given up her wild ways before being brutalized by former comrades (with friends like these, you don't need enemies, ha-ha-ha). Quentin Tarantino creates a violent tale which might just as well be a fable taking place a hundred or even a thousand years ago, the actual events perhaps slanted or exaggerated by the passage of time. In a sense, this could be a series of incidents taking place now, being told by storytellers in the year 2100, yes? Isn't this what Tarantino is doing - creating new legends for us to talk about and ponder? The characters in these tales do not behave so much like contemporary citizens as they do mythical heroes and villains; they're more like archetypes than real people. They seem more like ideas of how classic figures in a modern setting would act. How about the daughter of the first villain we see our heroine kill? Would she really just stand there expressionless, upon seeing her mother dead on the floor? In the Tarantino universe, she's just a future heroine or villain, destined to exact more vengeance in a never-ending cycle of bloodletting.The key to making this particular film work is for the audience to buy into the capability of the main character, a female, in dishing out such an impressive revenge. This is not as simple as it seems, even in today's modern film world, if going by box office returns (I'm thinking of 'The Long Kiss Goodnight' from 1996 with Geena Davis, which should have been a surefire hit; then move ahead to 'Elektra' this year). It's not that women can't be as mean as men in this regard. They just haven't been able to tap into that sensibility on screen so that audiences can go along for the ride. Tarantino doesn't appear to have a problem conveying that sensibility with his female actors. It may also help that The Bride character here is acting on her maternal instincts, rather than having them work against her, as in other movies. There's nothing quite so primal as fighting for your child, whether for vengeance or protection.I could go on about the various cinematic tricks Tarantino employs here, such as sudden black & white footage and anime, but the one that really impressed me was his use of music. He plugs in previously known musical bits into his own visualizations and you come away with a new appreciation for the tunes. Though the general thinking is that volumes one and two were originally intended as one film, another masterstroke is having the Bill character faceless and mysterious throughout this first volume. It teases the audience with what's coming in the 2nd volume, especially with that revelation in the last few seconds.",8,1,5,15 August 2005
The Graduate," Want to Know About Uncertainty? Ask Benjamin
","Who is the Graduate? He's every person on that narrow thread of time after school is over and adult work has yet to begin. I could really identify with Ben (Hoffman) when I was on the verge of graduating from college: I was staring into an abyss, an uncertain path which might go anywhere or nowhere; it was a scary prospect. This doesn't apply to those who have mapped out their next 10 years after college with icy precision. No, this is about indecision, lack of confidence, uncertainty - all applicable to Ben's character. It was why this picture was such a huge success, with young people, with older viewers curious to see their past or their kids' perspectives; Hoffman, though quite a bit older than a college joe when he played this role, easily captured the sense of uncertain youth, of a kid still a kid though suddenly expected to behave like a man. He gets a crash course on methods of being a man courtesy of Mrs. Robinson (Bancroft). It's too much too soon, but it sure unstuck him from a slog through extended childhood, and the other reason for the huge success. Back then, an older woman getting it on with such a young punk was unheard of - scandalous, really.The movie isn't perfect, nowhere near it: there are too many languid portions with that Simon-Garfunkel song piping in yet again. Unless you're a fanatic for their stuff, it wears thin by the 2nd half of the film. But it's this particular picture which made me realize how truly artistic a film can be, by comparison to most of the drivel released in the eighties, nineties and so on. I think this was only Nichol's 2nd film, but he laced it with suggestion and framing unheard of in later decades. There's the jungles just outside the nice housing in the background, the animal stripes on the woman in foreground; there she is, she's the predator and Hoffman is her unwary prey. The water motif, of being stuck, surrounded, suffocating - Hoffman at the bottom of the pool, his one brief escape from reality. Bancroft, tending to appear in frame as a reflection - is she a dream or a nightmare; both, of course. All the actors are close to perfect, including character actor Hamilton as the wronged but slimy Mr. Robinson; my favorite scene is when he confronts Ben in Ben's apartment near the end and calls him all those names, and Norman Fell appears looking befuddled as usual. And in the very end, Ben and his girl (Ross, her best role) are still on a road to nowhere, on a bus, of all things, a future very, very uncertain. The theme of the film holds true to the end. None of those pat Hollywood endings of the eighties and nineties. And so on.",8,1,2,22 December 2005
The Mummy Returns," Bring That Mummy on Again
","All the key players are back for this more spectacular variation of the new Mummy villain - an Egyptian high priest thousands of years old with many supernatural powers. The first 5 minutes, with the new character The Scorpion King essayed by The Rock, actually outdoes the '99 film right off the bat; everything is more, as is the case with such sequels - about 10%-15% more, like a formula. The box office grosses seem to bear this out - throw in more, and the crowds will come - this out-grossed the '99 movie. But, more what, really? More money spent on the special computer FX? That's it. When commenting on a film such as this, it's more appropriate to focus on 'the ILM guys' - the ones who construct all the fake armies and sprouting foliage out of nowhere. Did they spend the computer money well, is the main question. I suppose so. I'm not a computer FX expert.I am familiar with movies such as 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and its own sequels. The '99 Mummy movie was derivative of those adventures and this is a copy of the '99 movie. So all the stuff in the old crypts and hidden tunnels and funky pyramids is very old (no pun intended) by now. The scouring beetles make a brief early appearance and still manage to creep out a bit, but the rest is just a slightly enlarged/expanded take on the menace of the same old Mummy. They advanced the story a few years from the previous movie, indicated by the new son of the two main characters (Fraser & Weisz). And this is the only new element, the threat to the young son, which deviates from the first flic. 'The Scorpion King' offshoot picture arrived soon after this but what really surprises me about the franchise is that no 3rd Mummy picture has surfaced, yet. Money speaks more than a Mummy, as they say.",6,2,4,18 September 2005
The Fly," Horrific Tragedy in the Name of Science
","This remake of the fifties sf/horror version is Cronenberg's own masterpiece of horror. Sure, he had original, unusual ideas before this ('The Brood'in'79; 'Videodrome'in'83,etc.) and branched out into other genres after this, so it's odd that a remake is his ultimate effort. But it's here that all the elements of horror came together in a nearly perfect mix. Many of the scenes, particularly in the 2nd half, are uncomfortable to watch, and this may be why many viewers do not rate this film higher - it's just too disturbing to view. A lot of this has to do with the likability of the two main characters, played by Goldblum & Davis. Goldblum as Brundle especially, comes across as a slightly goofy, harmless eccentric in the early scenes. His charm works on Davis and also on the audience; we certainly don't want anything bad to happen to him. But you already get that sense of dread very early, when he first unveils his macabre-looking pod teleporters. You sense he has some bad times ahead of him - you just don't know how bad. The horror is so effective because it gets really, really bad - just so much worse than you could have ever imagined.The other aspect to the story, the progress represented by a scientific breakthrough, is another element which, rather than a potential science fiction premise, becomes subverted into a tragedy of horror. Usually, a concept such as teleportation, successfully accomplished, is cause for celebration (see the Star Trek series & films for a brighter version of such technology). Here, progress such as this should probably be avoided at any cost. But, the real tragedy is Brundle's horrific bad luck, falling prey to his human failings, notably impatience. If only he'd waited another day. If only he noticed that fly. If only he'd placed some safeguard to prevent his machine from performing a function it was not intended for. The machinery here becomes a dispassionate godlike creator of monsters; the machine is not so much demonic as remorseless and unfeeling. It's a most disquieting argument against the supposed benefits of escalating technology.Or maybe it should be termed evolving technology. Brundle's rapid evolution after he first steps into the teleporter touches on some of the most primal fears associated with modern mankind: death and disease. We watch him first seemingly devolve after he first voices our primary concern ('Am I dying?'). A cancer-like affliction cripples him, and it looks like he'll fall apart into nothing soon. Only later do we realize this was only a transitory step and further horrors await our eyes as Brundle changes, changes. By this point, many viewers may want to turn away or turn it off. It's really slow death we're seeing and, unless one has sadistic tendencies, there is no compelling reason to watch. Well, unless it's to feel grateful we will never fall victim to something like this. Or will we?",9,1,2,13 December 2005
Groundhog Day," Today is Yesterday Ad Infinitum
","A fantastic premise done up with comedy and irony: when Phil (Murray) subtly hints at the beginning how repetitive his 4th time (4th year)reporting in that little town for Groundhog Day seems to be, he has no clue as to what's in store - what repetition really is. This is the amusing version of the chilling half-hour version of '12:01' where the poor guy repeats an hour. There was also a more mundane '12:01' TV movie, also with one day being repeated, which was still entertaining. But this has Murray, who besides expectedly delivering all the goods on the funny aspects of the same day premise, has to also convey some of the wistfulness and despair associated with such a dilemma. To the film's credit, the story doesn't hold back on showing the full potential of such a wild concept: Phil relives the same day for years, gaining new talents & disciplines in the process, and running through the whole gamut of emotional arcs as all that special time passes: shock, bewilderment, recklessness, debauchery, suicide (the aforementioned despair), delusions of godhood and finally a kind of serene acceptance of his strange situation - this last can be construed as 'giving in' to the cosmic joke or lesson played on him.The story has some minor weaknesses: most viewers will notice, for example, after a 2nd viewing, that Phil's music teacher is taking credit for his musical genius at the end even though, for her, only one day of teaching has occurred. Surely, Phil showed her he was very adept at the start of the lesson (unless, he feigned total ignorance of music at the start of the lesson and let her think he so improved after a couple of hours - but this leaps into silliness). There also seems to be a scene missing with respect to Phil's relationship with Rita (MacDowell). I never was clear as to how or why Phil became enamored of her and eventually in love. Of course, he must have been observing her for many days as his day repeated until he came to this realization, but still, this happens suddenly and without any hint of such feelings surfacing prior to his calling her name while making out with another woman. But, overall, the concept was well thought out and well written for this version. As with the better films with such far-out concepts, questions arise afterward - why Phil? Does this happen to other people? To many other people? To everyone at some point? When will it happen to me? It's also a convenient explanation for the deja vu syndrome.",9,0,1,18 December 2005
Reservoir Dogs," These Dogs Show Their True Colors
","White, Pink, Orange, Brown... you'll be thinking of these colors in a different way after watching this ensemble of actors act their guts out in a twisting, vibrant re-interpretation of a crime drama. Tarantino nails it; the next one, 'Pulp Fiction' was more ambitious and had more bucks, but this had the advantage of a fresh approach, a new way of presenting cinema as, dare we say it, art. The actors went along with him, all the way, to the smallest detail. Watch the end of the introductory breakfast scene, after Mr. Pink (Buscemi) explains his non-tipping philosophy. Joe (Tierney) returns to the table and commands Pink to pay up anyway and Pink finally complies. Eddie (Penn) sits very solemnly during this point, with his hands under his chin, as if in deep thought. What's he thinking about? Could it be he thinks I should've forced Pink to pay? Is it times like these when I'm still the kid and my dad's the man? This is just a 2-second shot.Examples like that may be why a film such as this gets better every time I see it. I don't remember much about what I thought of it when I first saw it back in '92; probably that it was interesting. I thought it was more interesting the 2nd time I saw it. By the 3rd time, I was thinking, this is fantastic. I've just seen it again, probably for the ninth time and it's better than ever. Returning to Penn's performance as Eddie: most fans of this film usually point out Buscemi as the comical, quick Pink, or the cool Keitel as Mr.White, or the unpredictably cool Madsen as Blonde (Blonde-what a color,eh?-you psycho!). Penn gives the performance of his career here. He switches from daddy's boy to Blonde-type menace in the space of a few frames. He's probably the most creative with Tarantino's lengthy dialog, juggling pressure from his boss/dad, supervising the cadre of crooks and trying to make phone conversations interesting. And Tierney, struggling in a B or C movie career all his long life, has the role of his lifetime here thanks to Tarantino; the entire scene of him giving out the color names to the boys couldn't have been played better.What is really thrilling, however, is how Madsen still manages to surprise and chill after all these years. I watch him now and questions start to percolate in my brain: was he on drugs when he 'acted' this role? Is he slightly insane in real life? He really is amazing here - so much so that the few years following this movie all his roles were overshadowed by this performance. I almost believe Madsen discovered a new method style of acting back then, which didn't take because no one else knew how to do it.So why not a full ten stars? I have a few problems with Roth; nothing too serious - he's dead on in some scenes, such as when he tells himself not to chicken out in the mirror; other times, he's trying hard to hide an accent or just trying too hard. Thing is, in most ways, he has the most difficult role; he has to act like a criminal being acted by someone else being acted by Roth. I'm also aware of accusations regarding the older film 'City on Fire' which hints this work may be slightly imitative of at least one sequence unlike, say 'Pulp Fiction' which, despite appearances, is wholly original. But these are quibbles in the end - if Reservoir Dogs isn't original, what is?",9,1,3,25 August 2005
The Great Raid," The Greatest Rescue in U.S.Military History
","Late January, 1945, World War II: at the point at which this film begins, the horrible toll of war has already happened - the infamous Bataan Death March, in which thousands & thousands of American & Filipino prisoners eventually died. The film, from director Dahl, doesn't shy away from impressing this point, including showing an example of Japanese military brutality in the early going - burning some prisoners alive. From the outset, we seem to be instructed, or reminded, that war is not a matter of just heroism, exciting action scenes, or battle strategy - though this is how it culminates in this particular true story of rescue. But the majority of the film concentrates on the brutality; it's not a pleasant picture of what the POWs endure, nor should it be. Likewise, there is a parallel storyline taking place in the nearby city of Manila, controlled by the Japanese, where members of an underground who smuggle medicine to prisoners are all targets of the oppressors. Quick gangster-style executions are not unusual.The aforementioned death march hangs like a pall over all the proceedings and the American military, which had ordered the soldiers to surrender, thereby inadvertently causing all their eventual deaths, seem compelled (or shamed, depending on how you see it) to mount some unusual rescue attempt of about 500 prisoners. It's mentioned that this plan has no real strategic significance, no pragmatic value; it's a decision of the heart, not the head. Specially-trained army rangers form the unit which will carry out this raid, all anxious and willing to do what is right. This is about glory all right, but not the kind we may think; it's not about publicity, cameras, medals, and so on. It's about the personal glory each soldier will feel inside, knowing he did something right. This is spelled out by Bratt's Lt. Colonel Mucci; Bratt, with whom I was familiar with for lightweight characters, surprised me in this picture. He seems to play older than he is, a man who had chosen to be a warrior and leader of men. His speech to his rangers before the mission was true-to-life and inspiring at the same time. Franco plays the captain under his command in charge of the strategy and the mission.Besides the expected interest in seeing these historical events play out, this film can be instructional, as well. I'd forgotten, for example, about the strong bond forged between the Americans and the Filipinos (the guerrilla fighters) during this struggle against the Japanese oppressors. When some might question why it's necessary to relive such past events in the context of today's completely revamped modern world (why bring up past hates, past tragedy?), it also relives & reminds of past alliances and mutual respect. Of course, I doubt any descendants of the death march victims would want such history ignored or forgotten. The DVD I acquired was packaged with the book by William Breuer.",7,4,6,22 April 2006
Pulp Fiction," Lurid-yes, Talky-sure, Creative-Absolutely, Medieval-Maybe
","It's difficult to describe Tarantino's concoction in just one paragraph or even one page - there is a denseness to it all, an intricate weave - and even though I've seen it well over a couple of times, I'm still unsure of what the next scene will be the next time I view it. That's a tribute to the plotting - this isn't a typical script, that fer sure. Many will come away from it recalling all the gabbing done by the characters - this is an indulgence of Tarantino's we are all familiar with. It's unconventional if the goal is to produce a smooth pace; the action begins, then there's a lengthy monologue or debate which should impede everything. Most of the dialog is at least cutesy-clever, but those sections are not my favorite parts of the film. There were a couple of scenes where I thought, jeez-louise I guess Quentin's not into judicious editing when it starts to drag past the 3-minute mark of the same two characters yakking away. The dialog must be sacred to him - OK, I can dig it. And hey, I'm not referring to cutting down Chris Walken's one scene, where it's understood he had to go through an entire history of a certain watch for us to understand its importance.No, for me, the great thing about all this are the plot turns in the fiction. If you're watching it for the first time, you may think you know where a scene is heading, mostly based on your past experience of watching movies. But this is a pulp novel masquerading as a movie. This isn't the movie you and your father have seen, many times over. This is, to put it mildly, unpredictable. You may think you know where Travolta's and Thurman's characters are heading to on their date, but...no, there's just no way to predict what actually happens. You may think you know what will happen to Willis's character as he returns to his apartment when he shouldn't...well, actually, by this point in the film you may not be so sure. By this point, you're probably wondering what insane twist Tarantino plans to throw at you; and, holy ma-golly, doesn't it really get insane? I don't think this can be conveniently labeled as pulpy lurid fiction, more psychotronic.This film was a starting point for many things and a turning point in film history. Travolta had his comeback; Jackson was now a made man; Willis showed he wasn't just a Moonlighting/Die Hard bozo; well, hell, the entire cast benefited - including Greene as Zed, a hard-to-forget impression in a small role. For the rest of the nineties, we were besieged by Pulp Fiction wannabee movies trying to capture the spirit of a new film term - Tarantinesque. Of course, none of them did.",9,0,1,24 May 2006
War of the Worlds," A good adrenaline rush, if nothing else
","The past week, I've read in many places (not even sure where at this point) negative opinions on this film focusing on unimportant details, like whether the force fields the aliens use were incorrectly off or on at crucial moments. Or that they're tired of Morgan Freeman's voice as God (he's not God; he speaks of God and could just be a survivor recalling this event years later; and now we're discussing this detail and missing the big picture). I get the feeling some viewers cheat themselves of a strong movie experience by looking for stuff like this throughout a film. The feeling Spielberg conveys in the first few minutes is that this really is just another typical day, as seen from the perspective of Tom Cruise's character and his kids (where it will remain for the entire film). There's nothing ominous in the air (even the TV blips of strange weather project nothing bad). It's a day like last week and it will end as just another day. There's that sameness to everything which all of the audience can relate to. Day after day, week after week, even year after year - nothing to really get excited about.When it shifts, it's a jolt. It starts with that weird lightning, pauses for a few minutes to build more tension, and then escalates to Hell on Earth within a few more. If one were to describe one of those alien tripod machines moving past a couple of blocks away, blasting with it's death beam, it would probably elicit a laugh from listeners, but there's nothing funny about how it's depicted, to Spielberg's credit; he'd learned his craft in this regard by the time of Saving Private Ryan's beach scene. When Cruise peers around the corner, a small, almost mouse-like figure, a lucky survivor of the initial onslaught, all you feel is his fear, his shock, his helplessness. The tripods even produce a bizarre musical sound, a deadly counterpoint to the notes we heard in 'Close Encounters' produced by Spielberg's friendly aliens; here, the aliens are sounding the death-knell of the human race. I must confess I'm not sure this intensity will come across so well on a small TV screen; I saw this in a theater and they turn up the sound so high, a person walking to his car across the screen is intense.So you're with Cruise and his kids the rest of the film; all your neighbors are dead; your other relatives in other cities? Maybe. You don't know. Any minute now, you may be joining the hundreds dead. No, must be thousands. Millions? No, it's too insane, too dreadful! The first act, ending with Cruise walking back to his house, numb and covered in the dust of people, and then managing to escape in the only working vehicle, is the best sequence; Spielberg can't really top it. But, the next few scenes all come pretty close in a series of heart-stoppers. The one extended scene where Spielberg, Cruise, the writer and all the participants were at a loss was being holed up with Tim Robbins; it just didn't work and slowed the picture down. And the ending? The undoing of the aliens followed along the same lines of the original climax of H.G.Wells' novel and the '53 film version. The filmmakers simply couldn't find a way to trump Wells (one of the greatest science fiction writers of all time) and why should they? The alternative is the aliens win, mankind is dead - that's another film (here, we stop at about a billion dead). But, I didn't agree with Spielberg's reverting to his usual safety net and letting the audience off the hook by miraculously saving the son (ok, there's always a chance he could have survived, but this was a set-up). This was a war, perhaps the most terrible war, and people don't just pop up without a scratch after something like this, unless it's a, well, a Spielberg-type movie. Spielberg, Spielberg, even when you got it - for 90% of the film - you lose it in the end. Now let's all hug each other and wish away any more possible alien attacks. Sigh.",7,1,3,25 July 2005
The Green Mile," The Long Mile of Hanks & Darabont
","The adaptation of the Stephen King serial novel is given the A-class treatment by Frank Darabont, the same guy who did The Shawshank Redemption(1994), which has gained a great rep since the nineties ended. With a running time of 3 hours, plus the end credits, the pic needs to keep the viewer's attention on an above-average story - which it does. Darabont's style reminds me mostly of Stanley Kubrick's, another Director who tended towards long films. Somehow, Darabont manages to imbue almost every scene with some point of interest, whether it's Hanks' decent everyman struggling with more out-of-the-ordinary scenarios & decisions, or the nearly magical mouse which piques our curiosity in the prison (where much of the story takes place). Of course, it helps to have Hanks as the main actor to carry the picture. The sense of magic is what gives the story that extra lift. King's characters are transposed to the screen with empowering iconic attributes - the basics of humanity are represented in the guards & prisoners: strength, fear, sadism, grief, regret, compassion - all revolving about the 2 big basics of good vs. evil. How they all respond to the signs of magic touching their lives is what attracts the viewer's interest. Since it's not really grounded in reality, the pic sets up the comeuppance of the traditional 'bad guy' (a truly scummy guard) to satisfy the viewer's sense of justice, in ways we know will never happen in our cynical real life.",8,0,2,23 July 2005
Stalag 17," Enduring the Confinement as Prisoner of War
","'Tis the X-Mas season, but it's inside a German prisoner-of-war camp, filled with belly-aching Americans, during World War II. Holden is the camp opportunist, the conman, the guy lookin' for an angle - any angle - for himself. He orchestrates stuff like in-camp horse races, using mice as the subs for horsies. He's the one with the chest full of prime stuff, while everyone else slogs their way through with nary a cooked egg to their name. But Holden's wily ways catch up to him: his cynicism and willingness to bet on men failing to escape earn him the enmity of almost everyone in the camp. And when it becomes apparent that there is an informer among the men, probably selling info to the Germans, he naturally becomes the prime suspect. This soon earns him a beating and a reputation lower than the lowest rat. His only option: ferret out the real informer and clear his own name. There ain't much to celebrate for any of these jokers, having to spend the Holiday in prison overseas. Director Billy Wilder, known for his comedies, instills a sense of humor in scenes involving the German guards, to the point of making them all look clownish. In this day, this calls to mind the TV Series 'Hogan's Heroes' - a comparison I'm sure the filmmakers did not have in mind. So, amid the death & drudgery, we have a few laughs. I've always found Holden to be miscast in the prime role; he seems much too stolid and heroic-looking to be the weasel here. Based on a famous play.",7,1,5,27 May 2006
The Shawshank Redemption," You'd be Obtuse not to Appreciate This Fable
","This film, a modern fable, is an amazing success story - not in monetary terms, but in terms of reputation. It began as just another of many dramas, in this case based on a Stephen King story, and has emerged as possibly the best film of the decade, the '90s (#2 of the IMDb top 250 as of this writing, right up there with The Godfather!). The story begins as another prison drama but gradually metamorphoses into a poetic commentary on friendship and the scope of life. The main character (Robbins) is sent to prison in the late forties for supposedly murdering his wife. It really is a men's picture; there are literally no female characters (the wife appears for a few seconds early on in flashback and that's about it, besides a complaining shopper later; oh, and, of course, Rita Hayworth pops in as herself). The film holds many surprises in store for the viewer as the story progresses, not the least of which is the subtle revelation, towards the end, that the main character may just be Freeman's (how appropriate is that name!). If one had to pick one reason for this film's success (and there are probably several), it's that it's probably the best depiction of friendship between men on celluloid - no cutesy buddy-buddy stuff, no homo-erotic connotations - just a solid, adult basis for two men to bond over and remain friends.But there are many other, I dare say, cool aspects to the film. Most everyone who has seen this has at least two or three favorite scenes which they remember forever and which they watch over and over. My personal favorite is the one on the roof, where Andy (Robbins) makes his bid for a slightly better existence, taking a big risk with the captain of the guards (Clancy Brown, always intimidating). It's a turning point in the picture and shows two important matters recurring through it: taking a risk and using your intelligence. Andy turns out to be very smart; he's always using his head. And the ultimate switchback of the picture, the comeuppance of the evil warden (Bob Gunton, excellent as scum dressed in pricey suits), shows you that a film doesn't need a standard shootout to depict the ultimate justice or retribution. No, if you use your brains, you can really get back at those oppressive forces seeking to dehumanize you, abuse you, and lord over you. Boy, can you get them back. I mean really - has there ever been a bigger turnaround in the history of cinema? OK, maybe this is why this film is rated so high - you just can't get a better release from frustration than this, not on film. Here, payback isn't just a bitch - she's the daughter of Satan sent to take you to hell.Another thing to mention is that this film covers about 20 years of time. That's a long stretch. The film itself is over 2 hours running time. Most films, even the best ones, with so much to cover, can't help but sag in places, especially historical pieces. But that's not the case here. Writer-director Darabont, who also worked on the even longer 'The Green Mile' later, shows us how to create films which are always interesting to watch, whether at the one hour or 2-hour mark. Or am I being obtuse?",9,0,1,7 January 2006
Back to the Future Part II," Time Traveling can be a Real Headache
","Many critics of this sequel probably find this effort unnecessary and others may just find it overly confusing. The streamlined, comparatively simple plot of the first 'Back to the Future'(85) gives way here to a messy 'to and fro' time travel angle in which the heroes just can't seem to get it right. With the audience needing to concentrate all their energy on keeping track of the plot twists, much of the entertainment value could be lost. There's validity to this argument; however, I, for one, admire dense plotting, especially in science fiction tales - the more complex, the better, I say. It shows me someone was making the effort and wanted the viewer to wrap his mind around concepts not usually encountered.In this follow-up, Marty (Fox) goes to his future (year 2015 or 30 years in his future) to help his own son. As usual, the filmmakers overestimated progress, since we now know the flying cars in this future will not come about 10 years from now. The motivations seem haphazard; in the 1st pic, Marty went back in time by accident; here, he and the Doc purposely travel in time and manage to make a mess of things. Their arch-nemesis, Biff (Wilson), steals a future book back to 1955 and changes the course of history. The revised 'present' of 1985 becomes a nightmarish surreal world of anarchy and decay. With us so far? Now the heroes again go back to 1955 to correct things. Here's where things get really messy: Marty & the Doc are running around in 1955 while their counterparts from the 1st Back to the Future are also there in the background doing their thing. So now we're seeing the same scenes of the previous film from a slightly new perspective (from the p.o.v.of this movie's Marty & Doc).Wow. The filmmakers either wanted to dazzle the audience or drive them insane with this mind-warping running about. The drawback to the final 3rd of the movie is that most viewers will expend all their energy trying to remember scenes of the first film. But you really have to admire the creative attempt of metaphysically snaking back to the events of the previous film, seeing it from the inside out. Even if the whole Back to the Future trilogy becomes needlessly complex thanks to this chapter. The next & final sequel was filmed at the same time as this and was more back to basics.",7,0,1,12 March 2006
Carrie," Taking the Wrong Girl to the Prom
","This is what it boiled down to, isn't it? Taking the wrong girl at the wrong time to the wrong place. By today's standards, this is a classy approach to depicting horror on screen. It builds on the theme of alienation, taken to the Nth degree by circumstances surrounding the sad short life of Carrie White (Spacek). I think it actually improves on some of the points raised in Stephen King's novel. The scorn Carrie endures from her classmates is apparent from the first minute of the film (and who can forget the traumatic shower scene?), but the adults are all presented as clueless dullards, as well. It's a highly disturbing scene when Carrie is attacked by the other girls for her sexual ignorance, but the subtext of sexual repression extends to the scene after the shower, where the school principal gets distracted by the close proximity of the attractive female coach (Buckley), causing him to repeatedly get Carrie's name wrong. Carrie's anguished reaction triggers the early use of her potentially deadly telekinetic powers (powers surfacing after her first period).Everyone's actions, including those of the sympathetic coach, are really geared around being self-serving. The coach is intent on punishing Carrie's classmates with a form of torture, possibly out of guilt for behaving the same way when she was in high school. She makes herself feel better by enforcing this punishment on younger versions of herself. The one good girl (Irving) also decides to help Carrie out of guilt, to make herself feel better. No one really thinks about Carrie herself and this proves to be to everyone's downfall. They happened to pick the wrong girl to mess with - very bad luck all around. The first two acts, a build up to the climactic prom sequence, are just a preparation. We wait for things to go to hell at the prom and they do. The sequence is not very frightening by today's standards. Mostly, you see a water hose go out of control, and director dePalma employs split screens to diffuse the action. Then the two main culprits (Allen & Travolta) are attended to and this revenge (or justice) is also lacklustre.But then we're back at Carrie's house and with her truly creepy mom (Laurie). Ms.White is what actually made the film a shudder to watch, a very unsettling depiction of religious madness. The true climax is Carrie's final confrontation with her mother and it'll stay with the viewer for awhile, whether they like it or not. Then the real shock, the epilogue dream with Irving. If I had to pick the one scariest jolt in all filmdom, it's this. Even watching it repeatedly, knowing what's coming, still makes the hairs on my neck stand up uncontrollably.",7,0,1,13 November 2005
Tombstone," Earps & Doc vs.Mean Cowboys as early Organized Crime
","A late entry in the western genre when already not too many were being made, this is one of those re-watchable mini-epics, with strong entertainment value. It begins with a bang, an intense shoot-out after some supposedly historical footage narrated by actor Mitchum. We are introduced to The Cowboys, this era's version of the Mafia, led by the charismatic Curly Bill (Boothe). These first few minutes manage to unnerve and surprise the audience right away: we are also introduced to the psychotic gunslinger, Ringo (Biehn), but he's revealed as the most dangerous of the bunch only after the shoot-out, a sleight of hand by the filmmakers - they made him look sympathetic in those early moments while everyone is blasting away and he just stands there looking dazed and bothered. Only afterward do we realize he's a lethal lunatic of the damned - it's a powerful beginning.It's amazing how well this film turned out considering all the rumors of a troubled history. Credit must be given to director Cosmatos and the actors. It's a fairly huge cast, with numerous speaking roles, and everyone seems to have at least one good moment during the story. Then there's Kilmer as Doc, who is good or great in every scene he's in - this is easily Kilmer's best role. Doc is already sick as the movie begins but he manages to stay in the game to the very end, more dangerous than any 2 cowboys, using supernatural willpower & sardonic wit to distract everyone and himself from the fact he's nearly a walking ghost. Russell is just super-solid as Wyatt; he conveys a strength, tapped from unknown sources (whereas Doc draws from within), standing tall when other tough guys quake in the knees. These two make a terrific team; it's not the usual buddy stuff of most pictures. All the supporting cast is fine, including Elliott and Paxton as Wyatt's brothers, though there are some overly obvious moments. Earp's on - off relationship with the actress (Delany) has its ups & downs, there's not much room for subtlety as Earp's wife looks on quite upset as Delany strikes another of her bemused expressions. Also, due to the large number of characters, some of their stories have a heavily truncated feel (Priestley's, for example). The Vista director's cut special edition DVD has some restored footage to improve this problem. The better scenes are the confrontations between the men, the threats swung high & low, and the sheer thrill of watching Russell slap an overweight Billy Bob Thornton silly.And we have the villains, ah yes, the villains. I've already mentioned a couple of them - another one is Lang as Ike Clanton in a deliciously cheesy, hammy yet mesmerizing performance. By the last 3rd of the movie, I was so wishing he would get his - please, someone - Earp, Holliday, anyone ! - blow this bastard away! Ike is one of the great unsung villains of movie history, a tribute to Lang's abilities. The conflict in this true-life story stemmed from the notion that there were no real villains. It was a matter of which faction had the rights, based on gun power and political ambition. In other words, the Earps were just making a political power play in the view of some and there was little difference between them and The Cowboys. But this film wastes no time in establishing Wyatt and his brothers as the decent side of the coin and when you have characters like Ike, there's no mistaking which side are the bad guys. For a different take on this piece of history, check out the original Star Trek episode 'Spectre of the Gun' from '68. Oh yeah, there are also other films like the Lancaster - Douglas opus from 1957. But the Gunfight at the OK Corral in 'Tombstone' was just one set piece out of many.",8,44,57,26 May 2006
Casino Royale," Bond Has Himself a Tough Beginning
","This is where we have to begin now, isn't it - as far as the Bond mythology on film. Here - in a black&white prologue, as if we're back in the Cold War. We're somewhere in Prague, actually, where Bond earns his double-0 credentials. Now we're off and running, with the presumed-missing familiar gun-barrel, of this new Bond firing in our eyes and now in full color, the usual eye-catching credits. There was some trepidation in those first few seconds, that this restart, this new beginning would take us too far from the familiar Bond territory, but we worried needlessly. We're still with the slick spy/assassin concept, the blunt instrument with some cold cunning and extraordinary luck attached. If anything, the first major action set piece after the credits in this Bond adventure showcases one aspect of Bond better than all the previous ones, right off the bat (at least matching the best of Connery), thanks to the script and actor Craig: Bond's relentlessness. We're smacked by this in short order as he chases some bad guy who seemingly possesses superhuman tendons, leaping among girders and buildings like some Spider-man super-villain. Bond, as in good shape as he is, can't match this guy in the speed department, but he'll catch him anyway. He is relentless. See, that's 007. Not 001 or 005. Lucky number 007, possessed or driven by some possibly psychotic need to win, no matter the consequences.Is Bond as good as chief villain Le Chiffre at cards? He can't be. It's established that Le Chiffre is some sort of mathematical genius. Yet, Le Chiffre resorts to poisoning Bond and still loses (not giving anything away here - this plot point, besides being in the novel, was already dramatized way back in the '54 TV version and in the '67 comedy version). You can't stop Bond, that's part of his charm. Not that you can't give it a good try. And quite a few people do, as we've come to expect. But, Bond doesn't slip through these lethal attempts very smoothly in this one, i.e. without a scratch, reflecting the fact that this is an early adventure. He's a superior agent, obviously (as contrasted with another one in the first act), but he's in the really big leagues now. He's extra proficient, very capable, sharp, quick and even smooth already, but lacks that bit of seasoning which, in some clever moments, seems to throw off his timing just that tiny bit - and he usually ends up with quite a few scratches. Actually, Bond looks 90% dead or too near death throughout half this picture, an extreme version of 'learning-on-the-job' pitfalls, and that's where his determination comes in. In the other half of the film, he seems simply unstoppable. He is relentless. There's even a suggestion that he enjoys some of the pain to be endured in such an occupation ('that which does not kill me..') and there's a genuinely uncomfortable torture scene, especially for male viewers. It takes the usual sadism present in Bond pictures to another level.The plot follows the original Ian Fleming novel for the most part: Bond's central assignment is to beat the main villain at poker (not Bacarrat, as in the original story, an acknowledgment of where 21st century interests lie). Le Chiffre, a dead-eyed, rather soulless sourpuss, funds terrorists, and taking his money assures some points for M's department. Dench is back as M, even though she's over 10 years older than herself in 'Goldeneye,' which presumably took place later than this mission. But, such quibbles have no real place in considering Bond logistics. Bond, after all, is timeless, an immortal hero, and even though this is regarded as an origin story of sorts, the usual weaknesses of such tales is evaded by not stressing such ideas; there are just subtle hints and an overall casual air for most of the film, placing this in the same general limbo of all the other Bond missions. The film does veer into unexpected territory in the final act, involving Bond's relationship with Vesper, who did not fit very well into the standard femme fatale role; she somehow manages to drag Bond out of his steadfast persona briefly, as well. We can rationalize that all the constant pummeling Bond endured in the first three quarters of the story enabled this startling yet hard-to-believe twist; we can even regard this as another learning experience for a still-young Bond, in terms of reading people; but, how can he not know himself by this stage? Well, at least it was a brief aberration. Craig got all the nuances right, otherwise: he was grim when 'in the moment' of the job and relaxed when chatting with an ally, projecting a fearsome intelligence in all cases. He'll be back. Until then, watch 'Dr.No' next. Bond:10 Villain:8 Femme Fatale:7 Henchmen:7 Leiter:9 Fights:10 Stunts/Chases:10 Gadgets:6(blasted cellphones) Auto:9 Locations:9 Pace:10 overall:9-",9,0,1,12 May 2007
Speed," You'll Feel the Need to Feed on Speed!
","If viewing this film for the first time, you should get a powerful visceral experience which is all too rare today. In fact, I'd venture to say that this is one of the last movies to offer full-fledged excitement before current computer FX overwhelmed Hollywood so that all action films now have a veil of superficiality covering everything (yes, 'Speed' also had computer FX, but they were surreptitious back then). I'd say, around the mid-nineties, after 'Seven' or so, all the action films became closer to computer games rather than actual action-adventure FILMS. 'Speed' was, in many ways, a last gasp of film action in the pure sense - you feel that pulse of the old-style slam-bang dazzle right from the opening credits, moving down an elevator shaft which could be a computer simulation, but immediately it gives way to classic jeopardy involving flesh-and-blood villains (Hopper), sweaty victims-in-peril, and sweatier tough cops-as-heroes (Reeves, Daniels) coping with horrendous dilemmas. OK, some of the modern bland action thrills already pervaded this thriller, but it's still much too real compared to all the silly moving pictures pervading our theaters in the 21st century.This is also that rare film which really never has a slow moment. Some might label that aspect as unrealistic, but this is what it was meant to be - it's de Bont's finest hour; he was a director of photography before this and produced only adequate pictures after this. Somehow, he captured a perfect formula for this, his inaugural stewardship. It's great for a first viewing, but I was caught up in watching this several times in the nineties, to try and duplicate those visceral shocks a 2nd & 3rd time. I also found it was one of those movies I could watch with a couple of other people in the room and get caught up in the excitement as a group experience - there was never time to speak of other matters during some slow spots, as in during most other films. We, meaning the audience, are on that bus with the passengers after the first half-hour and for the next hour of a super-ride that everyone needs to experience at least once in their lifetime. And you'll probably want to give it a try at least one more time afterward.Reeves' performance as the hero is an aberration for his film career. All the reasons to be mystified by his success in movies or his penchant for slow-witted, laughable characters are missing. He'd had a chance to play a straight action hero before, in 'Point Break,' but he was an older boy there; here he's a young man, a coiled spring built in the mold of serious action heroism. When he threatens the deranged villain, there's no chance to mock his style, to be amused at his efforts at intensity - he's a lethal, dangerous figure here. I almost believe now that some substitute for Reeves was placed in most of his scenes here, since he never returned to such effective presence. Then, of course, we have Bullock. This was where her impish quality, with some moxie thrown in, got its greatest workout - no surprise at all that she became a big star after this. To say that she manages the perfect note in all her scenes is...well, let's just leave it at that. Plummer in a brief role as the jaguar driver - priceless! (He returned in the weak sequel, against all odds). Hopper and Daniels, as well as Morton, lend great support, as do all the supporting players on the bus (Ruck and the big guy playing Ortiz stand out). And speaking of the bus... I state now and for the record, no movie has ever utilized a bus to better effect - ever!",9,0,0,20 April 2006
X2: X-Men United," They are gods among insects
","The sequel to X-Men(2000) is a slicker, more complex vision, expanding on the groundwork laid out in the first one. It lacks the raw energy busting out in the first X-Men, which introduced all the major characters, so here we're sort of coming into the middle of a story. The first scene in the White House (intro Nightcrawler by Cumming, very effective) actually mirrors the original aspects of the first film, but after that, you see Wolverine (Jackman) briefly on a quest in snow country, then ambling back to the X-Mansion. You already know all about him and his friends at Xavier's place. It's almost like the 2nd episode of a TV series, with a $100 million budget.The film seems to lack a focal point, which, in the first, was Magneto (McKellen) as the master villain planning a super-terrorist act. Here, Magneto is forced to briefly team up with the X-Men and the only villain is a lowly obsessive human (Cox as Striker, very good, as usual). A strong theme, however, emerges. The mutants in this film are hinted at and depicted as even more powerful than believed by comparison to the first film. Magneto spells it out in conversation with young recruit Pyro; in his view, mutants are gods among the human insects, who are just bothersome. Professor X (Stewart) especially, is revealed as capable of wiping out the entire planet's population under the right (or wrong) circumstances. Even without the help of special machinery, he can affect crowds of normal people effortlessly. It's a scary and exciting subtext to the usual super-heroics. It also shows that maybe normal humans have a right to be fearful and untrusting of these superior beings.Another strong point to the film is the further development of many of the characters. More of Magneto's and Mystique's relationship is subtly revealed. Rogue & Iceman try to expand on their's. Wolverine, again, is hi-lited, more of his past is explained. After the wild action in the first scene with the President (adding epic scope to the story), we have to wait for the big fight between Wolverine & Deathstrike (Hu) for a similar adrenaline rush - and it's a doozy, surprisingly vicious and energetic. It's this scene where we get to see Wolvie unleashed, not the earlier one in the Mansion with the soldiers, which is somewhat subdued and darkened. With so many characters, it's not surprising that at least one would get short shrift, in this case Cyclops (Marsden), who disappears for half the film. But that's not really to the film's detriment. It does slow a bit in spots around the middle, tho not seriously. I think the only ones who would actually be let down by this entry are viewers whose expectations were way too high, such as expecting hordes of Sentinels to run rampant over the world.",8,0,0,3 September 2005
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The Best of Sci-Fi Times,the Worst of sf Times
","Though now known as 'Episode IV-A New Hope,' for many of us, namely those of us who first saw this exhilarating entertainment in theaters back in '77, this will always be the first 'Star Wars.' We will always think of it as just 'Star Wars' - plain & simple, no pretensions, no aspirations to deep film-making or high art. This is where we first met them all: Luke, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi (old 'Ben'), Chewbacca, the 2 robots C3PO & R2D2 and, of course, Darth Vader. They were instant pop culture icons; you got the sense you'd seen them before somewhere, but were sure this wasn't possible. But they'd been there before in our minds. We'd read about them constantly in science fiction novels and short stories - tales of outer space civilizations, of spaceships zooming through asteroid belts, of exotic-looking aliens hanging around space ports. We'd dream about them at night and try to imagine ourselves in their midst; up until then, we could only imagine such things - there were no projected images to realize such dreams. 'Forbidden Planet' from 1956 came close, and then there were the 'Star Trek' and 'Lost in Space' TV series, both hampered by dime store budgets and cheesy sets. We ate 'em up since there was nothing else. Then Lucas made it real.I remember when I first got wind of the upcoming movie, to open in May of 1977, I think. I saw the first publicized poster and bought the novel adaptation. On the poster, a young man stood with some light sword raised, a princess at his feet, numerous spaceships flying all over the place. I was in my mid-teens and felt the first pulse of building excitement as I realized all those fantastic tales I'd been reading the past few years were going to come alive on the big screen for me. It didn't disappoint. Luke Skywalker, who stood in for all the boys pretending to be on a galactic adventure, gets swept away from his mundane desert home smack dab into the middle of an honest-to-gosh galaxy-wide civil war! The strength of the narrative is / was amazing. There are no slow spots and you can't wait for the next scene during the entire experience; and, experience is the better description for it, rather than just 'movie.' You can't wait, for example, for the moment when Luke actually meets the princess; what will happen then? It's a textbook case of an exciting narrative and what I believe makes this superior to all the sequels (knowing that many feel 'The Empire Strikes Back' is superior - I must disagree).The one character you really can't wait to see again is the ominous Vader, naturally. The instant he steps into view during the first few minutes of the story, you just know this is the ultimate villain. This is the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool, the supreme uber-evildoer of the entire galaxy. You just know it by his stance, by his attitude, and by the electric chill that runs through your frail form as he steps down the corridor, moving into the annals of film history with one fell swoop. You can't wait to see what he does next, what nefarious action will send someone or some planet to its doom. Sure, he seems under the control of Tarkin (Cushing) here and later, the Emperor, but you just know he's simply biding his time until he takes over the whole damn universe. There is no precedent for Vader, and nothing close to him after. He's at his best here where there's still much mystery attached to his dark frightful form, a minion of Satan and Nazi stormtroopers all rolled into one.This was also the movie-experience which catapulted Harrison Ford (Solo) into superstardom. He seems almost childish here, not really straining to create a character, and it's this flip charm that makes it work, against all odds. He really does appear to have stepped out of the pages of some juvenile space opera, laser guns blazing, all snide remarks and foolhardy bravado. But he also becomes the older brother figure to Luke, who cannot carry the story by himself. Hamill, whose movie career began & ended with Luke, epitomizes the center of destiny for a galaxy. Both humble and arrogant, he's perfect in the role. Fisher's main surprise is that she's not all sugar and sweet as one would expect of a princess. These three characters evolved in the next two films, but they were always at their best here, icons given life for a short period - but also forever in film. The same could be said for Alec Guinness as Kenobi, a first class act all the way. You almost believe this elderly warrior could topple an empire, given enough time. Unless he runs into Vader...",9,139,184,25 December 2005
Fantastic Four," Frivolous Four aren't quite Doomed
","Let's be clear: this is the 2nd live-action version on this original quartet since they first appeared in the 1961 comic book. It doesn't matter to me that the 1st version (early nineties) was never released. Marvel now has two (2) tries at this and they nearly flubbed it again (much like with The Punisher). It's not quite the deal breaker a lot of fans believe it to be, with just enough of the spirit and accuracy for the characters to pass the grade. Just. My main problem is not with the four heroes, but the villain.Chiklis as The Thing/Grimm is great. He grumbles & groans as I've always imagined he would if stepping out from the 4-color pages. They may want to evolve the suit in the sequel a bit. He provides half the humor. The other half is provided by Evans as The Torch. Not quite the Johnny Storm of the books, but there's just enuff there with his repartee with Grimm and his kid brother standing with Sue. Frankly, I found the comic book Johnny kind of boring when he wasn't arguing with Grimm. And yes, I don't like Evans' buzz-cut, but oh well. Alba as Susan & Gruffudd as Reed have been getting a bad rap; I think this is fallout from the other two having all the best lines and scenes (gee, sort of like in the comic books!). Alba's performance was not embarrassing and, yes, she was bossy in a scene or two - playing Johnny's older sister, as in the comic books. Gruffudd was overly awkward as a young scientist lacking social skills but he was always less colorful, character-wise, in the books. Some of the later writers (after Stan Lee) in the books (in the eighties) made him even more boring than he is here. And, it was telling, in the final battle scene, that Reed did take command (finally).And now we come to the villain, as essayed by McMahon. Dr.Doom is, was and will be the greatest super-villain ever created by the biggest comic book company in the world. Here is where the film falls into travesty, from which there is no redemption. By contrast with the books, we have Von Doom as interpreted by a TV actor who doesn't alter his performance one iota from the characters he played in Nip/Tuck & Charmed. All right, some may argue, what if an audience has never seen those TV series for comparison. Sorry, no can do. McMahon shows he has no range whatsoever; forget 'limited range' - NO range! His inflections & line readings are the same, regardless of what the scene calls for. It's all done with the same, slightly smarmy tone. There was nothing to be done with his actual voice, I suppose, but, perhaps, if Doom returns in a sequel, it's not necessary to have the same actor. Let's have Doom possess a commanding, domineering voice, as he was meant to. And, most of all, let's have his motivations be correct; none of this lusting for Sue, this petty griping about money. That's just not Doom - it's some Doombot or his loser cousin.The problems with Doom outweigh some of the liberties taken with the FF's history. I would've given almost anything to see the FF crash-land a space shuttle in a deserted area after exposure to the rays in space, as visualized in my mind for 35 years. I could've done without Grimm's wife, a clumsy attempt by writers to give The Thing more angst. I don't know why the screenplay was unable or unwilling to just start with Doom in Latveria (picture Doom seated on his throne as news of the FF breaks out: 'Hm, I'll have to delay my plan for global conquest until I dispose of these 4 clownish freak-isms.'). But, those are all the breaks and just quibbles. At least they managed to include Willie Lumpkin. As entertainment, this FF film outstrips The Hulk(03) handily and is not quite up there with X-Men(2000). Hopefully a sequel will move things up a notch, influenced more by some Jack Kirby spectacle.",6,1,3,20 July 2005
The Great Escape," A Great Escape to the Movies!
","This film can make the 'greatest' list in so many categories, it's unbelievable! Greatest War Film; greatest chase; greatest historical piece; and let's begin with the greatest cast: I don't see too many surveys done on which film has the best overall cast, but this one must be it. McQueen - the king of cool and number one star with this film; Garner - almost as cool as McQueen; Attenborough - never utilized better than as Big X, the Brit stiff upper lip; Bronson - future superstar as a steady presence; Coburn - insolent mod sixties before it was chic; Pleasence - the quiet English reserve masking a powerhouse character; McCallum - before taking over TV with superspy Solo. And the beauty of it was, they were all packed together in one spot (one camp), plotting and scheming together until the inevitable chasing began.This is the perfect adventure film and is endowed with an aura of greatness because it's based on real facts during the greatest war in the history of the world. It made a real impression on me when I saw it as a kid. I was fascinated by all the chief characters as they were introduced, all seemingly trapped forever in a cycle of escape and capture (as I was very young at the time, the length of World War II seemed like half a lifetime to me). Forced into such an existence, each character became an expert - not only in the art of escape - but in other esoteric disciplines, as well. In a way, the story comes across as an ideal game to a boy: the good guys are the best at what they do and must match wits with their captors, the bad Nazis. There's a lot of tension built up right from the start (as McQueen and others try their first escape attempts on the first day) but it's the planning by the prisoners, which we are privy to, that provides a truly interesting film experience. Some of the solutions they come up with are ingenious.And then, the 3rd act, the actual escape. Where one usually expects a film so strong in the beginning and middle to bog down a bit, this one just explodes all over Germany. Though I've seen McQueen's mad dash on the motorcycle 15 times by now, it's still as thrilling as ever. But it's not just him; you follow along with many of the escapees in their clever, sometimes desperate bids for freedom. Again, it's a great game, but the possibilities and consequences can have a tremendous impact.",10,1,3,27 August 2005
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Zooming Through Those Asteroid Belts
","Episode 5, or the middle one of the first (now second?) trilogy of the Star Wars saga, has a great rep these days. It wasn't met with the same delight when it first came out in 1980 and I still don't believe it's quite as good as the original Star Wars (or episode 4-A New Hope). Somehow, despite a much larger budget, the epic scope and fabulous feel of a new universe (a new galaxy far away) is not quite there with this entry. Maybe you can accomplish such a feeling only once. The rebels and heroes flit from the icy world of Hoth through an asteroid belt and end up in the cloud city of Bespin, but it strikes me as a very small, enclosed universe here. I also noted some overacting on the part of the main characters during the first sequence on Hoth, especially from Ford and Fisher - or maybe their lines were just poorly written. The easygoing charm of the first film was gone; yes, this episode was meant to be darker, more somber by comparison. But that doesn't mean the characters need to be awkward, rough shadows of their previous incarnations.This filmed episode seems to copy the adventure serials of the bygone era (the '30s & '40s) a bit too literally - note the abundant use of 'wipes' as transitions from scene to scene. It switches back and forth, back and forth, from the heroes, to Vader in his usual dark mood, to Luke meeting Yoda - not the smooth narrative of the first film. Each individual scene, of course, is a success, usually spectacular. The FX were state-of-the-art for the time. The Empire's vast vessels look great, inside and out. The entire sequence in the asteroid belt is almost mind-blowing. Then they meet Lando, played by Billy Dee Williams, who doesn't make an easy fit; he seems to hold back, saying his lines through a clenched jaw, as if saving himself for a better performance later. The entire story here appears to be a prep for when Vader encounters Luke helmet-to-face, or at least to when Vader first shows up at the cloud city and snatches Han's laser pistol.There are some nice touches, as well, with repetitive motifs, which usually can be tiresome but add a flavor of sophistication here. I especially liked Vader's method of replacing his admirals and captains - he wastes no time and makes it clear he really will not be trifled with. In fact, it says something that the more interesting scenes take place on the Empire's ships, with the villains - this seems to happen when the villains are well done. Williams' score, including the Empire's theme march, is fantastic. Of course, almost everything hinges on the connection between Vader and Luke, a hidden aspect of which remained secret until the very end of this chapter. It's a startling revelation that remains possibly the biggest surprise for an audience in film history and, to this day, when I hear Vader utter those words, a familiar chill still races through me. Next up it was wrapped up in episode 6-Return of the Jedi(83).",8,0,1,21 May 2006
Gladiator," Roar of Battle, the Roar of Crowds
","Ridley Scott brings his stylistic sense to the historical epic in this recreation of the Roman Empire at its zenith. This time frame is actually ahead of the usual one with Julius Caesar that we're mostly used to seeing and actually takes place, I believe, during the same time as the elder epic 'The Fall of the Roman Empire'(64). By the title and the hearsay, you'd expect the story to revolve around gladiatorial combat in the arena, but though some of the significant scenes do take place there, the scope encompasses all of Rome and its surrounding provinces. The beginning is a lengthy sequence depicting a final battle in the war against Germania, a brutal & staggering depiction of two armies in combat. It's here that director Scott presents the flavor of what the viewer will become accustomed to as the picture progresses: important people, important events, important decisions - set to an epic scale, of course.But it's the people portion of the formula that dominates what could have been just another epic. Maximus (Crowe), a Roman general at the start of the pic, makes it clear very early where his priorities lie: with his wife & son, whom he hasn't seen in over two years. Yet, he's also intensely loyal to the empire and the emperor (Harris). We realize he's caught between the two responsibilities at this early stage of the film and it's not a simple dilemma; priorities must be weighed, possible impacts both personal & political. Although a decision is taken out of his hands, we see that it's not a simple solution of 'well, i'll go home' as he desired which would have dictated his actions. There's real intelligence to the script by this point. Crowe won the Oscar for his part and though he probably was more deserving for a couple of other films, it's easy to see how he carried the picture here.The supporting cast is first rate. Phoenix as Commodus, the new emperor who takes the decision out of Maximus' hands, does not come across as a standard villain, despite his actions (patricide, lusting for his sister, sadistic murder). You see him make revolting faces during the gladiatorial games, reveling in the blood spilled, and of course you think, what a grotesque villain. Yet, in other scenes he is quite pitiful - it's astonishing we can feel any sympathy for this wretch, but Phoenix plays the 'daddy should have loved me' angle to the hilt - and it works. The no.1 position in the empire dictates that the holder cannot trust anyone, it's so true; no one seems more alone than Phoenix throughout the film. Oliver Reed hams it up a bit as an arena entertainer, but it is Reed, a fitting final role. There's a lot a class spread out among the remainder of the cast - Harris, Jacobi, Hemmings all lend some gravitas, and Connie Nielsen is very good in a truly regal role.Since much of this film involves gladiatorial combat, I must at least mention the fighting scenes in the various arenas. They are very well done. But they're probably not the main reason to see the picture.",9,2,3,5 September 2005
Back to the Future," When Time Traveling, Avoid Your Parents
","There aren't too many time travel movies around, mainly because 'The Time Machine,' 'The Time Travelers' and 'Time After Time' films pretty much covered the subject. Then 'Star Trek' used up the premise in its TV episodes and films, and there was even that 'Time Tunnel' TV series in the mid-sixties. One option was to do such a movie with humor, pointing out the potentially absurd ramifications of traveling to your own past. So the main character of Marty McFly (Fox) ends up meeting his own parents when they were his age. Though this is a relatively tame comedy as far as teenage comedies of the eighties, there is the risky Oedipal element of Marty's own mother having the hots for him. This concept is then tossed aside near the end when, in a rather lame scene, his mom stops her advances because she suddenly feels like she's kissing her own brother. Disney should've went with this after all - it's possibly the least offensive picture of the decade and probably also explains its huge popularity - everyone could enjoy it.What elevates this above the common film are a few things: Glover's performance as Marty's father, both in younger & older incarnations, is deliriously eccentric; where everyone else is kind of in TV-movie mode, he's off in his own zone and hard to forget. There's an energy to the entire story thrust (from director Zemeckis), helped by Fox, who always seems anxious about something. The concept of time travel itself gets a clever redux here; we find out you can actually change reality in the present by your actions in the past - there's no mention of creating a parallel universe, for example. The ending is pretty strong, throwing in an extra whammy when we think things are over and everything is back to exactly the way it was. And it's very entertaining to watch Marty explore the fifties - we see through his eyes - the culture shock and making various connections between the older and new decades is a nice routine. There were also a couple of wildly funny moments involving Marty dressed up as an alien from outer space.",8,2,3,12 March 2006
