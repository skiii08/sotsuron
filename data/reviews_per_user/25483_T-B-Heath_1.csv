The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," An Emotional Accumulation
","I had spent almost an entire year waiting for Breaking Dawn Part 1. Ever since viewing Eclipse I'd anticipated the next film in the series, frequently browsing google for any updates on the film, on what new information, stills had been released about it. So when the film was finally released, I was shocked at the mass negative reception it received. Only a few days later did I myself get to make my own judgement - I loved it! It's been almost a week now since having seen the film for myself - it is still with me. You know a film is great, or at least entertaining, engaging, because it sticks with you psychologically. The emotions you feel, the senses you feel whilst watching the film stay with you afterwards. This was definitely the case with Breaking Dawn Part 1.The Twilight Series are not a set of perfectly made films - though I would certainly proclaim them to be worthy adaptations of the literature that preceded them (I haven't read any of Meyer's novels, save for a few extracts here and there - I still stick firmly to this opinion). None of them are perfect - there's a number of things wrong with New Moon, with Eclipse, and yes, with Breaking Dawn Part 1. However, the things that are wrong, misguided about Breaking Dawn - with any of the Twilight films for that matter - are so unimportant and outweighed by the successes of the films that they are really not worth devoting any words of this review to - at least not any more to. What I really want to do is share what I loved about Breaking Dawn in particular. First, the wedding. Brilliantly was the event captured by Condon and the crew. The build-up - Bella's moment with her parents before the ceremony, her talking with Edward the night before, her walking down the aisle with Charlie. Having watched Bella's history, her relationships with all these characters in the preceding films, especially her father, I was able to appreciate these moments Bella has, just before, during and just after the wedding. I would say that Breaking Dawn is a film which, whilst not absolutely requiring the viewer to have seen the previous film entries to enjoy it, will certainly be more, much more enjoyable and immersing for those who have grown with Bella, with her life up to this film.And that is what is most great about this film - it is an emotional accumulation. For Edward and Bella, as a now married couple. For Jacob, who now finally has to let go of Bella, and come to terms with her pregnancy, and then her subsequent ill health. Kristen Stewart plays Bella with such an authority - she's earned it, having portrayed her for a number of films now. I will make this key point - the Twilight Series is about Bella, it's her story. It is her emotional accumulation that matters most - the ending is a great demonstration of this, a heart penetrating reflection on her life - her human life, all her significant moments, her happiest, saddest memories - I won't give it away, but the very last moment of her human life shown in the flashes, one that no viewer has seen, was a beautiful artistic choice.All this serves the great contrast we are about to witness, the vampire Bella. All the Twilight films have great, emotionally climactic endings - Breaking Dawn Part 1 continues that tradition. Again, I won't give away what the actual ending is, but it is satisfying.The film is full of emotion, its packed with it. From the wedding, to the honeymoon, to the stages of Bella's pregnancy, to the chaos of her delivery - true chaos is depicted, a true sense of urgency, of danger and panic - the performances needed were provided, by all. The confusion, doubt, angst, volatility, hatred, desperation - the film convinces us of these emotional states that the characters go through, all throughout. The moment Bella supposedly dies, it is heartbreaking, the way it is shot, the way her face is seen smiling at her baby daughter the moment it has just been delivered, just before she goes blank, and becomes completely non-responsive. This is one of the film's, the entire series, most saddening moments.Breaking Dawn Part 1 is a tough film to watch at moments. It is exciting, funny, shocking, gory, immersing, and touching. I came out of the cinema excited by everything I had seen. The film was a real treat to have seen, and was most definitely worth the wait. Part 2 next. Thanks for reading - hope you enjoyed, or will enjoy, the film too!!",8,2,8,25 November 2011
