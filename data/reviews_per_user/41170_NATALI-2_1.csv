The Blair Witch Project," Heart-pounding, palm-drenching, run through the unknown.
","There are many reasons that this is one of the best movies to date. First, the marketing that has been done with this movie is phenomenal. Who would believe that such a low-profile movie could fool so many? People are often the most scared of the unknown, and this is exactly what this movie created. The ploy to 'trick' John Q. Public into believing that the whole plot really happened worked and many were left to wonder if it was real or not. Second, the acting in Hollywood doesn't get any better than in this movie. The actors were not given a set script and were allowed a lot of freedom in their characters. Because the acting is so believable, you often find yourself feeling the same emotions that the characters are feeling. Third, the American film-making dream is lived through The Blair Witch Project. This movie was made for an incredible six-figure budget and has already made millions. What young film maker hasn't already wished that they had thought of it first? Sure, it could have all been shot with professional equipment, but what fun would that be?",Null,1,1,11 August 1999
