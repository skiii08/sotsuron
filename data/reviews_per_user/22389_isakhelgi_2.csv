It," This Reboot, How IT Redefines the Horror genre.
","It's Ironic, How a reboot in a time where almost everything is reboots or sequels, Manages to capsize on it's fame and deliver a stunning fresh take on Horror.First of all the cinema-photography is Excellent, No doubt. The way the scenes are handled is almost with perfection. Truly Artistic. The sound system is amazing, truly well woven with the visuals.What i feel is important to try to come across is the fact that this horror movie, Really doesn't feel like the last 50 horror movies you've watched, IT doesn't throw you into a dark environment with shadows slipping in and out, making you squint through the whole movie, No this movie does not shy away from some light, Btw excellent lighting. IT takes you to their home and makes it their own. It really does dance across the line of what is deemed acceptable it does, But with an open mind it really does get away with it.Be ready if it looks silly at times and give it the slack on the leash it needs. IT has very scary scenes no doubt, but its enjoy-ability as a whole really needs to be highlighted.I hope i have convinced you to give this movie a GO....you really cant regret it..",10,7,16,9 September 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Lucas Your Baby is dying
","What George Lucas created these many years ago, was something different, mystical and surreal.Now look at it,A Money machine (Disney) is ready to milk the series so hard until this extraordinary piece of art is completely burned to Ash..The StarWars saga needs to be remembered for what it was and what it stood for. A story so powerful and captivating that it captured the minds of millions. A battle between overwhelming evil against a sparkle of hope. How good can triumph evil. This is not appreciated nearly as much as it should.He is the Leonardo DaVinci of our time.What happens, is the prequels. The Beginning of an end. He pours his head, heart and soul. To create something magical and new.He presents to us, The Phantom Menace A three part trilogy, That would explore the so interesting past of the SW universeWe do not Accept, We reject the first part, i am not sure why this happened,but this deeply effected Lucas,It was to late we had already decided and nothing good was to be from the prequels..The clone wars gets released, Totally investing in CGI The people hate new and reject it once again. Then something truly extraordinary happens...The Revenge Of The Sith, The most Brilliant masterpiece No words can justify this moviebut still gets rejected...Lucas furious with his fans SELLS his baby (SW)For about five Billion Dollarslets get one thing straight away, THATS A lot of FKN MONEY an Investment from ---Disney-- Now Disney is doing this to make even more money, they don't care about the art and the brand or whatever, They are going to squeeze these series so hard till it completely bleeeeeds out, cause they want this money as fast as possible..the Don't care long term, they think max 5-10 years. Get every single penny out of it then dump it..That is why we get shitty movies like rogue one, and there's a hell of a lot more of them coming ((that Han solo film))Lucas We are truly sorry, But Disney will come begging to you one day to revive the franchise.And i truly hope you will.. sincerely- √çsak Helgi Karvelsson",1,225,454,20 December 2016
