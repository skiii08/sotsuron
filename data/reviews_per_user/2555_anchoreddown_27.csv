Changeling," Certainly a film to not miss.
","Now more geared toward directing that his acting career, Clint Eastwood dusts off this amazing and unique crime thriller with the help of a few writers. The concept of Eastwood returning to Universal is a rather interesting move considering he's partial to Warner Bros. I don't exactly remember much about the film awards of 2008, but if I had been a judge to determine if this was in the rankings, I would most certainly call it one of the top twenty films for the year it was released. Angelina Jolie stars as an historical character, Christine Collins who at the start of the film plays a single mother who is trying to support her son, Walter. What starts out as a missing child turns into something bigger than the audience might anticipate. Since this is a period film of the late 1920s, you do have to remember on a historical note that this was the point in time when the L.A. police department was big into scandals to mostly cover up their ties to the mob. So with that in mind, you can imagine how frustrating it was for Ms. Collins to deal with the police as well as coming from the position of a woman of that time who had very limited roles in the public eye. Bottom line, if you like hard core drama that has suspense and is thrilling, this is for you. The acting is extremely professional. Jeffrey Donavan is very convincing as the head of police affairs who is stopping at nothing to keep Christine Collins from exposing his mistake by giving her the wrong child. This movie is not for the faint of heart. There are some disturbing scenes here. First and foremost it's a documentary, so some details cannot be avoided. As far as I am concerned if there is an updated version of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, this should be in that version of that book. Excellent performances all around!",10,0,1,4 February 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," He's back for round four!
","It's Jack and he's back! Captain Jack Sparrow! Getting an upgrade from the last three pirate films, On Stranger Tides to most Pirate fans was questionable from the beginning. That is however when it came to the call of what the script would look like, it would seem Jack Sparrow's character would be getting a face-lift. The film is loosely based on a book by the same subtitle name, which included the historical pirate character, Blackbeard. Since several characters from the last three films did not return to the casting call, the script had to change. There are honorable nods to the original film, Curse of the Black Pearl, yet script writers pushed it back farther to tell a little bit of Jack's personal life, of which gave us a new character, Angelica, who in term has a very important role in the film. It may not measure up to the original 2003 summer blockbuster, but it certainly has some exciting twists in swords and in plot. The film even suggests that it could have easily been a better sequel than Dead Man's Chest in the writers had known better. However, Pirate fans or not, this should not be missed for any movie goer! It rocks!",10,2,4,20 May 2011
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," oooh, look! Stars!
","Great for it's imagery, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a perfect nostalgic piece from the 80s for those who grew up watching it.Oddly enough, Roger Rabbit serves as the middle chapter of the Back To The Future trilogy considering Robert Zemeckis & Bob Gale didn't do much in between BTTF and BTTF2. Not only that, but it was filmed primarily at Pinewood studios, just as Batman was being made.It is normally extremely difficult to render live action with cartoon animation, especially for the actors. From what I've heard, Charles Flescher actually did rehearse with Bob Hoskins in a big rabbit costume.Next to the cartoons, Christopher Lloyd as Judge Doom is another big part of the movie. As a theater trained actor, he is extremely good at what he does and gives that creepy vibe. Not only that, but he had to work with the animation for his big scene near the end of the movie.Great piece of work. It's something that I could watch again and again and again. Also goes hand in hand w BTTF if you're into watching multiple movies in a row.",10,1,1,8 March 2013
Terminator Salvation," surprisingly good!
","The most recent update on the Terminator film series. Some might say it's not worth seeing, die-hard fans would give it high praise, there's no real big response to the film yet whether or not it will be a summer blockbuster.Basically, it picks up where we left off from number three when Skynet began the attack on the humans. There is a bit of backtracking with the new and updated terminator machine and the history behind this model and how only one was manufactured much like Peter Weller's character in Robocop in the use of a human body.The new machine sets out from Skynet to essentially eliminate John Connor and Kyle Reese. With more smarts than the rest, what's left of the human body tries to fight back against the orders and ends up playing out the role originally intended for Arnold if he was still acting. However it doesn't exclude his brief cameo he has toward the end of the film.I'm not much one to list spoilers, however once you see the way this film ends, it makes me want to start right back at the beginning again.The grading of the imagery should get high praise. It is very much earthly and worn on both the land and the machinery seen. It is very much in the same tone as Camp Crystal Lake in the recent remake of Friday The 13th. The acting is not that much different from the other three films which makes it realistic and firm.",7,2,3,22 May 2009
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Not a bad entry,........
","I'm no Spider-Man comic book expert, but based on what we've seen so far, this is a great fresh reboot for Mr. Spidy. Without posting any spoilers, if you saw the last Spider-Man film, the introduction gives multiple nods to both the previous Spider-Man film as well as give the audience a full introductory into the MCU, in a very strong way. A lot of people get nit-picky with their preferences on which movie does better. I prefer to take these kinds of films at face value rather than become the critic. I liked the movie, the direction it took made me feel like it was something the fans have been waiting for. Spider-Man is actually on the short list of my top five super heroes list, number one being Batman. There were a number of Easter eggs that I caught. Michael Keaton nailed his role as the slightly grouchy old dad and business man. It's almost like he's arched back into the favorite character of Batman, again, in a good way. The instructional videos w Captain America were hilarious by the way,.....",8,16,27,8 July 2017
Predator," one good movie!
","If survival gets anymore brutal than this, it's an all out war! A mission in the jungles of South America goes bad when the team players are brutally slaughtered. Dutch, a military man and his men go in to find them, and they get more than they bargained for when they stumble on, the predator.Arnold gives an outstanding performance in this high energy film of cross fires and steak outs. The jungle itself nearly becomes a character because of it's massive foliage and nooks and crannies where the predator can easily hide.The second half of the film takes off once they discovered they have been targeted.Once the audience gets pulled it, it's a mile a minute and you'll soon discover that the sequel is worth a look considering there's a lot of information to process about the predator. Not only that, but the chase gets more exciting once you realize he's hunting for sport and it becomes a deadly game of survival.I'll give it two thumbs up!",9,3,3,21 May 2010
Man of Steel," Just what the fans ordered
","With the second major progression of superhero movies, it just keeps getting better and better. Ultimately, the CGI elements are what make these kind of movies possible, or else it's back to the dark ages of film. This version of Superman will not disappoint. The fact the Goyer and Nolan are a part of the screenplay says everything. They know their comic book history. Remember how detailed The Dark Knight trilogy was in contrast to the origin stories?? The writing style of Nolan's is present, but not as predominant as it was in Batman Begins. Even though some of the concepts were tweaked, it is a great storyline that was over-due for Superman. For those who remember the version with Christopher Reeve, the storyline helps explain the introductory scene of the original '77 version much better, and even though the black Spandex from the Superman II villains doesn't come right away, it does not disappoint. The action doesn't slow down and for a traditional two hour and twenty time frame, it takes up every minute of the film.",Null,0,0,15 June 2013
Aliens," Certainly a choice sci-fi!
","Holding the spot for the sequel of Alien, this film goes so much farther than what was in the original.With scaly aliens bent on destruction of humans for reproduction, each of the team members fights off the vile and cruel specie.Sigormy Weaver pulls it off again with a supporting actress, which gives off a very impulsive and highly upbeat climax of having to rescue the fallen comrade as the colony station begins to crumble away beneath their feet.Watch for Lance Hendricksen and Bill Paxton, who are the two people who have been killed off by an Alien, the Terminator and the Predator.",9,5,6,24 March 2010
Die Hard 2," One great sequel!
","Next to the original Die Hard, this movie does live up to the antagonist! It's Christmas Eve in D.C. and there's a snow storm brewing. At the same time, a imprisoned dictator and drug dealer is on his way on a transfer through the airport that John McClaine is already at. Once again, in the wrong place at the wrong time, John finds himself hurled into a deadly terrorist attack that plans to take the drug dealer off to a tropical paradise. Plenty of quotable lines to pick up for the next generation of viewers, but not without the famous 'yippie kayee' line. It's a good two hour piece that keeps you going until the end, with an ending that will bring the house down. It's a great sequel that's worth a look!",9,1,2,3 March 2013
Batman Begins," a perfect beginning
","The movie is quite impressive for a reboot. Christopher Nolan, the director of Momento takes up the challenge of rebooting the Batman franchise. Not only that, but he takes Batman back to the root of the character. Understanding the need for a more dramatic and realistic look to Gotham City,Chris felt it was time for a serious peace. He applies this concept to every angle of the film. Christian Bale is not a new actor, however he pulls off wearing the cowl and cape very well with the direction Christopher Nolan wanted to take it. There are some familiar faces such as Katie Holmes and Gary Oldman on board. It keeps you going once the action begins and doesn't stop. Any Batman fan would appreciate this.",10,1,2,24 February 2013
1941," It Happened Right After The Toga Party(And Yet Didn't At The Same Time!)
","Seriously one of the most underrated comedies of it's time.Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis call to action every screwball in Hollywood to launch an all out attack on the Japaniese sub. Some of the more notable comedians in the film are Dan Akroid, John Belushi, John Candy, Ned Beatty and Tim Matheson. Strickly for entertainment. Slap yourself silly like you did for Monty Python And The Holy Grail, cause this is another two-in-the-morning-movie to watch where you just dying to start laughing all over again. Whatever you do, try not to smile when you see that sub leave the California waters.",9,7,11,12 June 2009
Gone Girl," surprisingly well done
","These are the kinds of movies I go to the theater for,.......it's a good thing they aren't doing 3D with it.Rosamund Pike and Ben Affleck star as a married couple that have their share of marital problems. That's what it looks like from the start.She goes missing at about the twenty minute mark. He obviously wants her back.The acting is very well done, and the fact that a Bond girl plays the female lead should be accredited to something,......This is worth the watch for a great drama style thriller. One could say this is equivalent to last year's sleeper hit, Prisoners for those of you who enjoyed that one.",9,0,9,4 October 2014
Back to the Future Part III," It's BTTF western style!
","The ending of Back To The Future Part II left most audiences a bit disappointed. That is however the true fans embraced the fact that Back To The Future would soon become a film trilogy.Picking up where we left off from the original sequel, Marty is stuck in 1955 with no Delorean. Doc Brown has been sent off to 1885 from a freak accident.Marty Mcfly is determined to see Doc Brown home to 1985. That is however when a charming Clara Clayton, (Mary Steenbergen) comes to town, Doc suddenly finds himself head over heals for her. While this is going on, Marty's short temper lands him a staged fight with the notorious Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen. Not only that, but the Delorean time machine is still not functioning correctly.The original theatrical release landed on Friday, May 24th, 1990 - Memorial Day weekend. Limited places around the United States were showing all three films back to back to back.What makes the third film exciting in it's own way is that this was a first chance to go into the wild west from the perspective of a time traveler, not somebody who was already there. This had never been done before, let alone having a time travel series reach a second sequel. The only other storyline that is remotely like this is A Yankie Doodle in King Arthur's Court, which is a plot that has been a bit over-exhausted.True fans of Back to The Future will no be disappointed. All of the main actors from the first two films returned, (minus Crispen Glover who had a few problems with the way his character was portrayed). Tom Wilson who plays Biff Tannen in the series made history by taking on multiple roles of the Tannen family members, Griff Tannen, Old Biff, Biff in 1985 and Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen.Rumors of a fourth film have gone across the web and back. It is in the contract with Universal and Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale have stated that it ends with the third film. The only other versions were the Saturday morning cartoon that ran from 1991 to 1993 and the Ride at Universal from 1991 to 2007.",10,3,3,20 September 2010
Jurassic World," A worthy sequel installment
","Since the last Jurassic Park sequel, there has been lots of speculation as to whether a fourth film would happen. Jurassic Park fans finally got their wish in a very big way. Yes, there's been some odd-bag remarks, but ultimately you have to decide whether it's a worthy sequel or not. Set 22 years since the incident in the original film, Jurassic World takes a slightly different turn from the other two sequels. There's enough grounded material to remind the viewer that this is a Jurassic Park film, yet takes a few new turns. Steven Spielberg may not be directing this one, but he's got his signature all over it, everything from the visual concepts to the tid-bits. Yes, it's not Jurassic Park, but it's what Jurassic Park should have been if the attraction ever got off the ground. It's a well packed action movie that hardly lets down once it starts. There are plenty of Easter Eggs to be found with references to the first three films, relying heavily on the original Jurassic Park. This is scarier and more up-front in your face, but if your kids can handle a movie like Jurassic Park to begin with, I wouldn't worry too much. (Watch for a cameo from SNLs Jimmy Fallon as the commentator in the bubble cages)",9,23,60,12 June 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," One great thrill ride.
","For some reason, or another this film seems to have a mixed bag of reviews, some love it while others hate this piece. Want an honest review??? When the studio reached the 'point of no return' by getting to The Avengers, it was the first Marvel film to reach the billion dollar mark. Up until this point, most of the Marvel based films received good reviews. What went wrong?? It seems to always be the common denominator, the audience. Movie goers seem to get more nit-picky of films that have background material these days. They keep praying that the producers keep 'messing up' on their favorite comic book characters. However, I mean no disrespect to anyone. This being said, it puts more pressure on the studios to do their job right. This is why films like Spiderman 3 failed to bring full force is because Sam Raimi could not give the script he wanted full treatment. Now that I have laid down some ground in the way Nick Fury would, as if talking to the team, here's my review of this movie. It's good to see new and old faces. With the grouping of the characters in Age Of Ultron, it's difficult to really put character emphasis on any one or two superheroes. We know the ones we've already seen in the Marvel Universe. Once again, this is part of the start of phase two in the writing process of both the films and Agents Of Shield. We got to see the alien life force from the first Avengers, so it makes sense that Age Of Ultron would have robots to accompany Ultron himself, seeing that he has to upload himself to a machine in the first place. This also eludes to the reveal that Marvel fans will eventually get of Thanos. Not only that, but now Spiderman will be able to join the roster again. Everybody knows that Agent Colson is still alive, so we have yet to see him show up again, but more than likely, will stay with Shield. What makes this film special?? I think it's the Scarlet Witch who taps into the minds of others, making them face their fears of their past. Bottom line is, don't let anyone tell you what you should and shouldn't watch. Sometimes you have to test the waters,......trust me, if you relax and sit back you just might enjoy this piece of film you may call 'a piece of crap'.",9,0,3,3 May 2015
The Dark Knight," Batman doesn't get better than this!
","History exploded onto the scene of summer 2008.It was the rise of quality films after a period of eight months since the third installment to Pirates of the Caribbean.The release of the updated Batman film, simply called Batman Begins brought comic book fans back to the theater. The Batman franchise was being renewed with a new director at the helm, Christopher Nolan.Putting a three year gap in between Batman Begins and it's sequel literally made most of it's success in the anticipation for the movie.Iorn Man came out and became a smash hit, only to reach the top for barely a month before The Dark Knight was released. The numbers were in the billions after the film grazed theaters world-wide. It is one of six films to reach the billion dollar mark.What is even more impressive is that most of the audiences just within the first week were people who wanted to see it four or five times over! The Dark Knight is simply pop culture reinvented with new faces on the screen as well as a few old ones. Katie Holmes may not be in the Batman franchise anymore, but that didn't phase the fans a bit.The history of the Dark Knight will be continued in 2012.",10,1,5,11 September 2010
Die Hard," It's been almost twenty-five heffing years!
","I am hours away from seeing A Good Day To Die Hard. I don't care about the fact that it's only an hour and thirty seven minutes, or that people are saying it's not that good. A Die Hard fan,................with the pun intended would want to see this movie! 'What was it that you said?? Yippie kayee Mother F-ker???' - Hans Gruber. If I want to raise my adrenaline, or get pumped up for a good work out, these are the kinds of movies I prefer to watch. Yeah, I'm the guy who is hooting and hollering at the screen, but that just proves my point that this is one of those movies that keeps the audience going. On July 14, 2013, Die Hard will be officially turning twenty-five. That really makes me feel old, especially considering I will be turning 30 as my all time fave, BTTF will be turning 30, so happy 25th anniversary Die Hard!!!!!",10,1,1,15 February 2013
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Nice finish!
","Picking up where we left off with The Desolation of Smug, this film plays out in the same format as any other Middle Earth film does. Less than ten minutes into the movie, the audience is back in the saddle for the third adventure of The Hobbit. This may not be the best rated epic from Peter Jackson, but I wouldn't say it was a disappointment. Some elements were missing for a proper epic piece, however the feel of the film speaks of conclusion and war. This seems to fit this reality. Lots of directors and writers speak of getting the feel of the film right. It's a departure from the last two films in The Hobbit, but when you cut it up into three sections of film, I say there's no need to add any more. Making line to the original LOTR trilogy, that part of it had to be in there. Ultimately The Hobbit should have been done in two films to better appease the fans, but I am not saying every chapter in a series of films has to do that. The third X-Men film was that way,......so I've heard,.......",8,1,2,26 December 2014
Back to the Future Part II," Sci-fi going BACK!
","It had been five years since the release of Back To The Future. In the summer of 1988, it was still very much part of the 80s way of movies. Universal came to Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale wanting to do two more films.The original draft of the second film would be sending Marty Mcfly and the Delorean time machine back to the 60s. However, reviewing the work, Zemeckis realized it would not work.It became apparent to the writers that making a sequel to Back To The Future would take some serious time and effort. As soon as Who Framed Roger Rabbit? was complete and in theaters, Zemeckis and Gale began writing.Deciding to go into the future, the two writers decided to make the future a happy place because they felt that the future was way too often mispredicted. Not only this, but they spend time consulting with Rick Carter, the production designer on what the 'future' should look like.The rest of the film is a bit of an overlap. Marty Mcfly goes back to 1955 to prevent Biff Tannen from monopolizing Hill Valley. Every little detail was exactly the same, right down to the positioning of the actors.What makes Back To The Future Part II so unique is that you get to see parts of the first film from the prospective of another character. This had not been done in Hollywood before in a sequel.The other major part of the film is the vista glide that was used to create the dinner sequence in 2015 with Michael J. Fox ending up in three places at once for the final take. Other similar shots were simply done by cutting the film in half for scenes with two Biffs and two Doc Brown's.Back To The Future Part II takes the storyline to the next level in time travel giving the audience the chance to see what happens when there's a ripple effect in a time line.A number of the techniques used in the film give film-makers today the technology they need to create bigger and better special effects. Thus, the sequel made history.",10,0,0,11 September 2010
The Dark Knight Rises," Glorious story, Batman!
","I was wanting to get my review up, however I decided to go with the idea, like the producers, to wait until Monday to list it on the IMDb page out of respect for the deaths of those in the Colorado shootings. (may they hopefully rest in Christ!) Like many others, I've been waiting a good three years since the last chapter for this movie to hit theaters. For fans of Batman, you will not be disappointed! It has everything a die-hard fan of Batman would want in a Batman movie. The events begin eight years after the events of The Dark Knight. Bruce Wayne has hung up the cape and cow-el since he's rid Gothom of crime. He's older and uses a cane to go around. It's when the Gothom city police start picking up information about a character named Bane who they don't completely know of the man's motives until he reaches the city. If the readers have been following the clips and trailers, this information is not new. Christopher Nolan has a very precise vision in mind for the final chapter in his Batman saga. He keeps the audience on the edge of their seat trying to digest the plot in between the action sequences, which very much are appealing to the eye in glorious IMAX. Overall, the film does tell a great story, weaving in details relating back to Batman Begins, and The Dark Kight but excluding details of the Joker out of respect for the Late Heath Ledger. There are also a few surprises concerning some of the characters Nolan brings to the screen.",10,6,14,23 July 2012
Black Panther," Marvel did it again!
","I had a small window of an opportunity to go see this movie opening day between things I had to do, and I'm glad I did. That's saying a lot from someone who's used to routines throughout the week.
They pack a lot into this chapter for the panther. I haven't taken the time to actually research the comic book character. Thankfully, there's plenty of exposition at the beginning, which is a good thing considering that there has been plenty of hype for each Marvel movie that comes out. It really helps the audience because this day in age, most people won't bother to do any research. For some movies, yes, you should get on Wikipedia or YouTube the character and see what pops up.
There's a lot that Black Panther is, and there's a lot that it isn't in the way of comic book adaptions. Marvel is getting better and better at keeping the superheroes fresh for the intended audience. The problem with DC is the way they've been handling their superheroes, but that's a whole different topic.
Yes, this is a bit of a political storyline, but at the same time the political side of the movie thankfully doesn't overpower the rest of it. There's plenty of action, ripped guys w their shirts off for the girls to leak their hormones all over, plenty of comedic moments and everything else in between. Martin Freeman's character is rather left hanging on as the comedic role, considering he's done this before w The Hobbit trilogy. 
As far as the culture of Wakanda, it's a mix between Iron Man's work and something you might see in Bruce Wayne's Bat-cave. Several parts made me think they could've used some of this technology in The Dark Knight trilogy. That is one impressive cave the panther has. The only thing that really stood out to me that was different was seeing that one guy who had that ornamental piece attached to his lip, ;-)
I've said it before, and I'll say it again, I've learned to stop reading reviews and what critics are saying about movies today because all they ever do anymore is shred the filmmakers to pieces. I want to be entertained, not to go into a theater to judge a movie. The rare exception would be sitting down to some Batman movie that would be similar to Batman & Robin. I'm a huge Bat-fan.
Well, I certainly enjoyed this entry in the MCU. Would probably get it when it's out on home video, or available for streaming off Amazon.",9,18,69,17 February 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A mesh of comic book galore!!
","Everyone has high expectations for Batman and Superman flicks, depending on how much you take in from the comics. For most people, explaining the origin stories is not rocket science, it's common knowledge. I always like going into the theater with a movie like this with little to no expectations because if I do, that might spoil the movie for me. This movie is eye candy. With Zack Snyder directing, it's going to have good visual effects based on his previous work, which does include Man of Steel. I'm more of a Batman fan, but I do know enough of Superman's origins to follow along with what was happening on-screen. This DOES stick to the comic books/graphic novels. Okay, it does seem like half way though that it starts to look like a film adaption of The Dark Knight Returns, only with two extra characters in the mix. Like I said, lower expectations might make this enjoyable depending on who's watching it. The reason this movie is rated R is because there's quite a bit of violence, but there are way more explosions,....and it's not the dramatic explosions you might get in, say a Michael Bay directed piece. No these explosions are more geared by reaction of the science behind the reaction on-screen. It's worth seeing whether your for Batman or Superman.",9,0,3,27 March 2016
Toy Story 3," certainly worth a look!
","To me, it was pretty obvious after Toy Story 2 was released, their would be a third film in the making.It is hard to describe exactly what one feels after walking out of a movie like this. For most people, the Pixar animation was something brand new back in 1995 when the original was released, leaving the audience wanting to see every little detail.The third Toy Story does a few things that are new to the world according to Buzz Lightyear and Woody. They get brushed off to the local daycare center. The audience is nearly horrified seeing there's a dictatorship being run by a teddy bear, but before you know it, you are reminded by the jokes flying around left from right that in this kind of a movie, anything goes.This really is nothing short of a Toy Story picture. Everything you'd expect, with a few twists. Not only that, but if you're an adult watching this, you somehow grasp and remember what it was like to become a young adult and learning to give up those old toys you remembered as a kid.",9,1,3,5 July 2010
Lucy," It works, if you think you're just human,.... ;-)
","Seems like a film like this should stand out along with the line-up of films from 2014. Either that, or it's seriously underrated. This film works on multiple levels, due to the science fiction side of the story. Your interpretation will swing one way, or the other on what the script-writers deliver to the storyline. There really is no need to develop many of the characters for something like this. You can, but that will either draw out the storyline too much, or enhance the tone of the film depending on the viewer. No, a standard 90 film length is perfectly fine for this plot. Why is it that we only use about 10% of our brain?? The real answer is simple and hard to understand, depending how you process it. The funny thing is,....the plot decides to leave God out of the equation, therefore, you're going to fall back on a more humanistic approach. This film is man's attempt to find the answers,.....but isn't that the REAL definition of 'religion'?? If you go back to what Lucy says about time and space, she specifically said that we are all subjected to time, the day were born to the day we die. We can't change that, therefore, we can't look at our lives in the viewpoint of a 'timeline', so to speak. In this sense, Lucy becomes like God. Does this mean we're destined to be gods?? The Mormons seem to think so, but that would mean we would create our own worlds, so to speak, and they wouldn't be as inclined to overlap to create the 'environment' we live in. The real reason why we don't use more the 10% is because knowledge gives power to do things. In a perfect world, no one would want to 'test the limits', or have the desire to 'sin'. It's temptation being removed from the equation, but in the 'world' we live in, the sin and temptation do exist. Where's the balance?? Wouldn't it then make sense to answer to the deity than ignore it?? Again, I go back to the idea that this story is about a world 'without' God in the equation. It's fine on its own, but to say that the material presented in this movie is real, would go back to the 'evolution' idea. Of course, what you see on the film isn't real. Everything that is linked together is purely fiction.",8,1,4,8 May 2016
Deadpool," Not terrible.
","At this point most Marvel and DC fans are expecting a bit of a slow down with the rate of comic book related movies. The studios would probably agree that to keep audiences coming, they have to keep it interesting. This Marvel flick seems to fall into the middle category depending on your interest in the comic book character of Deadpool. Ant-Man had a similar take where it was good, but not as powerful as some of the other Marvel flicks we've seen. Most of the Marvel movies are good at delivering a punch for great fights between characters and short witty lines in the middle of the normal dialog. Deadpool seems like it's an extension of what we got w Andrew Garfield's take on Spiderman, who does more bantering with the villains. If you like bantering comic book characters, this is more for you as opposed to characters like Batman who don't talk all that much when in action. I'm actually glad the studio managed to satisfy the Deadpool fans enough to shatter the February record - for Valentines Day. (That comes off a little weird). Oh, and for the fans that are anywhere from 30 to 40 years old, you will appreciate the end credit scene.",8,2,12,20 February 2016
Back to the Future," The best of the 'not yet' classics!
","Who doesn't remember growing up watching the Back To The Future Trilogy???? Since July 3, 1985 when the first film was released, fans from all walks of life can recall Hollywood history through the eyes of Marty Mcfly as he travels through time in the plutonium powered Delorean. The following fans are really the people to thank for keeping the BTTF trilogy alive.

In the pilot film, Doc Brown introduces the Delorean time machine as the choice machine for time travel. Michael J. Fox stars as Marty Mcfly, the teenager who goes back,..... to 1955 where he meets his parents to be. Interfering with their first meeting, Marty must fix the relationship with the help of Dr. Emmett Lathrop Brown and get back to 1985 in time.

Jurassic Park," simply a blockbuster classic
","Who doesn't remember growing up watching the JP movies??? The second one was just as good as the first. Personally, it's one of my all time favorite films. Why mess with perfection?? What's nice about this movie coming directly from the book is that they both came out at the same time and Michael and Steven worked on both the book and the movie back to back. That's why certain scenes are chopped up the way they are. They even used one of the intro scenes with the compys attacking the little girl as the intro in the second film.Good move!It's too bad Michael Critchon just died.Jurassic Park 4???? If you wish to see my script and choice of actors, which are a little dated because I wrote it in 2002, E-mail me for it. anchoreddown@juno.com PS I'm practically ready to begin my version of JP 5.The fifth script involves leviathans and dragons!",10,1,2,9 December 2008
