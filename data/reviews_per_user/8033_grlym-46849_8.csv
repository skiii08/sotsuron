First Man," Below expectations
",This felt like Thelma and Luis crossed over with 2001. So long winded. Seemed the producers and director had an open licence to do things that only impressed themselves and award communities. I had wished it was more like Apollo 15 or so many of the other great space films,1,7,11,8 February 2019
It," Expected more
",I watched it because my older kid wanted to. Wasnt very scary. Did. It really make sense other than 'it' kills kids aimlessly. And the kids magically kill it at the end.,5,0,1,23 November 2019
It," Better than original
",Infinitely better than the TV movie version made forever ago. But far from as scary as it was hyo d to be.,5,0,1,8 February 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Masterful and true to its roots
",The first worthy Star Wars film since the original 3,10,6,9,8 February 2019
Us," Potential wasted 20 min in
","The film started great. I was intrigued, but was quickly disappointed when the movie quickly showed it had zero depth. Horrific acting (or push from director to act scary which ended up more silly and pathetic) from the 'villains'; which is funny because ironically all actors who play their twin roles early in did very well.Nothing was scary or suspenseful. Zero storyline. Half at through I gave up and scanned through the rest to see if it picked up. Nope, more of the same.Finally at the end for the villain monologue to hopefully explain the movie fell real flat. The guttural groans of the 'shadows' made it unbearable to watch.I'm sad it did not provide anything of depth.",2,0,0,13 June 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy," Genuinely unique
",Never before had I been hired a super hero movie that was both compelling but also so humorous. I knew nothing about these hero's going into the movie and loved them all immediately.,9,0,0,8 February 2019
It Chapter Two," Same as episode 1
",Not too scaryAnd be prepared for the F word in nearly every other line of script to make up for all the movie lacks (a point)Seems like the movie is just Stephen kings 'stand by me' attempt at rewrite with weak scary overtone with not much that makes sense than psych 101 about bullies and fear,6,0,1,23 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Masterful
","Hands down the best Star Wars movie to date. It's cross between adventure, pulling heartstring , plot, acting , etc is peerless in the sW saga",10,0,0,8 February 2019
