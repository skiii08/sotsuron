Mission: Impossible III," How is this any different from the second?
","Yet again there is another woman in peril, who Cruise must save, some action sequences borrowing directly from the Matrix, with all of the jumping and slow motion, and Tom Cruise has yet to show me he can act. He seems to have the opposite of the Midas touch, everything he touches turns bad, but the problem here is that Cruise produced it, this was pretty much his baby yet again, and he made the plots so hokey, and clichéd (how many time has someone been on a motorcycle looking like he's mad at the world with sunglasses?) And Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall?! When he said that I was like 'Are you kidding?!' I can't believe he actually said that. I don't know if Tom Cruise really thought he was cool, by now he and his team who pretty much look like GQ cover models have not proved they can act, they look good, but they can't act.Tom Cruise is the one who takes the cake. Here he is one of the richest men in Hollywood, got that way pretty much on his appeal as a sex symbol, used to be clean cut, and now he is trying to reinvent himself as some goteed rebel, but it just doesn't work. He never was a rebel before, just some pretty boy who couldn't act, and he never could. The story is not about any kind of spying it is about Tom Cruise being cool. Everything seems to work out perfectly for him, no matter how bad things get every time some car is barreling for him it manages to stop just in time. I wouldn't be so upset with it except he seems to expect the audience to take it seriously.Philip Seymour Hoffman and Laurence Fishburne, two fine actors have no business appearing in this movie. They are very good actors and they need to stick to good movies. I guess they both felt they needed the exposure or the money. No one in this movie is required to act, and that is the most sad for those two. Cruise's acting really is his make up, which make him look hurt, or tired, but he can't do it himself.The ultimate problem with this movie is that there is very little resemblance to the original TV show. It didn't have this kind of action, or slow motion beat downs, it had some but most of that show was with your mind, and they figured everything out without beating people up. If they want to make a movie like this fine but don't call it Mission Impossible, this has nothing to do with the original classic series anymore. By now pretty much all of the action runs together, it looks the same, feels the same and pretty much has the same consequence, and this movie has the same formula so many other movies do: A lesser bad guy and then the main bad guy. Both of them find their unusual ways to die, which happen to be so cool, but still so clichéd.I guess that is the ultimate problem with this movie: clichés. This pretty much was no different from any other action movie, and with a 150 million dollar budget I guess I expected too much. And I guess I shouldn't have expected it any better, the only reason I saw it was on account of the movie I wanted to see started too early. StillI am hearing Cruise is gonna star in a remake of 3:10 to Yuma. I plead to you Mr. Cruise: You have ruined a classic TV series, please don't ruin a classic movie too.",Null,13,27,7 May 2006
Se7en," A Very Nicely Done Thriller
","Before I review this movie I should say that Morgan Freeman almost always does an excellent job in any movie he is in. This movie is not different. Brad Pitt is the other lead and does a fair job but the reason to watch this movie is because of Freeman and his typically sterling performance. Here they play two detectives on the trail of a gruesome murderer. This is one of those rare movies that was hyped and it lived up to the hype. The publicity surrounding this movie with it's two leads and the theme of the film was immense and the movie was as good as hyped. The mystery kept you guessing, the, thrills kept you a little tense throughout, and the ending was a shocker.The key to this movie was that the script told an intense and somewhat complicated story in a simple manner. The cinematography, the score, and the overall atmosphere of this movie provided an excellent atmosphere to such a dark and gritty movie. The plot is fairly old, two detectives on the trail of a murderer, but the actors and the direction manage to make this variation on the formula very enjoyable, and seem original, when it really isn't.But as I said before the key to this movie was Morgan Freeman and his performance. Everybody in this movie feeds off of his demeanor and his presence. He does so good he even makes Brad Pitt seem like a god actor. There is a nice supporting cast in this movie, R. Lee Ermey, Richard Roundtree, and even, well, okay, Gwyneth Paltrow, who really can't act. But the most surprising supporting cast member is Kevin Spcaey just a few months before he became famous.But the movie also asks a number of moral questions, in examining American society and our many vices, it examines our drive, our motivations, and ultimately our failings, and how our vices can be maximized to hurt ourselves. When I got out of this movie I was very shocked, this was quite a surprising movie, I did't expect anything like it and I was surprised at it. This is a rarity because in modern day a movie like this would be dissected by the studio, and wouldn't be allowed to have the same kind of theme and intensity it does now, it would be way to fluffy, by Hollywood standards anyway. With that said watch this movie if you want a to a nice gory little gem.",Null,0,0,9 April 2006
Alexander," OH MY KING Alexander: YOU WERE CURSED WITH A HORRIBLE SCRIPT!
","Oliver Stone is one of the most unique film makers in recent film history, but he really struck out with this one. I will not completely lambast this film like I would Leonard Part 6, or Hot to Trot, but this one really struck out. Colin Farrell plays Alexander, and he does a fair job of it, but he is not good enough of an actor to carry a movie by himself, and this movie really isn't worth carrying. The film just wreaks of a plot and a point, I really can't figure out why the films sucks, it just does. There is absolutely no plot, it just seems to ramble on, and the awkward phraseology of ancient Greece just goes too far, it does not fit, it should, but it doesn't this movie doesn't work at all it is so silly and so overdone you really do not get the true spirit of Alexander although I get the feeling Mr. Stone tried very hard to, just really REALLY fell short. Part of the problem was there were so many homoerotic themes at least to me, making Alexander out to be gay. Not that I have a problem with that, the movie in the what Oliver Stone tried to portray it really seemed like it drowned the quality of this film, like it really took away from any accurate historical significance, and portray an entirely different myth that surrounds Alexander, in other words to me it appeared that Oliver Stone was trying to make a completely different myth to compliment Alexander the Great. I found this film very hard to sit through in places, because I felt like the story dragged on for along time, longer than it should have. The film overall had no point, it appeared to me that Stone really did not want to tell a story with this film, he just wanted to have some fun playing around with Alexander The Great, regardless of whether it was true or not. Having seen the original Alexander the Great, with Richard Burton, which had it's own historical inaccuracies I watch this and I would prefer the old one because that was more character and acting driven, whereas here I could not really figure out what drove this movie, and I don't think Oliver Stone could either. The original also had decent dialogue, the words spoken by the characters were not so contrived and silly. That movie was nominated for a few Academy Awards, for this Alexander film I think the Academy should put out a hit on Oliver Stone. What results in Oliver Stone's vision of Alexander is a movie that isn't quite silly, I wasn't completely lost on the movie, but I really could not get into it either. Most of the performances, while appealing for the most part were contrived. The dialogue was unbelievable, and silly, making the actors, many of which were very talented unable to take their own parts seriously. No one in this movie really seemed into their parts, except for Val Kilmer playing Phillip, and Christopher Plummer, who plays Aristotle. No one else really seems natural, despite most everyone doing a decent job with what little they had to work with.Coming out of this movie I couldn't figure out what to make of it. I didn't feel like being too critical of it, but I didn't feel like praising it, definitely didn't feel like praising it. I think the problem with this movie was Oliver Stone got his oddly erotic revisionist message across, and it was a horrible message. I do not know if Stone really wanted to write an actual account of history, he didn't, but did he really think it would? There was so much allegory and symbolism, and stirring speeches, I didn't expect this from the man who brought forward the straight-forward articulate JFK (You have to agree it was very powerful even if you disagree with the film itself.) How someone who prides himself on being so straightforward can make something that rambles on and on like this is beyond my comprehension, perhaps Stone has gotten back on drugs again, 'Hey, wouldn't it have been cool man if Alexander was gay man?' That's what it seems like here, Stone just wanted to produce some sort of silly film about Alexander the Great, but didn't want to put any thought into it, just wanted to make some movie, but almost played with history because it was fun. Stone is an effective filmmaker, he always gets his point across, and I think here is his point is that Alexander the Great lived an erotic fantasy, that he heard awkward and silly neo-Greek speeches his whole life and his entire life was filled with unique and fascinating special effects that served as symbolism for his greatness, but Stone's vision does not serve as a good movie.",Null,1,2,4 December 2004
Crash," Took me completely by surprise.
","When I saw Sandra bullock was in a movie I figured it would be something pretty light weight like Hope Floats. But Sandra Bullock has a relatively small part in this interwoven and complex character study, Crash. The movie, which has a number of very big stars and familiar character actors come together brilliantly to give us a showcase of the American identity, in race, and in our acceptance of others. So many stories come together to create a brilliantly subtle and awesome movie about who we are.The plot is too complicated to go into in a forum like this, but there are a number of different small stories, such as the cop who is a bigot, and who is trying to get decent health care for his ailing pops. then there is the black TV producer who sees bigotry in more ways than one even in his wealthy lifestyle. So many other small stories but those are some of the plot lines of note.The characters are quite incredible, and are generally much more real and substantive than a lot of characters in Hollywood films, but here the characters seem so real, they seem so multi-dimensional, the good guys turn out sometimes to be bad guys, and the bad guys turn out to be good guys. A lot of times in this movies characters no matter if they are good or bad turn out to be completely unexpected.There have been so many movies that have examined their perspective times and mores many years ago, some movies were so good at showing who we were as a society, and examining ourselves. there really hasn't been a movie in recent years that has examined our generation in such a way. As we speak society is becoming more isolated and distant, even from our own neighbor. In this culture of distance and isolation Crash comes up and examines the culture, and is set in a city that might be the epitome of modern day isolation, distance, and decadence: Los Angeles.The movie also examines the increasing multi-cultural society that is becoming America and how everybody, rich, poor, powerful, working-class, fits into it. Kudos to all of these actors who make this really good script come to life in such a way. I am sad that there are so few movies like this. There was a time movies like this could not have been made, with this kind of intensity, with this kind of social commentary, there should be a lot more movies like this. A lot of movies, even independent movies do talk about social situations like this, but the characters sometimes seem fake, and the story lines contrived. But this movie has rich people, poor people, every kind of person from every kind of background you can think of, nobody in vogue, not too many people that are extremely popular, the movie is just real, one of the most real I have seen in recent memory, this movie is a must see, and hopefully an Oscar Contender.",Null,1,3,28 October 2005
The Best Years of Our Lives," One of the Finest Films Ever.
","World War 2 was a conflict that tested the resolved of the American nation, and it's spirit. The film changed the country permanently, in many ways, the world was a different place. So few films captured how the world was changing, as did this film. Frederick March, Dana Andrews, and Harold Russell play veterans on their way back to their hometown. They strike up a friendship on the way home and as they have to deal with the various aspects of their homecoming they talk and comfort each other, and try to help each other to adjust to going back home. Myrna Loy plays the love interest to Frederick March, a very nice woman who appreciates all that Frederick March is going through, but he is married to another woman that does not, and is more concerned about appearances than she is of the welfare of her husband.Even though movies were not allowed to delve into the issues that movies can today this movie talked about so many things that even movies today won't even touch, like the horrible state of job availability, how sometimes veterans are not appreciated for all that they do, even when they are physically altered as a result, and how they are set aside and hurt by American business who sometimes don't appreciate anything they do. This movie made quite a statement for the day, and I haven't seen too many movies do it since. This is a movie that more than other movies talks about a specific time, talks about certain standards and thoughts of the time. Much of the America talked about at the time doesn't exist today, or if it does it is not nearly as prominent as it is today.And that is why this movie is so good in a way: It is a time capsule, a movie so in tuned to this very important time in history, and it tells the story not through a documentary on the time, but through a very human story, with actual people that have very serious problems, and have to face the world as it was, with all of it's good and bad. The strength of this movie is in the characterizations, the writing and the acting portray a number of characters, and their interests, sometime good, sometimes bad, sometimes indifferent, and they come together so flawlessly to put such a great movie together.There's the wife who doesn't like what her husband is doing, the department store manager who gives Frederick March a low paying job, and doesn't appreciate at all that he fought for his country, the bank president who is reluctant to give loans to military families who need and deserve money so much, the axis sympathizer, and so many more, the diversity of the people here is amazing, and while there is so much going on the movie seems so focused, so singular, and the results is a spectacular movie.The leads do an excellent job, Frederick March as the disillusioned and troubled veteran, Dana Andrews as the wealthy veteran who is trying his best to help all of those around him, and upset by what he finds, Harold Russell, who actually lost his arm in World War 2, plays a man who did so, and he works perfectly for the movie. musician Hoagy Carmichael has a small but nice part as well, and Myrna Loy turns in a great performance too. This movie almost flawlessly captures the time, the essence of the era, as few movies can.There is really not a weakness in this movie, it is fun to watch, sad, funny, everything a movie should be, and the greatest thing about this movie, as few movies did, the movie does not have a truly happy ending, you don't know where their lives are going to go, some good things happen and some bad things happen, it just ends, and it's a very open ending, so it kinda shows you that so much is happening in the world, and this movie can't resolve it. This is one of the best movies ever made, William Wyler did a masterful job directing this movie, kudos to him and everyone that was involved in this movie.",Null,2,4,10 September 2005
Lost in Translation," What is the Point?
","Lost in Translation is the kind of movie that isn't really bad, it isn't really good, but I know for a fact it is there, I did see it after all. But that is the problem with the movie, it is just there. When it was over I was wondering if there was going to be more, during the movie I was wondering when the point was going to come up. It never did. There is no real purpose to this movie. The plot is coherent, the dialog isn't horrible unlike a lot of movie the film is slow and pointless, not horrible just pointless.Bill Murray plays a famous American actor who is doing a commercial in Japan. During his stay he meets a newlywed who is being neglected by her new husband. They become friends in the Tokyo backdrop. They go on relatively mundane adventures through the fantastic city, and what's the point of it? There just really isn't anything else to this movie. They meet, they do stuff, that's it. the performances by the leads aren't horrible, you just kind of wander why they're in it. Bill Murray seems uncharacteristically stiff, I just didn't see what the point of this movie was. It wasn't funny it wasn't sad, it was just there. I guess with a movie like this there isn't a whole lot more to say.",Null,3,7,7 June 2006
"I, Robot"," Domo Arigato, Mr. Roboto
","After thinking about this movie I have started to realize how they have taken a series of short stories written by one of the greatest all time science fiction writers and butchered some aspects of it. While there are many fascinating aspects of man's relationship with technology I can't help but think that this movie was only part inspiration and science fiction and more another in a long line of big budget Hollywood pictures that are filled with so many clichés and needless other film aspects that are not necessary to make this a good film, in fact these clichés and theatrical add-ons do nothing but hinder the film, and make what could have been an excellent film into a very silly film. Asimov would be very disappointed in what his series of short stories have become. The first problem with this film: Will Smith. Will Smith can be a very funny and entertaining comedic actor. But he has yet to seriously make the transition from comedic actor to actor that can be in a serious role such as this. Despite that I will admit there could have been a number of actors that could have been a lot worse in this part. The problem is I think that every lead part here requires a lot of depth and great acting, for this to be a truly excellent science fiction film, but Smith really was not able to provide the level of depth needed. Another problem with this movie is Bridget Moynahan. I admit she is cute but to ask her to be a real actress is like asking Mickey Mouse not to be a cartoon. She is not an actress, she is a nice firm body, with a lot of attributes, and in a movie that claims to be so serious and filled with philosophical questions about the fate of humanity she does not need to be in this film, she should be modeling, or in a movie that is not supposedly as thought provoking. The perfect movie for Bridget Moynahan's bad acting and obvious physical attribute would be anything with Freddie Prinze Jr. or Sarah Michelle Gellar, movie that are about as entertaining as watching grass grow, and yes Bridget Moynahan's acting is not quite as bad as watching grass grow, it is more like watching grass dying.But there are some positive aspects to this film, the first is you get a very eerie feeling watching in the middle of this movie, when you are not watching the bad acting, about the fate of humanity. This is a society that is hell bent on robots. Robots are everywhere in the future. They encompass every aspect of our lives, from our personal lives to our business lives. They are an integral part of everyday society in a way that in present day few can comprehend. When the movie talks about how robots are so integrated in society it really made me think, as well as a few people I was seeing this movie with. I told my friend in the theater 'this is freaky!' In this film they talked about computers shutting down libraries, about environmental degredation affecting society, and other global issues that affect us. The movie has a distinct tone of Asimov's time, as there is an implied trust in society that obviously does not exist in modern day America, as everyone does not think these robots pose any danger to anyone, and Will Smith's character is one of the outcasts, as he does not trust robots at all.. And it was, when this movie was a true science fiction film talking about technology and how it affects society this to me was Asimov's true vision of his work, not some silly Hollywood crap full of chiches and stupidity.But there are some bright spots in the cast. Bruce Greenwood plays Lawrence Robertson, the head of US Robot, the corporation that produces these robots.Chi McBride is excellent as John Burgin, Will Smiths boss who in understanding but always comprehensive of Will Smith's fear of robots. James Cromwell is also excellent as Dr. Alfred Lanning, the creator of these robots who is recently deceased, under mysterious circumstances, which is the centerpiece of the plot. Although this is a very fascinating film in many respects was unhappy with the finale. The finale was a typical slam-bang action thriller that might as well have been an alternative ending to The Matrix. This I think was nothing short of an insult to great science fiction, and aside from the bad acting is an insult to great science fiction work that is true science fiction instead of an excuse for an action film. To further add to the concept of a different time I get the feeling that Del Spooner, Will Smith's character is a comparison to McCarthyism, a reference to an earlier time as I mentioned before. In McCarthyism America was supposed to be scared of an enemy, and those that were not scared of this enemy were branded evil and part of the problem, which was in those days communism. Here paranoia is considered evil, and if you are paranoid of robots then you are branded an outcast in a McCarthy-like manner. This was one of the most fascinating aspects of the film, and one of the high-points of this film's writing style. The bottom line of this movie is that a good substantive film on the fate of man was sandwiched by a film full of Hollywood clichés. What could have been one of the best science fiction films of a generation has turned out to be a film with as many equally bad points as there are good points. This film is also entirely too reliant on computer effects. When I watch films like this, which are heavily computerized I am turned off by them, I do not feel as though I am watching anything, just something someone created from a computer. And I feel like if most of this movie, or at least large parts of it were created by computers I could create full length films on my computer. I know I can't, but perhaps the creation of films through computer is yet another question all of humanity will eventually will have to answer to",Null,5,10,28 November 2004
Batman Begins," What has happened to Batman?
","This is an interesting but not very good version of Batman. This is how it all started, but it contradicts some of the original movies, and just gets wrapped up in itself too much to want to even try to be good. Here we see how Batman gets obsessed with criminals after his parents are killed. While there are some elements true to the original comics such as Batman's commitment to justice, where did these guys get the idea to have Batman's outfit manufactured by a corporation? Batman was all self made, it wasn't made by some dumb corporation. Batman and everything he did was his own conception, designed to strike fear into evil. Bruce Wayne going overseas, getting arrested?! This really wasn't in the original comic books, I have no clue where anyone thought this stuff up. Whatever they did the movie seems very unoriginal, borrowing more from video games, like Dawn of the Dead, and other cheesy Science Fiction movies, like Night of the Living Dead, this movie doesn't seem like any original Batman at all.After seeing this movie I can respect the original, because Batman was in the start of the movie, his origins were not in the movie, and the movie was not boring like this one. The comic books were so cool because they had Batman in action, not because they had how Batman became Batman. And Commissioner Gordon, and Batman coming up together?! That is not something I ever read, but I guess after awhile some modern comic writers take Batman into a whole other dimension, far far away from what he was originally intended to be. Christian Bale does a decent job as Bruce Wayne, Morgan Freeman looks out of place in this movie, Michael Caine does an excellent job as Alfred, but is given some horrible lines, like trying to persuade Bruce Wayne NOT to be Batman? Telling him to go party? I am the first one that would love to go out with some hot supermodels and destroy a town, but I doubt that Alfred would be the one telling me to do so. This is so far off from anything that the original Batman was conceived to be, all Batman does here is beat people up. While there was always fighting, Batman was always thinking, he had to outwit his opponents too. And Gotham City now wasterland, that Ra's al-ghoul wants to destroy because it is so corrupt? This is insanity, that was something I think in a cartoon of Batman, I think. Batman begins is nothing like any kind of a beginning. This has got to be a different Batman, because in the original Tim Burton has his own origins of Batman, that were a little more realistic to what Batman was in the comic books. Whatever Batman is now is just crazy, I didn't like Batman and Robin, but it was better than this. Hopefully this will be the last in the Franchise, it's too muddled by now, but I can always hope.",Null,0,3,18 June 2005
National Treasure," Somehow I Expected Nicholas Cage to Have a Whip and a Fedora
","National Treasure is a good film, highly enjoyable, maybe even occasionally thrilling, but this movie wants so bad to be Indiana Jones but it is not. Overall this movie is a valiant effort, but it falls short of the brilliant adventure film it tries so hard to be. Nicholas Cage plays adventurer Ben Gates, a man who has been searching for a missing treasure that has been transported all around the world, most of his life. This treasure is supposedly something that has been amassed for part of the millennium. Now as Ben and his silly assistant Riley are about to find out their partners in treasure hunting are about to turn on them. The bad treasure hunters have a leg up now because they have some of the clues to the riddle, and they wish to steal the Declaration of Independence to see if they can find the treasure, as the map to the treasure is supposedly on the back of the Declaration. Ben Gates must steal the Declaration himself in order to keep the bad treasure hunters from doing wrong type things with it. Sound complicated it probably is, but it is much simpler to understand when you watch the movie. There are also a number of clichés, like the goofy sidekick, the numerous chase scenes, none of which really thrilled me all that much, but were well-done technically, didn't take away anything or add anything to the movie.The movie tries to be a mystical retelling of American history, as we find out the long story of the treasure and how it ended up where it did, or if it is still around at all, which no one really knows. There are plenty of riddles and puzzles in this film which are interesting, but not the kinds that really make one perplexed or just dying to see what happens next. The film sports a nice supporting cast, including a small appearance by Christopher Plummer as the grandfather of Ben Gates, and Jon Voight in the role of Ben Gates' father. Sean Bean plays Ian Howe, the bad treasure hunter, but he falls into the cliché category and really does not show any good acting skills in this part. Then there is the love interest, played by Diane Kruger, who is not nearly as revolting as love interests in other similar films, she actually can manage to stand on her own two feet against Nicholas Cage. Another problem with this movie is that Nicholas Cage is miscast. He does not fit the mold of a grand adventurer in the mold of let's say Harrison Ford. Cage just doesn't appear to fit into the part easily although he does what he can to act well in this movie. His miscasting does not take away anything from the movie just doesn't do too much for it. Let's face it that is what this movie is trying to be, another Indiana Jones. First it is important to say there will not be another Indiana Jones, so this movie was silly to try to be so grand in it's scale, it's not as good as Indiana Jones, but what is? Not much. Another problem compared with Indiana Jones is that when you watch the Indiana Jones films they never get old. You could watch them over and over again, and I know a lot of people that do. This is not a movie I am dying to see again. Indiana Jones was magical, this was a good movie far from one of the best of all time. And some of the scenes that are in caverns that are in mysterious places and things like that you expect Nicholas Cage to take out his bullwhip and jump across large crevasses and then the Indiana Jones theme to play. The movie does not try to be it's own film, or if it did it did not do a very good job of it.And a final comparison to Indiana Jones Steven Spielberg said that when he was making Indiana Jones he was just trying to make a B-Movie. He wasn't trying to make a great film, just a great fantasy movie no one was expected to take seriously. This movie takes itself to seriously, doesn't want to be a fantasy despite the fact it is. The movies plot lines and developing action are rooted too much into American history to try and be a good fantasy movie, so it doesn't work on the level it is supposed to. Don't get me wrong some of the plot lines and the story are interesting but it is nothing spectacular. It was worth it but will it become one of the highest grossing films of all time like Indiana Jones? I highly doubt it.",Null,0,1,29 November 2004
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Style Over Substance
","This movie is a classic example of style over substance. The wardrobe of the two lackluster leads is very expensive, tight-fitting, and very appealing to some. The house that the two live in is very expensive, something most people watching it could never afford, and a few may not even want it. This is an example of bad writing, the jokes are recycled, but just because the jokes are used doesn't mean the movie couldn't be funny, unfortunately the two leads are so horribly inept at performing comedy they waste what could have been a perfectly good movie. Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt largely are two people that are nice to look at, nothing more, for them to do comedy is too much, it is something they just can't do.There have been some horrible movies lately, while this one is formulaic and predictable it is not as bad as let's say Kicking and Screaming. The movies only good point is Vince Vaughn, a proved comedic actor who makes otherwise predictable material much funnier, his frantic pace makes his character about the best in the movie. You can appreciate Vaughn because in this movie, which almost has no unattractive or perfectly dressed people he is the only one that does not look plastic. And it was amazing to me to see no average looking people in this movie, sad to say a lot of movies suffer from that, people not as skinny as a pole, with all the curves, or with all of the perfect muscle definition, and it hurts a comedy, which is what this movie is supposed to be, but perfect people rarely are funny.The plot is the kind of over everyones head fare that you got to great success from Ghostbusters, and to solid effect from Men in Black, where everyone is just acting so crazy, doing almost impossible tasks. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are two assassins working for different agencies suddenly assigned to kill each other. The humor is supposedly suppose to come from the one-liners and the situations that arise from their strained marriage, and the awkward circumstances that come from their hits. Little of it provokes any laughter, but occasionally it would provoke a raised eyebrow, as some of the situations were just strange. One of the supposedly very funny running gags was Brad Pitt's inability to remember it the couple had been married 5 or 6 years and this was supposed to be funny.Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are not exactly brilliant thespians either, so they really can't act their way out of a movie like this. As these two often do, they look so bland and uninspired, but that's the way they always are, they're not actors they are nice to look at, and there is no better example than this movie that movie rely only on sex appeal, and no plot, writing and especially acting. And of course you have the mandatory dress up the lady in something sexy, in this case it was a dominatrix's outfit. But the sexy leads don't cut it. This movie could have been done better with better casting. Instead of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, cast Ben Stiller and Janeane Garofalo, two comedians that can make movies work.By the time the finals came around I was disinterested in this movie, I had gotten to the point where I realized the purpose of this movie was to have you look at the two sexy leads. The jokes were sometimes painful, but you can't really blame the writer, since his jokes and his screenplay were made so horrible by the performances. I just saw this movie because there wasn't anything else to see. So I guess it was a good way to waste two hours, or two hours were wasted for no good reason I can't figure it out.",Null,14,27,12 June 2005
War of the Worlds," A Fascinating Alien Movie Intertwained With Stupid Cliché's and a Happy Ending
","This comment contains a spoiler first, there are just too many gaping plot holes to not comment on, first when the jet crashes on the home Tom Cruise and his family are in it just happens not to strike his car. I mean come on we're not that stupid. That is forgivable, but the compact ending is not at all. Out of nowhere the son appears and is unharmed after he went off foolishly by himself to see the alien's attack. Also the house he went to and everyone in it was unharmed, grandparents and all, what a perfect ending, half of the world is destroyed, and that one neighborhood in Boston went unscathed. This movie should not have ended so perfectly. And then after Cruise defeats the aliens the next thing you see is he and his daughter going to Boston, I mean come on, what happened in between there? Let's try to be a little realistic here.Morgan Freeman's narration added a nice little element of intensity to it, and the idea of organisms in the human body destroying the aliens that was interesting. Tom Cruise for once did a decent acting job, and was a decent leading man. The strength of this movie is it's characterizations, and the visual images, Tim Robbins as the man taken in by the whole invasion, having lost his family, and obviously crazy, a train going by set on fire, but not able to stop, flowing bodies down a river, the countryside north of New York City drenched in blood, all of these images are quite incredible, and do contribute to the all around effect of the movie. The other strength of this movie is seeing the image from a non-corporate standpoint. There are very few superhighways in the movie, no McDonalds, no WalMarts, the movie is told largely in small towns and city neighborhoods, far away from the reaches of suburban America.The most recent alien invasion movie I can think of was Independence Day. That movies was just the opposite of this one. That movie had the president in it, and had a bunch f different stories put together to make that movie. This movie had one story, the family trying to get together, and revolved around one character, Tom Cruise and his two children. There is no scenes of the American military plotting it's counterattack, the story is simple and it works overall, despite the glaring follies in the plot. I didn't want to see this movie because I thought Cruise would be awful, he was decent, the problem was in the movie itself. Spielberg and the writers took a perfectly good movie and added some silly stuff to it especially at the end, where everything was wrapped up too nicely and made it all so perfect. I hate that the movie ended so pathetically, other than that it was very good. Spielberg has made a movie well worth seeing but it is not of the caliber of his earlier stuff, this is fun to watch though, and is probably best enjoyed by Science Fiction fans.",Null,0,1,31 July 2005
Hitch," Unoriginal date movie, some funny moments but it's been done before
","In every movie Will Smith is in he plays the same silly over the top character whose vibrant fast talking and silly personality always are the largest presence in most of his movies. Hitch exemplifies the personality unfortunately his presence is the only thing of any value in the movie, an unoriginal idea, and a script that is unfunny keeps him from really being himself. Will Smith plays a man who sets up men with the women of their dreams, for a sizable fee. He is very wealthy, very well-to-do and all around very appealing. He himself falls for a woman, and he is not nearly as confident and appealing as he makes his client out to be.Part of the reason I couldn't get into this movie was not just the unoriginal and uninspired acting, script and direction, but all of these characters are very wealthy, don't struggle for a living like most people, and generally speaking people tat are well off do not make for great entertainment. The movie just drags on and on, I was wondering if there would be any funny lines in the movie, there really wasn't, I was wondering if there was going to be anything in the movie to remember, there really wasn't. This is a movie that was just there, not really good, not really bad. Kevin James provides decent support, but that is about it. Writing about mediocre movies is hard there's nothing good or bad to talk about so you basically summarize the movie. This isn't a horrible movie but it isn't anything to jump for joy about either.",Null,3,6,8 October 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Ruined Star Wars George Lucas Has
","The original three Star Wars were fun, they were symbolic, they were fast, they were adventurous, they were just all around great movies. There was fighting, there was adventure, there was tragedy, there were real puppets. These next three movies were just God awful, and the legacy of three of the most fun movie of all time has been absolutely destroyed. Where is the innovation in these next three? Where are the cool characters, the catchphrases, where is the fun of the original three? There is nothing fun about this movie, and I think that is the problem: George Lucas didn't intend for these three to be fun, he wanted us to take it seriously, he even said these were going to be serious movies, which should have turned me away from them, because Star Wars supposedly is above all fun, and that's why the originals were so appealing, and these next three were not.Jar Jar Binks is a character who is so god awful that his major role in the first film was reduced to a less than ten minute role in the next movie, and a walk on role in this final film. How could George Lucas allow this? Jar Jar Binks was a god awful character, and he shouldn't have been in any of the films period. I don't understand how Lucas could create such magnificent characters in the first films, like Luke Skywalker, Yoda, Jabba the Hut, Bobba Fett, and other characters, many if not all of which have become pop culture icons and household names around the world, and then create pointless, or one dimensional, or unappealing characters like Jar Jar Binks? And how did R2D2 get to the point where he could fly and fight? He never could do that in the first movies, and this movie took place twenty years before this movie did, obviously as R2D2 got older he couldn't do as much. With the bad characters, and dark, serious tone, you can draw the conclusion that this the movie is badly written. The problem with the movie is the dialogue is simplistic. The legendary opening credits sport the phrase 'Evil is everywhere.' Wow, what profound words, that is fine for somebody that has never done this before, but for George Lucas, I would expect something a little better.The bad writing seems to compliment the unexciting storyline, which shows us the slow, and boring transition of Anakin to the evil Darth Vader. You would think that there would be something grandiose to it. but there really isn't, it's more than anything just there, which is just the opposite in the first ones. Lucas in the first movies made us feel a connection to the characters, that we don't feel here, I don't care about Anakin Skywalker, I don't fear him, the original Star Wars were so good at making us feel like we were in a galaxy far far away, here we feel like we are just in a theater, watching this boring galaxy far far away.Perhaps part of the reason why this movie failed so badly is the computer effects. The movie is basically almost completely computer animated, all of the sets, a lot of the characters, it's mostly not real. That was part of the beauty of the original movies, everything was there, it was tangible, all of the aliens, their costumes, Yoda, they were real, here none of it is real. Lucas would probably say the sets needed to be computer enhanced, but why? With so much non-computer technology these days, they didn't have at the time of the first movies I'm sure you could come up with something, I guess Lucas has just lost his imagination and drive that he had in the first movies.The problem I had with the first movie was that it seemed insignificant, the second movie might have been better if it were a little less computer animated, but this one lost me completely, very few if any redeemable qualities in this movie, I couldn't get out of this movie fast enough. This movie is completely lost , the first clue that it is so bad is I don't think people will be talking about Mace Windu, Quagon Jinn, Jar Jar Binks, and Queen Amidala as pop culture phenomenons, and household names the way people talk about Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and the rest of the original characters. The reason is because the characters, the writing, the effects, none of it is nearly as cool as the original, this whole series completely lost the novelty and the magic of the original, and maybe another reason is Yoda isn't a puppet anymore, he is digitally animated, just like a screen-saver, and so his magic and his character are non-existent. I could go on but I won't. This next set of movies was a big disappointment, keep Lucas away from Star Wars if you want to do another Star Wars film.",Null,0,2,19 March 2006
Ray," What I say? See this movie!
","This movie was Nominated for a few Oscars, it deserves all of them, at least compared to other films that came out this year. Jamie Foxx and a supporting cast of superior actors make this movie one to behold, I loved this movie, it is one of the best I've seen in years. The writing is almost flawless and the direction, not to mention the acting leaves little if anything to be desired. The soothing melodic voice, and intense vocals of this genius of music is put to a movie, to show Ray Charles for all of his good and all of his bad. Despite that there were some problems with the biographical perspective. The movie goes to the mid-sixties and then quite, it's almost like he did nothing after he recovered from his drug addiction. That was the one weakness, and of course his womanizing, his inability to deal with people, especially those that have done so much for him. Other than that this movie was moving, funny, dramatic, all in a very subtle way. This is the kind of movie that you look at and wonder why is it that more movies are not like this. I am not sure if Jamie Foxx will win the Oscar, but as Ray Charles he did a more than stellar job, in fact he made this movie as good as it was.When you watch Jamie Foxx in the lead role you almost think it is a documentary on his life, you sometimes forget it's a movie. There are a number of supporting actors who you recognize, but you can't place their names. They also make this movie seem larger than life. This movie, as far as production, writing, acting and execution are flawless. This was a lot of fun to watch. There are questions as to the kind of person this movie portrayed Ray Charles as, some saying it wasn't as hard on him as it should be, it made him look like too good of a guy. I thought the movie was pretty balanced, the movie didn't make him look that good. I never knew he was a drug addict, maybe I should have, after all one of his songs was 'Let's go get Stoned.' One reason to watch this movie is to see just how the genius got started, how he progressed, and got to where he was. Sadly I felt like the movie should have been longer overall. I thought the film should have focused a lot more on his childhood, and a lot more on his adult life. In that respect the movie focused too much on his years in the fifties and sixties.Still, despite the flaws this remains an excellent and well done movie. I loved this movie. But as I have had time to think about it I have realized this movie is great, but to me it is not among the best ever made. Because he movie does not focus enough on his young and older years it falls short of the comprehensive all-time great films, like Casablanca, or In the Heat of the Night, which Ray Charles did the score for. Still, this does deserve an Oscar or two, this is by far one of the best of the year, not necessarily saying a whole lot, but well worth your money. Watch it if for nothing else than the beautiful music of Ray Charles put to a movie, it is wonderful to hear it all. Jamie Foxx deserves an Oscar, if not Clint Eastwood, but if they give the Oscar to pretty boy Leonardo DiCaprio, I'm gonna write a few angry letters to the Oscars.",Null,0,1,12 February 2005
The Terminal," A Cauldron of Advertisement.
","Steven Spielberg invented in film advertisement, and to this day he integrates it so effortlessly into his films, as he did in Minority Report, in an even more blatant manner than here. Every time the Tom Hanks character walks there is some gargantuan advertisement for a Fortune 500 Company. And to me this does conflict with the kind of movie this is supposed to be.The Tom Hanks character helps a foreigner get medicine to his sick father, convincing customs that the medicine is for his dog, and in the background, shop at Target! The two seem at conflict. A commercial, and a piece of entertainment are two separate things, not one in the same the way Spielberg has made them. So the movie really gets under my skin in that sense. but other than that this is an interesting but not great little movie, far below what Hanks should be doing, and well, considering some of Spielberg's latest work, pretty typical of Spielberg.This is a solid little movie consisting of a number of familiar faces in nice character roles filling out the staff at the airport where the Tom Hanks character is forced to live, because of a problem with his home country while he is overseas. The situations are humorous and in typical Spielberg fashion over the top, but still manages to be a little more than marginally entertaining. The way that Tom Hanks' life intertwines with those around him is very entertaining and fun to watch. A love story with Catherine Zeta-Jones is interesting, but doesn't add or take away anything from the movie, except discussing her relationship with a man who really doesn't like her but she can't get away from him, at least that's the way I interpreted her relationship.I think the bottom line with this movie is it tried to capture the Spielberg magic of Indiana Jones or another of his legendary movies but it's set in an airport terminal, not exactly much magical about that. And the bottom line is all of these corporate logos really doesn't create magic, but it does create magic in the form of money for the movie, which I guess is a form of magic to some anyway.",Null,0,1,28 December 2005
Sin City," How do I Hate Thee Let Me Count the Ways
","How do I Hate Thee Let Me Count the Ways Before I watched this sorry excuse for a movie I had some ideas for some of the worst movies ever. This is very close to the worst movie ever made, if not the worst movie ever. Every movie that won a Golden Raspberry should be an Oscar contender compared to this. The plot revolves around the various citizens of Basin City, nicknamed Sin City. This is a town full of corrupt cops, murderous prostitutes, rampaging lunatics, evil priests, and any other vile character you can think of, with no good guys in the town Sin City sounds like a decent nickname. This movie is nothing more than an exercise in violence, gore, some sex, mutilation, cannibalism, flying blood, murder, and almost anything else designed to disgust your average viewer. The rampant violence had no real point, the extreme, and sometimes sickening scenes seemed to be there for no reason, but no, this is art. Sure murder and cannibalism have so much artistic expression. This movie has the artistic expression of a broken pencil, but there's probably someone that thinks a broken pencil has artistic expression, after seeing this movie I don't know what to think.I don't know how people can get shot 40 times and get minor injuries. People can get punched and it doesn't even scar them. Violence is so glorified and worse so unrealistic here. I have been assaulted, it is not fun, there is no glory in it, nothing fun, getting beat up is not nearly as vogue as it is here. If I had been shot 40 times I would not be laughing about it I would be dead. I have not seen a movie that glorified violence as much as this movie. This film makes sheer violence for the sake of violence look like it's all a game. The second most violent movie is like the Care Bears compared to this. Sin City tries to create an atmosphere of film noir. It is in black and white, and shot in a unique film noir camera style, giving the movie an interesting premise. The film starts out fascinating, and fairly interesting, but after 20 minutes the movie bombs. I never thought I would say the best part of a movie had Josh Hartnett in it.Some promoters said nothing like this movie had been seen before, neither had the Hindenburg, but that doesn't mean it was a good thing. This movie has the distinction of being the most violent movie and the most boring movie ever made. I looked at my watch more than a few times during this movie hoping it was over. I wanted to fall asleep, and I wasn't tired, the movie dragged on and on for more than two hours and had virtually no points of interest past the beginning. I never knew a movie could be this boring, but yet again I was proved wrong, this movie makes dripping water look interesting. Part of the reason this movie was so boring were the characters, I can understand over the top acting and characters, but the acting in this movie was awful, their characterizations made the acting the quality of a first grade play. I have never seen a group of characters so unbelievable and so awful, to the point that just looking at any of these people is revolting. Even with a cast of Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Rutger Hauer, Michael Clarke Duncan, and so many others should be at least decent. It isn't. The most repulsive of the characters is Rosario Dawson a dominatrix prostitute who leads a bunch of hookers in trying to save the lot of whores from a pimp who wants to control them. She gives bad acting a new idol, I hope I never have to see Rosario Dawson try to act again. All she does is add to this movies sexist tone. Almost every woman, if not all women are victims, who must be protected by strong men, women for the most part are unable to take care of themselves, and every woman in this movie is a sex object, someone who is valued primarily if not solely for sex, in some capacity.The movie has some attacks on politicians, police, and especially the Catholic church, and the city tries to resemble a major American city, but none in particular besieged by corruption, poverty and crime. But as everything in this movie does, it is all taken to the extreme. Any minor or marginal social commentary becomes an excuse for more violence, or another way to try and shock the audience. I can see immature people, especially kids saying 'Hey cool you can shoot someone 50 times and they can still be alive!' And you know this could happen, if it happened with the Three Stooges, who knocked each other on the heads with hammers and wrenches, and survived unbruised, it could happen here. If you are considering watching this movie (And I strongly advise against it) Keep in mind the only thing that kept this movie from being NC-17 was due to the fact it was filmed primarily in black and white. I think this movie still should have had an NC-17 rating, this movie was very very very very violent, and too much of the gore was shown in color for my taste. I wish I had never seen this movie, heard of this movie or had anything to do with this movie. Sin City is like looking at day old road kill: and you wish you hadn't looked at it. Both will probably make you gag, they both have that same kind of effect. If you want to see a good comic book movie watch Spider man, that is fun to watch, this movie is horrible, beyond horrible to no end and if you paid a cent to see it you wasted your money.",8,18,37,24 April 2005
Back to the Future," Corny no doubt but still awesome.
","This is as typical of a teen eighties movie as you can get, in fact the eighties might have been the decade that those teen movies were invented, if not then this is when they definitely got popular. The formula is generally the same, there is a self assured kinda rebellious young man who sometimes gets in trouble, has a nice girlfriend, and gets into all kinds of trouble. He listens to cool music, says 'ayyyyyyy' a lot, and most of the time has some sort of mullet. Some of the teen movies are good, some of them awful, but this one is a cut above the rest, Back to the Future is one of the best movies of the 1980's, and 80's superstud Michael J. Fox leads off this excellent movie. He plays Marty McFly, a high school kid who hangs out with the crazy scientist Dr. Brown, a wacky spaced out inventor played to perfection by Christopher Lloyd. The performances of Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd and their chemistry really are what make this movie they are perfect for their parts and really make this the movie that it is.The plot is very nice too. We see Marty McFly's neighborhood before anything was there, and it was just open land. We see the small town he lives in when it was much smaller in size, and there wasn't so much expansion. We see a lot of cool stuff in this movie. This is a movie that holds your interest through the entire thing. I have to admit I am a science fiction fan, and I have always been fascinated wit the concept of time travel, and while this movie is a complete fantasy (they travel back in time in a Delorean) It is also interesting to see the makeup jobs in this movie, we see characters 30 years in the past, and we see 40 year old people playing people who are twenty years old and vice versa. The highlight of the movie remains Christopher Lloyd, who plays what might be his best part ever, he is just too funny for words, and is so over-the-top he gives this movie the perfect tone, and compliments everyone around him with his great performance.The story progresses nicely, the last half hour is priceless, as we see Michael J. Fox play Johnny Be Good to a crowd who has never heard rock and roll as we know it. Then he goes back to the future and he almost misses it. The movie has the Quantum Leap aspect of it as we see what opens when you alter the past which affects the present in ways we never would have thought of. This movie is both a nice timepiece for the fifties and the eighties, showing at least the way that people in both time would like to have thought they were, in an idealistic world, so the movie is interesting like that, and has a nice touch of comedy, and science fiction here. The two genre's mesh well here, and sometimes Science Fiction and comedy don't always go well together. (see Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy) It is also kind of funny to see the time period conflict with each other, we see things that are done in the eighties, and not in the fifties and vice versa. While there are no belly laughs in the movie there are enough jokes and enough interesting moments that will definitely make you think, this is not a socially conscious movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it is something that is very interesting. This movie is probably the centerpiece of Michael J. Fox's film career, he rarely had a films this successful other than the two sequels, and this was a monster hit for the day. While it is one of the best eighties movies it is also one of the best about time travel, corny it might be but Back to the Future remains one of the best of it's kind, it's kinda hard to classify, but of whatever genre it is, it is one of the best.",Null,1,2,20 July 2005
