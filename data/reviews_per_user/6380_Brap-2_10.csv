The Lobster," TIFF 2015 -- The Lobster: Another take on relationships
","Yorgos Lanthimos gives us another taste of his monotone storytelling with 'The Lobster'. The story revolves around several nameless people who exist in a society that demands people to be in a relationship, or be transformed into the animal of their choice and be expelled into the wilderness to fend for themselves. Those who either become single through break-up or becoming widowed are sent to a hotel-like prison where they are cared for, but only for 45 days. If they fail to find a suitable mate, they are transformed and expelled.It doesn't take long to realize that you're not watching a Sci-Fi flick, but more so a satire on relationships and how people should always be a part of one, that single life is frowned upon. Colin Farrell's character attempts to jump through the hoops of the hotel by doing as they please, but his and other people's mentalities reveal that they cannot stay in that environment and would rather live amongst the Loners who vacate the forests, or die.We learn that mostly everyone who is a guest at the hotel is repulsive in some way: looks, attitude, or even a minor speech impediment. Eventually, it is understood that this brood of people -- losers, if you will -- are still supposed to be given a chance to find a mate and then live the rest of their dull life with that mate in order to avoid transformation.While the film exaggerates for our entertainment, it paints a very clear picture about how we perceive relationships and how we must be in one to complete our lives. Clearly, the attitude towards this idea is frowned upon (without going into Spoilers). The entire cast does a great job meeting the tonal demand of Lanthimos' films: dry, monotone, and almost no emotion. Farrell does a great job being terribly awkward. Rachel Weisz narrates the film, reading awkward lines in exchange for laughs. This film should be praised for its photography and script, but not for its length. Perhaps 20-30 minutes could have been shaved off to spare one from nodding off at times, just waiting for the end to come.'The Lobster' probably could have been a lot better had it been shorter. Despite its great script and hilarious pacing, the film eventually falls flat when it probably could have stayed on its feet.",7,9,23,13 September 2015
Requiem for a Dream," This movie makes 'Traffic' look like an anti-drug movie for kids.
","In the most violent, destructive, and emotionally gripping manner, Darren Aronofsky (and Hubert Selby Jr.) has managed to make sure, that I, Garry Tsaconas, will never even go near drugs in my entire life.The whole objective of this film was to give the viewer a direct observation as to how drugs (in this case, heroin and cocaine) can basically lead you from a high Utopia, into the final steps before death. (***Spoiler Alert Starts***) What was interesting about the movie was that none of the main characters die. They all end up at the lowest points in their one-decent lives, and can barely hang on to life anymore . When Harry (Leto) has lost his arm at the end of the movie, how many people walked out of the theatre and said, 'B.S.!!!! That's not possible?' Think again. When inserting needles into the human body, one must be aware of using....oh I don't know, A CLEAN NEEDLE, PERHAPS?! These junkies get what they deserve. Period (***Spoiler Alert Ends***).The acting, I must say, was excellent on behalf of all four main characters. I was very impressed at what I saw, especially since they worked with such a deep script. Marlon Wayans, for a typical comedian, managed to pull off an above-average performance. Jared Leto pulled a sweet job in this flick, nailing down an accurate Coney Island accent (although I'm not from Coney Island nor have I ever been there, the topic is up for discussion). Jennifer Connely did an alright job, but she wasn't up for any type of praise, I'd say. Ellen Burstyn carried about 50% of this movie. She does have talent, and she sure knows how to give you an impression or two. I can understand the whoop-lah of Julia Roberts getting the Best Actress nod at the 2001 Academy Awards, but she hadn't of been involved, I swear, Ellen Burstyn would've taken out the competition. As for the directing and the cinematogrophy, it sure captured the detail that was needed to show the effects of this film. Dual-screen shots, quick-action sequences to show what the viewer already knows (i.e. someone either shooting up, sniffing coke, popping pills, or simply eating food), and certian angles and shots that controlled the entire room, all for the viewer.'Requiem For A Dream' was not easy to watch. Well, to be honest, the second half of the movie was hard to watch. The first half is where the cinematic expertise comes into play. And for that, my hat is off to the cast and crew who were involved in this memorable film.'I like the way I feel. I like thinking about the red dress, and the television, and you, and your father. Now when I get the sun, I smile.'                                               - Sara Goldfarb",10,0,0,17 September 2001
Minority Report," Justice Remains Blind
","What's to say?Well, I don't believe that I've seen Spielberg use such experimental camera work before. In fact, I've never seen him do something like THIS before. A.I. doesn't count, folks.As a man trying to prevent crimes via future-tellers known as 'Pre-Cogs' (sp), Tom Cruise works hard to clear himself of a crime that he's going to commit in the next two days. The script works; the camera work, works; the acting works; the ending...was there. However, I didn't feel quite fulfilled by a movie that felt like it had dragged on way too long, but made some sense in the end. I'm glad I payed decent cash to see this flick, because it simply entertained my futuristically-creative self (a-la Robert Zemeckis BACK TO THE FUTURE). People should have fun watching this, but should also make concentrate on the detail that looks so unobvious. Spielberg intentionally starts the movie with a pre-crime to help describe how the system works to the audience. A good idea, indeed. I credit him for taking an extra step in descriptive film-making. He also managed to fit in some comedy into this Sci-Fi flick of sorts. I've never seem Spielberg do such a thing, but hell, I liked it. Overall, I was continuously watching. For a movie that's 144 minutes long, it can sure tell a crazy story about how any crime that is committed isn't a crime, until it has actually been committed. Justice still has a place in democracy.",Null,0,0,22 June 2002
Green Room," TIFF 2015 -- Green Room: Slice'em up romp with Neo-Nazis
","From the team that brought the world 'Blue Ruin', Jeremy Saulnier goes back to basics with 'Green Room.' A Punk-Rock band, in desperation of making some decent money while on the other side of the country, takes a gig at a somewhat desolate venue that frequents Neo-Nazis. When they witness a murder in the Green Room, then the classic Horror/Thriller movie romp ramps up.The film opened TIFF's 2015 Midnight Madness category to great reactions. The film definitely had a few hearts pumping. People who are fans of 'Blue Ruin' will be quick to compare, but it's important to understand -- and Saulnier clearly indicated this post-show -- that it goes back to Horror film roots that 'Ruin' steered course of, and that's 100% okay. Think of the typical stuck-in-a-room slasher flick. 'Green Room' is plenty more gory, so be prepared. The film garnered a good cast, including Patrick Stewart and Imogen Poots, and of course, Macon Blair.Well-executed action and horror. Did a good job at leaving people shaking and then eventually applauding. Only major gripe was the Stewart and Blair's dialogue were a bit difficult to hear at times. See this in a packed-house cinema if you can.",7,10,27,12 September 2015
Insomnia," The past will come back to punish you.
","(Pre-screen Review from Silvercity Theatres: Yonge And Englington, Toronto, Ontario)As always, a European script makes it to American soil, and makes a moron out of the simple film-maker. Apparently, 'Insomnia' was written by a Norwigean (spelling), and it's flow manipulated this film quite significantly. Plus, having an excellent director behind the camera, and a great staring cast, I would have to say that it all led to a quiet ending.
No complaints about this film - there wasn't much to say, really. All around, 'Insomnia' carries the confusion, lost roads, and numerous side-effects that 'Memento' left with the viewer (as this film was directed by Christopher Nolan, who directed 'Memento'). Also, the cinematography shifted the movie-goer's perspective into an actual insomniac drive. For me, I felt the dread and fatigue that was pushing through Al Pacino's character as the film dragged on. However, it literally did me in, as I started to fall asleep within certain points of the film. Pacino's character was faced with bad karma, as we find out late in the film. He had figured out that covering up the murder of his partner was only making things worse, and turning himself in would have made him feel a whole lot better about things. As for Robin William's character, he made me feel like he was an innocent man at times. His explanation about how he had committed murder seemed almost like it really was an accident. However, a man out of control, like himself, did not deserve to be around others if he were to continue on his life in the way he was planning on living it. Either him, and Pacino could turn themselves in and try to erase their crimes, or, they could face what decisions they had made in the past and continue on.Overall, good film. Hell, it kept me silent for the first five minutes after the credits started falling.",9,0,0,22 May 2002
American Pie," A sexual comedy at its best!
","'American Pie' was truly a movie that shows the average teenager going through major sexual scenarios. I should know, since I AM a teenager. :) Plus, I laughed my butt off in the progress.  I never thought I could watch a movie in a theater and be allowed to fall on the floor and laugh so hard, that the guy next to you would tell you to be quiet. It was a true masterpiece of teenage intelligence. The sex, the humor and whatever was in-between just made me EXPLODE in laughter.On a side note, it was really good to see Eugene Levy do a recent role due of the fact that I haven't seen him in any movies lately. I would like to see him do some more movies in the near future. This is some great Canadian talent we are missing. Even though his role in, 'American Pie' wasn't much on the silver screen, he still made me laugh before he said anything.Cheers to the American Pie cast and crew! Great Work!",9,0,0,12 July 1999
American Beauty," This is the real world
","This movie is like looking into a mirror. You are faced with making hard decisions everyday, thinking of how you are going to make it, without being physically, and mentally, tortured by the sickness of it all.
'American Beauty' is a fully-flexed simulation of what the world is like, outside of the movie screen. We all see what this, 'beauty' is like, we just do not want to admit it. The acting portrayed simplistic behavior of someone who cannot take the pain. Kevin Spacey seemed to reach that point well with his superb acting skills. Annette Bening reflected her mother-like personality as the typical, over-the-edge mom who has completley lost it. Thora Birch expressed teenage emptyness. She knew, somewhere in herself, that a normal teenager, acts like how Jane Burnham acts. As it was funny in the begining, I chose not to laugh at anything else after the first half of the movie. I was too into it. I was psyched! But I never ever, ever, walked out of a movie, so stunned, shocked, and impressed for any other movie in my entire life of watching the silver screen.To anyone who watched this movie, you have seen something that no other director could possibly do. 
Cheers to Sam Mendel and Alan Ball.",10,0,0,8 December 1999
American History X," 'If you prick us, do we not bleed.....'
","Edward Norton should have won that Oscar. He had shown myself, and the rest of the world the true reality of American History. AMERICAN HISTORY X is the eye-opener of the 90's and it sure opened mine. For some people, this was not an easy movie to watch for nearly two hours, but for the people who saw it all the way through, it should have done something to you. It should have opened up your eyes just like it did to mine. You know how it will feel after you watch AMERICAN HISTORY X. It probably was not easy for Edward Norton to say what he said,  but it added up for him in the end. When the movie ended, I am sure Nortons' character would have felt the same pain and aguish that all of the people he dealt with in the past (e.g. Elliot Gould) would have felt. It's like Edward Furlong says in the end of the movie, 'Life's too short to be pi**ed off all the time'.",10,0,0,1 July 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Crying in the wind, at the loss of a life....
","The reality of war has comprised of nearly one-hundred movies during the past century, and no one in that time frame has been able to make it as real as Spielberg did in, 'Saving Private Ryan'. All of it was true. The death, the destruction, the horror. Everything.The movie is quite remarkable. For nearly three hours it showed the basics and specifics of how the Allies and Enemies went at it in WWII. The enormous amount of losses at Normandy were all that sparked me in the movie. That is where I started remembering who was on that beach at the time, or who made it, or who didn't.The entire cast conducts an incredible performance. Hanks and Burns shine, Damon and Sizemore strike the screen with their emotions and thoughts, and Spielberg again amazes the world with his hard work and dedication toward the movie industry and the history of the world.",10,0,0,4 July 1999
Son of Saul," TIFF 2015 -- Son of Saul: Expect a little more than an education
","Easily tagged as a Holocaust film (but shouldn't necessarily be), 'Son of Saul' explores the perspective of a Sonderkommando named Saul — a German Nazi death camp prisoner who's job was to aid with the disposal of gas chamber victims — who finds a dying boy from the chambers and attempts to give him a proper burial who he claims to be his son, all during his time at Auschwitz. The film is uniquely shot from an over-the-shoulder perspective that keeps the viewer entirely focused on Saul, but still with the motions and actions surrounding him very noticeable (thanks to absolutely brilliant sound work in order to help achieve the eerie feel). 'Saul' reaches certain pinnacles of significant discomfort during scenes of execution — in the gas chambers and the burial pits — and a stone-faced Saul can do nothing but be forced to listen or watch. At points, the viewer feels claustrophobic when being ushered from the trucks in the middle of the night to one's fate. While the main story of Saul's attempt to give his 'son' a proper Jewish burial is what drives him — already accepting his own fate — the film goes beyond the typical WWII Holocaust story where you might only hear of incidents. In this film, the viewer is thrust upon into the fray of Hell, constantly following Saul through several one-shot takes that leave you wondering what is waiting for him. A word to the wise: this film prides itself on authenticity, realism, and truth; 'Son of Saul' is painfully poetic.",9,39,70,11 September 2015
