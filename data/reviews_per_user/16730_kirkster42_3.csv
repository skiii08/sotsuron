E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Quite Simply One of the Greatest Motion Pictures of All Time!
","SOME SPOILERS!E.T. is one of the greatest movies you'll ever see.  Here's why: #1 - The narrative and themes are timeless.  The innocence of childhood and the desire to be a part of something magical is just a portion of the film. It also examines the infinite realm of the imagination and the desire for lasting friendship.  These universal themes will help the film retain its message forever crossing over age, gender, race, etc.  #2 - The direction of E.T. is exquisite.  Notably, the bicycle chase scene near the end of the film is as thrilling as any scene in cinematic history.  This is Steven Spielberg at his best.  The action and excitement continues to build with the boys flying over a police barricade and into the forest.  Even though the finale is slightly cheesy with the spaceship leaving a rainbow as it ascends, you have to admit the whole scene is very touching.  One of the main reasons is because: #3 - The musical score is fantastic.  John Williams has always had a gift for providing an extra sense of suspense and adventure.  E.T. is just another example of his genius.  The score is uplifting and often times gutwrenching.  Most importantly, it adds an extra layer to the visuals and increases the emotional impact of the film.  All in all, E.T. is a brilliant ode to the joys of childhood and the imagination. The nostalgic trip I experience when watching the film is worth it every time.",Null,0,0,25 September 2002
Spider-Man," Good At Times, Bad At Times!
","All in all, I enjoyed the motion picture version of Spiderman.  It is good summer entertainment that is sure to dominate the box office  (at least until Episode II, Men In Black II, Minority Report, Goldmember, etc. are released).  Nonetheless, I have several complaints.  First, the filmmakers relied too much on special efx for the fight sequences.  Obviously, when Spiderman swings from skyscrapers special efx are completely necessary, and I have no problem with this.  But the scenes of Spiderman kicking anus on bad guys should be filmed with martial arts experts.  It would make them look much cooler in my opinion.  Besides, it would not be hard to put a Jet Li type under the costume.  In addition, maybe this is just me but I am sick of all action films trying to imitate The Matrix.  If I see another slow motion, back bending hero dodge bullets (or whatever) I think I'm going to throw-up.  Anyway, my second major complaint is the cheesiness of the dialogue.  The scenes between Mary Jane & Peter Parker are so slow and drawn out that their often painful.  Hint to the filmmakers: Don't force the sentimentality on the audience, it's not effective.  Pearl Harbor proved this last summer.  Also, the scene with the New Yorkers attacking the Green Goblin in defense of Spiderman is ridiculous.  I'm guessing the filmmakers completely reworked that scene after September 11 to show their support for New York.  Though it's a nice gesture, it is not needed in this film. After reading this review you probably think I hated the movie since most of my comments seem negative.  While I certainly did not hate it, I would be lying if I said I was not disappointed with Spiderman.  But I guess every comic book film can not be as good as the original Batman.  Not much can.

Pearl Harbor," What a cheesy piece of celluloid!
","SPOILERSWhere do I start?  I was quite disappointed with Pearl Harbor having looked forward to its release for several months.  I thought for sure that the writer of Braveheart could construct a deep and emotional account of such a crucial event in American history.  And there was no way that Bay/Bruckheimer could completely commercialize the traumatic attack.  But boy was I wrong.  This film could have been so good but instead it is so mediocre.  While it did have some redeeming qualities, for the most part it was piss-poor.  And here's why: PROBLEMS -- 1. Silly/Cheesy Dialogue: far too many sappy lines (Ex. 'It's your nose that hurts.' 'No, I think it's my heart.') And F.D.R. rising from his wheelchair to inspire his advisors, give me a break.  2. Editing Was Too Fast: many of the transitions were unintentionally jumpy.  It made me feel like some information had been left out. (Ex. Affleck telling Beckinsale that 'this is the best night of my life.'  This made no sense to me because I didn't see anything so great about it.  It seemed to me that Bay had to cut out some important action because the film was already three hours long.)  3. Too Predictable: I mean, who didn't know that Affleck was still alive and would be coming back to find his best friend with his girl (who is also pregnant).  4. Ridiculous Characters: the stuttering marine was funny for about a split second, the rest of the time it was stupid.  And it is entirely implausible that James King's character would fall for him, it's just silly.  I could go on and on but I guess I'll stop here.  In conclusion, the first half of the film and bits and pieces of the middle and end are entirely rubbish.  A pure waste of time.  While the middle portion and the actual attack is engaging and entertaining, I'm not sure if it makes up for the other garbage.  Why include the love story?  Why not depict the actual events leading up to the attack and maybe include some real stories from survivors?  Look at Saving Private Ryan.  The film didn't need a love story.  It focused on the emotions of war and the comradery developed when soldiers are thrown into battle.  When I left Ryan I felt the upmost respect for anyone who has served their country and risked their life for freedom.  But Pearl Harbor evoked no emotions except, 'Wow, these dogfights are cool.' or 'Well, it does have great special effects.'  I left the theater wondering if PH did justice to the 1,100 men and women who lost their lives in Hawaii, or if it simply provided Bay/Bruckheimer with an opportunity to make a lot of money by blowing things up.",Null,0,0,28 May 2001
