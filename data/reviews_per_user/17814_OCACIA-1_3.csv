Captain Phillips," 1/2 A4 script stretched to 133 of US propaganda
","Let me start by saying, one thing about Somali people is they are know for being very handsome. I leave it there. And we get to see the Western take on poor Africa crop up in the politics of this film. I mean these 4 little boys against the Entire US army/military and Seals and one Capitalist ship that did not contain any food for Africa, only products made from African raw materials that our silly leaders buy.(off topic) people in the West don't like those kind of films.This film only needed to be 15 minutes long. And even then the story is so weak and without any real tension. Those baby pirates are scary like Santa Claus. Where are the Real Bad Boys? 1/2 the film is in some life boat. What I am confused about is the rating, and the hype from the critics. I think they buy them off, because we did not see the same film. No way we did just watch 4 little pirates vs the US whatever in a little yellow boat and said it was 'Amazing', 'Thrilling', edge of my seat--not.I wonder if Hollywood would be interested in my script which features all the pirate ships that actually get paid and America loses?",1,32,79,26 November 2013
Life of Pi," Pretentious and very redundant, bad editing, questionable music
","The film was weak the minute it started. The script is sub-standard. It is not the fault of the book (guessing as I have not read it), but the fault of the script writer. It has in so many redundant scenes that serve no purpose at all in constructing the narrative. The prolix debates about religion have no serious connection to the story. They serve absolutely no purpose. The church scene, the issues around Jesus, poorly written, poorly introduced into the narrative. Very unrefined in transmitting a spiritual message. It is certainly not deep, and they had a million ways to introduce the multi-religious themes.The ship cafeteria vegetarian scene why was it there? The Japanese guy talking about his dish, why was it there? The scene when his father teaches him about the Tigers ways made perfect sense to the narrative.So after all of that redundant time wasting we get into the meat of the film. Which was okay. Hardly original, You seen Tom Hanks you seen Avatar fuse them together. Tom Hanks on Avatar Island. Some of the music, esp in the opening did not gel at all. I was shocked by the opening title credits it was absolute devoid of impact. It was like we do not know what to do, let us do something. And even after making head way they had to go an spoil everything with yet another redundant anti-mood scene in the hospital with anew story. His mother being eaten by sharks, I am like? Why? what did that entire redundant scene tell us? What for. Leave it as it is, the family comes home the titles come up. Weak story telling, Weak subtext, weak editing, weak directing, nice CGI, some nice tension. not well stitched together, maybe for kids.",4,5,19,22 December 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Now I want a Mac Book Pro
","confusion, disconnected, junk. Very upset with Fincher. Those stories of the two characters remained separate for so long they might as well have made two different films and split the change. Just tell one story or the other. Do not care for the book because I didn't pay money to see the book, I paid money for the film. It would be better to betray the book and make something worth seeing, other than a 3 hour Apple advert, than try to copy a good book and mess it up.Sex comes out of the blue, as expected in Hollywood. And let us not discuss the ending that would not end, except started to mutate into another film. Sometimes you look back on the Rambo/Die Hard endings and miss the old days. Blow it up - Roll the credits. finito.",2,8,15,4 May 2013
