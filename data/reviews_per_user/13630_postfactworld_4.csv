The Lobster," Don't waste your time
","I kept watching because Colin Farrell's screen presence kept my attention. I assumed that at some point, one of the characters would display some level of cognizance of the ridiculous plot in which they were immersed. It turned out to be a waste of 2 hours.This movie is nothing more than a vapid romp through someone's dull subconscious. I theorize it was written by someone who one day had the random thought that if he had to be transformed into an animal, he'd like it to be a lobster. Unfortunately, not all random thoughts deserve to be expanded into a screenplay.The characters are uninteresting - robotic and ultimately boring with no relatable human qualities. In Orwell's 1984 dystopia, at least we understand why the outer party members are so accepting of their situation - fear. There appears to be no motive for the citizens of the society in this film to accept submission to their ludicrous circumstance. This fact alone undermines the entire premise. Temporary suspension of disbelief regarding the characters' basic humanity and motivation turns into permanent suspension before the film is a quarter done.If this film is indeed allegory, I missed the hidden meaning entirely, and I've not read any other reviews that have gone further than merely to state, 'This is allegory,' or, 'This film makes you think.' Really? What is the subtext then? What's it making you think about? Pretentious babble.A very bad movie. I'm giving it two stars because I watched it all the way through, though I am perfectly willing to stop watching a movie after 20 minutes if it's truly awful. The film-makers get credit for making me believe they were going to deliver some substance before the end.",2,39,64,30 December 2016
Yesterday," A fantastic idea, squandered
","I'd like to wake up in an alternate universe where no one had ever seen this movie, so I could re-make it completely with the original premise and turn it into an all-time classic.It's a good movie, it really is. I enjoyed it, and it was so sweet I actually feel kinda bad for saying anything negative about it. But I've never seen a movie before during which I second-guessed the writing choices so often and so vigorously.The first half is very well-done. Everything leading up to the point that Jack goes to L.A. to make his record is quite on-point and really builds the excitement for the second half. I was giddy as a little girl at Disneyland when I THOUGHT I realized where the movie was heading. When Jack was in his room assembling all those Beatles songs from memory, I wanted to shout the lyrics at him through the screen so we could move on to the shining, wonderful second half, in which Jack Malik becomes the greatest musical superstar in history and has amazing adventures.But it comes on you slowly. You're watching, and waiting, and then you suddenly realize - 'Oh. They're doing this instead.'I'm giving it 7 stars because I love the Beatles and I liked the movie. But it could EASILY have been a 10 with better plot choices.",7,1,2,24 February 2020
Ip Man," Classic Revenge Story Done Right
","This is the best kung fu movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of them, including, of course, all of Bruce Lee's movies.What Bruce Lee's movies always lacked, this movie has - proper motivation for the lead actor. Bruce Lee fought for...let's just call them trivial...reasons. In his handful of great martial arts movies, he fought for:<ul><li>The honor of his fighting style over other fighting styles</li><li>A restaurant troubled by hooligans</li><li>Someone breaking his mother's amulet</li><li>Victory in an illegal martial arts tournament</li></ul>Nothing too heavy there. But Ip Man is next-level stuff. The backdrop is the Japanese invasion of China in WWII. The occupiers are heartless and cruel, the occupied starving, treated as slaves. The peace-loving Ip Man, who lives by Confucian principles, is drawn into conflict with the invaders against his will, and every fight is important for its own reason. You will find yourself cheering for Ip Man not because he's a great character, though he is; but because his motivation is your motivation.The action sequences are just terrific. You want your hero to be invincible, and he is, in the most satisfying way possible.This is a great movie and I highly recommend it, even for people who aren't into the martial arts genre.",10,0,0,12 August 2018
Arrival," Meh
","Amy Adams is absolutely captivating, as always, to the extent she demands your attention and never, ever lets go. She is infinitely watchable. It's not genius, unless it's contrived by her. It's just her unique form of charisma, one that is to be applauded and treasured, and is worth watching any movie to see.Sadly, that is most of the reason to see Arrival. The movie itself tries very hard to be mysterious, seductive, and interesting. But in the end, it fails because its philosophical and scientific kung fu is weak. Arrival utterly ignores such well-known time paradoxes as the Predestination Paradox and the Bootstrap Paradox and ultimately conspires to have you ignore common sense. To swallow the sugar-sweet ending (and you'll want to), you will have to pretend that an entirely new, completely unexplained paradigm of non-linear time is possible - one that defies reason and is passed without adequate...you know, I want to say 'without adequate' but in truth it's without ANY explanation.I couldn't pretend to believe it, and that's why I'm giving this movie 5 stars. Amy Adams gets 10.",5,7,12,15 May 2017
