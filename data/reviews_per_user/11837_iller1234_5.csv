Black Swan," Rather aim than go with the shotgun
","I'll skip the plot entirely for this review as the one given by IMDb is more than enough. That is to say you can describe it all with a few words and still risk spoiling the whole experience.Not all true though. Behind the quite predictable storyline lies some pretty good scenes and amazingly good acting from our main character Nina played by Natalie Portman. She makes the story believable at least subjectively, told from inside her own perspective. If you can manage the cheesy character of her producer, Thomas Leroy, the rest of the cast does a good job. For you out there interested in a mysterious thriller have something to look forward to in Black Swan, because even if you figure out how the story will end around 20 minutes in you will still feel the thrill of every scene. There's something cosy about occasionally getting your heart rate up and having total focus on the screen. The Silence of the Lambs and Gothika comes to mind here as a combination for a fitting comparison. Only lacking the true mystery behind an intelligent MS and being predictable hinders Black Swan from becoming a real blockbuster. What I like then is that it doesn't seem to be produced to bring good sales only, but rather to be a meaningful experience within the genre.If you get a blanket for the youngest this is a movie for the whole family. Good acting, good story and a good soundtrack to go with it Final verdict. Acting: 8 Soundtrack: 8 Story: 7 Production: 9",8,7,11,3 April 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," A mix of good and bad
","I thoroughly enjoyed all iterations of Pirates of the Caribbean. I have mixed feelings about this one, however. First thing's first - the plot.The story is fairly complex, especially if you haven't watched any of the previous ones. The two famed pirates we know from before, Cpt Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and Cpt Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), find their paths intertwined with Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites) and Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario). They all come to seek the trident of Poseidon. Needless to say obtaining it is easier said than done. One of the factors stalling their progress is Captain Salazar, brilliantly interpreted by Javier Bardem. The movie shifts from being an uncomfortable teenage romantic movie, to a bad sitcom and then to a fascinating fable with jaw-dropping special effects. The two former spoils the experience for me, the latter pulls me right back in. The typical Hollywood script of boy meets girl and girls body gets highlighted in various camera angles and talked about throughout the movie is there. Together with not-very-fun punchlines in almost every scene. The serious story and scenes of significance that Jack Sparrow and his ludicrous crew normally are supposed to bounce on are too few here. The ones that are there, though, are really intriguing. This is where Captain Salazar shines and reminds us of the magical, unforgiving and endless universe that is Pirates of the Caribbean. The movie as a whole is still good, and if you're a fan of the previous ones - worth your time. At the very least your top villain of all time list will get a little longer",7,1,6,28 May 2017
Paranormal Activity," Good but depressingly over-hyped. Disappointment
","I watched this movie in the cinemas since i wanted the full effect and to be horrified like never before as the youtubevideos suggests. The movie was so hyped i hoped it to be that scary movie I've been waiting for since my experience with Rec. The setup is a house, two people in it and a camera. Starts off promising with fairly good acting. It almost seems they are a couple in real life, that would be my guess. Micah(Micah) does what you would expect from a boyfriend after his girlfriend tells him she hears noises and sees things after midnight - he sets up a camera in the house and starts taunting. As texts in the middle of the screen shows the process, day1..day12 etc. things escalates from day to day. People in the audience are getting nervous and i feel the tension rising and building up my expectations. However the movie is never really kicking off and nothing is ever happening, its like Scream without the guy with the knife. Its like your lover giving you a lapdance and leaving in the middle of the show. Its like i pay 15bucks to get scared but i get angry instead. The whole movie felt like the first 30 minutes of a good horror movie, then all the sudden texts start running down the screen and the cinema is lit up - the movie is actually ending after 30 min? oh well my clock tells me I've been sitting here for 1½ hours. Taking the budget into consideration i would say its a great horror movie. I guess i was just expecting something more frightening. Want to know how the audience was reacting? They reacted like me, laughing and complaining when walking out.I could almost promise you the hype is mostly made up and the videos you can watch online are promotion and bullshit. I cant imagine anyone leaving the cinema or getting freaked out. OK, maybe if they are bored and leave or angry and freaked out.",6,5,9,22 November 2009
Thor," Mystique long forgotten
","I'll jump the plot for Thor as the short one provided by IMDb is more than sufficient to spoil half the movie.Chris Hemsworth seems at home with his interpretation of the young and naive Thor, although abit ludicrous and not strong enough to carry the heavy crown of a superhero in Hollywood. That's not measured in muscles by the way. Hopkins, Portman and Skarsgård do what they can with the script they are handed. Tom Hiddleston on the other hand steals the show in my opinion and brings some character to the otherwise weak dialogues and shallow story. The mandatory romance is unexpectedly uncomfortable with Natalie's character Jane Foster playing out almost as an under aged groupie to the rock star Thor.The visuals are good as you would expect, but nothing jaw dropping. The many backgrounds have great detail but I never felt any mystique or ancient power hidden in the pixels.There are some goodies to extract from the movie don't get me wrong. Agent Coulson reveals his connections with Iron Man and perhaps hints about the upcoming The Avengers set to be released in 2012.If you are still not sure whether or not to watch Thor, I'm sad to say if you've seen any marvel-movie from Hollywood, you've already seen Thor.",6,6,14,4 May 2011
Inception," Good idea but crushed ms by poor acting
","Saw it in cinemas a week after opening night or so. I couldn't keep off the 8 vote though i feel its a bit high.Short about the movie before i review it. Cobb - the main character, played by Leonardo Di Caprio, is a former architect and accused for throwing his wife out the window - literally, is trying to clean his record with the police by doing a job for a powerful acquaintance(Ken Watanabe - Saito) that involves dreamexorcism and the like. While struggling with the mystic relationship with his former wife he puts together a team of specialists to handle the job. Ellen Page plays Ariadne, the gifted young architect. Tom Hardy plays Eames, the 'impersonator' if you will. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Arthur, in charge of the technical aspects. They are all there to trick Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) big time. By taking him through three levels of dreaming they hope to alter the very core of his motivation and change his future plans as a result. You will have the rest explained to you, don't worry about that.I've heard people saying they have to watch the movie 3-4 times before understanding the story in full. In my opinion you have almost everything explained to you just as it happens. This comes through in discussions among the characters or with the camera itself. To clarify, if you have to think about something for a moment because you didn't understand it fully the characters in the movie interrupts your thought process by explaining exactly what just happened. I don't mean to sound arrogant at all but I have this problem with movies that tries to reach out to everyone at once. If the aim is to include every watcher they obviously have to explain things over and over in different ways. I totally get that but it doesn't fit well with a movie like this one, it takes all the thought provocation and mysticism out.I don't know if it was the overall Hollywood-humorous-mood of the movie that made it difficult for me to take the characters seriously or if it was just poor portraiting from the actors. It seemed more of a kindergarten with Leonardo, the grownup, running around trying to calm down the kids - Ellen and Joseph. More of a Harry Potter cast feeling to it Im afraid. Im also disappointed to say that Leo had his worst performance in a long time, if not ever. I'd think the manuscript was aiming for a very emotionally moving struggle for the main character. However Cobbs little misadventures wasn't moving me one inch. Leos acting felt empty and almost fake.Nolan tries to feed the watcher with a bit of everything, romance, humour, action, sci-fi and psychology all at the same time but falls short in every area. The actionscenes and animations are great though, in line with almost all new movies from Hollywood these days. This to me unfortunately makes Inception more of a hardcore actionmovie than the thought provoking masterpiece I was hoping for.Now if you are one not particularly annoyed by areas discussed above you wont be disappointed with Inception, you wont be anyway. The ideas behind it are new, very interesting and thought provoking. I think people will start investigating and experimenting with their dreams just a bit more after seeing Inception.I know I do, and I like it :)",8,6,13,7 August 2010
