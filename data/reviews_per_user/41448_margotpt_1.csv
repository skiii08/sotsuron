The Benchwarmers," If you like Jon Heder, you might enjoy this movie.
","I generally avoid movies with a lot of gross or body humor, and movies with the three major stars in it, and would naturally have avoided this one, except that Jon Heder was in it, and I thought I would give it a try. I was not disappointed. He pulled off being an idiot without recreating his Napolean Dynamite character. He was funny.There were other elements of humor that were random, silly and funny. I found myself laughing out loud, but unembarrassed. Many of the scenes caught me off guard. I was pleased that the movie had less trashy language than I expected, and actually less body humor than I expected.If you like random, silly movies, this would be a good choice, and if you are Jon Heder fan, you might really enjoy this movie.",6,1,1,19 April 2006
