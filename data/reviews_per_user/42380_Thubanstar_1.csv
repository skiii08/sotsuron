One Hundred and One Dalmatians," My favorite movie as a kid
","This was Disney's last animated film made when 'Uncle Walt' was still alive and in good health. First off, I love the way the story actually tried to stay true to the source material, unlike, unfortunately, many later Disney films.Just a side note here and a pet peeve. If you have a child that loves this movie, get them the original book by Dodie Smith, NOT the books Disney makes. If it's one thing Disney does that I cannot stand, it's taking real works of literature and making not only an animated version, but their own 'book version'. Ick.As for the artistic style... some people on this board are way too young to remember, but the cartoon style of the late 1950's early 1960's took a sharp turn toward the abstract, and realism was frowned upon for years. It's no wonder 101 Dalmations looks different from most other 'old school' Disney films. Honestly, they got away with as much realism as was accepted at the time in the graphic design and art community.This film is very well paced, with lots of wit and style and well written characters. Cruella is one of the great villains, and the puppies are adorable. I loved this as a kid, but even as an adult I can see that it works on many different levels.",Null,2,2,1 March 2005
