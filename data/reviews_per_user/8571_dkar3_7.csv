Angels & Demons," Wow...this movie sucks
","This is the stupidest movie and completely consistent with most Ron Howard films.First, it's a far cry from the book. OK, that alone doesn't make it a bad movie, but the movie sequence is almost completely unfollowable, difficult to hear and understand, and filled with ridiculous elements about Rome, the Vatican itself, the Vatican security detail, and the Catholic church. It expects us to believe that an American professor would know more about the Vatican, Italy, and the Italian culture than career Vatican employees and Italians. Tom Hanks is far from believable as an 'Indiana Jones'-type professor who supposedly knows more than just about anyone in the world about Catholisism, or Italian history or culture.Tom Hanks and Ron Howard continue to put out drivel and garbage and this is one of their latest excrement. Yuk.",2,2,4,28 November 2009
Gravity," Horribly boring, poorly acted, and a simpleton's dialog
","What a disaster movie (pun intended). Like the original Star Trek movie, this movie has some interesting special effects and familiar faces, which at first glance makes you think its something remarkable. Instead, the story line is absolutely dumb, boring, unbelievable, and pointless. There really is NO story here, but rather a contrived and narrowly scoped situation that supports the producers desire to use high-end technologies to make pretty pictures. Bullock and Clooney delivery horribly silly performances - unbelievable, preposterous, and dorky The only positive notes I can add, as stated above, is the visual presentation is very good. Visit the NASA web site and you will find same/similar real images, minus the formula gimmicks of the movies.",3,3,6,11 October 2016
Argo," Lame - totally lame
","LMFAO, there is some seriously LAME stuff in this movie. Afleck doesn't seem to realize the level of technology available in 1979 nor the incredible barrier between counties then. What a joke. The worst is when they are 'checking in' and one second their reservations are not in the system and then - thanks to the CIA's by-a-nats-hair approval, the reservations are available the next second. WTF: no internet, remember! The U.S., at that time, had few computers, and Iran had probably almost none! The story and direction in this movie is completely stupid. I'm not 10 years old!!!Otherwise, an OK movie, but so hyped, its not really more than a 'TV movie'. I can't believe its up for awards. I thought Airplane-2 was more believable, and that was a comedy!!!!",5,5,10,21 February 2013
Ted," Mildly funny, Definitely offensive
","This movie might be funny to the yehudies from NY, but its not very funny to the civilized world. The humor is not clever and not new. The story is not clever and not coherent. Where was this movie going?? Other than being offensive at times, what did this movie really have to offer?...not humor? Oh please!, NOT a message about relationships. They try far to hard to be funny by injecting out of context cussing, filthy, and bathroom jokes. Not very clever. It would have been much funnier if they had tried for a less crass approach. I've never seen a better idea trashed and ruined. What a waste of a potentially funny concept. Disrespectful to most races, religions, anyone with an education, its even insulting to prostitutes, if you can believe that!",2,3,6,24 December 2012
"I, Tonya"," Incredibly Inaccurate version of the real story
","Sure, if you take the movie at face value, its shocking, outrages, and vile, but reality as compared to the story is much different. I could make a GREAT movie about the 500th baseball manufactured by Spalding, but in truth and reality, it wasn't very interesting. I found reading the real biographies much more interesting. As for Allison Janney, whom I find very talented, the character is so fictionalized that its not enjoyable. Try playing a real-life, bigger than life person and see how you do! THAT would be a real challenge. Even I could make the life of your neighborhood movie usher look exciting and outrages.",5,0,2,27 May 2018
Ocean's Twelve," Horrible, self-serving, disjointed movie
","Ocean's 12 starts off on annoying and gets worse from there on. Like a celebrity awards presentation, each major actor/actress is introduced in short 60-second scenarios that seem to stop just short having a blinking 'applaud now' sign. The first 60 minutes of the film are incredibly disjointed, poorly edited, and at times, utterly unrelated to the story and confusing. Speaking of the story,...there is one, kinda,...but its barely visible for all the 'look at me' shots and cameos. Only Matt Damon seemed to actually 'act' during this film...the rest of the cast appeared to only be there to participate in a rat-pack-wanna-be session. As for the heist, the action, the drama....it was put into the last 8-10 minutes of the movie and was pathetic and anticlimactic. Horrible! Horrible! Horrible!",1,269,537,10 December 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," I thought it would never end
","Overall, I felt Lord of the Rings was a decent movie; however, it was ruined by the fact that it went on-and-on-and-on for nearly three hours.   At the two hour point, having already slipped out to use the restroom once, I found myself squirming in my chair hoping somebody would kill him just so we could end the misery!The imagery is very good, and for the most part, so is the acting.  There is a great deal of camera movement, especially during the 'fight scenes', so if your susceptible to nausea from this (such as in Blair Witch), at least try sitting towards the back.I realize cutting this film down to two hours may be considered by some to be like cutting the Book of Revelations from the Bible, but...the movie is way too long, the climax happens a dozen too many times, and I found myself losing interest in the whole thing.Rating:  4 out of 10",4,1,2,25 December 2001
