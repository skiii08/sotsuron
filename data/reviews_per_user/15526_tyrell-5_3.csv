Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Very Good, but not as good as 'The Matrix'
","Wow! Im not sure, but i think that this film is better then episode 4, 5 and 6, i really do!. Anyway, i saw this film at a THX-cinema, and that was quite an experience. I have never seen such cool and nice visual effects!. I also think that the acting was very good, Liam Neeson was very good as Qui-Gon Jinn, Natalie Portman was also very good, but i was disappointed about Samule L. Jackson's role, i thought that he would play a pretty big role, but not. This film was excellent, but not as good as 'The Matrix' I'll give this film 8.7 out of 10.

The Matrix," The Wachowski Brothers rules this world!
","Ok, im in the cinema with a friend, the film has just began rolling, and i think: this is just to slow!!!, but after about 30 minutes i begin to like this film, and i am thinking: this film is good!, very good!. The Visual effects are on the top, the acting is great, and, everything is great!. 1 hour and 45 minutes later, i sit outside the cinema on a bench, and thinking something like this: wow!, what a film!, i have to burn my film collection up! I give this film 9,9 out of 10!",10,0,0,1 August 1999
The Thin Red Line," Beautiful Movie
","This was one beautiful movie!I don't know much to say about this movie right now, but i can say that i sure liked it, it was very nice shot, with some (not many) nice underwater-scenes, nice landscapes and realistic battles. The music by Hans Zimmer was good, and the sfx was as in any film of this kind filmed in stereo, cool. But one thing i didn't understand was why they casted (is it called casted?), John Travolta and George Clooney to do such small roles.Well... 8,2/10",8,0,0,1 December 1999
