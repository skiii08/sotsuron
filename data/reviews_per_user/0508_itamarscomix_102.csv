The Blair Witch Project," Mis-marketing in action
","The Blair Witch Project is an interesting mockumentary with an intriguing concept, that was the victim of many bad decisions, in the process of making it and especially of promoting it. The ambition, it seems, was to create an experimental art-house film that would appeal to mainstream audiences, and by marketing it as a 'horror' movie, create surprise and buzz. The attempt to bridge the gap between the two viewer groups was quite positive, but what it actually achieved is alienating both: the horror crowd was disappointed and annoyed, especially younger viewers who sneaked into an R rated movie expecting gore and heads-on horror; and the more sophisticated, avant garde crowd, turned off from day one by the film's promotion, didn't even bother to go see it.A decade later, it's easier to put all that aside, as well as the internet-based hype generated by the producers at the time. The film can now be appraised as what it is, an exercise in experimental filmmaking, and an interesting one at that. It takes a lesson from the true great classics of horror - in that the fear of the unknown, the anxiety and anticipation of violence are much more effective than explicit violence in itself - and indeed, it's scarier than almost any horror movie created in the last twenty years, although the teenagers who usually go for that kind of movie will probably disagree. The Blair Witch Project creates tension and anxiety, and draws the viewer into the characters' world. And it doesn't matter one bit whether or not you think it might be real - in fact it's more impressive when you know that it's not.Unfortunately, it doesn't achieve true greatness in that respect either. In its attempt to bridge between mainstream horror and experimental indie movie-making, the film reaches a sort of middle ground that isn't quite here nor there, not quite satisfying anybody. The Blair Witch Project is not a classic or a great film, nor will it ever be, but it should be watched by fans of independent and experimental cinema and of classic horror, and remembered as a brave and innovative experiment that didn't quite make it.",7,0,1,23 September 2011
The King's Speech," Flawless
","You'd be hard pressed to find anything really negative to say about The King's Speech. Even if you try hard to question the historical accuracy, as some critics have, you still have a fantastic story of perseverance, of loyalty, and of friendship. Firth and Rush give phenomenal performances - for both, I suspect, the best performance of their career (Rush at least has some competition with Shine). Helena Bonham Carter gives an uncharacteristically low-key and humble performance, and the entire supporting cast - Guy Pearce, Timothy Spall, Derek Jacobi and Michael Gambon especially - are cast to perfection and do a terrific job. From a purely dramatic and cinematic perspective, The King's Speech is a near-perfect movie and deserves of an Oscar more than most winners of recent years.",9,1,1,23 September 2011
Moneyball," The Game of Numbers
","Moneyball came out of left field for me (har, har) and surprisingly became one of my favorite films for 2011. I say surprisingly because I've never been a fan of sport films in general, and in particular I know very little about baseball, living as I do in a country where it's much less popular than sports like soccer, basketball, tennis etc. However Moneyball proved easily to be more than a mere sport film or a baseball movie. Though it has a lot of elements familiar from the 'underdog team wins against all odds' school of sport movie, that's not the center of the story.Unlike Bennett Miller's previous movie, Capote, which relied on one very strong performance to cover for a weak script, here Aaron Sorkin's wit is easy to spot in the excellent screenplay, and though Brad Pitt does deliver a solid performance - one of his most subtle and understated - he doesn't steal the show. He does overshadow the rest of the cast, including Jonah Hill who makes an impressive foray into serious drama which, unfortunately, falls to clichés as the film goes on, and the wonderful Philip Seymour Hoffman whose performance is good but almost too understated to work.Moneyball is an effective movie, skillfully directed and very well paced, that manages to stay interesting throughout its over-two-hours run. It gets extra points for being communicative enough to allow a non-baseball fan to enjoy it and understand what's going on, though it loses some for not quite succeeding in showing just how important Beane's contribution to the sport was. Definitely worth a watch.",7,1,3,6 February 2012
Black Swan," Heavy-handed
","Gratuitous and heavy-handed. It's not that it's without its merit - it's very impressive visually, and a powerful, intense atmosphere is kept throughout. The performances are all terrific too, especially a small but powerful and surprising turn from Winona Ryder. But the plot is predictable and pointless, and the film feels like it's trying way too hard to shock and to create discomfort.None of which is Darren Aronofsky's fault - his directorial work is engrossing and original, and he's still in my book as one of the most promising directors of our times, in the same page as Paul Thomas Anderson, Wes Anderson and Chris Nolan. The problem is that after the wonderful maturity of his masterpiece The Wrestler, Black Swan feels like a regression, as it's closer to the heavy manipulation of Requiem for a Dream than The Wrestler's restrained minimalism. I just hope its success won't drive Aronofsky further down that road, and keeps trying much harder than he has to.",6,1,2,23 September 2011
Men in Black 3," Pleasantly surprised at not being disappointed
","No, Men in Black 3 won't make its way into my list of the best movies ever made, but walking into it with very low expectations, I was pleasantly surprised. A decade was enough to make me miss the world and characters of MiB, and while this third installment can't quite match the feeling of freshness and originality of the first one, it's a huge improvement over the disappointing second movie, which felt like a weak attempt to milk a cash-cow while it's hot - MiB 3 doesn't have that 'sequel' feeling, feeding on nostalgia rather than tailing a fad.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones did a lot of growing over this decade - Smith became one of the most sought after blockbuster stars in Hollywood, and Jones made some of the finest, most introspective films of his long careers (No Country for Old Men, In the Valley of Elah, The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada) and they both seem to have a lot of fun being back in their black suits, playing those beloved, silly, flat old characters. Smith in particular seems to take in his stride the fact that he has to step back into 'Fresh Prince' mode after years of playing more serious characters, he even seems to enjoy it quite a bit.It's the supporting cast that makes the film, though - most notably Josh Brolin (Tommy Lee Jones' 'No Country for Old Men' co-star) who plays the younger version of Jones himself to truly terrific results. Jemaine Clement ('Flight of the Conchords') is a delicious villain (though the character is under-utilized), and smaller roles played by Michael Stuhlbarg, Emma Thompson and Bill Hader. It almost seems like memorable supporting characters is what missed most from MiB II - well, that, and a decent script. MiB 3's plot is a pretty senseless and illogical attempt at a time-travel story, with some elements of Terminator kicking in, but it doesn't matter much that it makes absolutely no sense - the script has heart and humor, and the movie is fast-paced and goes by quickly, not leaving that much of an impression but leaving a big smile.",7,0,1,1 October 2012
Love and Death," Allen on Bergman
","Love and Death marks a very distinct transitional phase for Woody Allen, being the very last of his oddball comedies and the most sophisticated of them. It combines, essentially for the last time for Allen, incredibly silly puns and one liners that would fit in a Mel Brooks movie ('I think we should divide his letters... do you want the vowels or the consonants?') with clever satire and parody on Bergman and Dostoevsky. It's probably my ignorance in Russian classic literature that prevented me from enjoying it more, but I loved the loving Bergman spoofs and young Woody's quirky, neurotic humor. I can't name it as one of my favorite Allen films but it certainly holds its own as a fresh, hilarious piece.",8,7,8,14 January 2012
Lucky Number Slevin," High octane action, sleek script, but not quite Tarantino
","There's really nothing much to complain about when it comes to this film. It's absolutely, unfailingly entertaining and rewarding by the minute. With great action scenes, high tension, an intricate and clever plot, great dialogue and a superb all-star cast that includes Bruce Willis, Josh Hartnett, Lucy Liu, Ben Kingsley, Morgan Freeman and Stanley Tucci, Lucky Number Slevin is a true pleasure, and for fans of directors Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie, it's practically too good to miss.Therein lies the film's problem  it tries a bit too hard to imitate Tarantino and to a lesser extent Ritchie as well, and in the process it loses something of its own voice. It seems that McGuigan actively tried to create a cult film, and to a certain extent he gets the job done; Lucky Number Slevin has some very memorable characters and some highly quotable lines of dialogue. In the end, though, it's just not quite memorable enough to carry that weight. It's a very impressive directorial debut, no doubt, but it has neither the soul of Reservoir Dogs nor the energy of Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels. In trying too hard to be cool and sleek McGuigan forgot that he has a voice of his own, and the film lacks a bit in soul and feel.Still, it's lots of fun, and certainly stands on par with a lesser Tarantino work  True Romance (Tarantino's script) immediately comes to mind. Lucky Number Slevin doesn't have the spark, the inventiveness and the cultural awareness that make Tarantino great and unique, but it never gets dull, and never loses its perfect pace. The storyline may be far-fetched but it works, and the twist ending is both surprising and satisfying; and killer performances from three key figures  Willis, Freeman and Kingsley  make the fast, tongue-in-cheek, witty dialogue an extreme pleasure. Lucky Number Slevin is not to be taken all too seriously  it's basically a crime thriller, to be taken more or less at face value, and despite the constant Tarantino comparisons it has nothing of the cultural and artistic statement of Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill. For fans of the genre though, and for anyone looking for an evening of pure entertainment, you can't miss with this one.",6,0,2,28 November 2006
Requiem for a Dream," Breathtaking
","Darren Aronofsky, it seems to me, is on his way to be one of the best, most influential directors of the 21st century. His work on Requiem For A Dream, like on Pi, is absolutely stunning, with brilliant use of experimental photography and editing techniques, short, thematically repeating shots (also used in Pi) and the original split-screen technique. The movie is truly breathtaking, and I mean that most literally - I was starting to run out of oxygen after the first thirty minutes. And I only saw it on VCR. I can only imagine what this must be like in a huge, dark theater. The harshness of the scenes and the fast, video-clip pace of the movie make it a very difficult, but very rewarding, experience.The seemingly complicated plot covers for a very simple idea. The story (This time adapted from a novel, the story for Pi was written by Aronofsky himself and was much more complicated and original) revolves around four main characters, and tells their four individual tales, with the common elements of addiction, illusion and their consequences. This idea, though, is materialized wonderfully, and makes for a very, very powerful movie. All four characters - Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), his mother, Sarah (Ellen Burstyn), his girlfriend, Marion (Jennifer Connelly) and his friend and drug-dealing partner Tyron (Marlon Wayans), are remarkably well-developed, and each one is a full, real human being. Praise should go to Aronofsky but also to all four wonderful actors, especially Burstyn who did a really remarkable job as the TV junkie Jewish mother.The movie is shocking, difficult, painful. You'll feel like your brain is being torn out and cut into little bits. But it's worth every minute. Do NOT rent this out for good light entertainment, but watch it, and eagerly wonder what Darren Aronofsky has in store for us next. I know I am.",8,0,1,24 May 2005
The Hangover," A real comedy
","Just when I was starting to think I lost my sense of humor, along came The Hangover. I've been getting an uneasy feeling over the last decade that comedy is a dead genre; the ones that achieve any kind of critical acclaim are either mixed genre and dramedies, like Little Miss Sunshine or Juno; and I've enjoyed some absurdist films like the ones of Wes Anderson; but strict comedies have been hijacked by the likes of Adam Sandler, Will Farrell and - horror of horrors - Friedberg and Seltzer. These are crude comedies that rely on gross-out humor and very cheap laughs, while dismissing everything else that makes a movie watchable. Not since the late 90's have I truly enjoyed a comedy purely for the laughs. Was something wrong with me? The Hangover was a big surprise - at first glance it looked a lot like those gross-out comedies that are everywhere to be found. Indeed, Todd Phillips doesn't shy away from crude sexual and physical humor - which can be seen as early as his forgettable debut, Road Trip. But The Hangover has some other things that Road Trip didn't - good pacing, solid characters with interesting interactions, and genuinely funny moments. The humor is still mostly physical, but the story manages to grab the viewer's attention, and the far-out jokes fit right in, rather than being tacked on. It's a rare species these days - a strict comedy, which is truly funny and truly entertaining. I don't think I saw a pure comedy this funny since 1999's Office Space.The Hangover isn't a masterpiece, of course - it's a formula movie, and it embraces that formula whole heartedly. The characters are all familiar stereotypes, but they're written well enough and their interactions interesting enough that they feel real and compelling. In the same way, the editing, cinematography, music etc. are solid and built on well-founded and well-tested formulae that keep the viewer involved without distracting, the style never taking over the substance. It's a classic comedy, with no artistic pretenses but with plenty of laughs, comparable with John Landis at his best, and it's a real joy to see a movie like this can still be made today.",7,2,4,2 May 2012
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Smile, darn ya, smile!
","First off, allow me to correct a common mistake that was made by more than one reviewer here: This is most certainly not the first film ever made where animated characters interact with live actors. Pete's Dragon (1977), Mary Poppins (1964) and Song of the South (1946) all predate it, and if you want a lesson in cartoon history, so does Gertie the Dinosaur (1914). But that doesn't mean Who Framed Roger Rabbit is not a landmark film. It was revolutionary for its degree of interaction between the toons and the human characters, done so perfectly that they seem completely natural at first glance, but then amaze when you take a closer look - little things like Jessica Rabbit pinching Eddie Valiant's cheek, or Roger Rabbit hiding under the water in Valiant's sink, or beneath his coat, little details that took very creative special effects to be made convincing. It's also unique and original in the fact that some of it takes place in the real world, featuring animated characters, and some in an animated world, featuring live actors; and in that manner, it predates Cool World, Space Jam and anything following.Who Framed Roger Rabbit is wonderfully funny, directed more at an adult audience than children. Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd make a terrific impression in the lead roles, and manage to stay remarkably serious and convincing while conversing and interacting with entirely imaginary characters. Charles Fleischer is beyond brilliant in the voice of Roger Rabbit (as well as that of Benny the Cab) and Kathleen Turner as Jessica Rabbit is also terrific, a femme fatale so classic that it's ridiculous. The entire film excels with intelligent humor that would appeal to both children and adults, and it's a treat for animation buffs, with references to historical toons from the Foxy cartoons of the 20s, through Betty Boop, Dumbo and Bambi to Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse.Who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of the defining films of my childhood; I think that's true for almost anyone born in the 80s. I still have a warm place in my heart for Roger and Eddie Valiant, and a cold one for Judge Doom, who gave me nightmares for weeks after I saw it upon its initial release when I was four (he still gives me chills, by the way, when he first starts talking in his squeaky voice). If you somehow manages to avoid it, do watch it, and if you're willing, it's well worth the purchase, too.",9,1,2,24 May 2005
Lifeboat," One of my less favorite Hitchcock films
","This early piece from Hitchcock is probably notable mainly for being his first real attempt at a single-set film, all taking place in one location with a limited number of actors. It was an interesting experiment, no doubt, but the same thing was done again later with much better results in Rope and Rear Window, which makes Lifeboat pretty obsolete. It doesn't fulfill its potential for character study (an obvious route to take with such an excellent and compact cast) and instead serves mostly as wartime propaganda - that was confusing enough to be considered inappropriate back in 1944, and seems simplistic and xenophobic now.It's still a Hitchcock film so of course the cinematography is excellent and there are some truly gripping and effective scenes - not to mention terrific acting - but not as many as you'd think. The actors and dialog are good enough to give the hint of fascinating and complex characters, but they're given only the shadow of a personality and serve as allegorical prototypes more than human beings, merely serving the film's dubious message. Lifeboat is a notable point in the Hitchcock filmography, but it just feels outdated and doesn't play well today.",6,5,8,16 April 2012
Gravity," A wonderful panic attack
","For the first time in a long, long time, a film made me feel like a kid again. From the very first (long and glorious) shot of Gravity I was completely lost in the world Cuarón created for me, and for the next ninety minutes I was on the edge of my seat and struggling for breath. It was like a 1.5-hour panic attack - a wonderful, wonderful panic attack. Suspension of disbelief hadn't been so easy for me in years, and part of it was the masterful use of 3D - by far the best I've seen so far - but most of it was thanks to Cuarón's directorial work. This was a perfectly paced thriller, pure cinema at its most condensed, the editing, the sound, the cinematography, the acting all coming perfectly together to keep my eyes glued to the screen (or to the 3D glasses). Leaving the theater, I was stumbling, still not feeling quite at home in normal gravity.Then I went on the film's board to see people's impressions - and sure enough, it was filled to the brim with complaints about the various scientific inaccuracies and implausibilities in the film. I'm something of a geek myself and plot holes drive me mad. But I just don't get how so many people could hate a film like Gravity so much. Comparisons to Apollo 13 and The Right Stuff seem ridiculous to me; this wasn't about a real space mission, it wasn't about the space program or technology, it was a thriller/adventure focused on atmosphere, character study and a semi-spiritual journey that character goes through in the hostile territory of unfamiliar life. Sure, looking back at it, a lot of it wasn't very realistic, but when a film works on as many levels as Gravity did, I really feel sorry for people focusing on the little flaws - and I'm so happy that for once I didn't.",10,2,3,21 November 2013
To Be or Not to Be," Hilarious
","It's often overshadowed by The Great Dictator, which preceded it by two years and was technically the first American WW-II themed comedy, but To Be Or Not To Be deserves the honor both for being the first comedy to refer to Hitler and Nazi Germany by name, and also for being made while the US was very much an active side in the war. It's still incredibly funny, but it's much more impressive, almost shockingly so, when you realize that it was made while Hitler was alive, and just how powerful it was back then. Carole Lombard is show-stoppingly terrific, and it's probably the best place to see her talent on display, since sadly it was her final performance.",9,2,4,14 January 2012
Se7en," A good thriller
","David Fincher's now-classic neo-noir isn't as shocking as it was 15 years ago, neither in its levels of violence nor in its twisting plot. As serial killer films go, I believe Fincher outdid the achievements of Se7en with the underrated Zodiac - Zodiac's cynical indifference was to me more original and more poignant than Se7en's ominous manipulation. Zodiac's main point was lack of consequence; Se7en pretends to have more consequence than it actually does.But consequence or not, Se7en remains a perfectly solid thriller, entertaining, gripping and extremely well-crafted. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman both give understated but very fitting performances, and the masterful cinematography makes for a very powerful experience, 15 years later. A masterpiece it ain't, but a very good piece of film it certainly is.",8,0,1,14 January 2012
Inglourious Basterds," Messy and indecisive
","Being a devoted Tarantino fan, for me this movie was a disappointment. Inglourious Basterds has its flashes of genius, as you'd expect from a Tarantino movie, but they're lost in a muddle of half-baked ideas and characters, and in the end it's probably his weakest movie so far, lacking in the one thing that even Death Proof had - energy and pace. The film does have some mentionable qualities, that are enough to make it watchable and even quite enjoyable - as you would expect from Tarantino, it's fantastically professional in every aspect, especially cinematography and sound. Some of the characters have tons of potential, and the actors are usually spot on (another honorable mention to Christoph Waltz), but there are so many characters that not one of them is developed enough to be satisfying. Tarantino fails to juggle a large number of plots and sub-plots the way he did in Jackie Brown in Pulp Fiction, and they never intertwine in any meaningful way. And worst of all, it's not even that controversial or offensive - Tarantino took a lot of liberties with history, and he certainly created violence that's more realistic and more explicit than ever before, but it's really just violence for the sake of itself. I realize I'm in a minority here, but I don't recommend this movie. I'm not saying don't watch it - there's a lot here to enjoy. But in the end, it's just not that good.",7,5,9,23 September 2011
The Girl Next Door," For entertainment purposes only
","The Girl Next Door is one of the most unrealistic movies I've ever seen. It's less realistic than The Exorcist and it makes less sense than Yellow Submarine. Once I got past that though - and it took some effort - and tried to enjoy it for what it is, I found out it's not a bad movie, either.Even when it tries to pretend to have a message or a point, and it unfortunately does, The Girl Next Door should be taken for entertainment purposes only, and as such, it's pretty entertaining. It's never laugh out loud funny, but it has some humorous moments, some good acting (no, not Elisha Cuthbert... but Tim Olyphant is great, and young Emile Hirsch already shows some talent) and surprisingly, the humor is much less broad and crude than most other teen comedies of its time. In fact, The Girl Next Door, shockingly, is almost family friendly, and its overall attitude is more positive and idealistic than you would possibly imagine. Not that anyone would want to watch it with their family, mind you. The movie has a pretty limited appeal - it probably won't be that attractive to anyone but the 15-21 year old male demographic. But you shouldn't be concerned if your kids watch this, either. The Girl Next Door is one of the more conservative, cheerful, feel good comedies of the 00's.",7,2,4,26 September 2011
127 Hours," Stylish
","Once again, Danny Boyle shows that he has quite a lot of style. His talent for creating memorable images, powerful compositions and suspenseful, energetic shots is stronger on 127 Hours than it was on any of his films since Trainspotting. Cinematically, 127 Hours is a very solid piece, beautifully shot and edited, and complimented by a marvelous performance from Franco.And yet, at the same time, Boyle also shows just how incompetent he is at constructing a coherent and well-paced film. The chaos that worked for Trainspotting did not work well on any of his other works, and it fails here too. The biggest problem 127 has is that it begins and ends at the middle. We get no character development, no structure, no build-up, no satisfying ending - we're expected to get into the action right away, and just as quickly the film ends seconds after the climax. For that reason 127 feels more like a music video than a film. It has no real characters; the few flashbacks the protagonist has seem like a pretty lame cover-up for that fact, giving him a background and a family as generic as possible.It's pretty shocking, in fact, that a story this dark and shocking can eventually feel so light on film. Despite the grimness of the whole situation, it feels like a lighter version of Into the Wild. Which is why, as powerful as the film is while you're watching it, it leaves absolutely no lasting impression - which is criminal for a story like this. It's probably a good thing that it's short then, because it's just long enough to enjoy the visuals and Franco's acting, to be mildly shocked the way you would be at a news broadcast, and then to move on with your life.",6,1,3,7 November 2011
Pirate Radio," Paved with good intentions
","I really, really, really wanted to like The Boat That Rocked more than I did. I love the subject matter, I love the time period, I love the soundtrack, I love the actors.But in spite of all the good intentions, the film fails miserably. It tries to mimic the chaotic, over-the-top humor of British comedies from the 60's - which is quite apt - but it loses itself and its message on the way. The chaos doesn't serve this film well - in fact it renders it almost unwatchable, or it would have been if it weren't for the wonderful music and the terrific acting by Bill Nighy, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Rhys Darby and the rest, who clearly had a lot of fun making it.",5,0,2,24 September 2011
Superbad," What's all the fuss about?
","Maybe I'm just too old to appreciate it, but finally seeing Superbad for the first time I just can't figure out what the big deal is. It's not that it's bad - it's just extremely generic. It's a teen sex comedy with crude, familiar jokes and gags, lots of slapstick, decent chase scenes and a couple of gross-out moments. It's completely beyond me how a movie like Superbad is considered by so many 'the best comedy ever made' - even if you ignore the existence of more intelligent comedies of the past like The Big Lebowski, Airplane, and the entire catalogs of the Marx Brothers, Mel Brooks and Woody Allen (the list could go on and on), even in its own limited genre there is very little to tell Superbad apart from the rest. It doesn't help that the two leads - played by Jonah Hill and Michael Cera - aren't interesting or likable (though they're both fine comedians who do their best) and the romantic interests are completely flat. Actually, the only laughs in the movie come from Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Seth Rogen and Bill Hader who are supposed to serve as some sort of side story - but if the side story is more interesting than the main plot, something is wrong. Superbad has no subtlety, no subtext, no real originality and is probably best watched while drunk or high.",5,3,7,15 July 2012
Ed Wood," Tim Burton's Lost Masterpiece
","Doubtlessly the most underrated and misunderstood movie in this brilliant director's career, Ed Wood is one of Tim Burton's best movies, right up there with his four timeless masterpieces - Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, The Nightmare Before Christmas and Batman. It's very different from anything else he's done before, though. Even the music is different - it was composed by Howard Shore ('The Lord Of The Rings') instead of Tim's regular partner since the beginning, the brilliant Danny Elfman. Few of Burton's beloved motifs are to be found here. I think the reason is that he meant for Ed Wood to look like an Ed Wood film rather than a Tim Burton film - and it works, down to the black & white and the cheesy dialogue. It's a camp masterpiece, and essential for Burton fans.Granted, Tim's choice of subject matter for this film - a biography of the worst director in history - may seem odd, but then again he was never the kind of director who repeats himself (except for the excellent Batman Returns, of course). And in his skilled hands, the rather messy storyline makes for a wonderful comedy that is absolutely hilarious - but also, at times, touching. The character of Edward Wood (played skillfully by the one and only Johnny Depp) is so absolutely pathetic that he can really get to you - his incredible ambition even at the face of repeating failure ('...The worst movie you ever saw? Well, my next one will be even better!'), his childish enthusiasm, his absolute assurance in his 'vision' (his wonderful dialogue with Orson Wells) and lack of patience to get it done with (he does one take for every shoot) and his fondness for women's clothing make him a unique and lovely character, and in Johnny's hands he is brought back to life.The rest of the cast is also wonderful, and a great deal effort was put into choosing actors as similar as possible to the real people they're portraying. Best of all is of course the wonderful Martin Landau who does fantastic job as horror superstar Bela Lugosi. Jeffery Jones as Criswell, Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge, pro-wrestler George 'The Animal' Steele as Tor Johnson and Sarah Jessica Parker as Dolores Fuller, as well as all the rest, are terrific. I recommend seeing at least one of Ed Wood's films (preferably 'Bride of the Monster' or 'Plan 9 from Outer Space') before watching Ed Wood, and that would give you a much better perspective at the film and the characters.",10,3,3,24 May 2005
500 Days of Summer," Pandering to the Hipsters
","Straight out of the Juno school of filmmaking, here's another bitter- sweet, off-beat romantic comedy with a quirky, off-beat girl, an ironic sense of humor mixed with sweet romanticism, and tons of cultural references and name-dropping from Ringo Starr to Ingmar Bergman to Oscar Wilde, a sure way to appeal to young proto-intellectuals and hipsters. It works, to a certain degree, especially thanks to two very effective leads. Having had my own little celebrity-crush on Zooey Deschanel ever since her short but unforgettable performance in Almost Famous almost a decade ago, it was easy to relate to the character portrayed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who's growing up to be quite a decent actor by his own right, even if he still looks sixteen (I was hoping to see some stubble in the scene in which he's depressed and doesn't leave his bed for a week, but nada).500 Days of Summer has a lot going for it, and a lot of the right elements are in place, but it doesn't achieve real greatness, not even mild and humble greatness like that of solid, intelligent romantic comedies (Jerry Maguire, When Harry Met Sally, High Fidelity etc.) It's just not that memorable, and stylistic elements like the non-linear storytelling serve mainly the purpose of being cool and contemporary than any real one. And even though the actors are great and they do their best, they do it with characters that aren't very complex to begin with. It's an enjoyable movie, and a fantastic date-movie for a couple of young cynics, but it's not one that will stick with you for long.",6,1,2,14 January 2012
Juno," Entertaining
","Juno has two separate levels - when taken as an offbeat comedy/drama, it's quite enjoyable, cleverly written, beautifully shot and exquisitely acted. When looking a bit deeper though, you may find a pretty shallow exploitation of very important issues, which tries very hard - and succeeds - to be likable, but in the process delivers some very problematic messages.My advice is to not take it seriously at all, and then you'll find it a fun bit of entertainment with some very good acting and clever dialog. Ellen Page delivers a star-making performance, and Jason Bateman creates a surprisingly complex character.",7,1,5,23 September 2011
L.A. Confidential," Thrilling and powerful
","Rewatching L.A. Confidential for the first time in 13 years, I was surprised at how much better it is than I remembered, and how much better it stood the test of time than other movies of its time, Se7en for example. It's a genre piece for sure - Curtis Hanson is not after originality, he uses every trick in the book and fills his film with genre clichés, but he does it so cleverly that those clichés seem fresh and effective like they haven't been in many years, subverting every expectation the seasoned viewer has, while never actually leaving or deconstructing the genre.As for the cast - not one of the three leads are among my favorites, but all of them are at least partly pre-fame here - Kevin Spacey after his first Oscar but before his second, Russell Crowe before Gladiator, Guy Pearce before Memento - and they all do a terrific job, especially Spacey. James Cromwell, one of my favorite character actors, is chillingly good, and Basinger and DeVito deliver too. Very few police dramas manage to work a large cast of unique and well-developed characters as well as this one, and it makes for one of the most entertaining, powerful, thrilling movies I've seen in a long time.",9,5,7,23 September 2011
Midnight in Paris," Bohemian Wonderland
","In one way - a very meaningful way - Midnight in Paris is a major triumph. While some films Allen filmed in Europe in recent years - like Match Point and Vicky Christina Barcelona - felt like beautiful, loving homages to other directors, Midnight in Paris is all Woody Allen. In fact, it's the most personal and introspective work he'd turned out since, probably, Deconstructing Harry. The real Allen feel is all here - not the whimsical sarcasm of Hollywood Ending or Whatever Works, but more the feel of classics like Manhattan and Annie Hall. That in itself is reason enough for fans to run out and watch it.That's not to say that the film is perfect, though, and to put in in the same class as masterpieces like Manhattan would be a mistake. The fact that it's nominated for an Oscar may give the wrong impression - Midnight in Paris isn't one of Allen's best films, nor is it one of the best films of the year. The biggest flaw of Midnight in Paris is its painful predictability - Allen really tries far too hard to explain to the viewers what he's trying to say, to the extent that the film's Aesop is spoken twice, once in the beginning and again near the end, and none of the subtlety of the films he created in the 70's and 80's in there. It's more easily comparable to crowd-pleasers like The Purple Rose of Cairo - which maybe the reason it did so well. Midnight in Paris makes every attempt to be liked, and it is - by both viewers and critics - but it fails in creating a timeless classic.There's a lot to like about Midnight in Paris though - obviously the beautiful shots of Paris (including an opening montage that may echo the one in Manhattan, though it's much less effective), and a never-ending series of brilliant performances in small roles - most notable of which is the very brief appearance of Adrien Brody as Salvador Dali. Those small roles unfortunately overshadow the more prominent roles of actors like Rachel McAdams, Kurt Fuller and Michael Sheen, whose characters are gray and unlikable in comparison - but then, that's part of the point. I was also underwhelmed by the lead himself, though, which is a shame - Owen Wilson does a decent job, but in comparison with his strong performances for Wes Anderson, his character here is so obviously an avatar for Allen himself that I couldn't believe a single word coming out of his mouth.Midnight in Paris is beautiful, whimsical and very entertaining; it also attempts to be deep and personal, but those elements unfortunately are nearly lost by the lack of subtlety. But it's still a great film, especially for Allen fans but not only for them, one that sits squarely with the B-list of Allen's semi-classics.",8,0,2,4 February 2012
Hotel Rwanda," Mesmerizing, Breathtaking
","Hotel Rwanda would have been a fantastic film without Don Cheadle; but his performance gives it so much. It's hard not to be reminded of Liam Neeson's portrayal of Oscar Schindler, but Hotel Rwanda has just the kind of human believability that Schindler's List lost quite quickly. Cheadle is touching, believable and inspiring in this role, and I for one am looking forward to seeing more of his work in the future. It's nice to see some famous faces popping in on Hotel Rwanda  Nick Nolte, Jean Reno, Joaquin Phoenix  but these are all cameo appearances, and it's the less familiar actors, Cheadle first and foremost, that give their whole and make it the fantastic experience that it is.And yet, the actors aren't the focus of this film, or at least not all of it; Hotel Rwanda is practically a documentary, and excluding a few sentimental moments, it makes no dramatizations and no beautifications in presenting the horrors of the massacre in Rwanda. If at times the film seems to drive the message home a bit too forcefully  and it often does; Hotel Rwanda leaves very little to our interpretation, and that sometimes interferes with the drama: I had a bit of a problem with characters uttering lines that explain what we should have figured out for ourselves, like Joaquin Phoenix saying 'I'm so ashamed' to nobody in particular just after spending several minutes showing just how ashamed he is  it's all part of the director's intention. Hotel Rwanda doesn't make excuses for itself: it refuses to leave any viewer indifferent, and it refuses to let you twist its meaning. The message is so plain and strong that it cannot be ignored and overlooked. The film is just enough shockingly brutal to make sure that we get it. And we do; it's a depressing, powerful experience, which makes you as truly ashamed as Phoenix's character was of the kind of horrors human beings are capable of, and of your own inability to interfere.Hotel Rwanda never had a shot at the Oscars  it's just too frank and too straightforward for the Academy to stomach. But it might just be the best movie made this year. At any rate it's an important film, a film that needs to be watched and demands every bit of your attention. It's a true masterpiece that will probably be remembered as a classic for many years to come.",8,0,0,11 November 2005
Crash," A good, dark drama
","Crash is basically a film that pretends to be more important than it really is, and that's the one big flaw that hindered my enjoyment of it. It really is a very well made drama, and an impressive directorial debut from Haggis, who obviously learned a lot from his collaborative work with Clint Eastwood  Crash is nearly as dark and gritty as anything the master had done. A cast of second rate Hollywood stars and B-list character actors  which includes Matt Dillon (who hadn't had a truly impressive dramatic role in more than a decade), Don Cheadle (who made his breakthrough the very same year with Hotel Rwanda), Brandon Frasier and Sandra Bullock among many others works surprisingly well together, and the film is a strong and professionally made drama with some very good dialog and excellent atmospheric cinematography.Crash is good, but it doesn't have what it takes to be truly great, and I wouldn't take anyone calling it one of the most important films of the year very seriously. The Altman-ish mish-mash of characters whose separate stories interact in surprising ways has become overtly fashionable in Hollywood in recent years, and sometimes it seems to me like the main objective is to avoid the nuisance of developing interesting individual characters; in fact, not one character in Crash  including Cheadle's and Dillon's, both of whom give undeniably remarkable performances  is interesting enough to be considered a main character, and I found myself completely detached from all of them. The film tries to get across a message about the racial tension in America  and some of the images and stories are definitely shocking, moving and effective, but the message is ultimately vague, and it often seems like a pale and weak imitation of Spike Lee. At any rate it never at any moment manages to be half as powerful and potent as anything Spike had made.Crash is definitely a good drama that's worth your time, but it's not one of the best or most interesting films of the year. At its best it's as good as the weakest of Clint Eastwood's films  and if you've watched his films then you know that's high praise. Don't believe the hype; Crash is a very good film but it's no news. If you hated Magnolia, 21 Grams or anything of that genre then you're not likely to get that much out of Crash either.",6,1,5,18 November 2005
Megamind," Presentation!
","Megamind's basic concept of telling a superhero story from the villain's POV is an appealing one - and it's one that has been done many times before. It would have been shocking and original back in the 70's, but unfortunately for Dreamworks, the movie's biggest potential target market - fans of comic books and superhero comics in particular - have seen this already, including, notably, Joss Whedon's 'Dr. Horrible's Singalong Blog' and Kurt Busiek 'Astro City' comics, both of which had more spark than Megamind. As a result the movie has to rely on the most basic of genre-based jokes, and the parody it attempts of superheroes and their psychology is one that has been explored to death.That basic premise is milked for all its worth though, and while it doesn't serve for any real insight about the genre, about good and bad or about destiny, it does make for a lot of good jokes. And while the premise itself runs out of fuel about thirty minutes into, and at that point the genre savvy viewer will be able to figure out just how the rest of the story goes, there's enough hilarious dialog and visual gags to make it enjoyable throughout; just like the animation is slightly behind the times, but still solid enough to get the gags across. Megmind is very well edited and paced, with some very memorable scenes and a great soundtrack. It's not one of Dreamworks' best but it's terrific entertainment.",7,1,2,8 April 2012
Malcolm X," An important film
","Malcolm X cannot truthfully be said to be one of Spike Lee's best films, but it was an important step for him, perhaps the most important one of his career. This biopic, and Spike's fifth full-length feature, makes only partial sense as a follow-up to his greatest classics, Do The Right Thing, Mo' Better Blues and Jungle Fever, the three films in which he created and developed his unique voice and made a name for himself as one of the most prominent independent filmmakers in the US; Spike's own voice can barely be heard in Malcolm X, and his usually immediately recognizable trademarks are tough to point out. The reason is that for the first time in his career Spike Lee took a step back, and he is not the dominant personality in the film; the dominant personality is Malcolm X himself, and Spike let Malcolm's voice be heard throughout the film louder than anything else.So Malcolm X is less a work of art and more a statement than Spike's previous films. It's scope is immensely larger than anything he did before  it does, after all, span 200 minutes  and is therefore, naturally, not as tight and focused as Do The Right Thing or Jungle Fever; but in Malcolm X Spike tackles head on the very subjects he treated with symbolism and subtlety in those films, and it was therefore a natural and important progression for him, and a logical continuation of those movies, and in it he proved that he has more than one voice. In a biopic, and for that matter, in any docu-drama, the most important factor is for the director to care about the subject, and I'm yet to see a director who's more passionate about his subject than Mr. Lee.Malcolm X boasts a huge ensemble casts, with wonderful performances by Delroy Lindo, Angela Bassette, Al Freeman Jr. (in a harrowing performance as Muslim extremist Elijah Muhammad) and Spike Lee himself  but the movie is still entirely Malcolm X's, and therefore Denzel Washington's. Spike's protégé gave a lifetime performance in Mo' Better Blues two years earlier, but he surpassed it with his gut-wrenching portrayal of Malcolm X, which earned him an Oscar nomination (unfortunately lost to Al Pacino in Scent of a Woman) and based him as one of the best actors of his generation.Although Malcolm X is not Spike Lee's best film, it's an important film that needed to be made, and it's a good thing that Spike was the one to do it. More than it's an impressive, moving, beautiful movie  and it is - Malcolm X's story is a story that must be heard, and this biopic is a film that, truly, every cultured and intelligent person needs to watch.",8,32,56,12 October 2005
Closer," Very Good
","Once again, Mike Nichols shows us just how clever he is. I don't agree that this is his best film in years - let's not forget Primary Colors, Birdcage, and the heavenly brilliant Angels in America (ignore Wolf and What Planet Are You From), but it certainly is a return to his roots, and definitely his most serious and straightforward film in many years, probably since Carnal Knowledge. It shares, in fact, many of the themes and qualities of Carnal Knowledge (as well as other early classics like the Graduate and Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf) - Like that film, its scale is very small in place and very large in time, following a small group of characters over long time gaps; likewise, we only catch glimpses of their lives, and get most of the information on important events from the characters themselves. Like Carnal Knowledge, Closer focuses on inter-relations between the four main characters, betrayal, mistrust and insincerity. Closer is bleaker, though. It's probably the bleakest thing Nichols had done. It's a downer that doesn't seem extremely special and original as you watch it, but it sticks with you. After all, that's an important mark of a good film.As for the acting, now: despite my patriotic support of Natalie Portman (her being originally from Israel) and my undying love for her ever since I saw her as a child in Leon, she didn't really impress me in Closer. She tries to be sexy and mysterious, but she's still just a sweet girl, and she doesn't truly convince. Julia Roberts had always gotten on my nerves, and Closer is no exception. The male actors are the ones who really outdo themselves here; Jude Law and Clive Owen are both fantastic, obnoxious and pathetic at the same time as only a real man can be. You despise them and you pity them and you understand them. You are them. These are two great young actors who have a bright future ahead of them.Interestingly enough, Mike Nichols never did write his own texts. All of his films were written by other people, and like Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf and Angels in America, Closer is also an adapted play. Yet he has a fascinating way of making the texts his own. The dialogues in Closer are well-written, no doubt; but just like in his previous films, it's his brilliant dialogue directing with which Nichols leaves his distinct mark and which makes it convincing, amusing and unnerving all at once. Nichols may not have a vision like Kubrick, Coppola or Scorsese, but he does what he does the best anyone could.Closer is not an essential, and it's not one of the best films of the year. It's well worth a watch though, especially if you're a Mike Nichols fan or if you enjoy human relations melodramas. Not great, but very good.",8,1,1,24 May 2005
Shutter Island," A disappointment
","After all these years, Scorsese is yet to have made a bad movie; while contemporaries Spielberg and Coppola sunk to mediocrity long ago, Scorsese is still one of the most versatile and skilled directors in the world. Shutter Island is no exception; it's not a bad movie. But it's not a great movie either.Funnily enough, Scorsese, who used to stand at the forefront of avant-garde and artistic cinema in Hollywood, serves in the new millennium as the voice of classic, old-school cinema, often verging on nostalgia. That works perfectly in the often bashed The Departed, which was unpretending piece of straight entertainment. The problem with Shutter Island - an obvious call back to thrillers of the 40's and 50's, to Carol Reed, Hitchcock and Wilder - is that it tries to be more, and as a psychological film of substance and depth it barely succeeds.It's a terrific success as an entertaining, gripping thriller though - that is, as long as you repress the urge we have as modern viewers to take the twist ending as the most important element in the film; because the twist ending is quite predictable and almost anti-climatic, it can easily disappoint if you put too much emphasis on it, and it's easy to miss the fact that the moment of reveal wasn't meant to be the film's climax. Shutter Island makes no new discoveries - there's no real insight and there's no real mystery. There's lots of atmosphere, solid acting, fantastic music, editing and cinematography, and above all - entertainment. Taken like that at face value, it's quite enjoyable, but don't expect a revelation.",6,0,1,23 September 2011
Life of Pi," A fantastic voyage
","The little I knew about Life of Pi before seeing it - a young Indian man is stranded on a lifeboat with a tiger - couldn't in any way prepare me for what I was about to see. The truly amazing thing is that that's pretty much all there is to it. Ang Lee weaves an incredible amount of emotion and depth into a very minimalistic, poetic story, and for that reason Life of Pi may be the most impressive cinematic achievement of the year - it's true cinema, a film that doesn't rely on a complex plot, shocking twists or tons of characters, but simply on coherent, free-flowing storytelling, beautiful images and utter precision. There's not a wasted minute or an unnecessary shot - the special effects are impressive but always subtle enough to leave center stage for the story. The film is incredibly easy to get into, it's constantly interesting, it's simple yet deep, and it leaves a lasting impression and plenty of room for debate - really, what more can you want from a film? Ang Lee is proving time after time that while he hasn't become a brand name like Spielberg and Tarantino, he's one of the most fascinating directors working today, mainly because he doesn't make the same film twice; Life of Pi is a perfect example to use when demonstrating how important a director is, and how much a good director can do with a very lean and (on the surface) plain script. Lee always had an eye for beautiful imagery, though, and Claudio Miranda's cinematography in Life of Pi makes for some of the most beautiful yet; not only the bulk of the film that takes place in the middle of the ocean and is dominated by CGI, but also the live action segments, especially the first thirty minutes. The opening sequence in particular is one of the most gorgeous I've seen in years, and while watching it in 3D makes the immersion a bit quicker, it's by no means essential and it's impossible to not get lost in the film, no matter how you watch it.A quick word on religion: I've heard about some people who avoid Life of Pi because, as atheists, they reject the religious undertones. I'm a devout atheist myself, and enjoyed it immensely, and I encourage other atheists to watch it too. The film has a spiritual undertone, yes, but it doesn't force salvation down the viewer's throat like some other films. In fact, I don't recall seeing another film that made me feel so sympathetic towards believers; it portrays religion in an ambivalent, affectionate yet critical way, and it leaves quite a lot up to the viewer's interpretation. It also makes a point of showing that, while religion has its purposes and can be of great help to people in tough situations, the division and hate between believers in different brands of religion is the thing that messes everything up, which is a message that I, as an atheist, related to. All religion, Life of Pi says, is pretty much the same - it's a way of coloring reality, of making it easier to handle and seeing the beautiful side of it. Like stories, and like films. Life of Pi is an ode to storytellers, be they Pi, the originators of religion or Ang Lee itself, and it's one of the most beautiful pieces of storytelling you'll see.",9,4,8,3 March 2013
Lost in Translation," Gorgeous
","Isn't it exciting to see a promising new talent blossom and grow? With 'Lost In Translation', we have the unique pleasure of watching three such talents bloom and find themselves. The first one is, of course, director Sofia Coppola, daughter of the grand master Francis Ford, and a proud collaborator in the family business. 'Lost In Translation' is only her second feature film, but all the promises made by her debut, the acclaimed 'Virgin Suicides', is fulfilled in this movie. Though it shares with its predecessor a kind of drowsy, atmospheric slowness, 'Lost In Translation' is a much better structured movie, and shows Sofia truly on her way as both director and writer. It earned her an Oscar for best original screenplay, and golden globes for best screenplay and best film (comedy / musical).The second is young actress Scarlett Johansson. I had my eye on Scarlett since I saw her in two of my favorite films of recent years - Terry Zwigoff's 'Ghost World' and the Coen Brothers' 'The Man Who Wasn't There'. She played supporting roles in both movies, yet I was still impressed, and not just because of her young age (in 'Ghost World' she plays a high school graduate along with Thora Birch, yet she is two years younger than Birch - she was only 16 when the movie was made!) This year, though, we can see her in two leading roles - in 'Lost In Translation' and 'Girl With Pearl Earring' - and in 'Lost In Translation', she really proves that she's a talent to be reckoned with.The third is - yes, that's right, Bill Murray. So, yes, he's been around for nearly a quarter of a century now, but we never really thought of him as much of an actor, right? Good though he was in 'Ghostbusters' and 'Groundhog Day', never before have I imagined him to be anything more than a comedian actor, and capable of playing a lead dramatic character successfully. In 'Lost In Translation' he is both funny and touching, and his performance is worthy of an Oscar.'Lost In Translation' is a beautiful, moody, atmospheric little piece of perfect cinema from a young director just beginning to show what she has to offer. It moves very slowly and has very little plot, but never gets dull. Altogether, it's one of the best and most intelligent films of the year. Very highly recommended.",9,0,1,24 May 2005
Captain America: The First Avenger," Better than expected
","It's kinda hard, when watching Captain America, to forget that it's intended mostly as a prelude to the far superior The Avengers; Captain America exists mostly to introduce the character and do away with his origin story. The sub-header 'The First Avenger' certainly doesn't help to relieve the feeling that this film just wasn't meant to stand in its own right.But surprisingly enough, director Joe Johnston managed to turn a sparse script about an anachronistic and old-fashioned character into a well-paced, even entertaining film. It's not as entertaining or as energetic as The Avengers or the Iron Man movies; Captain America's style is in accordance with its World War II setting. Johnston embraces the anachronistic idealism and patriotism of the character, but never to the point that it feels camp. The film feels like it takes place in the 40's, but it doesn't feel like a pastiche or a period piece, which would have made the transition into The Avengers jarring and painful. It feels like it's part of the Marvel universe, but it also has its own unique feel (something which Thor and The Incredible Hulk, sadly, cannot say).It's still not quite a stand-alone film - not like Iron Man. It shows more than any other Marvel film so far the flaws in creating this elaborate shared universe of characters. It's especially clear in the under-utilization of the villain character, the Red Skull, who promises to be an interesting and mysterious character but gets far too little screen-time, which is all spent on the good Captain's origin story. That story leaves very little room for the film to have any of its own plot. But it has its own atmosphere, it has heart and a sense of humor and an anachronistic, idealistic but very likable hero.",7,4,5,2 October 2012
Watchmen," Good adaptation
","It surpassed my expectations, which wasn't difficult because being as this is one of my all time favorite pieces of literature I was very concerned about the adaptation, and Snyder did a more than passable job. The cinematography is terrific, and the dystopian atmosphere of the comics is transferred with bone-chilling effectiveness, as is the moral ambiguity.Unfortunately, Watchmen does, ultimately, remain a solid illustration of the novel rather than an independent creation with its own statement. Recommended mainly for fans of the super-hero genre, as others may find it difficult to follow.",8,4,6,26 September 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," More than anyone could have hoped for
","As one of thousands (if not millions) of people who harbored a Tolkien obsession in their youths, I anticipated the Lord of the Rings films with both excitement and dread. It's hard to remember now, but back in the year 2000 most of the world thought Tolkien's magnum opus was unfilmable. It took a hobbit-like, New Zealand native horror comedy director to prove them all wrong. Some fans were quick to point out the flaws, the deviations made from the source material, but for anyone who actually loved the spirit and the atmosphere of the novels, Peter Jackson's films were more than anyone could hope for.A decade later, with the initial excitement, hype and backlash died down, it's easier to see these films for what they are, both the good and the bad. And while they're definitely flawed, and they definitely deviate from the novels quite often (a necessity), they're also - and I say this without second thoughts - the best mainstream films of the previous decade. When considered as a standalone creation and not an adaptation, they're excellent works of cinema, perfectly balancing a fast, energetic pace, impressive special effects that have aged shockingly well, exciting action scenes, great dramatic acting, immense amounts of pathos and drama and just the right amount of comic relief. Jackson also managed the singular achievement of using the trilogy format to the films' benefit; not since the original Star Wars trilogy has there been a trilogy of films in which not one disappoints, each one expending over the previous installments (in stark contrast with the Matrix - which was released around the same time, and in which, it grew gradually clearer, the creators had no idea what to do with the sequels).The problems the films had are mostly derived from the difficulty of filming at such a large scope. Deviations from the original are mostly excused; 'No Tom Bombadil' seems as ridiculous a complaint, in hindsight, as 'Organic web shooters'. The writers did a spectacular job of removing just enough and changing just enough to make Lord of the Rings work (spectacuarly well) as a work of cinema. My biggest complaint is about lack of characterization and background for some of the supporting character, mostly Boromir, Gimli and Legolas. Boromir was reduced to little more than a villain, though Sean Bean was good enough to give him the kind of depth and humanity the character should have; Gimli and Legolas were practically comic relief. The acting was so good all around, though, that it's hard to notice. In fact, no fantasy casting website could have put together a better cast, and nobody stands out as a 'weak link'.Lord of the Rings is probably the only case in history of a series of films where all entries do nothing but compliment each other - no complete shift in genre (Aliens), no gradual declination (Matrix), no anticlimactic third installment (The Godfather, Back to the Future). For that reason it's hard for me to compare the three, though Fellowship of the Ring has a special place in my heart, because it was the real shocker - it was the crucial point in time when we found out Tolkien could be filmed after all. Every film in the series has its weaknesses and strengths - The Two Towers has timeless scenes with Gollum but some much slower ones focusing on Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas; Return of the King has lots of pathos, but relies too heavily on huge battle scenes and has one of the most disappointing endings in film history. But taken all together, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is one of the most solid, most entertaining, most wonderfully impressive and memorable, most epic films ever made, and that will never change.",10,1,2,8 December 2011
Man of Steel," Inconsistent
","An interesting but inconsistent reboot of the Superman franchise, Man of Steel definitely better than Superman Returns but there's nothing that different or new here to make it worth the time. This new script places a lot of emphasis on the Krypton story, with a long introduction segment with Russell Crowe who does a solid job as Jor-El, and Michael Shannon who provides a very good and human General Zod.On the plus side, Henry Cavill is the best Superman since Reeve and he gives the character a lot of humanity as well as charisma; although, the Clark Kent persona doesn't appear until the end, and I'm not sure he can pull that off. Amy Adams, on the other hand, is very vanilla as Lois Lane, bringing none of the character's zest or passion into the role. Since she's already in love with Clark and knows who he is, we don't even have the sexual tension to look forward to in the sequel. The script isn't as flawed as other Nolan films but it's still messy; visually, it looks good but not as stunning as other Snyder films.",6,2,4,21 November 2013
Hugo," The Magic of Cinema
","How so many people didn't enjoy Hugo truly baffles me. It's quite possible that hype backlash from the rave reviews and award nominations did Hugo a big disservice. No, it's not a masterpiece; it's not one of Scorsese's best films, and in most years, it wouldn't have deserved a best film Oscar nomination. But in the very weak 2011, it certainly deserved a nomination, and, considering the competition, maybe even the win.The number one thing people ought to realize when going into it is that Hugo is not a fantasy movie. Personally, I was happy to find that out, but apparently many were disappointed. So, once again - Hugo is NOT a fantasy story, though a dreamlike atmosphere helps it straddle the line between fantasy and reality while never really crossing over. It's a fanciful adventure story, focused around a child, yes, and definitely fun for children, but by no means a children's film exclusively; most of all it's a love letter to cinema itself, most of all to the pioneers of film, and that love is what makes it so effective. Like another flawed Scorsese film - Gangs of New York - the director's unbridled passion for the subject matter makes all the difference, and it's difficult not to catch his enthusiasm.Clearly, not everybody enjoyed Hugo, but for the life of me I can't really understand why. I can see how you might find the subject matter tedious, the protagonist annoying, maybe the movie thirty minutes too long; but speaking for myself, it was so much fun and so gorgeous that I didn't want it to end. Even if you didn't like the narrative, the cinematography and the sets are beyond beautiful. This is also the first movie I've seen in which the 3D actually added something to the narrative, as it helps create that feeling of magic, that dreamlike quality of cinema, that sense of wonder that we have lost in the century since the medium was invented, and which Hugo is all about.",9,7,10,12 March 2012
American Beauty," Very good, but not quite great
","Re-watching American Beauty 11 years later, I must admit, I was somewhat underwhelmed. The impact it had on first viewing didn't quite last. The film was praised for its deconstruction of the American dream and portrayal of the dark undertones of suburban life, but the fact is that was done more powerfully in Todd Solondz's movies, and American Beauty just doesn't seem very shocking - maybe it was more so in the 90's, I'm not sure. As a drama, though, it's still very powerful, and the characters are compelling, lovable and despicable at once, and it does a very good job of making the viewers care about them - in complete contrast with Happiness, with deliberately keeps a wall of coldness and distance. The wonderful acting helps, especially from Thora Birch, who at that point had the potential to become one of the greatest actresses of the new millennium.At the time of its release American Beauty was hailed as a masterpiece - it doesn't quite seem like one now. Rather, it's a good drama with some fantastic directorial work and some truly great moments, and a very humble movie at that. The fact that I don't consider it one of the top films of the 90's doesn't change the fact that its Best Picture Oscar was one of the best and gutsiest choices the Academy made that decade.",7,1,2,23 September 2011
Duck Soup," Not as good as I hoped
","Duck Soup can easily be seen as the prototype to the Marx Brothers classics that followed, but it's not one of their best. The political satire is well directed, but it doesn't reach true Marx hilarity until the last fifteen minutes or so - no brilliantly timed slapstick (until the timeless mirror scene), no truly great dialog and one liners (until the terrific exchange between Groucho and Chico at the trial scene), and the musical numbers are especially weak (especially the one that opens the movie, though that might be intentional because the tone changes entirely when Groucho shows up). It's an essential part of their filmography, no doubt, but for me true greatness is achieved only in the follow-up, A Night at the Opera, the one that finally dismissed the unfunny straight- man Zeppo and let Groucho, Chico and Harpo really run wild.",7,1,2,14 January 2012
Apocalypse Now," Wild chaos
","Apocalypse Now is a strange anomaly in the history of cinema. It's a complete disaster of a film, that ran into every catastrophe and hurdle imaginable, and failed on almost every level (just ask Francis Ford Coppola himself). And yet, it's also one of the best films ever made.Apocalypse Now's wild chaos stands in complete contrast with Coppola's three previous films - The Godfather parts 1 and 2, and The Conversation, all of which were precise, complete and, especially the first one, practically flawless. Apocalypse Now, on the other hand, is filled with flaws; it's messy, inconsistent, at times incoherent, and large parts of it appear (and often are) completely improvised. This is, of course, the one film on which Coppola, having financed most of it himself, had complete creative control. It's the film that brought the age of the auteur to its logical end, and it's also the beginning of the end for that period; one year later the auteur was finally killed by Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate. But while Heaven's Gate is a pompous, pretentious, self-indulgent mess, out of the chaos of Apocalypse Now emerged one of the strongest creations in cinema history.No description of Apocalypse Now can really capture what it's about; it can be said to be a film about the Vietnam war, or a loose adaptation of Conrad's Heart of Darkness, but it's far beyond either one. It's an exploration of the human psyche when it's taken to the most extreme situations of stress and violence - the Vietnam war is used as the setting for that. But, as can be seen in the documentary 'Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse', the production itself qualifies as well. Both Coppola and the cast explored the full range of human emotions on the film, and that's what makes it more powerful and more timeless than war films like Platoon and The Deer Hunter. Apocalypse Now is the human condition. As Coppola himself said - it's not about the Vietnam war, it IS the Vietnam war. Every failing the film had during production only helps create the chaos and distress that make it so unforgettable and such a landmark in cinema history.",9,6,10,1 October 2011
The Men Who Stare at Goats," A failure, but an interesting and entertaining one
","My expectations of this film were very low, so it's no surprise I enjoyed it much more than I expected to. It's true that The Men Who Stare At Goats is messy, the narrative very unbalanced, and the second half of it completely misses the potential it had and spoils everything that was good about the first half, but I always prefer films that try to do something new and strange and fail, over ones that play it safe and make for a mild and forgettable success, and this one is definitely the former.With a great premise and an excellent cast, The Men Who Stare At Goats could have been much better than it is. The actors do a terrific job - in particular Clooney and Bridges (Spacey delivers but his character is just not interesting enough to work, and McGregor makes for an obvious straight-man character that serves only as a narrator and isn't compelling by his own right). It's a shame that a better movie wasn't made from this great story, but still it's an interesting movie with some terrific moments that's worth your 90 minutes.",7,1,2,23 September 2011
Shrek Forever After," Please, make this the last one
","Considering the quick deterioration the Shrek franchise went through in it first three installments, the most incredible thing about Shrek Forever After is that it isn't any worse than Shrek the Third. In some aspects, actually, it's slightly better. That's not saying much though. Like the previous movie, Shrek Forever After is stale, repeats old jokes and basically, doesn't justify its own existence. Unlike the second and third movies, this one doesn't introduce any new characters that are in the least big interesting or funny. Rumpelstiltskin (they're really reaching for fairy-tale characters) is a dull and unimpressive lead villain, a disappointment in the series that produced excellent villains in Prince Charming and Lord Farquaad.Shrek Forever After is, in fact, the least funny of all four Shrek movies. The story is somewhat better than the previous entry, though, and the one thing that the movie does well is present a satisfying and conclusive ending to the series. As long as it's indeed the last one, it's as respectable a farewell as we could have expected from this rustic, once great franchise... oh, hold on, is the Donkey movie in production yet?",5,2,4,20 December 2011
Dark City," Stylish
","Dark City feels almost like a Matrix rip-off, but in fact it was released a year earlier. It's something of a diamond in the rough - a fantastic story, lots of good ideas and good writing, great art direction and a dark, strong atmosphere. Unfortunately, Proyas's directorial work isn't as strong as the story, and it doesn't do it justice; the action and chase scenes, as a whole, feel unbalanced and poorly paced. And much of the cast is out of place too, especially Kiefer Sutherland who does a very poor job in a role which should have been a key one to the story. It's good hard sci-fi, but it's flawed, and that may explain why it's not remembered as a classic. But for fans of the genre, it's highly recommended.",7,0,1,14 January 2012
The Intouchables," Sweet and Funny
","It's not hard to see how Intouchables become a hit. It's a crowd pleaser in the true sense of the word; a movie that works to appeal to every sector of the audience, and uses a familiar formula that's been seen many times before. Interestingly, though, it doesn't resort to the lowest common denominator. Nakache and Toledano were clearly aware of the fact that they're not offering any new revelations, and instead focused on making the movie as entertaining, touching and effective as possible, and it works, loath as I am to admit it. The movie is fast-paced, fantastically edited, always entertaining, sitting squarely on the border between comedy and drama; the two leads, François Cluzet and Omar Sy, have perfect chemistry and make even the crudest jokes work. More impressively, they make even the most cynical viewer forget that they heard it all before.Intouchables is, in fact, one of those precious few films I can label as 'almost perfect', in that it's impossible to point out any particular flaws. The biggest flaw, and the only reason I gave it a less than perfect rating, is simply how predictable it is. It's very easy to ignore while you're watching, but Intouchables is, in fact, a formula movie, which doesn't really have anything that new or interesting to say, and doesn't do anything that wasn't done before. That doesn't detract anything, though, from the fact that it's an excellent movie and practically impossible not to enjoy, if only because the two leads are so incredibly likable and so much fun to spend 90 minutes with.",8,1,2,19 May 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," What's the point?
","The Amazing Spider-Man isn't quite a horrible film; it has some redeeming features. Most surprising of all to me was Andrew Garfield - I really had very little faith in his ability to play the titular character, but he did an excellent job, better, in fact, than Tobey Maguire ever did, as both Spider-Man and Peter Parker. Coupled with Emma Stone playing a very charismatic and likable Gwen Stacy, they manage to inject real feeling and humanity into the high-school and the romantic scenes, that was sorely lacking with Maguire and Dunst.But that's just not enough. Obviously, in almost every film, there's one actor that I'd have liked to replace with someone else - but is that a good enough reason to remake the film with a different actor? That's what The Amazing Spider-Man is. Maybe it's a little more gritty than Sam Raimi's version; maybe it's a little more teenager-oriented; maybe it stays more true to the comics on some plot points, at least to certain versions of the comics. But it's not different enough that it can be viewed as its own creation, rather than compare it to Raimi's films, which is apparently what the producers wanted to avoid. They jumped the gun way too fast, rebooting the series when the Raimi films are still fresh in our memories, and in doing that prevented their film from ever being appreciated as a new one.And in that comparison, it loses, badly. For every redeeming quality there are ten screw-ups staring us right in the face. The script is very poorly written; Spider-Man's origin story once again takes up half the film, but it's done so much less convincingly than in the 2002 version, and followed by very awkward, nonsensical scenes of Peter Parker skateboarding around and doing slam dunks, apparently in a condescending attempt to make the film more appealing to teenagers. Instead of the appealing and menacing villains of the first two Sam Raimi films, we get Rhys Ifans - a talented character actor - doing his best with a poor script and with a very unconvincing CGI human lizard, which makes for a very dull, gray, cartoonish villain that goes starkly against the more realistic approach Marc Webb was trying to go for. As for Martin Sheen and Sally Field - they're both terrific actors, but they bring nothing more into the characters of Uncle Ben and Aunt May than the weak lines the script gives them.The Amazing Spider-Man is just good enough to make for an entertaining summertime braindead blockbuster, but even though it's not a terrible film, it's something worse - a film that doesn't deserve to exist. Kudos to Andrew Garfield on his work; in a good film he could have been great. But this isn't it.",4,1,3,18 November 2012
Aliens," Very overrated
","Aliens is, by all accounts, a very solid and effective sci-fi epic. James Cameron shifted the horror/sci-fi blend of the 1979 original towards a more action/adventure oriented film, and as such, it works: The action scenes are good all around. But as a follow-up to one of the finest sci-fi films ever made, it fell short for me, and the constant referring to it as the best film in the series is, in my opinion, heavily unjustified. Even if taken at face-value as an action movie, it doesn't have a lot of substance on top of the action, and unlike Cameron's Terminator films it's often lacking in structure, pacing and especially in self-awareness of any kind - Aliens is dead and dull serious all the time.And when compared to the first movie, a champion of tension and atmosphere, Aliens is almost constantly predictable, and failed to get me into any state of real suspense. Also, while Alien was filled to the brim by a cast of first rate character actors - John Hurt, Harry Dean Stanton, Ian Holm, Tom Skerritt - which made every death a shocking moment, the cast of Aliens, except for Sigourney Weaver's admittedly excellent performance (though I preferred her scared survivor in Alien over her kick-ass action girl in Aliens), is pretty dull. Lance Henriksen is good in his few brief scenes as Bishop, but Michael Biehn is as unimpressive as ever, Carrie Henn doesn't get any real sympathy, and as for Paul Reiser - his cookie-cutter evil-corporate-shell character is as dull as his perfect clone, Giovanni Ribisi's character in Avatar.I may have overstated the movie's faults - it's not, by any means, a bad one, but for those reasons (mainly) I can't consider it one of my favorites, while Ridley Scott's original is. Interesting to note that many of those reasons are the same that make me dislike all other James Cameron movies, all of which are, with the exception of T2, unbelievably and ridiculously overrated.",5,4,10,23 September 2011
Resident Evil," Precisely what I expected
","This film was, I'm sorry, *really* bad. I just can't see a point to it. In the game, all you do is walk around and shoot zombies; the film is exactly the same. There's just a bunch of guys walking around and killing zombies, and occasionally the zombies kill one of them. Every single moment of the film is a hundred percent predictable, so the 'plot twists' are obvious and the scary parts are simply not scary. The acting is horrible, Marilyn Manson's soundtrack is exactly what you might expect, the directing, plot and dialogue are non-existent.Well, I don't know... Maybe it would be scarier to watch on a big screen in a darkened theater, but to me today's horror directors simply got it wrong. You don't make a movie scary by showing lots of blood and organs and people with no eyes or no jaws. A truly scary movie is created by ATMOSPHERE (note Hitchkok and Kubrick). Seeing a guy being sliced into a hundred little pieces isn't scary, it's repulsive. There IS a difference, you know. Two thumbs down.",2,9,16,24 May 2005
The Commitments," Dublin Soul
","One of the most versatile and promising directors of the '80s, Alan Parker's run of good fortune (Midnight Express, Fame, Pink Floyd The Wall, Birdy, Angel Heart, Mississippi Burning) seemed over when he came out with the mediocre war drama Come See the Paradise in 1990. In 1991, however he had a surprise hit with The Commitments  which was his first comedy since the bizarre Bugsy Malone in 1976. The Commitments was nearer to home than any of his recent films  it was about Dublin, while all of his last dramas were decisively American; it also marked the end of his dealing with war and world-level ethical issues in favor of the small lives of working-class men; and also a return to his love of music, which was prominent in his early films Fame and The Wall.The Commitments is not a musical though; and to call it a comedy is also difficult. It is hilarious though, as well as touching, and it has as much a sense of rhythm and groove as the great songs within. It's a small film, certainly  especially when compared to melodramatic epics like Mississippi Burning and Angel Heart  a small film about small people, but it's tight, and it's highly enjoyable from start to finish. A wise choice was made in comprising the cast entirely of unknowns (with the exception of the great Colm Meaney in a side-bit as Jimmy Rabbitte's father) and other than Bronagh Gallagher and Angeline Ball none of them had any interest in acting afterward. That makes the characters and the story all the more believable. And that's the main thing that makes The Commitments work so well  it's entirely believable, and the characters are convincing and true to life. They're all very unique characters in a true and human way, and there are no stars to steal the show. The story is believable too, and the ending avoids the clichés of similar British comedy-dramas about working class people in creative fields, which have become so popular in recent years  films like The Full Monty, Billy Elliott and Brassed Off, and manages to be feel-good and yet entirely convincing.The Commitments is not a major and important film like Mississippi Burning, but to all intents and purposes it's a better one. For anyone who loves soul, blues or funk music it's a must  for any music lover in general, in fact; as well as any lover of English and Irish cinema. Its message may not change the world, but it will stick with you, guaranteed, as will the film. The Commitments is one of the most enjoyable films you'll see, and may be Alan Parker's best creation. An experience not to be missed.",9,3,5,22 August 2006
Quantum of Solace," A Waste of Talent
","The big problem with Quantum of Solace isn't that it's a horrible movie - it's better than most Pierce Brosnan headed Bond films, and director Marc Forster (Monster's Ball, Stranger Than Fiction) clearly tried to inject some of his skill and sensitivity into the shots and the pacing. Perhaps, had he been given a stronger screenplay to work with, he might have made it memorable; as it is, Forster's talent is wasted on one of the most forgettable, unnecessary Bond films ever made. Even the silliest of Roger Moore adventures had more to make them stand out and make an impression than this one.It's possible that this feeling derives partly from the fact that Quantum of Solace was intended as a direct sequel to Casino Royale, more so than any Bond movie made before; but more than a sequel, it feels like an appendix to that other film. Casino Royale made a mark partly thanks to the novelty of Daniel Craig as Bond and of the darker, more realistic atmosphere, which Quantum of Solace follows, but it also had a simple yet intriguing story, a memorable villain and an interesting romantic interest - all of which Quantum of Solace lacks. Mathieu Amalric makes for one of the most nondescript of all Bond villains, and his fiendish plot is far less fiendish and far more complicated than it needs to be to get us interested; the Bond girls (Olga Kurylenko and Gemma Arterton) barely have anything to tell them apart.Instead of a coherent story, gripping action scenes or interesting characters, Quantum of Solace attempts to make a larger point about the nature of revenge, but the script isn't good enough to give that any weight. Craig does his best, as does Judi Dench, and their scenes together are by far the strongest parts of the film, but since we're talking about a Bond film after all, these little moments of human drama take up a very small part of the film, and the rest just doesn't work well enough. Quantum of Solace, despite having possibly the shortest runtime of all Bond movies, manages to be more confusing and complicated than most; and at the same time, feel like little more than an interlude between Casino Royale and Skyfall, making me feel that it could have just been inserted into an extended version of the first Craig film. Bond enthusiasts may want to check it out, but it's a film that the rest of us can easily live without.",5,1,4,20 May 2013
District 9," Could have been better
","Like many other sci-fi films before, District 9 starts with a fascinating premise and great story and concept, that unfortunately are only enough to hold about thirty or forty minutes of film. A sci-fi mockumentary is a great idea and for the first half hour it holds great. Then, sadly, District 9 turns into a pretty standard sci-fi/action affair with a pretty standard story arc about an anti-hero who starts out as a villain, then learns the error of his ways and goes through a process of redemption. Really not much to write home about. Still - the story is more original than that of Avatar, and even the action scenes are more well-paced. It's just a shame that it could have been a great film and instead it's just okay.",7,6,9,23 September 2011
Bridesmaids," Drawn out
","Bridesmaids seems to have been so acclaimed mainly because it's not as bad as you might expect. It's often compared to The Hangover and not without reason, but the one area in which The Hangover truly excelled which made it stand out, is where Bridesmaids fails miserably - pacing. Each gag is drawn out over painfully long periods of time, and the movie is 40 minutes too long. It almost makes sense when you realize that the two leads are SNL graduates.That's not to say Bridesmaids doesn't deserve some credit. A comedy with an all-female lead cast is rare enough, and the movie has the unusual distinction of being a comedy directed at women that isn't a romantic comedy - in fact it's anything but, though it comes close at one point - and along the way breaks a lot of conventions about what a 'chick flick' should be, including some scenes of no holds barred gross-out comedy, of a kind that would fit right in with a male cast, but feels strangely disturbing with the female cast (and what does that say about our perceptions of gender?). Those are the moments where the movie is truly funny; and although the humor is low, in many ways it feels fresh, and as a comedy - in the big picture - it works and is memorable.When there's actual plot, though, it feels like the characters keep talking long after we got the point. Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph and Rose Byrne all play characters of varying levels of unlikability and it's hard to care about any of them. The saving graces are Melissa McCarthy - the movie's only likable character, for me - Jon Hamm and Jill Clayburgh, whose scenes are shorter, funnier and more to the point than anything else. When Wiig and Byrne are bickering on screen, though, it's tough to remember why we have to root for either one.",6,0,1,29 May 2012
Drive," A breath of fresh air
","There were few films in recent years that I enjoyed quite as much as Drive. The main reason is that few films managed to surprise me as much: Drive managed to create expectations and then avert them several times over. It constantly straddles the line between genres - clearly channeling the action films of the 80's in its first half, then turning into a violent, character-driven crime drama. It also straddles the line between past and present, lovingly embracing the romanticism and energy of the classic action flicks, but contrasting it with dark, post modernistic nihilism.More importantly than all that, Drive dares to avoid the border that divided almost the entirety of American cinema in the last thirty years, the border between art and entertainment. Like some of the best films ever made - The Godfather, Silence of the Lambs, Pulp Fiction - Drive attempts both. And while it's not on the level of a masterpiece, it manages to be good art and good entertainment. It's well-paced, constantly intense and thrilling, and doesn't overstay its welcome - offering the viewer only glimpses of the characters, leaving us wanting more. It's also beautifully shot, with a moody and unnerving color scheme, and boasts a wonderful cast of top character actors (Ryan Gosling, Bryan Cranston and Carey Mulligan are great; Ron Pearlamn and Albert Brooks play against type and do a wonderful job) playing a group of fascinating and intricate characters.Drive is an action film, a crime thriller and an art-house drama rolled into one, but don't expect it to fulfill whatever expectations that description gives you. It's a simple film with a simple story, which immerses the viewer in completely and never lets them lose interest. Might not be a classic masterpiece to be remembered fifty years from now, but a damn good movie by any standard.",9,2,6,15 December 2011
X-Men: The Last Stand," Great action scenes
","The Last Stand is decisively the weakest film in the X-Men 'Trilogy'. Director Bryan Singer was replaced by Brett Ratner, who, like Singer, never made a sci-fi film before; but while Singer took a restrained and dramatic approach to the genre, Ratner behaves more like a child with a new toy and plays the high-budget special effects to excess. Dramatically, The Last Stand is not as convincing as the first two parts; it does continue the action/soap opera combination that characterized the first two films  as well as the X-Men comics  but the romantic side, namely the love interest between Wolverine and Jean Grey, fails to deliver. Hugh Jackman gives a performance that is hardly as strong as in the first two films, and other than Ian McKellen  clearly the best actor in the whole trilogy  who does as breathtaking a job as he always does  there are no characters here that are very interesting by their own right.That's another major problem the film suffers from  there are way too many new characters, and very few of them are interesting enough, even if most of them are well-cast. That same problem was apparent in the first film, which introduces all the main characters in a very short span of time; what made the second installment the best one was that it focused mainly on a tight group of main characters, leaving more room for drama. Iceman, Juggernaut (a wasted performance by the fantastic Vinnie Jones), Callisto, Kitty Pryde, Colossus, Pyro and the rest are half-baked characters, mainly in it for the action scenes; Angel  who was marketed as one of the lead characters  has a remarkably small side bit. The only new character that really made a mark was Hank McCoy AKA Beast  played, in a bit of casting genius, by Kelsey Grammar.But all complaints and grievances taken into account, although the film is not very strong dramatically, and has serious pacing problems with scenes that drag out with not enough action to balance them  when the action does come it's spectacular. The final battle of the film is the most impressive action scene in the trilogy, thirty minutes of beautifully shot and choreographed mayhem and destruction. It's a credit to Ratner that he took very bold decisions of letting a large number of main characters die, making a sequel  although possible  very unlikely; and he really let go and went all the way with the carnage, making this final scene a feast to the eyes. This is where the large number of new characters finally makes itself worthwhile, and for any fan of sci-fi and high-effect action this scene is a pleasure.The Last Stand is not as good a film as the first two X-Men's, but it's a very well made action film. If that's what you're looking for, then you'll love it. If it's drama you're after, you'll be less impressed, but there's still McKellen, always a pleasure to observe, who plays a stronger part here than in X2. A worthy conclusion to the X-Men trilogy.",6,0,0,30 May 2006
Stardust," A wonderful fairy tale
","I'm hard to please; usually, when a film based on one of my favorite book deviates this much from the source material, it simply won't allow me to enjoy the film. It happens all too often that a literary work with real originality and spark is marginalized on the big screen for the sole purpose of selling more tickets.But for once, the result was so good that I just can't object. Stardust has little to do with Neil Gaiman's original novel, certainly; the changes make sense, though, and I think Gaiman saw that too. The novel was unique in its mixture of classic fairy tale with extreme sexuality and violence; Matthew Vaughn's film version tones down those elements, as well as the more disturbing horror elements, to make the film watchable for kids too. Normally I'd be dead against it, but Vaughn did a wonderful thing - while Stardust is kid-friendly, it's not a kids' movie. The sex and the violence aren't there on the surface, but the intelligence and the dark subtext of the original are still there. The film maintains a lot of Gaiman's spirit while being quite different, which amounts to that rare thing, a film that can be enjoyed by both children and adults on entirely different levels.Let's not forget, quality fantasy cinema doesn't grow on trees. Lord of the Rings an Harry Potter aside, pickings are still slim enough that I'd welcome any fantasy film that respects the genre and makes for a good watch. Though Stardust isn't quite as quotable and memorable as The Princess Bride, it shares a lot of its qualities, and there's no bigger praise. Stardust may not be as deep, complex or genre-bending as the novel it's based on - it makes much safer choices - it's an incredibly entertaining film, skillfully balancing comedy, romance, suspense, action and lots of imagination, and it's a film anyone can enjoy - you can watch it with your kids, with your parents, with your friends, spouse or date. You can watch it more than once, and you'll get a kick every time.",9,0,1,27 December 2011
Kick-Ass," Cynical and far too easy to misunderstand
","Kick-Ass attempts to cynically deconstruct the superhero genre, and at that level it doesn't quite make it for me. Watchmen - clearly the graphic novel, but the movie too - did so much more intelligently. The sarcastic, tongue-in-cheek attitude with which the gruesome violence is shown fails to make it any less gruesome, and is all too easily taken at face value, especially by younger viewers, thus missing completely the point Vaughn was trying to make.On the entertainment and style fronts, Kick-Ass is more successful, and it manages to create a truly fresh cinematic superhero look, a more colorful contrast to The Dark Knight's gritty realism. The acting for the most part is mediocre at best, except for the wonderful Chloe Moretz as Hit Girl and Nicolas Cage - who hasn't been this good in a long time - as bad-ass vigilante Big Daddy. It doesn't really matter though, because Kick-Ass is all about style and action scenes; the dialog-based scenes are weak and dull enough as they are, filling up the gaps in-between coolness. For comics and superhero fans, including ex-fans who long ago dropped their interest in the costumed vigilantes, this is a great piece of entertainment, but not a whole lot more.",6,2,6,23 September 2011
Gran Torino," Over-hyped, but very enjoyable
","Definitely not a masterpiece, Gran Torino is in fact one of Eastwood's weaker directorial works, and I can't quite figure out the hype that surrounded it (for a little while, at least). The plot and the message are painfully predictable and hackneyed, and Eastwood's performance, though powerful at times, brings overacting to a whole new level at others.It's not a bad movie, though, first and foremost because it's very self aware, which makes it a pleasant experience for long-time Eastwood fans. If it's indeed - as he himself stated - his last starring role, then it's a fitting one; Eastwood's character in Gran Torino is a sarcastic, melancholy parody of every character he ever played, and for him it's a regretful look back at a long career of simulated violence.So while it's hardly a great movie, it's a nice conclusion to a long and impressive career; it could have been better, but as it is it has an important place in the Eastwood filmography. The fact that, despite all its flaws, it's as ably made as you'd only expect from an Eastwood film, makes it watchable and even quite enjoyable.",7,0,2,23 September 2011
Lincoln," The History Channel Presents
","A lot can be said for Daniel Day-Lewis's performance as Abraham Lincoln - it's amazing indeed. We all knew it would be the second the casting was announced. Day-Lewis breathes life into one of American history's most mythological figures, making him charismatic, larger than life, but sweet and spiteful and just human too. He's not alone - the supporting cast (special mention to Tommy Lee Jones) all do a commendable job, slipping comfortably into their characters, and delivering their dusty lines in a way that feels natural and fresh, as if you've stepped back straight into Lincoln's time.And yet - unfortunately - the wonderful acting is the only thing that makes Lincoln anything more than a History Channel docu-drama, albeit a very well-budgeted one. Beneath the superb actors; the flawless set and costume designs; the high-contrast, full of pathos cinematography that places Lincoln with a convenient halo behind his head every time; there's a very dull story treatment that moves at a steady and monotonic pace, with no ups and downs, no tension and no climaxes. It deals with the loaded and painful subject of slavery, yet somehow manages to completely avoid any sort of emotion. The viewer doesn't care about slavery, or about the 13th amendment - we care because we know Lincoln was a good guy and we want him to win. Slavery isn't given a face, slaves aren't given a face, and even when the amendment does pass we feel nothing. This is jarring when coming from Steven Spielberg, the master of emotional manipulation, who pulled at every heart string with last year's schmaltzy 'War Horse'.Lincoln is informative. Enough so that, if you're at all interested in the time period, the 2.5 hour runtime will go by reasonably quickly and the film will remain interesting throughout. It's also, admittedly, Spielberg's best film in years - since Catch Me If You Can, if not since Schindler's List. But one of the best films of the year? Hardly. At the end of the day, it feels like a very well-made historical reconstruction, and not a drama film. The points where it might have striven for some emotional connection - Lincoln's scenes with his wife Mary Todd (Sally Field) and son Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and of course the assassination itself - are handled very poorly and feel like a lame attempt to squeeze some feeling out of the audience; again, a shocker when coming from a master like Spielberg. A film that could have been so much better than it is, but will still be shown to school children for years to come.",7,1,2,3 February 2013
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Always one of my favorites
","I watched The Nightmare Before Christmas for the first time when it was released for the first time; I was nine years old. Growing up in a country where whatever knowledge I had of Christmas and Halloween came from American TV, I missed a lot of the jokes and a lot of the references, but I enjoyed the colorful characters, zany adventure and dark slapstick. I loved it.I watched it again when I was 16 and going to art school, during a lecture about adult animation. This time I enjoyed the stylish design, the meticulously made stop-motion animation and the infectious songs. Loved it.And I watched it for a third time when I was 22 and studying design. I now knew the careers of both Henry Selick and Tim Burton back to front, and could appreciate just how much of a landmark the film was for both of them. I could also appreciate the subtle pokes at American culture, and the clever homage to both classic animated Christmas specials and German expressionist cinema. Loved it.I now tend to watch The Nightmare Before Christmas approximately once a year. It's not a tradition or anything, I still don't celebrate Christmas or Halloween. There just always seems to be some good reason to watch it, as it's one of the shortest, quickest, and most enjoyable of my all time favorite films. And I enjoy it every time. It's wildly imaginative, beautifully animated in stop-motion animation that isn't likely to age any time soon, gorgeously designed and wonderfully scored. It refused to acknowledge the idea that an animated film has to make a choice between kids' and adults' animation; it's directed at mature and intelligent kids, and at young-at-heart adults, two years before Pixar started making films that made the same choice.Most of all, The Nightmare Before Christmas remains one of a kind. Burton tried to recreate the magic with Corpse Bride and failed miserably. It's funny, it's filled with sarcasm but also surprisingly touching and idealistic. It's the best movie Tim Burton never made, and it will always be one of my all time favorites.",9,3,3,19 November 2011
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," Don't you know me, Kansas City?... I'm the new Berlin Wall!
","The Rocky Horror comparison is easy, I guess. Why? Well, it's a rock musical with transvestites in it, right? But it's much more than that. If you're a Rocky fan, and you watch Hedwig because you heard they're alike, expecting cult value, you'll probably be disappointed... even though Hedwig has more cult following than you'd expect, and in some places weekly screenings with costumes and audience participation a la Rocky are actually held. But Hedwig is much more than that. Aside from the truly great music (which I'll discuss in a minute) the story of Hedwig and the Angry Inch is a sad tale of surprising depth, encompassing loneliness, betrayal, sexual confusion and identity crises as well as a bit of simplistic but kindly treated Platonic philosophy, with a brilliant ending that leaves many question marks and is good for hours of debate and discussion.Hedwig and the Angry Inch is certainly not, as some reviewers point out, a niche film to be enjoyed only by homosexuals - though I imagine you'd probably have some problems with it if you're particularly homophobic or conservative. As long as you're open-minded, Hedwig (meaning both the film and the character) has the power to appeal and to move everyone; I haven't seen the stage version - Many people say that other actors who played Hedwig were better than John Cameron Mitchell - but John is absolutely electrifying in this role, surprisingly appealing and charismatic, as well as recognizable (which is quite surprising when you're talking about a transvestite glam-rocker from East Germany), and he acts and sings with all his guts. The fact that he is also the writer and the director, I think, really shows and it's for the best; the film is very personal, and you can tell from his acting that the character is all his own. Miriam Shor and Michael Pitt are both amazing in the supporting roles.Even if all of that doesn't work for you, the music is where the film really stands out, and it's also the biggest point of difference between it and Rocky. While Rocky was created and inspired by the glam rock scene, the music - with maybe a couple of exceptions, like the wonderful and biting 'Sweet Transvestite' - is the stuff of Broadway, or at least Off-Broadway. That's not putting it down; it was intentional. The music on the Rocky Horror Picture Show is for the most part musical parody, pop tunes of sarcasm and wonderful dark humor. The songs on Hedwig are much more serious business, and much more complex, too, and most of them sound like they might have been recorded by David Bowie at the very height of his career. The rockier, harder songs like 'Angry Inch', 'Exquisite Corpse' and the spectacular, show-stopping opener 'Tear Me Down' sound like Ziggy Stardust mixed with Iggy Pop and tossed twenty five years into the future, with heavenly power chords and thundering bass and drums; 'The Origin Of Love' is an amazingly beautiful epic rock ballad with gorgeous lyrics; 'Wig In A Box' is a spectacular pop song which is so catchy it would have made a mega-hit were it released in the 70s; and the closing song 'Midnight Radio' is so classic a power ballad that you'll find your hand immediately reaching for the lighter. The band is fantastic, they have a terrific sound and are all great musicians, but they let Mitchell have all the attention he deserves. By the way, the music used in the shooting is playback as is usually the case in such movies, but John's vocals were recorded live, and it shows in his very emotional and powerful performances that have the feel of a live concert. Also, each song - especially 'The Origin Of Love' and 'Wig In A Box' - is shot as a perfect video clip. The band members, though they are not actors, and hardly talk at all, all look great on film and are pretty funny guys, too.In conclusion, let's just say it's a great film and get it over with. It's not a trash film, or a cult film, or a gay film. Just a great musical and a great film overall. I dare you not to run and buy the soundtrack after you watch it.",10,1,2,24 May 2005
Big Fish," The story of stories
","Big Fish should be filed under 'what could have been'. Having been a big Tim Burton fan in my formative years, having loved Batman and Beetle Juice in my early teens and then growing into Ed Wood later on, my interest was dwindling with Sleepy Hollow and turned into real concern with Planet of the Apes. Out of nowhere came Big Fish - which seemed to signal a complete shift for Burton. He was finally growing up, rebelling against his own predictability and the style that he himself created and single-handedly turned into a cliché. On Big Fish he was reinventing himself and recreating himself as a legitimate filmmaker. Sadly, it remained a completely solitary incident. Burton sunk further back into his own clichés and never once created anything as fresh as Big Fish since.And so, Big Fish must be considered as a film by its own right, rather than a transitional step in Burton's filmography; and when seen as such, it's revealed as a gorgeous film, a drama/fantasy combination that's considerably more positive and whimsical than comparable films like Heavenly Creatures, The Fall and Pan's Labyrinth, all of which use the fantasy in the darkest ways possible. In Big Fish the fantasy isn't about escaping from horrible reality - it's to enhance a 'regular' reality, to make it more interesting and more spectacular. In a way, it's about the very essence of storytelling, and by extension, of filmmaking, which may explain why it's Burton's most emotional and personal movie - since Edward Scissorhands, at least.Burton's knack for visuals is obviously on display here too, but for once it's not the main attraction. Big Fish is gorgeously shot, the lighting and coloring construct the mood, but this time the characters are the centerpiece - the characters, astonishingly, not the actors (looking at you, Johnny Depp), because not one of the actors actually delivers a shattering performance (Albert Finney is the best one, as well as the only one who makes the fake accent work) but the characters are all remarkably memorable, and the credit should go to the cast but most of all to Burton. It's shocking that he could ever make a movie as emotionally potent as Big Fish, and sad that he never tried to repeat it.You can completely ignore the fact that Burton directed this; if you hadn't been told, it's possible that you'd never notice. Just sit back and enjoy a beautiful, touching, sad, hilarious, magical story, and be glad that someone talented took the time to make it.",9,1,1,25 September 2011
The Dark Knight," Surpassing all expectations
","I'll be the first to admit I was very skeptic about this one, because I was very badly disappointed by Batman Begins, but in any standard this was an excellent movie and probably the best superhero movie since 1989's Batman at least.The Dark Knight maintains the elements I liked about Batman Begins - the dark grittiness, the realism and the maturity - but has more of what it was lacking in - good pacing, strong action scenes and strong villain characters. Ledger and Eckhart are both brilliant, and more than make up for what I feel is a mediocre Bruce Wayne at most. It's a bit too long and tries to stuff too much storyline into one movie, which is why I can't give it a full 5 stars. Other than that - excellent. Really surpassed my expectations.",9,0,3,26 September 2011
Friends with Benefits," A formula that works
","Friends With Benefits is a genre film and it isn't ashamed of it. It uses every cliché in the book and it uses them to full effect, better than any rom-com I've seen in ages. In an age where the classic rom-com is all but dead, when hipsterish films like (500) Days of Summer subvert every rule of the genre to hell and back for the sake of being edgy and subversive, Friends With Benefits is just self-aware and subversive enough to feel like it was made in 2011 and not twenty years earlier, but even if they make a snarky remark while doing it about the lack of realism in this sort of film, they still do everything you know - and hope - they will. The amazing thing is, it works. This comedy inspires true catharsis in the viewer and reminds us all why these clichés and rules were created in the first place - long before the genre turned into the bad, sticky joke that it is.A lot of the credit should go to the cast, of course; because a film like this could never work if you're not rooting for the two leads to end up together. Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake, it should be noted, are not in any way great actors. When each one is alone on the screen, they fail to impress, and when they interact with any member of the excellent supporting cast - Richard Jenkins, Woody Harrelson, Patricia Clarkson and even Emma Stone - Kunis and Timberlake are always the less interesting and less magnetic half of the scene. And yet - when they're together, they have an incredible and natural chemistry, one that only the great couples of the silver screen could ever achieve, and they make even the sex scenes, that could have been awkward with other actors, feel natural and pleasant. They makes for a real and likable couple that you want to root for, even relate to, so much so that you can set aside your cynicism and forget that the scenario would have been very different with two people who, well, don't look like Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake.Most of all, though, it's the screenplay that makes Friends With Benefits work against all odds. It shows real wit and understanding of the characters' age-group, and doesn't try too hard to be hip and modern that it alienates the viewers and the actors. It's radiant with love for New York City, turning it into as major a player in the story as the lead characters, giving the story a strong sense of location and reality. Most impressive of all is the dialog during the sex scenes, which is more candid, realistic and hilarious than you would ever expect from a rom-com. Where other films would stop short when these scenes and fade to black and blast up the music, Friends With Benefits doesn't really show what people having sex look like - it's still a mainstream American comedy, after all - but it does show us how they act, and it's extremely accurate, avoiding any manner of idealization or romanticization and as a result is very relatable and as a result, very funny.I'm a heterosexual male. I don't, by definition, like romantic comedies. But I liked this one. I understood where the story was going about ten minutes in, I knew exactly what the characters were going to do, but I'll be damned if I didn't really want them to do it. And I enjoyed it all the while. Friends With Benefits won't change the world, it's highly likely that I won't remember it two years from now. But if, ten years from now, it'll pop up on TV, it'll jog a pleasant memory, and I'll watch it all over again. And it'll be two hours I'm sure to enjoy.",8,0,2,18 July 2013
Puss in Boots," Unneeded, but entertaining
","The big problem about Puss in Boots is that there's really no reason for its existence. In a Disney franchise, it would have been a straight-to-video sequel at best. It distinguishes itself somewhat by focusing more on action and less on fairy tale gags than the Shrek movies, but it's not enough to make up for the very flat, predictable storyline. Every new character introduced for the sake of this movie is also a one-note gag, the protagonist remaining the only one with any real characterization.In spite of all that Puss in Boots is pretty entertaining, and it's notably better than the last two entries in the Shrek series - animation included, while the animation in Shrek Forever After was lazy and bland, Puss in Boots was made with a lot of imagination and attention to details; the animated cats are all hilarious, their behavior filled with wonderful observation of the real world counterparts, lovely visual gags that make up for the general lack of fresh humor. The movie is bland and forgettable as a whole, but it's a pretty fun way to spend 90 minutes, especially if you enjoyed Kung Fu Panda.",6,0,4,16 February 2012
Taken," A Paranoid's Wet Dream
","The only reason I'm giving Taken 4 stars rather than one or two is the fact that, admittedly, it's a well-executed action flick. It's been compared to movies like Die Hard and Lethal Weapon and indeed, despite the excessive use of hand held jittery cameras that place it firmly in the 2000's, it manages to create action scenes more coherent and flowing than almost any other movie made this decade; this combined with the short runtime makes me believe that I might have liked it a lot at age 11 or 12. Of course, it's not a movie that should be watched by a 12 year old kid, and that's just one of the reasons I consider it one of the most poorly conceived movies ever made.Fans of Taken often defend it against the critics by claiming that it isn't meant to be taken seriously - that it's an escapist fantasy. The fact is that it's anything but. Rather than providing escape from reality, it's a movie that feeds on dangerous paranoia - the personal paranoia of over-protective, suffocating parents, and the collective paranoia of xenophobic patriots. The movie reinforces the paranoid fantasy that everybody is after your children and they will suffer greatly if you ever let them leave your sight for even a moment; that all foreigners are out to get you; and that if you ever step out of the comfort zone of your precious US of A, you'll immediately be kidnapped and sold as a prostitute. Of course, you can escape that fate, but only if your dad is a former CIA agent and proficient in various methods of murder and torture - the other victims aren't that lucky, as we can see that the loving father doesn't really give a damn about any of them (or about his daughter's good friend, either). Honestly, I'm really quite concerned about the effect this might have on people watching who have shades of notions of those fantasies already.Which leads me to the second big problem - that the subject matter that supplies the plot for this alleged 'escapist fantasy' is very realistic, very delicate and difficult, and is glossed over and trivialized magnificently. Apparently we aren't supposed to care that most of the victims of human trafficking aren't American tourists with cellphones and CIA dads to help them escape; the protagonist doesn't really care either. The movie suggests that human trafficking isn't really a problem, really, as long as we leave it to those primitive Europeans and don't let our own children go to that filthy continent. The truth is that human trafficking is a problem so global and so very real on a day-to-day basis, that the very fact that the movie tries to deal with it undermines any pretense to escapism.Taken caters mainly to two groups - young teenagers, who'll enjoy the action and the overall coolness and in the process may be lead to believe that this is a realistic representation; and overprotective dads, for whom it will reinforce their biggest nightmares, and it may make their paranoia much more extreme. In both cases, the movie can do more harm than good; the protagonist is so cool and impressive (an admittedly strong performance from Liam Neeson) that those viewers are likely to idolize him. Indeed the movie never asks us to question his morality, and instead expects us to despise and villainize the more sensible mother, who's actually showing some healthy respect and trust in her daughter, and of course, the stereotypically balding, chubby and above all rich stepfather, who seems like a pretty decent guy but whom we're supposed to hate anyway because he doesn't share the biological dad's psychosis (and a wasted appearance by the wonderful Xander Berkeley, a superb character actor who here has to play a completely character-less character).These are just some of my complaints about how dangerous and ill-conceived the movie is; I'm not even getting into the fact that it's completely and ridiculously unrealistic, and extremely poorly paced (the daughter literally meets her kidnapper when she's stepping off the plane, and is kidnapped about five minutes later). I also won't go into the fact that, while Neeson's character is ridiculously paranoid about his daughter going to the dark land of Mordor (France), he shows no qualms whatsoever about leaving her alone with a Christina Aguilera-like pop starlet who promises to get her into show business. Because there's no way that she'll give his daughter drugs, that her entourage will seduce her into decadent parties and orgies, or that her agent will take advantage of her? Oh right, I forgot. They're all Americans. That kinda stuff doesn't happen there.",4,2,4,7 August 2012
This Is Spinal Tap," All the way to eleven!
","The only thing funnier than 'This Is Spinal Tap' is the people who didn't get the joke. Leafing through the reviews on Amazon and IMDb, I came upon a couple of one star reviews along the lines of 'it was an okay documentary but why make a film about this band nobody's heard of when there were lots of better bands around?' There was even one guy who, apparently attempting to appear musically educated, stated that he remembers hearing some of Spinal Tap's hits in the 70's, but they were nothing special. The fact that there are a few who failed to realize that Spinal Tap were a fictitious band, created specifically for this mockumentary, is a testament to the subtle intelligence of the humor and the preciseness of the film's parody, as well as to the dreadful overall state of mainstream rock in the late 70's and early 80's.In his first feature film, Rob 'Meathead' Reiner disguises himself as documentary maker Marty DiBergi and follows around the comeback US tour of has-been heavy metal dinosaurs Spinal Tap. Reiner did not invent the fake documentary  and I don't care what Charlie (or was it Donald?) Kaufman says, it wasn't Fellini either  the concept can be traced back to the brilliant opening scene of 'Citizen Kane' and even earlier than that  but no film prior to 'This Is Spinal Tap' was this loyal and uncompromising in its documentary structure and in its invented reality. Reiner, Guest and co. took the joke to the very limits, and it's easy to see that with the DVD bonus features, which include TV commercials made by Spinal Tap, video clips, press conferences and TV appearances from across the band's history, even an appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show.Spinal Tap are everything that was silly, trite and ridiculous about the music industry in the early 80's. In their Prima Dona behavior, their stupid quarreling, their idiotic, half-baked pseudo-philosophic wisdom, and most of all in their songs, Spinal Tap put a distorting mirror in front of half the bands that were around at the time; and any band that was insulted because they thought the joke was on them, merely proved the point. The songs use every cliché of rock music without shame, and the performances of Michael McKean, Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer as the band-mates are precise, merciless and hilarious. Best of all is Guest as virtuoso guitarist Nigel Tuffnel, who is beyond brilliant in several unforgettable scenes (including the classic 'the dials go up to eleven' routine), but is also hilarious when he doesn't say a word; his body language and facial expressions while playing on stage spoof any self-proclaimed genius guitarist of the time, and there's no need for mentioning any names.Again, what makes 'This Is Spinal Tap' great is the subtleness of the humor. Reiner and co. felt no inhibition to supply jokes by the minute as way too many comedies do, and it's an ability he proved again later in the classics 'The Princess Bride' and 'When Harry Met Sally'. The jokes in 'This Is Spinal Tap' do not overshadow the characters and the story told, but with very few actual jokes the film is still unbelievably, consistently, laugh-out-loud roll-on-the-floor funny. Especially for musicians and music lovers in general, who will immediately laugh at many of the easy to miss jokes, 'This Is Spinal Tap' is essential viewing, and one of the funniest films you'll ever see. The DVD is also great, with lost of supplemental material and wonderful deleted scenes, including several with the great Billy Crystal.",10,0,4,18 March 2006
Alice in Wonderland," An insult to Lewis Carroll's vision
","I almost don't want to review this movie, because I love Tim Burton and I hope he'll realize the error of this project and be back on track for the next one, the way he did after the horrendous Planet of the Apes (and no, Alice isn't quite as bad as that one, but that's not saying much). Having been accustomed to being disappointed by literary film adaptations, I came in with low expectations, and still I was disappointed.What bothered me most as a Lewis Carroll fan was not the changes made to the storyline as much as the changes made to the spirit and the atmosphere. Amy Biancolli phrased it perfectly - 'Its single biggest failing... is the fact that it makes sense'. The film betrays everything that was magical and fascinating about Carroll's nonsense and whim, turning it into a clone of Narnia or the Neverending Story. The Mad Hatter -- a tortured soul turned to madness by evil and horror? Seriously? That's almost as bad as turning the poem of the Jabberwocky - a masterpiece of language and nonsense - into an ominous prophecy. 'Underland'? Please. The characters are Carroll's, but Carroll's vision is gone.Not that the film doesn't have a few things going for it. The casting is near perfect, and it could have made a solid Alice film. Helena Bonham Carter, Matt Lucas, Stephen Fry, Alan Rickman, Michael Sheen, Crispin Glover, Timothy Spall - they all do a commendable job. Johnny Depp's Hatter was awful but it wasn't his fault - he was merely doing his Willy Wonka over again. Mia Wasikowska does a good job, even if any connection to Carroll's Alice is purely coincidental. Costume design and art direction are as good as you'd expect from Burton, but hardly groundbreaking.As for the 3D, it does very little to help the film along. I do hope that Burton has learned his lesson - that 3D is no replacement for filmmaking (although sadly, seeing how successful Alice was, it may be that he won't learn that lesson). If Avatar hasn't driven the message home, then Alice should be a wake-up call to anyone of the James Cameron school of thought, who will realize that 3D cinema is a gimmick, a fun one, but definitely not the next stage in filmmaking, at least not until somebody did anything worthwhile with it, and so far I haven't seen that happen.",4,1,3,23 September 2011
Avatar," All style, very little substance
","In its core, Avatar is a mediocre movie, a retold Pocahontas story in a futuristic setting, the sci-fi element adding very little to the message that screams at the viewer on a minutely basis. Character development is minimal, the dialog trite and recycled. While it could be argued that T2 - still Cameron's greatest movie - was more or less the same, that movie excelled in pacing its action scenes, and in incorporating style and humor in a way that Avatar never does, rather than just in visual effects.Having said all that - none of it can reduce anything from the technological and visual triumph Avatar achieved. which is so much more impressive when viewed on a big screen with the 3D goggles. Cameron and co. created a fully formed world, more convincing and more real than anything seen before, with gorgeous fantastical landscapes and atmosphere, and incredibly imaginary yet totally realistic creatures and plants, and draws the viewer in completely, just like the main character is drawn into a reality that's not his own. Too bad none of the characters are compelling enough to give that connection any real meaning.",7,1,4,14 January 2012
The Artist," So much fun
","I confess that I'm a sucker for films about filmmaking; I love them in every form, shape and color. As a result I probably would have liked The Artist no matter what. It's a good movie by any measure, though; a beautiful homage to the Hollywood of the 20's, made with incredible amounts of love and respect. The black and white cinematography is perfectly gorgeous; it echoes the style of the 20's but with a more sensitive modern touch that makes every shot a work of art. Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo both deliver wonderful performances; Dujardin in particular was clearly born to act in silent films. James Cromwell is also terrific, even if some of the others, like John Goodman, don't fit in as well. The Artist is entertaining, funny and also quite touching, Dujardin delivering huge amounts of emotion without talking.It's not a masterpiece, though, nor is it the best movie of the year. The basic premise was explored long ago in Singing in the Rain, and The Artist doesn't have the same kind of timeless staying power; nor does it have the cynical wit of Mel Brooks' Silent Movie. The Artist is first and foremost a homage and a call-back, and it could have easily have gone for a completely different plot. It works for what it is; some clever things are done with the format, especially the first dream sequence. But in its basis it remains not much more than a very good silent movie, lots of fun for cinephiles and film history lovers - actually, scratch that: it's lots of fun for everyone.",8,2,4,12 February 2012
Up," Pixar strikes again
","Pixar seems to be improving from one film to the next. From The Incredibles onward, they've been set on making their films more and more appealing to adults, and they've done it - Up can be enjoyed by the entire family - more so that Wall-E, which was too slow paced in its first half for children.The feelings of melancholy and nostalgia in Up, especially the opening montage, are authentic and truly touching; which doesn't mean that Up is not also incredibly funny. The second half is a romp of an adventure movie with lots of action and lots of fun; it's not as powerful as the beginning, but it's also not a letdown like the second half of Wall-E. Whether it's melancholy or insane, Up remains consistently good throughout, and it's one of the best CGI features made yet.",9,1,2,26 September 2011
The Fly," Surprisingly touching
","I'm not, nor have I ever been, a fan of body horror or gross-out horror; true horror, to me, is the kind that relies on suspense and tension. I make an exception with David Cronenberg; even when he gives in to full-on gore, he does so with his own unique vision and spark.The Fly is not quite an example of that; it's much more commercially oriented, much less personal and original than earlier Cronenberg pieces like Videodrome or Scanners, and it gives in to the gore much more whole-heartedly. It remains, in fact, the most 'standart' horror film of Cronenberg's career.And yet The Fly is still a success on a very different level; character development takes the place of world-building, and so it manages to achieve more emotional connection than any other Cronenberg film made before A History of Violence. Jeff Goldblum delivers a shockingly good performance - maybe the best of his career, and creates one of the most sympathetic, pathetic horror-film monsters in history. The fact that we see him grow into the monster gradually over the course of the film makes it even more gut-wrenching. The Fly is not a Cronenberg classic, but it's definitely a horror classic.",8,1,2,24 September 2011
Reservoir Dogs," Violence as Poetry
","First things first, I'm not going to call Reservoir Dogs 'Quentin Tarantino's best movie', because I love all of his movies dearly and I will not pick favorites. Nevertheless, as of the last time I saw the three of them (the other ones being, of course, Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown. I'm not counting Four Rooms, because he only had one segment in it - even if it was the best part of the movie), Reservoir Dogs was the one I enjoyed most.A brief overview: Lawrence Tierney is Joe Cabot, and Chris Penn is his son 'Nice Guy' Eddie. Joe is a crime boss planning a diamond heist, and for the operation he hires six men, all of them acquainted with Cabot but none of which knows each other. To avoid having any details about one another they keep their identities secret and call each other by code names: Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Pink (the always wonderful Steve Buscemi), Mr. Blonde (action star Michael Madsen in the part of a lifetime), Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker) and Mr. Brown (Tarantino himself, who gets killed at the very beginning of the movie). When the robbery becomes a bloodbath, the thieves escape to the rendezvous and try to figure out what went wrong and who's responsible.The movie is basically a very small scale theatrical production, as the main body of the story takes place in only one location, although there are several flashbacks that play a very important part in the film. The movie caused a lot of buzz at the time of its release partly due to its high level of violence, but today it seems much less shocking and that gives us a chance to better appreciate Tarantino's unique storytelling abilities - especially since having also seen Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown we can now safely assume that its success wasn't a one time thing. Tarantino's dialogue is brilliant beyond competition and his juxtaposition of conversations about life-and-death issues and mindless chatter about the most minor trivialities of life makes his movies a treat to watch (Note the Madonna conversation in the beginning of Reservoir Dogs and the Delfonics chats in Jackie Brown. While I'm on the subject, the use of music here is brilliant, as Quentin juxtaposes a nostalgic 70s radio show with the film's most violent scenes). The poetry and beauty put into the most violent sequences are as enchanting as they are shocking, and Michael Madsen's torture scene, backed with Stealer's Wheel's 1970s hit 'Stuck In The Middle With You', became an instant timeless classic.Tarantino is of course the main guy in this classic, but the actors are all worthy of praise. Harvey Keitel is a great straight man, who seems to be the only honest person in the film, and the always nervous and catatonic Steve Buscemi balances him out. Michael Madsen and Tim Roth are both spectacular, and Lawrence Tierney is brilliant (as another character describes him - 'You remember the Fantastic Four?... The Thing. He looks just like The Thing.') The relationships forming between the six individuals, all of the complete strangers, make Reservoir Dogs a really fascinating watch. Tarantino is a picky director; he makes few movies, but the ones he makes really count. I'm waiting for his next release, 'Kill Bill', eagerly. If you missed out on any of his three masterpieces, don't.",10,1,3,24 May 2005
Three Colors: Blue," Beautiful grief
","When viewed by its own right, and not as part of a trilogy, Blue is simply a beautiful movie. Above all the heavy layers of symbolism and social commentary - which, I admit, were a bit too heavy-handed for my taste - there's a simple and touching drama about grief, loss and recuperation. Beautifully shot, beautifully edited, and played out with subtle and minimalistic perfection by Juliette Binoche.Most of all, stylistically, Blue excels in its juxtaposition of image and music, and it does so on almost every shot. Some of the elements that try for symbolism felt to me like they try too hard - the excessive use of blue colors, or the brief blackouts. But at its quietest, simplest moments, the music and image compliment each other to create a perfect mood, and cinema at its purest.",9,0,0,26 September 2011
Castle in the Sky," Early masterpiece from Miyazaki
","Hayao Miyazaki's second feature film, and his first one to be widely acclaimed both commercially and critically (though his debut - Nausicaa AKA Warriors of the Wind is considered by many fans his best), 'Tenku no Shiro Rapyuta' AKA 'Castle in the Sky' may seem childish and simplistic when compared to his more recent masterpieces like 'Kiki's Delivery Service', 'Mononoke-hime' and 'Spirited Away', but in 1986 it was years ahead of its time and it was one of the milestones of modern anime. It's important to remember that 'Castle in the Sky' was made two years before the revolutionary 'Akira', and while it's not provocative and controversial like the aforementioned masterpiece, the lead characters are all mainly basic manga hero / heroine / villain type characters, and the story is quite predictable and obvious (at least in today's standards), Miyazaki's designs and animation work are of standards never seen before. While the story and humor are a bit silly and outdated at times, the movie is still very entertaining and very enjoyable - if not as breathtaking as 'Spirited Away'. And if you'll allow yourself to see the beauty of the frames themselves and ignore the low-budget coloring and animation and the identical twin faces - at this point Miyazaki is still faithful to his roots and to the agreed standards of Japanese cartooning - you'll see Miyazaki's genius shine through as well as it does on 'Spirited Away' and Mononoke. While 'Castle in the Sky', being a sci-fi adventure and very suitable for children, fits in more neatly with classic anime than anything else he had done since, his motifs and principles still show and play an important part. To say much more would be to ruin the movie, so I'll kindly shut up. Suffice to say that I'm giving it only nine stars because if I gave it ten I couldn't go any higher for 'Spirited Away' and 'Princess Mononoke'. And that would be a crime.As in most anime movies, I recommend watching the Japanese version with the English subtitles, even if you don't speak a word of Japanese - the English overdubs just don't tend to be very good, and in this case it's just horrendous. You might want to watch it in the English version once, though, just for the laughs, and for the star-filled cast (the English dub was only recorded following the success of 'Spirited Away', as it was for 'Kiki's Delivery Service') - Anna Paquin and James Van Der Beek (Yeah, the Dawson guy!) fill the lead roles, Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker from 'Star Wars', in case you don't know!) plays the villain, and other roles are filled by Andy Dick, Tres MacNeille (The Simpsons, Rugrats, Animaniacs...), Michael McShane (Friar Tuck from Kevin Costner's Robin Hood travesty) and Mandy Patinkin (Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya...) Good for a laugh, or a few laughs really. But watch the Japanese one first.",7,7,12,24 May 2005
The Untouchables," Nearly Unwatchable
","From the thunderous music and melodramatic graphics at the very beginning of The Untouchables, I knew I wasn't getting a subtle and nuanced crime drama like The Godfather, Goodfellas or LA Confidential. Actually, I knew that as soon as I saw Brian De Palma's name. What I was hoping for was a solid piece of entertainment, possibly with over-the-top violence and drama a-la Scarface. I was shocked by how much I ended up disliking it.The first scene had a lot of potential, but it turned out that De Palma used up everything he had in that one shot - terrific cinematography, great art direction and costumes, and Robert De Niro. Those are pretty much the only things The Untouchables has going for it, and indeed, that first scene is one of the best in the entire film; the other standout scenes are Sean Connery's first two appearances, which probably earned him the very mysterious Oscar, but his character becomes bland in the second half and from then on his performance is less impressive, and it becomes ever more difficult to ignore his awful Irish accent. De Niro is impressive in his scenes, in a performance that's deliciously hammy and over-the-top, but it's not one of his best; even considering it's De Niro past his prime, in the rather slow period he had between Raging Bull and his comeback in Goodfellas, his Al Capone is still much less nuanced and less interesting than his characters in King of Comedy, True Confessions, The Mission, Once Upon a Time in America and Angel Heart.And still, Connery and De Niro are the best actors in this mess. Kevin Costner is wooden in Keanu Reeves levels; it doesn't help one bit that his character is one of the most deplorable in the film but played as an All-American Hero, which makes him hypocritical as well as unlikable. Charles Martin Smith, Jack Kehoe, Billy Drago and the rest are nothing but cardboard caricatures, while Andy Garcia has his moments but clearly has no idea what his character is about, no more than De Palma does. Most disturbing of all is Patricia Clarkson who gives an unintentionally eery performance as Costner's wife, who seems like something out of The Stepford Wives.On top of the bad acting and the shameless levels of historical inaccuracy, the film is a mess morally. Brian De Palma was never a master of moral ambiguity or subtlety, and here the morality is pure black and white, but he clearly doesn't really get what the story is actually about, and the result is a pretty enraging film with a hypocritical protagonist who goes on a killing spree and breaks every law possible to uphold a pointless law that he doesn't really care about, as the final scene clearly shows - yet the actor and director are both convinced that he's an infallible hero. All this in a movie full of clichÃ©s, with some moments that were taken right out of a Hallmark movie, with every possible 30's stereotype De Palma could think of, all of it very stylish but completely devoid of emotion. The explosion scene near the beginning is a perfect example.So why, on earth, was The Untouchables so well received when it was first released? Maybe some cosmic radiation made everybody in the late 80's and early 90's think that Kevin Costner is a good actor - that was finally over when he made the combo of Waterworld and The Postman. The Untouchables at least looks great - the costumes and art direction are excellent, and for that I give it four stars; there's also a Ennio Morricone score, which has some fine themes, however those have nothing to do with what's going on on screen and are generally disruptive. The best thing I can say about The Untouchables, overall, is that it's unusual and memorable. But not in a good way.",4,4,10,3 January 2012
The Godfather: Part III," Just when I think I'm out, they pull me back in
","Frequently attacked and constantly under-appreciated, The Godfather, Part III is often, and unfairly, referred to as one of the biggest disappointments in the history of cinema. When comparing  and I suppose a comparison is inevitable  The Godfather, Part III is certainly not quite as strong as the first two films, both of which are classic masterpieces, practically flawless, to be found in any respectful list of all-time best movies. It was largely a failure both commercially and critically (being nominated for seven Oscars but receiving none). Nevertheless, Part III is a fantastic drama, as good a crime drama as Scorsese's 'Goodfellas', which was released that same year and received much more critical acclaim; certainly the last great film Francis Ford Coppola had directed yet (hopes for 'Youth Without Youth', which has a late 2006 release date). Just like The Godfather, Part II achieved greatness by not trying to recapture the original but being an entirely separate and unique creation, so Part III is a separate creation that stands by its own right, and while it's a continuation of the first two films, it does nothing to subtract from their greatness as some sequels do. The Godfather can work perfectly as a single film, as a two-parter, or as a trilogy; it's a wonderful saga either way.In many ways, The Godfather, Part III, is closer in its spirit to the first film than to the second. International affairs take second place to character development and human insight. Part III, however, focuses on the character of Michael Corleone deeper than any of the other films. It's debatable whether or not Al Pacino's performance here is stronger here than in Part II  it's clear that he's more experienced and mature an actor than he was in 1974, though he may have lost just a bit of his edge. But while in Part II we saw Michael as a decent man gradually turning into a monster, all the while focusing on his life in comparison with his father, Part III delves more deeply into his soul; the influences of Shakespeare and Sophocles are stronger than ever before, as Michael turns into a tragic hero in the classic Greek sense of the words, a man with, ultimately, good intentions, brought down to his tragic end by fate and by his own flaws. Michael is more human and more pitiable in Part III than ever before, and Pacino is certainly up to the task. Comparisons to Vito are certainly there (watch Michael talk some sense into Vincent, just like Vito did to Sonny in the first film) but they're no longer the focus of the film; this film is about Michael, and so Pacino's performance here is more impressive than in the first two parts.The rest of the cast is fantastic (although there aren't any actors in the caliber of Brando, De Niro, Caan or Duvall  who was supposed to be in the film but backed out), but other than Diane Keaton and Talia Shire, who reprise their roles from the previous films excellently, the real revelation here is Andy Garcia, who plays Vincent, illegitimate son of Michael's eldest brother Sonny, and friend-of-the-family Lucy Mancini (the affair between Lucy and Sonny is referred to very briefly in the first film, although it plays a large and important part in the original novel). The role of Vincent Corleone is certainly the strongest in Garcia's career, and his only Oscar-nominated one; Vincent is wonderfully reminiscent of his father (played by James Caan in the first film), and he plays an important part of shedding light on the character of Michael Corleone, while never quite stealing the show from Pacino, clearly the center of the story. Also commendable are performances by George Hamilton, Joe Mantegna, Bridget Fonda and Eli Wallach.There has been much debate about Sofia Coppola's performance as Michael's daughter Mary, so here's my angle on it: it's quite bad indeed, and Sofia proves beyond doubt that she's not an actress. With a lesser cast around her, it wouldn't seem as bad, but next to actors like Pacino, Garcia and Keaton, Coppola seems totally out of place. However, it does little to hurt the film; Mary's part in the film is quite big, but she's mainly there to shed light on Michael and Vincent, and Sofia's less than mediocre performance is ignorable. Thankfully, she quit acting afterwords, and moved on to directing, a field in which she shows much more promise; in fact, the young Miss Coppola shows signs of being one of the most promising young directors of the new millennium.The Godfather, Part III is a fascinating and thrilling tale, and the last forty five minutes are as gripping as any scene in the first two films; Coppola's directing is as inspired and sensitive as it ever was before, and the dialog is all spotless, believable and captivating. The reference to the death of Pope John Paul I, who died only 33 days after being indicted and whose death remains something of a mystery, is a nice touch, which helps create the sense of realism that was an important aspect of the first two films. It's not as timeless a masterpiece as The Godfather and The Godfather, Part II, but if you loved the first two films, you should by all means watch this third installment, too.",8,1,3,17 February 2006
Zombieland," Meh
","Zombieland has a lot going for it, but it tries too hard and too much. It never quite makes up its mind on whether it wants to be a parody, an action movie, a road movie or a coming-of-age drama; which isn't a bad thing by itself (some of the best films ever made are the ones that defy definition under any specific genre) but Zombieland plays each genre by the book, feeling like a montage of clichés; the best example of this is the Bill Murray segment, which, while it's the funniest in the movie, feels completely out of place and seems to have been glued in just to add a few laughs to an otherwise mostly jokeless comedy. While the movie is a lot of fun - the pacing is mostly flawless, Woody Harrelson is wonderfully cool (Jesse Eisenberg and Emma Stone are not at their best, but Abigal 'Little Miss Sunshine' Breslin makes up for it with a compact but wonderful performance) and the premise - basically, a zombie movie with no gore or deaths (well, hardly any) is appealing but the movie fell flat for me. Shaun of the Dead wasn't perfect either but it had more groove.",5,1,2,14 January 2012
Die Hard," An action classic
","John McClane was a breath of fresh air after the series of heavy-muscled, unapproachable action heroes who dominated the 80's - Stallone, Arnie, Van Damme, Norris. If anything, McClane was the child of Dirty Harry Callahan; and if Harry was the ultimate badass cop for the 70's, McClane filled that role in the 80's and early 90's. Even more so than Callahan, McClane was a hero every viewer could identify with; wise-cracking, neurotic, short-tempered. It's the character that made Bruce Willis a star overnight, and made Die Hard one of the defining films of its genre. And even if parts of it seem dated, and a lot of the supporting actors do a cheesy job, Willis and Alan Rickman are both spectacular enough to hold the whole thing together, making it a constantly thrilling and wholly enjoyable movie even twenty years later.",9,1,2,23 September 2011
Psycho," She couldn't even hurt a fly
","Psycho remains the greatest thriller ever made. I consider it Alfred Hitchcock's last great film (apologies to all Birds lovers out there  I'm sorry, but in Hitchcock's standards that movie really was mediocre at best) as well as the best he had made, and the one in which the efforts of terrific films like Rear Window, Vertigo and North By Northwest finally culminated into one timeless masterpiece. Hitchcock knew what most of today's directors of thrillers and horror movies have forgotten  how to build up tension and sympathy for his characters. In no film did he do it better than in Psycho. And so, even if it doesn't seem half as violent and horrific as it did four and a half decades ago, and even if the shower scene isn't as convincing as we'd like to remember, it's still one of the scariest and most effective thrillers ever made.Psycho was clearly years ahead of its time, and it laid the groundwork for modern thrillers from Taxi Driver and The Conversation to Fight Club, Se7en and The Usual Suspects. Other than the fact that it's a perfectly constructed film, from the opening titles (by the great master Saul Bass) and the wonderful music (by the irreplaceable Richard Herrmann) which compliments and build the tension and horror to perfection; to the editing, the subtle dialog and the construction of each scene and each shot  Psycho stood out for the focus Hitchcock put for the first time on the villain character, to whom the heroes  Janet Leigh as the victim, John Gavin as her lover, Vera Miles as her sister, and of course the great Martin Balsam as the investigating detective  all take second place.Norman Bates is not only a lifetime performance for the great Anthony Perkins; he is the single greatest creation in the entire Hitchcock catalog, and one of the most fascinating villain characters in film history. It may be remembered that in Hitchcock's previous films  Rear Window in particular springs to mind  the 'madman' or villain character was the most unsatisfying and undeveloped element of the film. The murderer's motives are tackled here head on, and in this way it foreshadows many of the greatest thrillers of the 70's, 80's and 90's. Psycho is not about discovering the identity of the killer  that much can be figured out by any viewer from the first time Norman Bates is on screen. It's about exploring Bates's mind and psych; his dialog is written to perfection and Perkins's performance goes without a hitch.The only scene I still have problems with is the one in which Simon Oakland appears as a psychiatrist to explain to us Bates's motives and his story, thus spelling out what it seems an observant viewer can figure out for himself. Still, maybe viewers in 1960 weren't as immersed in psychological thrillers as we are today and so needed the explanation. This scene  anticlimactic and slightly too long  aside, the finale is still one of the most memorable and chilling in film history, and in my mind more impressive that the famed shower scene, making the entire film an unforgettable experience and one of the most effective ever made. Psycho is an essentiality to any cinema lover.",10,2,3,6 July 2006
Rosemary's Baby," This film is not recommended for pregnant women
","The stylish, ambitious, chaotic mess of 1965's Repulsion was condensed to its purest form in Rosemary's Baby, Polanski's first real masterpiece and, along with Chinatown, his most memorable work. Rosemary's Baby took some cues from Hitchcock's work, but by its own right it revolutionized horror cinema, and had a huge part in inspiring classics from Jaws to The Shining and The Thing - films that took to heart the lesson that nothing is scarier than nothing, and maintain tension and terror throughout with very little actually happening.Partly thanks to the film's minimalistic nature (most of it takes place in one apartment, not unlike Repulsion) and the refusal to rely on special effects, and partly thanks to Polanski's inspired directorial work, Rosemary's Baby stood the test of time better than any horror film of its time - indeed, better than most films of the 60's. Young viewers more accustomed to slasher horror may scoff at how little happens, but once you start watching the feeling of terror and discomfort grows and it's impossible not to be taken in, especially if you've anywhere near the protagonists' age. Mya Farrow and John Cassavetes are terrific in the leads, probably delivering the most powerful performances in their careers; and their show is nearly stolen by the irritating, charming, creepy, lovable Ruth Gordon (who won a very deserved Oscar for her part).Very few films are as timeless as Rosemary's Baby, and few are as absorbing and effective. A must-see for every film lover.",10,3,4,5 April 2012
Inception," Cold and flat
","The concept of Inception is a very appealing one, and the film is wonderfully inventive. It's also not as confusing or effects-heavy as some have said - the story is actually very well constructed. That just makes it all the more frustrating, because Inception has some very hard to define flaws that prevents it from being a truly great movie - most of all the very uninteresting characters. It's not exactly that they're flat - they're all convincing enough and the dialog is fluent enough, but none of them deserve any true emotion or interest from the viewer. It's a good movie by any measure, and yet - like every previous Christopher Nolan movie - stops just short of being a fantastic one.",6,2,4,23 September 2011
The Terminal," Another half-baked film from Steven Spielberg
","It's been over a decade since Spielberg had his one-two combo in 1993 with a groundbreaking futuristic action film (Jurassic Park) and a truly beautiful historical drama (Schindler's List) and, unless you count Saving Private Ryan (which, in my opinion, has several ingenious scenes but is too long and has a lot of filler) it's been that long since we've seen a truly memorable offering from the great master of the 70s and 80s. That's not to say that he made a bad film; there's some to be said for Catch Me If You Can, Minority Report, Amistad and, to a certain extent, AI as well; but none of these show any sign of the brilliant and original spark of the genius who created Close Encounters, Jaws, ET, Indiana Jones, The Color Purple, Empire of the Sun, or Duel. On the contrary - Spielberg seems to have created a monster he cannot control, and each film he makes seems, at least a bit, like a cruel parody on him, as he employs every Hollywood cliché that he himself invented all those years ago. The Terminal is no exception. Spielberg's third collaboration with Tom Hanks - who (apologies to the hordes of Hanks fans out there), be he an astronaut, a boy in an adult body, a detective, a con artist or a refugee from a war-torn country, will always be Tom Hanks - which, like the other two, is based on a true story, is by far the weakest of the bunch. The film starts out with a great and fascinating premise, as a biting satire about the cruelty of capitalist bureaucracy, and as long as that is the subject, it's both funny and touching, as it shows the way the Uncle Sam treads all over the little man. Spielberg, however, doesn't manage to fill more than thirty minutes with that concept, and soon enough we find him swimming towards the safe and known shores of physical humor and romantic comedy. The story about the man forced to live in an airport is of course a terrible stretch, but it gets across and manages to convince; once Catherine Zeta Jones steps in is when the story becomes unbelievable. The film soon turns into a cheesy, unconvincing romance with some really bad dialogue, and loses all its uniqueness and originality. Obviously, The Terminal has its moments; it's Spielberg, after all, and is entertaining at the very least. I expected more, though. In all likelihood this is Spielberg's worst movie, or at least the worst in some years. This one is good for a video rental, no more.",4,2,5,24 May 2005
Paths of Glory," Perfect
","Fans of Stanley's Kubrick latter, more celebrated output (from Dr. Strangelove onwards) may find it jarring to realize how little Paths of Glory feels like a Kubrick film. On one hand, it may be considered Kubrick's first real classic (unless you love The Killing, which I don't); on the other, he didn't quite find his own voice yet. It's a mixed blessing - Paths of Glory isn't quite as mesmerizing or stylish as The Shining, A Clockwork Orange or Full Metal Jacket; but it's much tighter and more focused than any of those. It's also far more human and more realistic.The strange result is that while Paths of Glory isn't quite one of Kubrick's greatest classic, it's one of his best films and, as a matter of fact, one of the best films of the 50's. It's also one of the finest war films ever made, and practically one of a kind within the genre; Paths of Glory isn't about the chaos and hell of war (like Kubrick's own wildly chaotic Full Metal Jacket) but rather about its effect on people; as such, it's a surprisingly subtle and poetic affair, focusing on characters and scenes of extremely powerful quietness. The acting is terrific all around, so much so that Kirk Douglas's character - the moral compass of the story - may be the least interesting of them. The fascinating ones are the flawed characters - those are the ones who make Paths of Glory both incredibly realistic for its time and a potent and powerful allegory.",9,0,1,22 April 2012
Back to the Future Part II," Not as solid as part 1, but still great
","Very good, but very uneven; Part II is both the campiest and the darkest installment in the series. More specifically - the scenes taking place in 2015 have aged badly, and though they have some strokes of genius, they feel strained and rely far too heavily on cheap make-up effects, Michael J. Fox doing a mediocre job at playing Marty McFly's entire family a-la Eddie Murphy (not a pleasant comparison, I know). On the other hand, the scenes in the alternative 1985 are wonderfully dark and edgy compared to the first film, and all the scenes in 1955 - especially the ones made to correspond to parallel ones from the original - are brilliant. The unsatisfying ending doesn't help the fact the it feels a bit like a tweener, but it still stands as one of the most solid sequels ever made, and holds the first and third movies together well.",8,2,3,23 September 2011
Carrie," Wasted potential
","When one of the most overrated directors in Hollywood adapts the most overrated author in America, the predictable result is an incredibly overrated movie, which is indeed what Carrie is. It's not a bad movie exactly - it has a lot of style and a few interesting ideas - but those get lost in a very messy haze. De Palma boldly tries to mix high-school drama with horror and mystery, but in the end all aspects fall flat, and as is often the case with Stephen King stories, the supernatural element is the dullest one in the whole movie. Sissy Spacek's performance is memorable enough to make a very flat and undeveloped character work, somehow; the best performance in the movie, though, is that of Piper Laurie as Carrie's mother, and it's completely wasted, as is anything good that De Palma has here.",5,1,6,23 September 2011
Mary and Max," Sweet and beautifully animated
","Adam Elliot's first full-length animated feature continues in the stylistic footsteps of his short films, on a larger, more ambitious scope, though the focus is still around similar motifs of loneliness and alienation. The quality of animation has improved, though, and the story is sweet and even moving; if you still need proof that animation isn't just for kids, Mary and Max is solid evidence. It could have easily been an independent tragicomedy by a director like Todd Solondz or Gus Van Sant, but the animation compliments the imaginative story and the colorful characters.The movie doesn't quite do well with the long format, though; when compared to Elliot's Oscar-winning Harvie Krumpet (2003) it's easy to see why. The characters of Mary and Max are both too flawed, and they both do very little growth for this long a movie, and the viewer gets a feeling of treading water. Despite the fact that the movie keeps inventing throughout, it get dull, and I couldn't help but feel that it would have been better with a 40 minute runtime. For that reason it feels very fresh at first, but it can't maintain the feeling of surprise and originality that Harvie Krumpet had, but it's still recommended for animation lovers.",7,1,4,14 August 2012
Vanilla Sky," I like it more than I should
","Vanilla Sky is, obviously, a very unnecessary film. Hollywood's ever growing tendency to hijack every somewhat successful foreign film and remake it in English for the local market is one of the worst diseases of the American film industry; this remake of Alejandro Amenábar's excellent Abre los ojos - made only three years after the original's release - is, by its conception, no better than any of them.And yet - and yet, I like Vanilla Sky. I can't say that I like it as much as Abre los ojos, but that's mainly because it lacks the element of originality. Some elements aren't as strong as the original, and there's definitely a Hollywoodian feeling that distracts, but the remake has many strengths as well - other than the obviously bigger budget, the biggest advantage it has is director Cameron Crowe. Crowe adapted the film nearly word-for-word and shot-for-shot, but he lent it his own style, his own penchant for pacing, and of course an excellent soundtrack which includes artists as varied as Radiohead, The Monkees, Red House Painters and Sigur Rós. Crowe's smoother, more elegant approach is just as appropriate for the story as Amenábar's grittiness, if not more, and it's actually quite refreshing to see these two different approaches to an almost identical film.Tom Cruise also does a surprisingly good job. While Jason Lee and Kurt Russell don't quite work out in their roles, I actually liked Cruise better than Eduardo Noriega in the lead. Cruise lends the role the same airheaded, self-important naiveté he had in Jerry Maguire, to darker results, and supplies one of his better performances. I also liked - nay-sayers be damned - the increased emphasis on the sci-fi elements, which work as a truly surprising turn when they finally appear.Vanilla Sky isn't as complex or intelligent as Abre los ojos. Instead, it's more stylish and more dynamic, and as a film by its own right, it works just as well. Despite the many similarities these are two different films, and I like them both.",7,0,1,26 December 2011
X-Men: First Class," Not a good prequel - an excellent movie
","Why is 'prequel' such a dirty word? Is it all because of George Lucas? Could a good, actual prequel ever be made? The difficulties of making a good prequel are obvious - it's difficult to make the film exciting when the eventual outcome is pretty much known in advance, and the viewer is perfectly aware of which characters are death-proof and which aren't; in addition, being forced to adhere to franchise continuity can come at the expense of good storytelling. Of course, the more fervent the franchise's fanbase is, the most difficult it is. Most franchises avoid the challenge altogether. Batman Begins and Casino Royale were referred to as prequels during production, but both were complete reboots; Star Trek, on the other hand, seemed like a proper prequel at first but then took a completely different route. X-Men: First Class, in contrast, takes a middle route, and it's almost impossible to figure out whether it's a prequel or a reboot. There are too many cross-references to the other X-Men movies thrown around to really call this a reboot; but it also contradicts the timeline and continuity of those movies in every possible way. Are those references only intended as in-jokes? But the approach of the movie is also not different enough to warrant a completely new continuity. That reeks of indecision.The amazing thing, though, that once I got past that, that's more or less the only real flaw I could find in First Class. In fact, it may be the best film in the series, other than not having the benefit of the excellent performances of Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart. The problems in continuity may make it difficult to enjoy for rabid fans of the previous movies, but as a standalone, First Class stands perfectly well as a sci-fi film with drama, pathos, solid acting, excellent action scenes, and, yes, a sense of humor too - even though it's decisively darker, more pessimistic and more morally ambiguous than all previous X-Men films - that is mainly thanks to Michael Fassbender's incredible performance as Magneto, who manages to equal Ian McKellen's wonderful portrayal of the same character in X-Men 1-3.X-Men: First Class suffers from the inherent problems of all prequels - anyone who saw the first three X-Men movies or knows anything about the comics knows a lot about the conclusion pretty much from the beginning of the movie. But it manages to go around that problem by not focusing too much on the plot - instead, First Class is a character study, an exploration of morality, and a coming-of-age story - as well as a large-scale action extravaganza, of course, though not excessively so; it's a human drama centered on the relationship between two complex characters, but it also enjoys a wonderful ensemble cast. An excellent movie by any standard, that doesn't adhere strictly to the constrained of a defined continuity, but stands proudly on its own as one of the finest superhero movie ever made.",8,0,1,12 January 2012
Blade Runner," 21st Century Film Noir
","It is popular opinion that the movie Blade Runner was altogether better than the novel on which it was based, Philip K. Dick's 'Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep'. Quite frankly, having read the book before seeing the movie, it seemed quite disappointing to me, when compared with the original. The importance of more interesting, philosophical subjects of the novel was cut down meaningfully; namely, the philosophical consequences of the idea of a humanoid robot that would be superior to man himself in any way. J.R Isidore (transformed into the very minor character of J.F Sebastian), Buster Friendly, Rick's wife and her eery mood-dialer, and most of all the electric sheep, the most wonderful symbolism in the novel. These were all removed. The idea of the artificial animals was only hinted, as was the unsolved question of whether Deckard himself is a replicant or not.But IN SPITE OF ALL THAT -- when considered individually by its own right, as it should be (it's no accident that the film and the novel have different names!) Blade Runner is still one of the masterpieces of sci-fi cinema. Harrison Ford - though he plays the exact same character he always does - fits right in. Ridley Scott's directing is superb. His biggest stroke of genius is in his relating to a theme that was very subtle and weak in the novel - the film noir atmosphere. Scott did an incredible job creating a futuristic classic film noir, right down to the electronic-film noir musical score.As an action and an atmosphere movie, Blade Runner is one of the best sci-fi films ever made. Highly recommended for all fans of the genre. Reading the novel is completely unnecessary to appreciate the film.",8,0,1,24 May 2005
Toy Story 3," A fantastic conclusion to the series
","Toy Story 2 felt like a half-hearted, though entertaining, rehash of the first; this third installment, coming 11 years after part 2 and 15 years after part 1, is anything but, and it's not only much better than the previous film but manages to regain the spark and novelty of the original, yet in a completely different way. Toy Story 3 is darker, more sober and more mature - the film and its motifs intentionally grew up with its viewers, just like Andy did, and for anyone in my age group - anyone who was a kid when the first film came out and is now in their 20's - it's very relevant and extremely effective, not to say that it's not also whimsical and hysterically funny. The animation too is some of the best Pixar created yet, and watching it back-to-back with the first two Toy Stories is really stunning in showing how much CGI had developed since its early days.",9,0,0,23 September 2011
Signs," Bloody awful
","I didn't have very high expectations for Signs. I didn't expect it to be this bad, either.What did we have here, then? Terribly unconvincing acting by Mr. Mel Gibson, one of the worst performances he's ever turned out. But what can you expect from him with this kind of script? His character is a two-dimensional mess. A widower reverend, who saves the world from aliens. That's about it. There's no real connection. And if you tell me the movie isn't really about aliens but about faith and Christian love and whatnot, I'll tell you plainly to shut up. It's a sci-fi movie, and it's bad sci-fi. If you consider it as a family movie it's even worse. Joaquin Phoenix, remembered fondly from Gladiator and Buffalo Soldiers, is wasted. And the kids were even more irritatingly cute than Haley Joel Osment in Sixth Sense - if that's possible. We got mediocre directing (not up to M. Night Shyamalan's standards), bloody awful writing. Shyamalan's dialogue was always bad, but the stories were great. This time we have a story that is not much more than a remake of War of the Worlds. This movie was made dozens of times before. The fact that Phoenix mutters 'It's like War of the Worlds' (oh, how self conscious) doesn't make it a parody or a homage. It's still a rip-off. Mars Attacks was a parody; Signs is a rip-off. The film doesn't excuse itself by using higher standards of special effects than were available before - the aliens look so awfully digital it's just pathetic.And the thing that bothered me worst is this. Watching a Shyamalan film, my expectations low though they were, I knew that as bad as the script will be, I'll still get a lovely, surprising twist ending. Well, there was a surprise. Here's the twist: there's no surprise. The ending is obvious and cheesy as hell. Maybe that's meant to be the surprise - if it is, it's a very tasteless joke. Sorry. The corny love-thy-neighbor-and-god-and-believe-in-yourself messages at the end don't impress me much either. Signs told me nothing I didn't already know. Look, I know all about crop circles, right? I kept hoping for a surprising explanation for the phenomena at the end of the film. Well, here's the explanation - they were created by thin, ugly, green aliens who want to take over the Earth, who look surprisingly like the guys from Close Encounters. WOAH! That was so never done before! Hey, hope you don't mind the spoiler. I consider it more a fair warning to prevent you from completely wasting two hours of your life. If you're a sucker for trick endings and consider watching the film because you liked Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, stay clear.",3,24,52,24 May 2005
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Stylish and beautiful
","To call it a masterpiece or a Woody Allen classic would be a major stretch. What it is is a satisfying and fitting conclusion to Woody's European vacation from himself, which started with Match Point and continued with Scoop and Cassandra's Dream. Its major weakness is that it's simply not a Woody Allen original, but a homage to cinema that he loves. For that reason it still feels less authentic to me than even the more mediocre of his classic pieces. But considering the staleness of some of his recent New York movies, I feel he did the right thing by taking this much needed break. And having recently seen the wonderful Whatever Works, I'd say that it worked and he's now ready to return to 'real' Woody Allen films.That's not to say that Vicky Cristina Barcelona is not an effective and entertaining film by its own right. It's sensual and emotional like few of his movies ever were, and it's incredibly beautiful. A lot of the credit should go to the actors. Javier Bardem and Scarlett Johansson, both among my favorite actors, do a commendable job, but Penelope Cruz and Rebecca Hall are the real surprises here, and they're the ones who really dominate the movie. With phenomenal acting like that, coupled with sharp dialog and beautiful cinematography, it's a very enjoyable, though somewhat forgettable watch - despite some flaws like the narration and annoying music.On a side note - while stylistically little of what goes on here is original Woody Allen, his themes are all over, and it's no accident that the phrase 'whatever works' slips out of Rebecca Hall's mouth - the connection to the film that has that title is obvious. Knowing now that Whatever Works was a script in work for over a decade, it's conceivable that Woody decided to lead up to it in this more escapist film. Viewing both films as a double-feature, it's easy to conceive it to be another attempt from Woody - as he did try (successfully) in Crimes and Misdemeanors and (not successfully) Melinda and Melinda - to tell the same tale twice, as a comedy and as a tragedy. And viewed like that, it almost actually works.",8,0,1,14 January 2012
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Extremely intelligent family movie
","While Fantastic Mr. Fox is quite definitely Wes Anderson's most commercial film so far, it treads the line between Hollywood and art-house surprisingly well, and manages to be an extremely intelligent family movie in the strictest meaning of the term - a movie to be enjoyed by both children and adults, each on a different levels. Kids will enjoy every minute, and adults will enjoy it more because they'll understand it more (watch Spike Jonze's Where the Wild Things Are for a failed attempt at achieving that very balance). With terrific voice talents and wonderful animation, this is one of the most truly enjoyable films I've seen in a long time, and at this point I'd like to point out that I didn't use the word 'fantastic' once in this review; I'd like a reward please.",9,0,3,23 September 2011
The Truman Show," Oh, and in case I don't see ya
","With its (all intentional of course) cheerfully colorful cinematography, cheesy music and one-dimensional supporting characters, it's easy to miss just how brilliant The Truman Show is; it's in fact one of the most important cinematic creations of the 1990's, at least as important as darker films like American History X and Fight Club, and one that works on several different levels. Because while it works quite clearly as a sarcastic satire and a commentary on the destructive and intrusive nature of the media in the post-modern age, in the light of the reality TV syndrome which was at the time just starting to grow, it's also a philosophical metaphor about the state of mankind.For Truman's story is man's story; and it's difficult not to see the importance in the names given to the lead characters. True Man's life, the film says, is an illusion, a lie. Or perhaps  all our lives are illusions, but the True Man is the one who figures it out and seeks a deeper truth. In its essence the point is very similar to the one The Matrix made; The Truman Show is a fascinating trip through Plato's Cave, and while it takes a rather simplistic look at Plato's philosophy  because any other way would be impossible in a film of less than two hours  it doesn't dumb it down. The Truman Show is a deep and intricate film that deserves repeated viewing and gets better with time, and can be discussed for hours.Writer Andrew Niccol  who made his breakthrough debut one year before with the critically acclaimed cult favorite Gattaca  lost the Oscar that year to the Academy's favorite Shakespeare In Love, and director Peter Weir got most of the credit for the film; but while it's certainly an important achievement for Weir and the best film of his long career, it's Niccol's sarcastic, intelligent, innovative script that made The Truman Show great; that, and the amazing performance by Jim Carrey, who showed his fantastic dramatic skills here for the first time. Carrey is enchanting in the lead role as the ultimate everyman Truman, and we're as fascinated with him as the show's fans in the film. Praise should also go to Ed Harris, who plays Christof, creator and director of The Truman Show (and again, special attention should be given to the character's name)  and also to Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich, Natasha McElhone, Harry Shearer, Peter Krause, Paul Giamatti and the rest of the wonderful supporting cast, both in Truman's world of Seahavan and in Christof's 'real' world. Finally, a word of praise for the excellent musical score, composed by Burkhard von Dallwitz and the great Philip Glass, which compliments the film's atmosphere to perfection.The Truman Show is not an easy movie to absorb; it's a disturbing tale and a disturbing message, which takes some time to seep in, and while it's entirely unconvincing as a reality and even as sci-fi, and feels more like a metaphor than a story of a specific man, it's also entirely involving and demands to be taken at face value. Truman's character is irresistibly charming, and just like the people watching The Truman Show, we believe in him and identify with him completely. The beauty of The Truman Show is that it's lots of fun; it proves that entertainment and art are not necessarily opposing ideals. By being entirely entertaining and gripping, it gets its messages across a whole lot better.The Truman Show is now eight years old: the way I see it, once a decade has passed, a film can begins to be considered a classic. The Truman Show will pass that test. In any possible aspect, The Truman Show is one of the absolute best films of the 90's, and one that will remain relevant long after reality TV has bitten the dust.",10,16,21,30 March 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A classic tale of heroism, of magic and revenge
","Before there was a trilogy, before there were prequels, before there was an expanded universe with hundreds of books, comics and video games, before Greedo shot first and before Jar Jar Bink was a speck of light in George Lucas' eye, there was Star Wars. Even if it's not the best film in the series (it's not), Star Wars deserves its own place in the history of cinema, as a work that changed Hollywood forever. It brought back the grandness of the epic cinema of the 30's and 40's and multiplied it, creating a new era of spectacle and excitement.Unlike the rest of the films, there's absolutely no need for an expanded universe or a complete saga to appreciate the original Star Wars by its own right. It's a complete tale, a classic saga that takes its queues from historical epics, samurai films and serials, and contains every aspect of the timeless hero's journey. The fact that it takes place 'in a galaxy far, far away' is trivial - though it did help the film have a bigger impact.Star Wars has very little to do with science fiction; not much of the science in it makes any sense, it might as well be magic. But that's what made it so powerful, and what made the prequels - that tried to explain everything away - so disappointing. Luke Skywalker's story is a classic story of the simple farm-boy who leaves his home and becomes a hero, and for that reason exactly it's timeless, and resonates with audiences even now.Now go see The Empire Strikes Back.",9,7,10,24 September 2011
50_50," Sweet
","50/50 falls very neatly into the very definition of 'dramedy' - as the title suggests, it's a 50/50 split between the two. That's not to say that it isn't, in its heart, very much a drama; the poster and tagline that suggest a buddy comedy starring Seth Rogen should not be trusted. But it refuses to ever delve into kitsch or soap-operatic melodrama; it tackles a difficult subject with maturity, subtlety and yes, a sense of humor. It's lighthearted, but never tasteless. And it's this combination that makes it so realistic, so lovable and so easy to relate to. It's never too depressing or bleak, but it's also not unrealistically optimistic; and being a positive, honest film about terminal disease, it feels very refreshing indeed.Cinematically there's nothing very special about it. The editing and cinematography are actually very good; but just in a way that makes the film easy on the eyes and easy to connect to. Just like Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance, which is naturalistic and very strong but also subtle and quiet - which is maybe why he was snubbed so badly during award season. The supporting cast, too, are all deserving of praise - Seth Rogen (clowning around as always, but also a surprisingly realistic and compelling character), Anjelica Huston, Serge Houde, Bryce Dallas Howard, Anna Kendrick, Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer all deliver beautifully - but all their performances are toned down, they don't deliver any poignant monologues or soliloquies. They're all just believable and real human beings with flaws as well as virtues.All this makes 50/50 a film that may not leave a striking impression, but will stay with you in its spirit and its humanity - which may just be the point. It doesn't strive to be a great film, just a very good one, that diffuses some of the melodrama usually affiliated with a subject like cancer, and presents it much closer to what it would play like in reality - a part of life, one that hopefully one wouldn't have to experience, but a part of it nonetheless. It won't make any top 50 lists, nor should it, but it should be watched by everyone.",8,0,0,28 August 2012
Easy A," Calling John Hughes
","A nice little high-school comedy, refreshing in its depiction of teenage life that is much more honest and realistic than most genre movies made in the last decade; it's attitude of realism combined with craziness is remarkably similar to that of John Hughes' movies and indeed Easy A is a clear (stated) homage to them. It's not by any means a cinematic creation of importance - some good performances and a witty intelligent script but not much in terms of craftsmanship - but it's solid entertainment and it may be an effective generation-bridge between parents who were teenagers in the 80's and their own teenage children, one that's not nearly as embarrassing for inter-generation watch as most recent teenage rom-coms are.",7,0,0,23 September 2011
Sin City," Style Over Substance
","Probably no other film deserves the title 'comic book movie' more than Sin City, though it has no men in tights and capes. It adapts Frank Miller's classic pulp stories lovingly and faithfully, to the point of using the comics themselves as a storyboard, often recreating frames down to the smallest details. More impressively, though, it manages to maintain the original atmosphere, and to create a total 'comics' feel despite the fact that it plays within a genre usually associated with film.It needs to be said that Sin City is, to all intents and purposes, trash. It's stupid, it's violent, it's sexist, it has all its plot devices deeply rooted in the clichés of film noir and crime pulps. It's a classic case of style over substance - but with so much style, it really doesn't matter. Back in 2005 Sin City's stylish use of CGI was revolutionary, in that it used it to create a unique look rather than try imitate reality or even surreality; and it still stands out today as one of the most beautiful films ever made, where every single frame is a work of art. But in contrast with the other two Frank Miller-involved movies - 300 and The Spirit, both of them gorgeous as well - Sin City isn't just a series of pretty pictures, it excels also in perfect pacing, that makes sure the viewer is excited, pumped up and glued to the screen constantly. In fact, it's one of the best action movies seen in the 2000's, one which has its roots in the true classics of the genre rather than the modern Michael Bay-induced plague of slow motion, explosions and jittery camera.Sin City is a must watch for cinema lovers and design enthusiasts. It shouldn't be taken too seriously - anyone raging about the movie being predictable or unoriginal isn't really saying much. It's all about visuals and style, and as such it's one of the most amazing and unique films ever made.",10,0,1,13 November 2011
Slumdog Millionaire," Award bait
","Slumdog Millionaire is a stunning feast for all the senses, in the finest Bollywood tradition. It's so stunning that it can easily make you miss the fact that underneath it's empty, and none of the characters hold any real depth or interest. Why is it that Tarantino would never get this many Oscars for directing a similar tribute to cinema from Hong Kong or China? It's definitely an impressive piece of cinema, and Boyle's most accomplished visual work, but as storytelling goes it's a decent effort, no more, and definitely not the masterpiece it's made out to be. It's a film made for the sole purpose of winning awards.",5,2,3,26 September 2011
The Social Network," A document of our times
","The subject matter really isn't as interesting as the film makes it out to be - the story of Facebook is a pretty standard one in the world of internet entrepreneurship, and in the long run, I suspect, will not be more than a historical footnote, which is of course the risk you take when making a movie about current or recent events. The film itself, though, is masterfully done, extremely fast-paced without ever losing the audience's attention, and skillfully avoids dozens of very expected clichés, making it, to all purposes, the first solid mainstream work from David Fincher. We may have lost Fincher the angsty bad boy forever, but we may have a new Spielberg on our hands.",8,0,1,23 September 2011
Beetlejuice," Remains one of my favorites
","Re-watching Beetlejuice more than a decade after it thrilled, frightened and enthralled me as a child makes me sad about Mr. Tim Burton's transformation into a Hollywood favorite semi-quirky remake-director (Planet Of The Apes, Sleepy Hollow) in recent years (Big Fish indeed signals a hopeful recovery - if only Charlie And The Chocolate Factory doesn't spoil it...!) At the young age of thirty, and in only his second full length feature, Burton created a cult favorite that is one for the ages. In this bizarre, off-beat script by Michael McDowell (who collaborated with him before on an episode of the 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents' television series) he found the ideal vehicle for his unique and strange imagination - and indeed, Burton's unique vision is more apparent here than in any of his movies, The Nightmare Before Christmas being the happy exception. Though it's true that it's not as personal a creation as 'Nightmare' or Edward Scissorhands, this is the movie that would place Burton on the map as a major director, and would earn him his breakthrough job - directing the first Batman feature film. It is on Beetlejuice that he would also start several long-time collaborations with actors who would work with him again in the future - Michael Keaton (Batman & Batman Returns), Winona Ryder (Edward Scissorhands), Jeffrey Jones (Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow), Glenn Shadix and Catherine O'Hara (both of whom did voice-overs for Nightmare Before Christmas). So, again, while Beetlejuice isn't as deep and personal film as we would see in Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood or Big Fish, Beetlejuice is an incredibly imaginative and captivating film and is a perfect black comedy. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin are both more than adequate, but Michael Keaton in the title part is of course the real star of the show - although in reality his part is much smaller than those of Davis and Baldwin. Keaton is electric and mesmerizing as the bio-exorcist or 'the Ghost with the Most', Beetlejuice (spelled BETELGEUSE!), probably the greatest and most memorable performance of his career (with the possible exception of the part of Batman). Keaton really let loose in Beetlejuice, and he and Burton were seemingly having a blast - they created one of the most memorable horror and comedy characters on the big screen. Seventeen year old Winona is also terrific as Goth-girl Lydia, fascinated and repulsed by Betelgeuse's extreme personality. Similarities between her character here and the one in Edward Scissorhands are easy to find, but for my money her performance as Lydia is the better one.And in conclusion, if there's any movie that I'd recommend to own on VCR or DVD, it's Beetlejuice; because Burton at his best made films that are well rewarding in repeated viewing, and Beetlejuice is Burton at his very, very best, even if it's not his best film. So even if it's not an essential masterpiece like Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice is one of the classic cult films of all time, and I can't imagine going through life without it - that is, if you have the tiniest bit of a sense of fun and humor.",9,1,3,24 May 2005
Up in the Air," Forgettable
","Why was Up in the Air so widely acclaimed by critics and award ceremonies? It's the kind of movie that's so over-hyped that it makes me want to give it a lower score than it deserves. Because the fact is it's not a bad movie - it's just a decent one. I have nothing against Jason Reitman or his filmmaking style, but both Juno and Thank You For Smoking - flawed though they were - had freshness and originality that this one doesn't have. Reitman drew brilliant and surprising performances from Ellen Page and Aaron Eckhart; in Up in the Air, George Clooney plays the most stereotypically Clooney-ish character imaginable, and charming though he is, he doesn't seem to be putting enough effort into this. The writing is witty, the production is slick and the soundtrack is fantastic, but other than that it's a very mundane piece of cinema.",6,2,3,23 September 2011
The Godfather," Perfect
","It's a difficult word to cope with. It's a word that I try to toss around as little as possible. But there's just no other word. The Godfather isn't necessarily my favorite film of all time, it's not necessarily the best film of all time, but it's just that: perfect.Very few films can make this claim; very few films work on every possible level, on every aspect of the art of cinema, with every line and every shot perfectly placed, none wasted, none too fast, none too slow. The Godfather is a film that takes its time, sometimes moving slowly, but never so slowly that it loses momentum; it's a film that's incredibly rich and full of emotion and symbolism, but it's also very entertaining.In the music - Nino Rota's score compliments every scene its in, immerses the viewer, never distracting but always a part of the atmosphere, so that whenever you'll hear it a scene from the film will immediately come to mind.In the editing - it can be very simple at times, and very intense at others - like the baptism scene near the end. It can be slow and tense, it can be calm and euphoric, and it can also be bloody violent.In the cinematography - the lighting is never coincidental, always complimenting the mood of the scene, the coloring always expressive and always of importance.In the acting, of course - The Godfather boasts a supergroup of actors, and almost all of them pull their most impressive performance here - Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton... this is to the credit of Francis Ford Coppola who drove the actors to these performances as much as the actors themselves.There is no film better than The Godfather. There may be films that are more complex, more original - The Godfather's tale, beneath the complexity of dozens of characters, is a simple story of family, honesty, morality, loyalty and family... most of all family. Even Part II can be seen as more sophisticated than the first film - but it's not 'better', because unlike The Godfather, Part II has flaws, small as they may be.If you love movies - watch The Godfather. Whether or not you're interested in crime fiction, watch it. If you just want a good piece of entertainment, watch it too. It's a rare accomplishment - it's a film of quality that may be equaled, but can never be surpassed.",10,2,5,27 September 2011
