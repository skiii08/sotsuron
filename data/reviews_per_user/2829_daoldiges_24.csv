The King's Speech," His Speech Kept My Attention
","The King's Speech is well made and is full of solid performances. The timing of the King's ascension to the thrown coinciding with the war does add interest to the story. The two males leads play well off of one another, which is the glue that makes this film work. It held my interest but otherwise not what I felt compelling.",7,0,0,23 June 2018
The Lobster," Interesting To A Point
","I'm not familiar with the director's other works but based on a solid cast and some good reviews I thought I'd give The Lobster a look. It definitely starts off strong and once the premise was revealed I was very curious to see how it would further develop. It certainly looks good and is visually attractive and interesting. The performance are all solid as well. The manner in which the film spoofs, satirizes, and questions modern relationships and our increasingly technical/machine/impersonal modes of communication was often times funny and thought-provoking. However, after about a third of the way into this story, I found it to grow a little thin and beginning to lose focus. It never really regained its sure footing and ends with more of a whimper than a bang.",6,0,1,31 December 2018
Lifeboat," Humankind in a Lifeboat
","While Hitchcock and his films seem to be endlessly referenced, Lifeboat is very seldom ever a part of those conversations. After seeing this film I'm still not sure why that is. Its unique setting, entirely aboard a lifeboat adrift at sea, is quite successful. The script is interesting and brisk, the acting good, and while some of the characters hint at stereotype, overall there is real suspense, wit, and humor represented here and its also quite entertaining. Worth checking out for Hitchcock fans and non-fans alike.",8,0,0,16 June 2018
In Bruges," Unexpectedly, Oddly Interesting
","I knew nothing about In Bruges except that it takes place in Bruges, Belgium, and yet I was completely surprised by it. 10 minutes in and I was beginning to get the sense that I was not going to like this film much. It took a while longer but slowly I was drawn into the story and started to care a little bit about the characters. A few more story twists later and I was engaged, and before I knew it the film had finished. There are quite a few problems with In Bruges but despite all of them I actually I did enjoy it. It's humor is often times dark (which a lot of folks don't get/like in general) some of the scenes are contrived, and there's quite a bit of killing for a film that is in large part a comedy. So if you're the type of person open to all of those elements in the same film, see it, if you're not one of those folks then stay away.",7,0,0,23 June 2018
A Star Is Born," Gaga is Good But This Film Lets Her Down
","Even though it's her first time acting, Lady Gaga did a very nice job with the material she had to work with. Unfortunately, the weak script - poor character development most prominently, rendered the story muted and not as emotionally engaging as the director (Cooper) or the writers had hoped for. Yes, the story is a familiar one but the very start of the film did show promise and a fresh handling of a story we've seen before, but shortly thereafter the weaknesses start to creep in and everyone in my group left the theater underwhelmed and disappointed.",6,0,3,4 February 2019
Train to Busan," A Fresh Zombie Film
","I didn't know what to expect from a Korean film taking on the zombie genre, a genre that I'd only ever seen from American directors and studios. I really enjoyed this film. It was a very dense film in that there was a tension, emotion, intent, and forward movement at every moment in the film. There was not really any down time, which is what I'm looking for in a thriller. I really liked the lead actor and empathized with him throughout and consider this a film worth seeing even if you're not necessarily a fan of American zombie productions.",8,6,13,21 May 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Broadly Drawn Drama
","In general I enjoyed Three Billboards but do have several reservations preventing me from enjoying it more than I did. On the plus side the basic story is interesting and most of the performances are really good. On the down side several of the characters are drawn a bit too broadly to make them and their actions completely credible. And while the basic story is interesting it relies too much on coincidence, which undercuts the viewers involvement. Like I said, on one level I did enjoy Three Billboard, but not enough to enthusiastically recommend.",7,0,0,19 June 2018
Cold Mountain," Hit All The Rights Noyes
","There are so many things to enjoy and appreciate about this film. The epic historical/love story, the score, the cinematography, the broad and unique cast of characters, and wonderful performances all-around made for a very impactful film experience for me. It's not that I didn't like Nicole Kidman, it's just that prior to her work here I always thought of her as overpraised. That all changed with her performance here. It wasn't only the delivery of her lines but she also brought an intense, genuine, and robust physicality to the character that blazed with power and intensity. Jude Law and Renee Zellweger played opposite characters, one barely spoke at all (Law) and the other wouldn't stop talking (Zellweger), but both were just right here. The score, which was a combination of newly written music along with traditional American folk music and was very emotive and greatly enhanced the story. All of the supporting characters too were also very unique and memorable. Many things happen throughout this epic story of love and war, side stories and side characters, all of which vibrated with emotion and tension. I encourage you to check out Cold Mountain for yourself.",10,1,2,4 June 2018
Doctor Zhivago," Zhivago is Flawed and Magnificent
","I saw the film first which spurred me to read the novel. I enjoyed both of them for different reasons, one being that the stories are a bit different from one another. The film puts more emphasis on the love story between Zhivago and Laura, which I am in no way faulting it for. This is truly a grand film created on an epic scale and viewing it one can really feel the brutal Russian winter (yes, I realize much of it was film in Spain but only because the Soviet Union would not allow them to work in Russia) which to me makes this all the more impressive visually. Sharif, Christie, Tom Courtney, and in particular Steiger all give great performances which immensely contributes to the power of this film. The war and revolution are beautifully and effectively rendered. Maurice Jarre's score is excellent and memorable, but the musical leitmotif was greatly over-utilized to the overall detriment of the production. I encourage everyone with a genuine interest in the film to seek it out on the big screen the way it needs to be experienced to be fully appreciated, and that applies to those of you who have already seen it on the small screen and enjoyed it.",9,0,0,16 June 2018
Edward Scissorhands," I Gave In and Am Happy About It
","For some reason I quickly developed a resistance to seeing Edward Scissorhands upon its original release. Tim Burton and Johnny Depp working together again, it just held no interest for me. So all these years later I decided I needed to finally check it out and am very happy I did. Far from perfect there is still a lot to enjoy about this film: Danny Elfman's score is magical and moving, Johnny Depp is actually quite good, and Diane Wiest in fantastic. The sets, costumes, and overall look is fun and interesting. Yes, this film touched many emotions, it's funny, sad, and moving altogether. If you're like me and resisted seeing this film I suggest you check it out, you might be as pleasantly surprised as I was.",8,1,1,17 July 2018
Jackie," Jackie-O In Mourning
","I was curious to see this film as I love history and do find the Kennedy story interesting. This film was in many respects interest - mostly because it surprised me and did not give me what I was expecting. The time-frame is very brief, just the week or so following the assassination. Jackie was portrayed as a rather vain, course, and defensive person who smokes and drinks a lot, all of which could be due to the recent circumstances in her life. Portman's performance was also interesting in that she didn't treat the role with awe and gave it to us straight, which I appreciate. I actually really enjoyed the score quite a bit, but didn't think it was a great match for this specific project. Like I said, it was interesting but as a whole a little disappointing. This is the part in a film review of this type where I would usually mention that only if you're a big Jackie fan should you take the time to see this film. However, I will change that to read that if you're a real Jackie fan you probably shouldn't see this film because it does not portray her in the elevated, glamorous light so many want to think of her in, and you will likely be disappointed. Please don't hold your imaginary, fantasy ideas of what you want this person to be against this film and it's participants.",6,0,0,24 May 2018
The Duchess," Lovely Sights & Sounds But . . .
","The sights and sounds of The Duchess are considerable - Rachel Portman's score is beautifully lyrical, emotive, and lingering. The ancient city of Bath and English countryside are beautifully photographed, as is the entire film. It was a wonderful feast for the senses, including the costumes and overall fine performances. Unfortunately these are not supported by the story. The real Georgiana was a dynamic individual very active in the social and political movements of the day, yet here we are provided merely with a cliched and predictable lightweight romantic melodrama. This quality cast is capable of so much more, and yet we're given mostly style but no substance, which really undercuts our ability to empathize with, and feel for the Duchess. Overall this film was lovely to look at but disappointing in its lack of scope.",6,2,2,28 May 2018
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Old World Charm Never Goes Out of Fashion
","I've found that amongst movie-goers Wes Anderson seems to be a bit polarizing. I'm one of those folks that falls somewhere in the middle regarding his work. I had modest expectations for The Grand Budapest Hotel but have to say I enjoyed it immensely. All of the performances are good and all of the characters are so unique and interesting. Each of them is unique in a way that for me was real and believable, and therefor someone I could relate to. In particular I found the Lobby Boy and his loyalty to the Fiennes character very endearing. Visually it was continually interesting and the hotel, along with the decor, and mannerisms of this film did have an elegant, reserved, old-world feel to it, which added a new dimension to my enjoyment.",8,1,2,23 June 2018
Revolutionary Road," What Happened to the Revolution?
","Revolutionary Road really is a road, and it's where the two main characters, a married Leonardo DeCaprio and Kate Winslet, have purchased their first home from realtor Kathy Bates to raise their two children. It's in CT and Leonardo's character commutes into the city every day to a job he doesn't like and comes homes each night to Kate Winslet who is an unfulfilled actress. They're unhappy with their lives and devise a plan to suddenly move to Paris, thinking that is what they need to feel happy. Things don't go quite as planned though. I liked all of the performances and this film looked good too. Unfortunately the characters were somewhat flat and one dimensional. There is a lot of emotion put forth by the characters but as a viewer it's not really felt, only on display. I think there was a lot og good elements here but for me they don;t really add up to a satisfying experience.",6,0,0,31 May 2018
Lawrence of Arabia," Grand and Intimate Epic
","For some unknown reason I've always had an attraction to this film and it's enigmatic lead character. Which is why I went all through my high school and college years refusing to see it on the small screen in the hopes that I would someday have the chance to see it on the big screen. I was about to give up when in 1987 they released the 25th anniversary edition. Boy, am I glad I waited. I was not disappointed and this film was even more than I'd imagined it to be, which is super tough considering I'd been building it up in my mind for almost 15 years. The story, score, costumes, performances and most significantly Lean's deft and inspired direction all held me captivated from beginning to end. I'd read several biographies of T.E. Lawrence, and was this film a wholly accurate depiction of him and the events during the Arab campaign, not exactly. Then again it's a dramatic film inspired by Lawrence and not a documentary, which is why I take issue with those who complain that the film is not a detail by detail account and I remind myself that for every film inspired by either a real person or book that there will always be those hold-outs who refuse to allow themselves to fully enjoy art for arts sake. Oh well, their loss. As for me and anyone else reading this review I cannot recommend this film enough, and if possible see it on the big screen to fully appreciate it. I am an admirer of Lean's work but do want to add that I actually appreciate the full theatrical release quite a bit more than the special director's cut release.",10,5,7,12 June 2018
Velvet Goldmine," Costumes Substituted For Story
","Director Todd Haynes has a tendency to substitute costumes and a strong visual style for story, and he does so again here with Velvet Goldmine. True, the look of a film can itself tell a story, and enhance an already existing story, but here it does not communicate enough to make up for a weak and thin script. Despite all the sparkles, feathers, music and strong performances, Velvet Goldmine disappoints.",5,1,2,31 December 2018
A Quiet Place," Good Cast
","The cast and it's performances were the best part of this film that while it did contain moments of surprise and fright, was also marked by obvious devices and odd story twists injected just to serve the story line.",7,2,5,16 May 2018
Call Me by Your Name," I was really moved by this film
","I wasn't sure what to expect from this film as I'd never seen any of the director's previous films, but I have to say I was emotionally blown-away. All of the performances were really solid, in particular the lead character played by Timothy Chalamet was a truly unforgettable performance which will stay with for a very long time, perhaps forever.The story is often over-simplified to one of love/lust between the two male leads but there is so much more to it that that. It's about self-doubt, self-discovery, self-identity and how those are all wrapped up in those around us and how those we care about view us. The setting and world this film creates is like a wonderful, sun-drench postcard come to life in the best way possible. It's a complex story beautifully expressed in this film which I consider necessary viewing.",10,7,13,16 May 2018
Singin' in the Rain," Singing and Dancing Gem
","This movie shows the story of the film industry as it transitions from the silent era to that of talking films and shows the fears and difficulties for those crafts people going through that process. The Singin' in the Rain sequence with Gene Kelly really is a bit of magic that never fails to delight. Most of the other musical numbers were also quite good. I also like the story as well. I will say that the acting does have that kind of one-dimensional cheerfulness so prevalent amongst movie musicals of this era, but despite that I still find this film quite enjoyable.",8,1,1,7 June 2018
La La Land," La La Nice
","I appreciate the freshness and daring of the modern day musical and thought both Emma and Ryan gave solid performances. Their singing and dancing were fine, the story somewhat familiar yet still held my interest. There were times that I felt like I was observing this film rather than actually being absorbed in it though. Nice but also not particularly memorable.",7,1,1,23 May 2018
The Shape of Water," Visually interesting but highly predictable
","I've enjoyed much of this director's previous work and like those, I found this film to be visually sumptuous and endlessly interesting to look at. Unfortunately though, the story was very predictable, the characters cookie-cutter and ultimately did not match up to the visual delights on offer. Unless you're a serious fan of the director I would not consider this essential viewing.",6,4,7,16 May 2018
Before Sunrise," BEFORE Sunrise Please
","I'd both read and heard some really positive reviews of Before Sunrise and was looking forward to it. In large part I also feel there are some special elements to this film - the idea of meeting and being captivated by a stranger on a train and spending one magical, impactful night together, some really thoughtful and interesting dialogue, and an honesty of expression between the two main characters, all good and appreciated. However, I do have one major issue with this film, that it didn't know when to end. Unlike the two lead characters who at the films conclusion know not to force anything or attempt to take things too far, the director unfortunately extend things beyond their natural reaches to the film detriment. I sincerely think that with some prudent editing down this film could have been much stronger. I'm happy for those reviewers that were touched by this film and hold it in such high regard, sadly I am not one of them.",6,3,3,12 June 2018
300," High in Style, Low in Everything Else
","As usual I did no research and read no reviews before seeing 300, and so went into it with few expectations. For the first few minutes I wasn't quite sure what I was watching. It wasn't 'animation' but then again it didn't look like regular film, it was definitely enhanced and manipulated to give it an appearance unlike anything I'd seen before. I was curious to see more. However, after I'd adapted to these new visuals I was more available to focus on the story, script, and what was actually going on. That's where the trouble began. This film seems to be stuck in one gear - very high. Every scene was like yet another climax. It was unrelenting and before soon lost it's impact and power to excite. Also, the script wasn't so much dialogue as much as it was profound statements, rally cries, epic speeches meant to inspire and awe, and that was basically it. It seems this film was meant to awe and inspire the audience through its visuals only, but for me I need a supporting story and characters who, love them or hate them, I need to feel something for them. 300 is interesting to look at, but has nothing else going for it.",4,1,4,24 June 2018
Moon," Moon Is Interesting
","The guys from Filmspotting mentioned Moon the other day, prompting me to want to check in out for myself. I'm not what you would call a hard core Sci-Fi fan, although I do really enjoy it. I also recognized many ideas and concepts that I'd seen in other films, and yes some of the story was not really plausible, but despite these I did enjoy Moon, and I think it's because of the unique and fresh way it was all put together. This one solo person out there on this three year mission confronting all of this alone I found it easy to put myself in his shoes and because of that I found Moon entertaining.",7,0,1,20 July 2018
