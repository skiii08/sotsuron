Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Brilliant effects don't mask bad dialogue, story, acting
","Amazing vision is what we expect from George Lucas, and he doesn't disappoint. Yet if this man would just spend a few trivial dollars AWAY from the cinematography, he could get his dialogue rewritten to be, well, acceptable.I'm a fan of 'Star Wars', and a huge fan of 'The Empire Strikes Back', but I didn't like 'Return of the Jedi'. This new 'old' chapter in the story contains many of the problems that 'Return of the Jedi' did: its dialogue is wooden, the actors are not given proper direction, and there is no continuity to the story.Yet these are not the biggest problems. The biggest problem is that we basically don't know the characters. Is there anyone who didn't know, 20 minutes into 'Star Wars', who Luke Skywalker was and wanted to be? Yet in this movie, we never learned anything about the motivations of Qui-Gon Jinn, Darth Maul, Obi-Wan Kenobi, or, most importantly, Anakin Skywalker (although he was SLIGHTLY more developed).We're supposed to like Anakin because he's a kid and he's a slave and he's amazing. We're supposed to like Qui-Gon Jinn because he's a Jedi and because he likes Anakin. We're supposed to hate Darth Maul, but the only reason I can figure that out is because he's, well, ugly. That's not character development.If so much time in this movie wasn't devoted to Jar Jar Binks, a most annoying, wretched character, there would have been plenty of time to develop everyone else's character. This, more than anything, spoiled the movie for me.Yet, I'm glad to have seen it. It was a stunning vision and contained the best Jedi battle of all the movies to date. An unbelievable pod race sequence was brilliantly done. The effects were, of course, peerless.But George, next time you do a movie, have your dialogue ghost-written and leave Jar Jar on the cutting room floor: Meesa  find Jar Jar very bad, very bom-bad. And stop playing to the kiddie audience: that's not how 'Star Wars' attracted viewers!",5,0,1,3 June 1999
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," The gaping hole (spoilers within)
","Don't read this if you don't want a spoiler. Just one, but it's a big part of the film. It's last, prefaced by asterisks, just in case you're intrepid.I have a rule about 'classic' movies. If a movie is to be considered a classic, it must hold up to repeated viewings. I've seen 'E.T.' now probably about 6 times, but 4 of those times were at the urging of family members. The last time, of course, was for the newly-released 20th anniversary edition.I first saw this movie in 1982 and I liked it OK. I was moved by the story and I felt that the adults in the story didn't all look like idiots, and that the kids weren't made out to be extremely precocious geniuses. Of course, I was only 18 years old then.I saw it again, a few weeks later, on a date. It paled massively on the second viewing. I wasn't looking for flaws, but I felt like I could see every string Spielberg was pulling. Furthermore, I was unhappy about how hard he was trying to manipulate me. Below in the 'HERE'S THE SPOILER' section is what I saw the second time.And now, the gaping hole. E.T. is shown to have powers of telekinesis, healing, and intelligence. He can touch-heal a cut finger, bring dead plants to life, fly several bikes through the air and craft an interstellar communicator out of a saw blade and a Speak-n-Spell. I just can't see how a weak, slow-waddling creature with less manual dexterity than a raccoon could ever achieve interstellar flight. He certainly seemed much less intelligent when he was snarfing Earth food and drink left and right. Smart enough to build an ansible from toys, too dumb to fear food from another planet. Go figure.
*************** HERE'S THE SPOILER *******************If you're going to fool movie viewers into thinking something has happened, you shouldn't make it blatantly clear that it HAS happened if you're going to contradict it later. You should leave some room for doubt. When E.T. comes 'back to life',  your manipulated emotions feel ripped off. We saw him die in extreme detail. The movie doctors describe degeneration of the body. We are led to believe that E.T. is dead in every way possible. Then, voila, he's back. Yippee.Sure, you can argue that he's alien and that we don't understand aliens, but to me, that's a cop-out. Spielberg went too far to show death. Bringing E.T. back after going to so much trouble is cheap and soap-opera-like.",5,6,15,25 March 2002
Meet the Parents," Why I can't watch Gomer Pyle
","First things first: I WANTED to see this film. I think Ben Stiller is a hoot and De Niro is an excellent actor who is perfect for this material. De Niro did not disappoint and Stiller was exactly right for his role. Everyone was well-cast.So, then, why did this movie stink?I'll start by saying, I can't watch 'Gomer Pyle, USMC'. It's not that I don't like Jim Nabors; it's just that the show is about how Gomer always does things that are painfully and blatantly obviously STUPID and WRONG. Gomer asks out Sgt. Carter's girlfriend because the Sarge has to work in town and Gomer doesn't want her to feel lonely; then Sarge sees Gomer and goes on the rampage. Well, DUH. Nobody would do anything so stupid unless they really wanted to pursue the girlfriend. It's painful because I see it coming a mile away.Ben Stiller plays the Gomer Pyle role in this film. DeNiro is superb as the suspicious and unapproachable father in the Sergeant Carter mold. Stiller's character does so many things that are so STUPID and WRONG that you wonder how he could have survived to adulthood. I don't want to give anything away, but you and I and everyone else in the world knows that you don't try to 'replace' a highly trained animal with one you found at the pound! Well, DUH! You see everything in this movie coming - a mile away.At least Gomer Pyle was only a half hour long. I kept wanting to get up and leave but several members of my family were along and I couldn't very well leave them there. At least I was treated, at the very end of the film, to a fantastically hilarious airline subplot that really made my wait mostly worthwhile. Every time I am in a situation with obvious airline morons in the future, you know that I'll be thinking, 'Step Off!'4/10 stars, only because the acting was terrific.",4,2,2,27 November 2000
Akira," Different, detailed; but a masterpiece? Not really.
","I've been a big fan of science fiction and fantasy in both literature and cinema for at least 25 years. I love the cutting edge, yet until the year 2000, I had never seen any anime. My anime-loving friends urged me to introduce myself to the genre with either 'Akira' or 'Princess Mononoke' or even 'My Friend Totoro'. Since my friends only had 'Akira' on video, I chose that. I watched this in November 2000, so please forgive me for forgetting the character names.Right away, my viewing frame of mind fell once the English soundtrack came squealing its way through my sound system. What is it about US distributors of Asian movies? Why do they think we want to hear grown women talking in baby imitations? I'd much rather read subtitles and hear the original soundtrack than these peevish, cartoony caricatures.When my friends had hyped the incredibly detailed, fluid animation style that put American animation to shame, I looked forward to seeing it. In fact, every review here seems to glorify the skill and talent of the animators. Although the frames did contain a lot of detailed artistry and a large number of independently animated objects, the movement was jerky as all hell. It was very easy to see where the frames were linked. It was like playing an action game on a PC when it gets overloaded trying to keep up with the game. Disney may be pablum for the masses, but its theatrical releases certainly are a hundred times more smoothly animated than 'Akira'.I had to put the 'viewing experience' aside and concentrate on the plot, theme, and characters. I've done it enough times in the age of VHS rentals, so it was no problem here. I found that the character development for everyone except the protagonist was weak and shallow. I never could understand any motivation for the erratic behavior of the friend. Now, this is more like an American movie than some cutting-edge Asian import.The plot.. well, very poorly explained, especially the last 20 minutes. I think I understood the ending of '2001' better the first time I saw it. I don't want to spoil anything, but there is no explanation for what happens at the end of this movie. Those of you who have seen it will understand... bigger and bigger and bigger... why? Just to be grotesque?Finally, the theme made sense to me. Our world faces great danger from our misunderstanding of technology and humanity's preoccupation with it. We will be our own downfall if we are not careful. Good message, I get it.So, overall, I gave it 4/10. I thought it was sloppy in direction and the story was utterly lacking in interest. Those of you here (and on the video jacket) who compared this film favorably with 'Blade Runner' are, in my opinion, not paying very much attention to 'Blade Runner'. That is a hugely superior film to this.Finally, as to 'My Friend Totoro', I saw it too. It had the same problems with animation jerkiness as this does. Is 'Princess Mononoke' going to let me down too? I'm going to watch the SUBTITLED version of that anime just to get away from those baby voices.",5,35,66,24 April 2001
