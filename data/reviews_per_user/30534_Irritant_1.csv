Alien 3," Better then most people realize.
","Personally, I don't understand why people think that this movie was a disappointment.  I actually enjoyed this more then Aliens, which may shock people, but to me Aliens had too many 'funny' moments in it, and was too 'formulamatic'.  I thought that this movie with it's very bleak atmosphere, and the great looking alien effects, not to mention the tense acting by Charles Dutton and the other prisoners.  You can just feel the sexual tension and borderline criminal feelings of some of the cast towards Ripley. Action, sure the second movie had more action than any, but this was more like the first movie, with excellent pulse pounding chase scenes, and much like the first, you just didn't know where that slimy .. was going to strike next.  Say what you will, but Alien 3 in my book is the second best of the series.",Null,3,4,24 September 1998
