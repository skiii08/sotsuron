The Blair Witch Project," One of the greatest I've seen
","First of all I do have to admit that after I saw it at the movie theatre, I was slightly disapointed. Was there nothing more to it than this? I also heard other people comment on it, saying it wasn't that good. But I couldn't stop thinking about this movie, and the more I thought about it, the more I liked it, and I realized what a brilliant movie this was. I would like to recommend this one to everyone.",10,2,3,22 August 2002
Back to the Future," Great Scott!
","***SPOILERS HERE!***I will comment on the whole trilogy here.These movies, Back to the future 1-3, make up an immensely enjoyable sci-fi comedy trilogy. The story: Marty McFly, an ordinary teenager meet up with his friend Dr. Emmett Brown, to see his latest innovation. It turns out to be a timemachine! Things go wrong, however, and Doc is shot by angry libyan terrorists and Marty flees in the timemachine - and ends up in 1955. After changing the past he realizes that it may have consequences on his own future existence, and so the adventure begins as he tries to restore the past. And he must also find a way to make sure Doc wont get shot in the future! And will he ever make it back home again?In the other two parts, he and Doc travels into the future and the past and back again, they have to make sure the past as well as the future is in order.This is an amazing trilogy. It's not so much of a movie, as it is more like a daydream :) Surely I can't be the only one who used to fantasize about things like time travel when I was a kid? Check this out, this movie has everything:* Marty McFly as the guy we can identify with, with all the trouble with school, love, his helplessly oldfashioned parents, and everyday teenage life.* Dr. Emmett Brown, as the crazy scientist, with his weird gizmos, eccentric ways, a hair in a greater disorder than Einsteins hair, sometimes wearing goggles and a white coat, now and then using his favourite expression 'Great Scott!' :-)* A time machine. A time machine in a DeLorean! Do I have to say more? :) I love it.
That's the story. As you can see, I have absolutely nothing to object. Over to the casting, which couldn't have been done any better than this. Michael J Fox is perfect as Marty McFly, and I can't imagine anyone else in this movie. Michael is perfect in this role. Christopher Lloyd is excellent in the role as Doc Brown. Claudia Wells is doing a great job as Marty's girlfriend, and also Thomas F Wilson is great as the bully Biff Tannen.All in all, this is a movie that all kids - young and old - should watch :) Of course there will be some of you who will not like this movie, but that's how it is. I am sure most of you love it.It's a perfect 10/10.",Null,0,1,14 December 2002
