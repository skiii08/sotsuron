Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not quite the Class of Episode IV-VI, to much animated passages. I missed the charme of the Storm Troops (real men) or the Ewoks.
","I went to 'The Phantom Menace' to see how the story began and therefore I must say, George Lucas did not forget anything important for the following Episodes. But i was disapointed to see that the underwater world on Naboo was an animation which remembered at any point at a computer game called 'Schleichfahrt'(sorry, I don't no the english name)and I preferred that one. And the invasion troops where pure animation too. A film composed in the virtual reality and in this point a very good piece of work. But for a Star Wars Movie 'Episode I' missed relationships as Chewbacca and Han Solo had, emotions as the Ewoks showed and something like the 'humanity' of the storm troops, which means I always could imagine that the stories of Star Wars could become reality in a far away future, but 'Episode I' seems to be virtual reality of our days.",7,0,0,8 September 1999
