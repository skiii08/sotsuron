The Blair Witch Project," Underrated classic
","The Blair Witch Project is not a slasher movie. It is not the next Scream, and therefore will not revolutionise the genre like the aforementioned movie. It is not even the next Alien. What it is a slow-burning chiller that was falsely marketed and thus unleashed onto a mainstream audience whom it never should have been released onto. Many people class this movie as boring. It is true, there is little 'action' in at least the first half of the movie. However, this is not meant to bore the audience but merely get under the character's skins. The great thing about the characters in Blair Witch, is that they are gritty, flawed people. They are not glamorous, sometimes not that likeable, like real life. The writers do not make any attempt for you to like them. This emphasises the fact they are real people and respond in a violent manner to an all-too real siuation.There is practically no gore in this movie. The script is very repetitive- but when does a 20th century young American talk like Macbeth? And the 'acting' lacks dynamics. But these are what make it unforgettable- ultra-realistic, ultra-menacing nitemare inducing in the extreme. This is true guerilla film-making not for the narrow-minded or those with a short attention span.Indulge yourself in this unsightly pleasure. You'll thank me for it.",9,1,2,20 March 2003
The Ring," Fun, scary but silly
","Another day, another Hollywood remake and this time its the turn of a Japanese horror classic on the metaphorical chopping block. Its got a cool concept, it has a cool actress in it (Naomi Watts of Mulholland Drive fame)and a cool trailer. Cool then? Well...Gore Verbinski (sp.?) chooses not to out-gross the audience (a la Halloween H20) and instead works on our deepest fears- that of the unknown. Oh, and a television. Naomi Watts proves she's no flavour of the month with a surprisingly good portrayal of a woman on the edge of a nervous breakdown- again. Also there's the inclusion of everybody's favourite late 90s horror symbol- a scary looking child. Hmmm, I'm wetting my pants.
But honestly, this is a very good scare-'em up. It has you on the edge of your seat throughout and you actually (SHOCK! HORROR!) care about the characters. The only thing that detracts from the film's appeal is the final, silly 30 minutes. I won't give too much away, but the film shifts from horror of the unknown to horror of the surreal. And the audience laughs.Not for your kiddies. It'll stay with you, that's for sure...",Null,0,0,20 May 2003
Memento," Modern classic
","Picture the scene. You wake up with no memory of where you are, what you have done last or who you can trust. The last memory you have is of your wife being raped and stabbed by a mysterious man. This is the interesting premise for Memento, the first truly great film of the 21st century.The film opens with Lenny, holding a Polaroid of a dead man- the person Lenny has just shot for the murder of his wife. The film works backwards from this point giving the audience the discovery of finding out how he got to that conclusion. This unusual narrative device both emulates Lenny's sense of confusion and challenges the audience simultaneously. While the audience is thinking, director Christopher Nolan throws complex ideas at the audience about death, memory and unfailing commitment, which both reflect and contrast with the main character's experiences. By the time the viewer reaches the `beginning' of Lenny's tale we feel mentally drained. Nolan exploits this by throwing up one of the darkest twists in recent memory.Guy Pearce is revelatory as Leonard and instantly exudes an air of charm, desperation and menace to the character. Excellent support comes from Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Ann Moss shocks you to the core as the enigmatic Natalie- easily her best performance on screen to date. The acting is combined with the simple but haunting soundtrack to create a sense of real depth and emotion thrillers rarely provoke.A shocking tale of love, murder and memory loss Memento becomes a classic due to its stunning performances, soundtrack and direction. Flawless.",10,0,3,30 May 2003
The Fifth Element," Seriously mad but strangely compelling
","*Contains possible spoilers*Before you start to think this film is something similar, this is NOT, I repeat NOT the next Bladerunner. It doesn't even try to be. If you only like deep, meaningful films (i.e. David Lynch plus) then this will not be your cup of tea either. Approach it with an open mind (i.e. one with little brain) and enjoy.Milla Jovovich is the supreme being, the fifth element. She has been sent to earth to save humankind from a deathstar like thing of utter evil. However, when she falls into the back of ex-military man's Bruce Willis' cab, he has no idea. Thus the story spirals out of control (in more ways than one) encompassing everything from Chris Rock's deranged radio host to an alien opera singer with stones in her body. This is pure, mad escapism.
Luc Besson's film is mulitcoloured, theatrical, commercial, eccentric, bizarre yet cliched and ever so slightly scary. Its obviously a total mess, but thats what makes it all the more fun. On the one hand, you've got a happy ending, plenty of flesh on display,numerous action sequences and the token black guy but on the other you've got costumes designed by Jean Paul Gautier, a bizarre pop/dance/comedy soundtrack and Ian Holm.A contradiction of a movie, and all the better for it, The Fifth Element is what happens when a Hollywood studio goes European. With a sci-fi twist.",8,0,1,1 April 2003
Full Metal Jacket," Important but flawed war film
","One of Kubrick's last films, Full Metal Jacket is revelatory and frustrating in its look at the much discussed Vietnam war. After such landmarks of war film making such as Apocalypse Now, Platoon and The Deer Hunter all discussing the vietnam war, it begs the question, ten years after the war, do we need another anti-'Nam movie? On the face of it, the answer is a resounding no, and therefore I went into the film with a certain amount of cynicism.Full Metal Jacket tells the story of Private 'Joker' Davis (played by Matthew Modine)through his training to become a 'killing machine' through to the heat of combat. Originally wanting to become a reporter on the action in the war, Joker gets involved with a batallion leading to almost heartbreaking consequences. There is a famous two-part structure to this film; the first part being set at a training facility and the second part in Vietnam. This simplicity that Kubrick employs allows greater character development as the viewer's attention is diverted from getting to grips with a narrative (due to its simplicity) and therefore concentrates on the people. In this respect, it is similar to Platoon, as an everyman's view of the war. However the film is far more thematicallt complex from Oliver Stone's movie due to the more ambiguous shades of good/evil, light/dark throughout the piece.The first part of the film is dominated by R.Lee Emery's foul-mouthed drill instructor giving Kubrick some intensity to play with. Therefore the first section of the movie works brilliantly as the director heaps on satire, humanity and terror. This is helped by Emery's fantastic performance. The second part of the film loses focus but is still strong. The problem with this half is that the two strongest characters (Pyle and Emery's character) do not appear here and thus the film feels formulaic. However the last ten minutes make up for it, with a showdown that rivals Apocalypse Now's final stretch.Kubrick's penultimate movie is not perfect- it drags in the second half, feels a little cliched and unfocused in tone. However it is a film that should be watched- if only because it is brave enough to criticise not just the war but the people in it, too.",Null,0,0,17 June 2003
Armageddon," Not fun, not funny, not good!
","SPOILER WARNINGCould this movie be more formulaiec? The 'characters' ( I use the word loosely) were all so stereotyped, the movie frequently went into parody. Bruce Willis was trying too hard while Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler weren't trying at all. The inclusion of the usually reliable Steve Buscemi was also upsetting, as I'm still wondering what he is doing in a piece of trash like this.The script is cliched, the acting poor and the pacing of the film is all wrong. A disaster movie should slowly build up to some kind of climax- but as this movie is loud and fast all the way through the ending is a bit of a damp squib as it has no where to go. Anyway, even if treated correctly the ending would be poo anyway- they saved the world with extra Americana. I'm thrilled.The emotional sub-plot was obviously tacked on and feels like something out of a second-rate TV movie. Oh, and the movie is painfully unfunny.I only rant to save others from the pain I experienced when watching this movie. AVOID.",Null,0,1,28 January 2003
American Psycho," As confused as the protagonist!
","*Contains some spoilers*This film will divide many audiences (and quite deservedly)but it is definitely a must see, even if you do end up hating it.Patrick Bateman is the epitome of 1980s self-obessession- hes obsessed with his body, his looks, his image... and his business cards. However nobody appears to care- as they are all too self obsessed themselves, even to the point when Patrick says to somebody that he's in to 'murders and executions', without them batting an eyelid. So why does he bother? Well, thats for the audience to decide... and their decision to the answer is a frenetic one. Despite all that I've said, I didn't like this film. I found its messages all too obvious and whiney and the character of Patrick Bateman as more of a self-parody than anything else. But maybe thats the point of the film?
That said, there is much to recommend it, most notably Christian Bale's depiction of nut-job Bateman. He has many good lines throughout the movie, and is as good as any anti-hero you're likely to get in a mainstream Hollywood film like this. Also the scenes with the two prostitutes are hilarious. I especially like the moment, where his idea of pillow talk involves chatting about how Phil Collins made Genesis one of his favourite bands. The conclusion also must be taken with a pinch of salt- although it does seem to be too much like Taxi Driver for my liking (the classic did he or didn't he do it situation).However overall this movie seems like a wasted opportunity- as a satire it seems as shallow and underdeveloped as its central character and not half as much fun. It could have been profound. What it is, as it stands, is so awful its quite good- in a trashy way of course",Null,0,0,28 March 2003
American Beauty," Great movie
","There are very few movies which I've watched and instantly fallen in love with, but this definitely has to be one of them. So why is this movie supposed to be so good? Here's why...Lester Burnham is simply the anithesis of the anti-hero. He is stuck in a dead-end job, receives little support or loving contact through his wife, and his only daughter seems to despise him. However one day he meets his daughter's friend (played by Mira Sorvino) and is instantly transfixed. This sets off a rebellion insider him, encouraging him to quit his job, fantasise about the girl and smoke illicit substances.Not exactly a moral, wholesome two-hour experience then? Well, no but neither was the Godfather but people judge that to be a masterpiece. What it is is superbly acted, wonderfully directed and hugely funny. It has some wonderful one-liners ('There is nothing worse than being ordinary') and possesses real depth. It is a movie that challenges the perception of what you think you are, and how you lead your life, and an analysis of what really makes a person happy.It is also refreshingly dysfunctional and cynical in its attitudes towards the modern-day suburban ideal in middle America. Love it or hate it, you can't help but discuss this movie for weeks to come.",10,0,0,3 December 2002
Pearl Harbor," A disgrace!
","Believe the terrible reviews. This movie sucks more than the latest vacuum cleaner technology and is not even half as much fun. It is also highly offensive cinematically, historically and racially.Cinematically this movie falls on its face from the first shot. Director Michael Bay seems to think we are more interested in the spectacle of the event rather than the people involved. Therefore we get lots of eye-candy but minimal character development. Therefore the actors can't do anything but look the part. Ben Affleck and Josh Harnett are awful in the leading roles, and Kate Beckinsale is nothing more than a one dimensional skirt. What is worse, we are supposed to get an adrenaline rush from watching innocent people die (i.e. the numerous explosions). Bay even has the cheek of showing Pearl Harbour as a US victory, when it was anything but. Racially, this movie uses all the Japanese stereotypes and then some, presenting us with a laughable set of villains. If this is the point, then this movie is even worse. I don't have a problem with films that promise you pure entertainment. I do have a problem with films that try and pass themselves off as profound and sensitive when they are really about making money and brainwashing teenagers into thinking this is how things really are. Its not entertaining, its not clever and its downright pretentious. Pearl Harbour is terrible. Enough said.",Null,0,1,23 March 2003
Saving Private Ryan," Underwhelming
","Not Steven Spielberg's best film by a long shot (ET or Schindler's List anyone?) but certainly his most graphic, Saving Private Ryan is pretty much summed up by its tagline 'The Mission is a Man'. The film is simple, almost to the point of frustration and possibly Spielberg wanted it this way to highlight some of the themes running throughout the film (war is, um... bad). However what it amounts to is poor storytelling. Coming from Spielberg, a man who prides himself for storytelling, this is a disappointment.Tom Hanks plays the everyman, again, as a reluctant schoolteacher wanting to help his country. Matt Damon plays Private Ryan, the young soldier that Hanks and his crew have been sent to find. Beginning with one of the most memorable scenes in recent cinema and ending with one of the most sickeningly sentimental scenes, Private Ryan is an uneven work. What people like about this film is the simple message juxtaposed with, what I guess, brutal violence. Oliver Stone managed this better in Platoon (even the brilliant opening scene in Private Ryan does not compare to the scene in Platoon where the soldiers burn down the Vietnamese village).That said, SVP still features decent performances from Matt Damon and Tom Hanks with excellent support coming from Tom Sizemore and a surprisingly touching performance from Vin Diesel, in a small role as an Italian-American soldier. The direction is also solid as is the script. However mundanity and Spielberg's safety net, sentimentality frequently come into play making this a lesser entry in the war film and the Spielberg cannon.",7,1,2,29 May 2003
The Pianist," Hugely overrated
","I despise the term overrated (partly because of its often use on IMDB) but this movie is the dictionary definition of the term. How did it win those oscars? Why it is in the top 250? I don't know.Polanski's tribute to the holocaust is a largely pedestrian affair that suffers from a lack of style and tautness. The inclusion of many scenes in the movie is mysterious considering the fact they hold little relevance to either the holocaust or the Brody's character's story. The film therefore feels bloated and self-important. Polanski does not treat the subject matter with any opinion or style- and just shows us what happens before casually strolling onto the next scene. Polanski would argue that this is because the subject matter does not need any style or opinion added to it, which is fair enough. However the problem with this is, that it is extremely dull for the audience. The 'powerful' elements of the movie are few and far between, bluntening their impact. Also, towards the middle of the film, there seems to be a genuinely scary lack of substance and we get treated to lots of long shots contrasted with close-ups. What this is supposed to tell us, is also a mystery. While the movie must be commended for its treatment of the subject matter and Adrien Brody's excellent performance, it feels more guided rather than directed. Its casual attitude to the violence seems mundane rather than shocking and there is nothing here that Steven Spielberg didn't do better in Schindler's List. Essentially dull, rather than powerful, only the last 45 minutes make this film memorable. 6/10",6,4,9,24 March 2003
The Game," A flawed masterpiece
","In The Game, Michael Douglas plays a middle-aged, lonely and slightly bored executive. His brother, Sean Penn gives him a token for the ultimate game experience- not just real-time here folks. Beginning with a bizarre clown and ending with a lot of unanswered questions, The Game is certainly a film that you will be talking about for a long time after the slightly suspect conclusion.David Fincher creates a tension-saturated thriller here. The murky visuals of The Game experience and the heady visuals of the Clockwork Orange-like introduction sequence to Douglas' game are striking. Sean Penn gives an excellent, if slightly too eager performance as the brother and Deborah Unger leaves a significant impression as the shady Christine. The film excels from the moment Douglas enters the game's headquarters until about five minutes from the end.This is where the film fails. The joy of a film like this is in receiving a fantastic payoff but this conclusion is far from satisfying. The nature of `the game' is more-or-less revealed at the end, which is fine. However when you realise what has happened it more-or-less spoils the film. The beginning of the movie verges on the dull too, where we are treated to lots of brooding shots of Douglas thinking about his long lost father.
However, ignore the ending and experience the ride there. In this respect, this film is pretty much the best thriller of the 90s.",Null,0,1,30 May 2003
8 Mile," Dull, to be frank
","Eminem's big screen debut is at once revelatory and disappointing. It is revelatory because it shows Eminem to be something other than a controversy baiting ego on legs. It is disappointing because the film wastes an acting talent by divulging in cliched stereotypes and inanity.It is a many used tale. Rabbit (Eminem- in a semi autobiographical role) is an aspiring rapper in Detroit. He is the only white kid in his friendship circle, and the only one who is really talented. The irony here though, is that he cannot show off this talent because he has incredible stage fright. His mother is hardly supportive, being more interested in sleeping with as many men as she can on the block, and Rabbit has no siblings to talk to.
What is so disappointing about this is that it feels so 'safe'. The issue of race and how major a factor it is in rap is never fully explored. The only thing that comes close to it is an incoherent set of ramblings about conformity. The dialogue should be witty and clever but is merely just inane reverting to stereotypical ghetto speak (a lot of '**** this' and '****that'). The acting is also third rate due to the lack of material the performers have to work with. Kim Basinger is merely a sketchy stereotype as the trailer trash mother. What it comes down to, is a set of the emperor's new clothes. It wants to be an involving, emotive drama but what it really is, is a shallow popcorn flick with no soul and no intelligence. Dull, duller, dullest- you'd be better off watching Boyz in the Hood for the umpteenth time- at least it's genuine.",Null,0,0,20 May 2003
Shrek 2," So entertaining it's criminal
","Despite myself, I liked Shrek 2. No, I will rephrase. I LOVED Shrek 2. From the countless film references (everything from The Fabulous Baker Boys to Ghostbusters) to the fleeting appearance of Joan Rivers, this film was a cinematic joy. Move over Disney, there's a new monster in town.Shrek 2 starts where the first one ended. Fiona and Shrek, now a happily married couple (so happy, I'm- ahem- green with envy) decide to meet the in-laws (voiced by Julie Andrews and an always entertaining John Cleese). However, while the parents are coming to terms with the shock of seeing their daughter married to a green giant, a devilish plan is hatched by the Fairy Godmother (British television favourite, Jennifer Saunders) to get rid of Shrek, and force the lovely Fiona to marry Prince Charming (gleefully played by Rupert Everret). With additional voices coming from Antonio Banderas and Eddie Murphy, how could it go wrong?Fourtunately, Shrek 2 never puts a foot wrong. I liked the first Shrek, but was somehow baffled why so many people fell head over heels in love with it. I agree, it was refreshingly different from other summer blockbusters, and all the more entertaining because of that. However, it did not in any way match any of Pixar's computer generated delights. This time, however, Dreamworks have easily managed the above, and manage to take a few catty sideswipes at rival Disney too.The animation and voice acting is superb throughout. Frequently funny, Shrek manages to be suprisingly clever as well, taking digs at Disney, capitalism and infrequently, itself (in a knowingly post-modern way of course). Unlike Pixar's last movie, Finding Nemo, this one has so many highlights it is difficult to choose one to praise so highly. However, if I was pushed, I would go with the Fairy Godmother's rendition of 'Hero'.
In a summer of (so far) lacklustre, banal blockbusters (Van Helsing, Troy, The Day After Tomorrow) it's interesting to see that the most family friendly movies, (this, and Harry Potter's new adventure) are the best. Shrek 2 is criminally entertaining and quite simply, magical.",Null,0,0,28 June 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Film of the year?
","*Possible Spoilers*Well, that remains to be seen. However, Kill Bill may be Quentin Tarantino's finest film to date (and this is coming from somebody who rates Pulp Fiction as one of their all-time favourite films).The plot is minimal, but then it doesn't need to be anything else. Uma Thurman's 'The Bride' wakes up after spending over four years in a coma, caused by a bullet to the head at her wedding. When she wakes, she seeks revenge on the people who robbed her of four years of her life- and possibly- her unborn child. This includes Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu), Californian Mountain Snake (Daryl Hannah), Copperhead (Vivica A. Fox) and eventually (hence the title of the two films)Bill (David Carradine).Many users and critics have stated that to enjoy the movie, a knowledge of martial arts and Japanese cinema is mandatory. True, if you are familliar with these movies, you will stand a better chance of understanding all the stylistic and thematic material on display here. However, I have very little knowledge of the genre Tarantino is paying tribute to, and I thoroughly enjoyed the first volume of Kill Bill.Another key element of the film is the violence. Much has been written about this, including the controversial decision in America, to grant the film an R rating. The violence in Kill Bill is the icing on the cake. The fighting takes place in an alternate plain of reality, a stylised movie world which knows it is a stylised movie world. Quentin is constantly toying with the audience- experimenting with their preconceptions of where the boundary of reality and fiction lie. His deliberately outrageous, cartoonish blood-letting is both a tribute to his favourite movies and his little joke.However, the real joy of Kill Bill is in its pure unadulterated entertainment value. Quentin obliterates the option of boredom through his flawless direction and, as previously mentioned, wonderfully stylised violence. The soundtrack is effortlessly cool and charcteristically offbeat, ranging from Nancy Sinatra to RZA. The use of different media such as black and white, colour and anime make the experience even more complete and memorable.However, when reviewing Kill Bill, it is hard to ignore Uma Thurman's presence. Her performance treads a fine line between reality and the personification of revenge. She epitomises what Quentin is trying to achieve- in so much as she is sex, violence and cool on legs. Whether this is her greatest performance so far, is to be seen (Kill Bill volume two needs to come out, for me to reach this conclusion)but she is damn fine as Black Mamba and QT was wise in delaying filming for her.
It's not deep, profound or original, but Kill Bill Volume one, will be one of the best things you'll see at the movies all year. I was thinking while watching this masterpiece, that having the amount of fun I was having, was almost probably illegal.",Null,0,1,1 November 2003
Mission: Impossible II," Vain, dull sequel
","Despite others slating it as some kind of anti-christ, I enjoyed the first Mission Impossible movie. it was no Terminator 2 in terms of spectacle or adrenalin rush, but it was fun, if slightly familiar trash. So when I heard that there was to be a sequel I was pleased- so trotted off to my local movie emporium to see it. The fact that it had John Woo directing it (whose other big Hollywood movie 'Face Off' was great fun) just added to my expectations. Two hours later I came out of the cinema in silence. It was that bad.The main problem with it is the screenplay. It provides the crew with little sense of either character or substance. The plot is comically contrived and the characters are immediately dislikeable. Woo obviously decided to try and cover the lack of substance in the script with flashy direction. However this highlights the movie's faults even more with a hugely narcissistic opening sequence which makes Tom Cruise appear to be some kind of false idol. What this film reminds me of, is Armageddon, the ill-fated 1998 disaster flick which has inspired so many rants on the imdb. It is shallow, it wastes talent and is extremely monotonous.",4,0,0,3 March 2003
Black Hawk Down," Dullest of the dull
","One of the most overrated films on the imdb (how it scored over six out of ten I do not know) is also one of the most shallow and monotonous. But, hey, it DID come from the same man who produced the worst film of the last few years, Pearl Harbour and the dumbest film of recent memory- Armageddon.Based on a true story of a 1993 mission to topple a dictator, Black Hawk Down is, if anything a vivid depiction of the horrors of war. With one of the best directors around (Ridley Scott)and an all-star cast (Tom Sizemore, Ewan McGregor etc.) how could this fail? The movie really fails from the start as it possesses a dog of a screenplay which does not bother to relate the audience to the characters in the situation (a la Saving Private Ryan)as we never get a chance to get to know them. This would be less of a travesty if the final act of the film didn't need the audience to relate to the characters, but it did. The supposedly poignant ending just comes across as pathetic and cliched. Ewan McGregor is the only one who comes out of the film with their reputation intact as the remainder of the cast come across as wooden and lifeless. Josh Hartnett is a capable actor but after this and Pearl Harbour, his credibility and hireability should really be brought into question.One of the only plus points of the film, is the combination of Scott's direction and the superb cinematography. Visually this film is superb and extremely arresting. The lighting and some of the visual contrasts employed are nothing short of astonishing. However good cinematography does not make a good film and it only emphasises the fact the film is so emotionally and ideologically shallow. Ridley Scott- why?",Null,0,2,29 May 2003
Annie Hall," Superb
","In my book, there are two types of great films. One type is in the class, of say, The Godfather. This type of film is technically maginificent, featuring superb performances, wonderful direction, a riveting story line and is effortlessly entertaining. There is another type of film, the type that Annie Hall fits into. This is the type of film which I call my 'favourite' films. They may not be as technically proficient as 'the Best' films ever made, but there's something to them which make them irresistible.Annie Hall, plotwise, is a pretty typical Woody Allen movie. It is a bittersweet romance between a balding, neurotic comedian (Woody Allen) and a sweet, if somewhat goofy (and younger), lady (Diane Keaton). The film focuses on their relationship from the time they meet taking the audience through some wonderful setpieces on the way. Annie's family is somewhat eccentric, for example, leading to a wonderful (and slightly Deer Hunter-esque) scene with Christopher Walken. The parties she attends are also something new for Alvin (Woody's character) leading to more moments of comic genius (an age old type of comedy- the comedy of manners- with a 1970s spin).Arguably Allen's best film, Annie Hall is immediately accessible to the non-Woody fan. His use of innovative techniques (for the 1970s) can be admired by even the most stern of critics- and used in conjunction with the wonderful performances and some of the funniest one-liners to have graced celluloid, Allen creates his masterpiece. Keaton is superb as Hall, obviously inspiring performances for female comediennes everywhere for years to comes (Phoebe's character from Friends, is a direct homage to Annie Hall). Allen's tried and tested neurosis is wonderfully appealing here melting even the coldest of hearts.In this reviewer's opinion, Annie Hall is one of the finest romcoms ever made, and certainly the most innovative. Even the uncharacteristic (for a romcom) ending feels upbeat and enriching. A film that cries out to be seen, Annie Hall holds a place in my heart- which is more than can be said about some of Allen's most recent work, or some of the pretender's to the throne of Annie Hall.",10,0,0,27 July 2003
Pulp Fiction," Undeniably great cinema
","Lauded by many, hated by others, Pulp Fiction is ambitious, provocative, shocking, funny and breathtaking at the same time (and, as you can see- in the same sentence). It is both a homage to all those 'pulp' works of fiction out there and a fresh look at the crime genre.Quentin Tarantino's second film, Pulp Fiction is a set of three interconnecting tales focusing on sin and redemption. There is the story of the hit man who takes the boss' wife out for the night (with John Travolta as the hit man and Uma Thurman as the wife), a story of a failing boxer (played by Bruce Willis) and a story focusing on Samuel L Jackson's hit man- and his role in a diner stick-up. An eclectic supporting cast (including Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Harvey Keitel and Quentin himself) add to the gritty, blended nature of the film.It is hard to pick out any distinct high or low points in pulp fiction in terms of the filmmaking itself as it is all so well executed. The performances (except with the possible exception of Tarantino) are uniformly nuanced and deep. The dialogue fizzes off the screen and conveys an interesting mix between mundane conversation and character insight. The direction and subsequent cinematography are all realistic yet subtlety stylish (see the diner scene for proof). All the stories and elements are linked together with a superb soundtrack full of undiscovered and well-known 70s songs which highlight the films seediness. Unlike some of the more recent films, this was the deserved winner of the Palm D'Or back when it was released. It is also, definitely contender for best film of the 1990s- and certainly the most fun.",10,1,2,30 May 2003
Platoon," An Oliver Stone film
","The title of my comment really says it all. Oliver Stone is not known for his subtlety, his intelligence as a filmmaker or his writing skills. Such is the tragedy of Platoon.Platoon tells the story of a young, innocent man, Chris (Charlie Sheen) who volunteers for the Vietnam war, to contribute to the country he has taken so much from. Here, he witnesses some terrible atrocities, and falls under the influence of drugs and apathy. There is a good vs. evil conflict in not just the war aspect of the film, but Stone's humanitarian aspect too. Tom Berenger plays the hard-nosed veteran who frequently clashes with Willem Dafoe's protective one. However, this is a war film, and as the bodies pile up- so does the chaos for Chris, both physically and emotionally.Platoon, in a sense, has the same problem as Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, itself a Vietnam movie made in the late 80s, over a decade after the end of the war. Platoon is essentially a film of two parts, but unlike FMJ, the two parts of Platoon do not comply with the narrative. (In FMJ, the training section of the film gave us insight to a part of Vietnam we never saw before- and so therefore the actual fighting, which we had seen before, was a let-down.) The first hour of Platoon is masterful, and proof that Oliver Stone can be coherent and subtle as a director and a writer. The second half of the film however is a total mess. Unlike FMJ, it has not to blame the narrative constraints- but the writing and directing of the film itself. The immediately striking, coherent battle sequences of the first half become muddled and irritating in the second. The emotional impact of the film becomes deadened by over simplicity and the film becomes repetitive with Stone just lurching from one battle to the next.  With Natural Born Killers, Stone used his excessive film making techniques as both self-parody and media commentary, with explosive and shocking results. The miscasting of John C. McGinley doesn't help, as the cowardly comformist and neither does the underuse of Willem Dafoe. That said, the final sequence of the film regains a sense of lost direction and rescues the movie from an otherwise 'A.I.'-like second half slump.
Flawed, frustrating yet mind numbingly tragic, Platoon is a worthy addition to the Vietnam movie pantheon, although hardly the greatest of the Vietnam movies. Watch Stone's 'Born on the fourth of July' instead, for a more satisfying Vietnam experience. Or Apocalypse Now, or The Deer Hunter for the best Vietnam films.",Null,1,3,27 July 2003

I haven't seen the original movie, but if its better than this, I'd be in heaven.Tom Cruise gives a strong performance as the seemingly unstable David, convincing me that he is more than a smile on legs (for only the third time in his career- the other examples were Magnolia and Born on the Fourth of July). Penelope Cruz is slightly lightweight but fills the demands for her role, as does Diaz. The only disappointment is the slightly bland Kurt Russell. In the movie, however, it is not the acting that really impresses- its the filmmaking.Cameron Crowe excels in the director's role, providing himself with a welcome change of pace from his usual schtick. The increasing insanity of the movie is perfectly executed by Crowe (the brief sequence where Cruise walks through an empty Time Square is incredibly effective). The soundtrack (a distinguishing feature of a Crowe movie) is also sublime.
You will be shocked and challenged as a viewer. The plot does seem a little contrived but the issues explored behind it are endlessly discussable. The movie isn't perfect, but its a welcome change of pace for Cruise and Crowe and for those raised on a diet of Hollywood gloss, should be a revelation.",7,0,0,15 March 2003
Identity," Irritating!
","While hardly going to be the worst film released this year, Identity is by no means decent. Starting off with a familiar, if entertaining premise it promises much but ultimately fails as both a horror film and as an excercise in audience manipulation. The casting of Ray Liotta and John Cusack, however, is one of the film's strengths. The slightly eccentric decision pays dividends as some of the best scenes in the film involve confrontations between their two very different characters, allowing thespian sparks to fly. It also allows for the film to add a shade of humanity to its lean 90 minute running time. The rest of the cast is decent, with the possible exception of John C. McGinley who comes across as hammy in his supporting role.Shot in dark, desaturated tones, Identity even looks the part of a good horror film. The use of weather to accentuate moods of the characters is as ever, a reliable device for tension while it also allows the charcters to meet- a nifty if standard plot device. It harks back to the Robert Zemekis film What Lies Beneath in its tribute to Hitchcock- a kind of neo-Hitchcock style, I guess it would be called.However it is due to the unspeakably awful final 30 minutes, that this film comes across as underwhelming. In an age old trick, director Mangold, pulls the rug from the audience's feet leaving  a multitude of seemingly unanswerable questions for them to decipher. Yawn. Instead of coming across as scary, perplexing or even thought-provoking, the final section of the movie is frustrating, uneven and a con. The ending is so anti-climactic and ripped off that you feel like throwing a big brick at the screen and shouting obscenities at the ushers when you leave the multiplex.Identity's first hour is fun, fairly tense, if familiar hokum. Then in act of extreme pretension the film launches into another genre and becomes unintentionally funny and desperate. See it, for the gory deaths and performances. Skip it, if you don;t want your intelligence to be insulted.",Null,0,1,29 June 2003
Gangs of New York," Disappointing
","Multiple nominations from the academy. Star names. A superb director. Gangs of New York a triumph? Certainly not!What begins as an insightful study into the late 1800s New York-style degenerates into a second-rate love story about two people the audience doesn't really care about. There are interesting characters (Bill The Butcher played by Daniel Day-Lewis is not justs one of these, but the best thing in the movie in terms of character and acting), fantastic sets and wonderful costumes but little else. Scorsese's direction is sporadically brilliant, but only sporadically. The different styles he uses in the film come across as messy rather than varied. This can also describe the soundtrack which begins as 'nu-classical' and degenerates into melodramatic. The second half of the movie is also a casue for concern, as it seems to make little sense due to bad continuity, leaden editing and (one suspects) heavy cutting of crucial scenes.As for the violence- it ends up bouncing right off you. This is due to the very poor editing (which also spoils the rest of the film) making the fight sequences dull and unmoving instead of powerful and masterful, like in Raging Bull or even Ridley Scott's Gladiator. All this isn't to say that is a bad film, because it is not. At times it can be brilliant (especially scenes with Daniel Day-Lewis and John C. Reilly- like the hints of corruption at the beginning of the movie) but overall its very inconsistent and doesn't connect with you emotionally. As grand as it is, Gangs of New York, left me cold.",Null,0,0,16 February 2003
Donnie Darko," Spoiler free review of a great film
","Donnie Darko is a high school student who, one day almost randomly, is visited by a giant rabbit called Frank. Frank tells Donnie that the world is going to end in just a little over twenty-eight days. Then Donnie returns to his normal lifeÂ…But the question is, is Donnie Darko little more than another David Lynch wannabe or is it something more profound? Well, initial impressions of the film suggest that this is no more than gimmicky, philosophical posturing (something many people accuse the Matrix movies of being). However if you did deeper as a viewer, bountiful rewards await as Donnie Darko (like the character itself) has more to it than meets the eye. After the slightly detached opening sequence, the first thing that strikes you about the film is Jake Gylenhaal. Even at the film's most conventional (i.e. the dinner table scene near the beginning of the film) he practically leaps off the screen and envelopes you whole with his movie star cred. Forget Colin Farrell (well, maybe) but Jake is the real deal. He brings an arrogance and a vulnerability to Donnie which is never short of touching. He has good support too. Patrick Swayze is the epitome of superficiality as the self-help guru while Drew Barrymore pulls a superior version of her usual doe-eyed performance. Also, something else interesting to note about the film is the use of music. The opening uses music quite efficiently in encapsulating Donnie's character but it's the penultimate scene in the film with the Tears for Fears song `Mad World' that surprises you the most. That scene rates amongst the most heartbreaking of any modern film. I will stop myself there, because I want you to discover it for yourself.If the film did have a flaw, t would be that it often feels like the debut movie it is. Its not that Richard Kelly's writing or direction is pretentious or dull- it just seems a little precious at times. There are some striking elements of the film (like Donnie's form of `real' spirituality versus Swayze's fake version) that scream `film school graduate' due to their simplicity- which does slightly mar an otherwise exceptional piece of work.Not quite the ground-breaker it would like to think it is, Donnie Darko is still one of the most captivating, soulful, ambiguous and thought-provoking (and possibly one of the best??) films of the last few years. And for that, Mr. Kelly- I salute you",Null,0,1,3 June 2003
