Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Definitely Worth Seeing
","As always you cannot rely entirely on what critics say.  TPM is a very good movie with some of the most elaborate special effects in history.  While mid-movie it's a little slow, it builds up fast at the end. It's likely to be a bigger hit with little kids because of the young main character, but adults will enjoy it too.",7,0,0,19 May 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," That's it?!
","I guess you've got to be Tolkien fan to appreciate this movie.  While the SFX were really good, especially the battle with the Orcs in the mines, I found this story hard to like.  It literally 'dead ends' with no clear resolution to this part of the story, although there are two more movies coming along after it.  (At least when 'The Empire Strikes Back' ended there was some sort of ending.)Oh well.  I'll probably see the other two just for the sake of seeing a completed story.  But is this movie by itself a huge hit?  In a word: Nope.",5,1,2,21 January 2002
U-571," Some Truth, Good Submarine Sequences
","While it's true the British actually cracked the German Enigma cipher, American forces did capture a U-boat intact (U-505) during the war.  The U-505's code books and cipher machine were captured by the USS Guadalcanal during 1944.  Some tension ensued following this 'victory' because the American and British high commands were afraid the Germans would learn of the capture and change the code.  Captain Gallery of the Guadalcanal, not being in the ULTRA 'loop', was unaware that the Enigma code had already been broken and therefore didn't realize what damage this could do.  But the Germans believed the sub to be lost with all hands.  Let's have a movie about this.",Null,0,1,5 October 2000
Pearl Harbor," Technical Inaccuracies Abound
","It was just too long for it's own good.  While most people will not notice, being a Pacific war buff I noticed way too many shots of modern destroyers, Aegis cruisers, and modern carriers made up to look like WW II era ships. They should have lopped off 1 hour of this movie and made more CGI shots of historically accurate ships.Other than that, again, it was just too long and the relationships are 'by the book'.  And the scenes of the Japanese flag officers are formulaic at best.Rent 'Tora! Tora! Tora!' to see the drama and character development you won't see in 'Pearl Harbor'.",Null,0,0,16 June 2001
The Butterfly Effect," No Actual Butterflies Were Harmed During Filming
","I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this Kutcher vehicle.  Not being of that generation, and not having seen any of his other movies, I went into this picture with an open mind.Here we have a somewhat new take on the 'time travel' theme.  Instead of a fancy machine, Kutcher uses a sort of telepathy much like Christopher Reeve in 'Somewhere in Time'.  Except in this story ripples in time have dire consequences.I won't spoil the picture by giving away the plot, but if you like time travel stories you'll like this movie.  Who hasn't wanted to go back and change something in their childhood?",Null,0,0,26 January 2004
