Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Love it.
",I'd heard the hype and decided to go in with an open mind. Nothing ever lives up to the hype. Yes it has faults as all film does and I remember some of the same complaints being levelled at the original trilogy. The fact that anakin is a 9 year old innocent just makes his progression to Vader that much more tragic. Plus it expanded the galaxy and the saga of the skwalker clan.At least it wasn't a thinly veiled rip off of a new hope ðŸ˜Š,8,17,24,29 March 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Not terrible, not great either.
","Basically a reboot and utilising bargain basement versions of characters from the classic trilogy. Not terrible but also not great. Snoke is rubbish as is star killer Base.Rey starts well and rapidly becomes preposterous. One minute the force and the Jedi are a myth, then she's pulling mind tricks like a pro. It's fun while it lasts but the story is just stupid.",6,16,79,29 March 2017
