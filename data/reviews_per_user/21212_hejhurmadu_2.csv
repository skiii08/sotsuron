First Man," I think the camera operators had Parkinson's.
","I was never a fan of NYPD Blue (the birth of this type of camera work) it give me a headache and to me detracts from the story by adding an unwanted distracting element.This movie is filled with dodgy camera work, probably to make up for the laborious story.It was shot like a home movie and I cannot stand that.I only gave it two stars because I liked Ryan Gosling in Fracture, which has nothing to do with this awful movie.",2,3,6,22 April 2019
Suicide Squad," Could have been good.
","Every movie I have happened to watch with Cara Delevingne has been bad, why on earth is she being cast in movies at all, she is really awful, at everything except having enormous eyebrows.This movie is the really bad remake of the Dirty Dozen. A really bad mess of a movie with sub plots weaker than Pee Wee Hermans defence argument. i.e. He had no defence and pleaded no contest.Memorable characters for good acting.
Will Smith - Deadshot
Margoe Robbie - Harley QuinnMemorable characters for really bad acting.

I'm sorry to say, Jared Leto, and I like Jared Leto.That's it.
Batman vs Superman was all about how bad they CGI'd Fat Cavalls face, but at least it was better than The Suicide squad.",1,0,0,11 September 2018
