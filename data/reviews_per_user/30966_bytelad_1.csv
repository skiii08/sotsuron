Resident Evil: Afterlife," Poorly Done
","This installment has probably ended the Resident Evil series for good. There is absolutely nothing original or suspenseful here. The cast has no substance, and the most interesting part about Alice's character is removed in the beginning of the movie. Every turn in the movie is expected, and any intended excitement is directed at the wrong audience. Anderson basically took The Matrix, The Island and Resident Evil and combined them into one movie. I did however, love the use of A Perfect Circle's The Outsider remix for this movie. Oh man, it could have been so much better. Shawn Roberts and Milla Jovovich were very cool on the screen, but everyone else and the poor writing killed every scene. Oh, and if you are planning to see this movie in 3D, don't! The 3D glasses make it difficult to see, as most of the scenes are without much light, and the 3D effects are less than amazing. When the movie ended, I felt like I just watched a 10 minute commercial for the actual movie, and the only ones who seemed happy with it were fans of Boris Kodjoe. Save your money and wait for this one to come out on TV.",2,9,20,19 September 2010
