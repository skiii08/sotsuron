Requiem for a Dream," The tragedy of life's outsiders
","This is the most intense film I have seen, depicting four individuals whose lives descend into absolute disaster. The film-making is superb, with scenes and sounds rapidly following each other, giving the impression that the lives of these poor people are being acted out within a giant musical or opera, with an unforgettable crescendo towards the end of the film. I felt a great deal of empathy with the troubled characters as their dreams painfully morphed into complete nightmares, which is sadly what life can sometimes bring. I would strongly recommend this film, because like anything inspired by Hubert Selby Jnr, it takes on unreported territory and laments the lives of those who become society's outsiders.",9,0,1,17 February 2006
Gravity," Interesting symbolism
","I have mixed feelings about this film. When I watched it, I thought the cinematography was beautiful and the 3D effects were excellent. However, I also felt that it was a bit of a 'space geek' kind of film and was not much more than a prolonged survival drama. The film was only about 90 minutes long but it became tiresome quite quickly. About an hour into the film, I was hoping that a piece of space debris would come crashing into Dr Ryan Stone's vessel to put her out of her misery and me out of mine as well. But having reflected on the film, I think it is a better film than I initially thought. There are some profound themes in there. The setting of the film- outer space- is serene and beautiful. One could say that it is a God-like creation. There are acts which hint at a benevolent God-like nature in human beings, such as Kowalski calmly sending himself to certain death in order to give Dr Stone a chance to live. The final scene was beautifully done, as Dr Stone returned to Earth and gradually emerged from the water, which seemed to be a nod to the beginning of human life itself. So we had the beauty of space, the beauty of Earth, the beauty of people and human creation all together in one film. That is quite unusual and makes this film one that is worth seeing.",6,0,2,1 January 2014
The Beach," A thought-provoking film
","Anyone who has backpacked to various parts of the world and trawled through youth hostels will appreciate some of the accurate observations in this film. It is basically about a backpacker who thinks he has found something different, but quickly discovers how insular and distorted the community he finds himself in is. I think this film makes a great point about how destructive inward-looking groups can be. Leonardo di Caprio's acting is a bit forced and over the top at times, and some things happen in the film which beggar belief, but overall it's a thoughtful account of the need for 'something more' in the lives of lots of young people, and how that 'something more' may not be travel, but a sense of community.",7,1,4,2 April 2006
The Shining," A totally silly film
","This film is laughable. It's great if you believe that people can see ghosts, the future and the past, but if you have any kind of grip on reality, then forget it. It's not horrifying at all, but funny. It's hilarious. It's so silly and absurd that it makes a great comedy film. Genuine psychological horror has to be based firmly on reality, not on an invented supernatural world of spooks and telepathy, as this film is. The plot is so ridiculous that the viewer ends up with no sympathy for any of the characters. I could not have cared less if they all got chopped up, as from the first moment a ghost appears, the viewer knows that he is in a completely make-believe world. It is not possible to suspend one's disbelief for a film as obviously unreal as this.",5,1,3,20 April 2006
Sin City," Strictly for comic book obsessives and misogynists
","This was a very irritating film. It was full of stereotyped macho men running around trying to help the equally stereotyped damsels in distress. Every female character in this film was without exception treated as a sexual object, and usually as a prostitute who needed a man to protect her. This is a good film for those who have no sense of reality and are ignorant enough to think that the world either is or should be about strong, powerful men protecting weak, sexualised women. Those who love the fantasies presented by comic books, who believe that people are good or bad, and who like the idea that morality is as simple as black and white, will want to watch this movie again and again. For those who are grown up and appreciate films which are more realistic and not so ignorantly simplistic, my advice is to avoid this film at all costs, because it offers nothing to the intelligent, rational-minded adult viewer.",1,9,21,3 June 2006
Slumdog Millionaire," Will make you 'feel good', but lacking in substance
","There are good and bad things about this film. First, the good things. It shows aspects of the reality of slum life in Mumbai that are routinely ignored by 'Bollywood'. In this film, we see the shacks people live in, the way they dry their clothes and how they go to the toilet, and there are allusions to prostitution and to the criminal and communal violence that can be a feature of living in the slums. We also see something of the organised nature of begging and the cruelty of those who control the child beggars. The filming is beautiful, the film is entertaining, and we can all leave on a high and feeling good about how it ends, with its underlying message of the power of love and compassion.However, the key problem with the film is that everything is captured on no more than a superficial level. There are beautiful images in the film of the Dharavi slums and the inhabitants, but they are the kind of images one would expect to see in a guidebook. In other words, these images are taken from the perspective of a tourist, and, like the tourist, the film merely scratches the surface of life in the slum. The superficiality continues in the simplistic nature of the characters and the lack of any real character development. Some of the characters are introduced to simply be one-dimensional 'baddies', such as the gangsters Maman and Javed. The plot itself is contrived, with one question on the game show leading to a 'flashback', another question leading to another 'flashback', and so on. The plot is also implausible in a number of ways. For example, it is never explained how Jamal goes from the slums to a clean-cut looking, English-speaking call centre assistant. Also, the reason for Jamal appearing on the game show is because he apparently wishes to resume contact with Latika, but we are not told how he expects Latika to contact him, given that she is being kept under lock and key by Javed.Despite these shortcomings, there is no doubt that the film manipulates the viewers' emotions in such a way that they 'feel good' after seeing the film, they feel on a high, and they love the film. However, this is a typical feature of many Bollywood films. This is what these films are designed to do. They are there to act like a drug, like alcohol or like sex to give you a kick and to make you feel good. This is not necessarily a good thing because the kick is not going to last. When I walked out of the cinema and into the supermarket, the comedown from the high I felt after seeing this fairytale left me feeling nothing but depression. Watch Slumdog and get your buzz from it, but be ready for the cold turkey as well. Somehow, I think there should be more substance to cinema than this.",6,3,9,1 February 2009
