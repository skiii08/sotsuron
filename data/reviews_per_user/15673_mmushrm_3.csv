The King's Speech," Brilliant, not a dull moment.
","Its not often when you can say, 'totally engrossing' and 'not a dull moment' in a movie thats not an action movie and is 90% indoors with 2 guys talking. This movie spans roughly 1935-1939. With the death of King George V, the abdication of Edward, coronation of George VI and the start of the WWII in Europe. It revolves around the relationship that forms and the method of speech therapy that George VI underwent. Climaxing in the speech the king made to rally the nation when war was declared with Nazi Germany. I am pretty sure some artistic licensing may have been taken in some of the scenes. Edward and Wallis Simpson were portrayed in a rather negative light (true or not, who knows). I recommend reading up on George VI before watching the movie it will help and add to the understanding. It will also make it feel like you are watching their private lives. Brilliant movie, definitely one that I will watch again.",10,1,3,19 January 2011
The Adventures of Tintin," A very good adaptation
","This movie is visually very good. There were times when I almost forgot that it is an animated feature and not live action.The story plot and pacing is straight out of the TinTin adventure comics. I have to admit that it is a throw back from the action anime movies that we are now used to (dark, gritty, suspense etc). So while watching I felt that the movie was missing something. But when I thought about it and the TinTin comics I had read as a child, the movie is a true adaptation of the comics. A simple tale of mystery, action and adventureThe best way I can summarize and praise the movie is that The Adventures of TinTin is a visually stunning and accurate adaptation of the TinTin comics.",7,1,1,17 March 2012
"Sal√≤, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Pointless
","Why do people make films like this? IMO this film has no redeeming qualities. If its for titillation, I found none. It seems like a sad comedy which wasn't very funny at all. The torture and killing scene at the end again seems added just for the sake of shock. I dunno maybe because I watched it in Italian with pretty bad English subs but this movie is a pointless waste of time. I am assuming its based on De Sade's 120 days which I also did not enjoy so no surprise I didn't like this. Guess its not in my psychological makeup.However if you like scat, pee, blood, sodomy(guy on guy), full frontal male nudity, violence, sadism, homo-eroticism. This movie may just be for you. When you list it like I did, it does sound rather interesting but unfortunately its not.",4,3,11,7 February 2011
