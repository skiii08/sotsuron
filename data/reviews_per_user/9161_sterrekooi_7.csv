The King's Speech," Beautiful
","With 12 Academy Award Nominations, it is no wonder I suppose that my expectations of this movie were high. The movie narrates of king George VI, father of United Kingdom's current Queen Elizabeth II, and mainly about how he overcame his stammering. We see the king in his long sessions with speech therapist Lionel Logue (a fantastic performance of Geoffrey Rush) and in his palace among his family, struggling with his shame and frustrations.Someone who had seen this movie before I did, said to me: 'It's a great movie. No one gets killed, no one falls in love, and yet it is a great movie.' And it is. If it were not for the marvelous directing and camera work, it is for Colin Firth. My goodness, what an amazing actor; the way in which he portrays George VI with all his sides (his ferociousness as well as his fragility) is frankly moving. If he indeed wins the Academy Award for Best Actor, I will be extremely happy. It seems Colin Firth has been underestimated a lot since the start of his career; he finally gets the recognition he deserves. Absolutely brilliant.En then we have of course Geoffrey Rush, whom I mentioned before, and who is funny as the unconventional but dedicated speech therapist. And there's Helena Bonham Carter, of whom I've never been a fan, but who also deserves praise for her performance.As for the film itself, it's certainly been directed by a still very young, but talented actor. The camera work is lovely, as well are the decors and the lightning.I could start talking about that I sometimes felt this movie was leaning too much on Colin Firth's performances and that the story line seemed a bit boring sometimes, but I won't; the many good points of the film surpass its few less good points.",9,1,3,24 February 2011
The Sound of Music," Wonderful, amazing, fantastic, great movie!
","Well, what can I say about this movie? I think it's great. It's my favorite movie. Like my mother, I can see it thousands of times without finding it dull. The music is such brilliant, especially because of Julie Andrews' amazing voice. I actually can't say something negative about this film...it's full of magical, wonderful music, everything fits, wonderful actors, wonderful story...the end is wonderful, when they get away over the mountains...the songs are fantastic...every time I see this film I look at it with so much enthusiasm...I have seen it 20 times or more, and it doesn't get dull, as said! The strict captain and the singing, life-enjoying Maria...it is wonderful how they get together. They fall right away for each other, and when they tell each other about their love...just wonderful. I am 100% positive.",10,2,8,6 January 2006
Black Book," Bad film, fine actress
","I wanted to see this movie, so I was happy when I saw it would be broadcast yesterday. But now I've seen it, I must say that it turned out to be a disappointment. Everyone was thrilled about Mr. Verhoeven's movie with Carice van Houten in the leading role...it opened the road to Hollywood for Carice, so I thought it would be good...but it wasn't. The whole film is like a comic; you just don't feel anything with what's happening. Paul Verhoeven is good at making beautiful pictures, but I missed this movie just misses content. It doesn't take you, you just feel like watching a theater play. Apart from that; I did think Carice was a good actress before I'd seen Blackbook, and I still do. I'm just a fan of her; she's a very pretty, talented woman, but her talent just doesn't come out in this movie. Practically in the next scene after Rachel's/Ellis' family is killed, she's cheerful again. Right, she says: 'I'm unable to cry about it,' but this just doesn't make sense; her whole family has been killed and she's smiling again in the next scene! This might be a part of Verhoeven's directing, but it just makes you feel; this doesn't make sense. Yet, I love Carice's acting. I'm just a fan of her, but I found it a pity. This movie is a missed chance to make something really beautiful.",6,3,6,2 January 2009
Brokeback Mountain," Beautiful story, wonderful acting, but sometimes weak
","I was thrilled to see this movie, since I'd heard a lot about it. So I was very happy when I read it was going to be broadcast on the television last night. Now that I've seen it, I can say that I did like it. But it wasn't what I'd expected. The actors are all really good; the death of Heath Ledger is a big loss for the world of acting. He did an excellent job as the reticent Ennis and he proves himself as a great actor. Jake Gyllenhaal is very good as well. The beautiful landscapes of the Canadian Rockies in Southern Alberta are amazing to see, and there are a lot of moving moments in this film. However, sometimes I found it a bit flat, though I can't really explain why. You just have to see it for yourself, it's a good movie with very good actors, but it's not perfect, as some people call it.",8,2,5,25 December 2008
The Illusionist," Weak ending, exciting story
","The story is very exciting: it's quite bleak and you're thinking the whole time: What's going to happen now? But the end ruins everything. Please don't put such an happy ending to such a bleak movie! It was like Romeo and Juliet, but without the dying. It's just not believable to pretend someone's dead but she appears not to be at the end! Besides this horrible end everything was fine: Edward Norton is intimidating and slightly mean as Eisenheim, and I also loved Jessica Biel besides her non-speaking features: her emotion is the same every time. I'd already seen Paul Giamatti in Lady in the Water (2006, together with Bryce Dallas Howard), in which he was great, and here he was too.",8,0,0,4 February 2007
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Outstanding, fantastic acting and full of excitement!
","I was really excited to go seeing this movie, because I've always loved the Harry Potter books/movies and I'm a huge fan of Emma Watson (Hermione Granger). So today was the day. Already in the beginning, the movie is exciting, when Harry en Dudley get attacked by Dementors. And the excitement doesn't stop there: the whole movie is full of exciting moments, flashes, lines and whatever more can be exciting. I'd almost say that the most beautiful thing of this movie is the outstanding acting of everyone. With every movie, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson grow (not only literally, but also in their acting) and I'm not surprised about the great reviews of Order of the Phoenix. Gary Oldman (Sirius Black) is obviously fantastic: his way of talking/doing things is almost moving, and the feeling between him and Daniel Radcliffe is really special, as if they are really godfather and -son. With his movie comes a new character named Luna Lovegood, portrayed by the lovely fourteen year-old Evanna Lynch, whom got casted for this part out of 20.000 other girls. Her remarkable appearance, her high, soft voice and her dreamy eyes make her exactly the right person to play the part of Luna. She's pretty much like I thought Luna would be like, and she's really doing very well. And then we have Michael Gambon (Albus Dumbledore). Thinking he wasn't the right person for this part (too restless, much more different than Richard Harris was, he was always more like I had Dumbledore in mind), I sort of changed my mind today. He's an outstanding actor and has a very remarkable, beautiful voice. Daniel Radcliffe is doing a very good job as Harry for the fifth time. I hope those who've seen Equus in London, the piece in which he's naked, will be able to get that picture out of they're head for a moment and enjoy watching Daniel as Harry Potter, and not as the sort of mental Alan. Emma, my lovely favorite actress, is once more outstanding as Hermione. She really seems to UNDERSTAND this character, she's thought about it, and that's the right thing to do when it comes to acting: make sure you understand the character you're playing. So does Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange, though a pretty small part, played very well. David Yates prooves that he's a good director, and I am really happy that he'll be doing the next HP movie too. Overall, this movie is great, though it was a pity they cut out a lot of things that are in the book. The kiss of Harry and Cho is sweet and kind and romantic, I loved it. The movie is one big story full of excitement, wonderful music and outstanding acting. I recommend it certainly.",9,0,1,30 July 2007
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Disappointing, but nice.
","I was really curious to see this movie. I had been waiting for it for months, I had seen all the trailers, I had looked up every thing of information about it...And then the day came I got to see it. It was the 1st of December 2005. I went to the cinema with a couple of friends, expecting very much...well, I've got to say that I liked it very much, but it was also quite disappointing. The whole film, especially the beginning, went so fast, you could really see they had to hurry a bit with making it...it was really, as actress Emma Watson said, going like 'tsjaktsjaktsjaktsjak', the scenes didn't really fit together, they were all standing apart, if you know what I mean. But this got better in the second part of the film. I liked the second part better. The Yule Ball scene was awesome (it was really my favourite): I was really impressed by the beauty of the set, though I already had seen it in the trailers...Emma Watson, whom plays Hermione Granger, could be given the prize of 'Most Beautiful Girl of Hogwarts' Yule Ball', she really looked stunning in her beautiful pink dress. What can I say about Emma Watson: I am such a huge fan of her, so it's normal I'm prizing her, but she really HAD such acted in an outstanding way. I liked the line 'Ronald would like me to tell you that Seamus told him that Dean was told by Parvati that Hagrid was looking for you' very much, it's such funny and nice. What I want to say about the three young lead-actors in general (Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma) is that they've really grown up. Daniel is sixteen years old, Rupert is seventeen and Emma is fifteen. Remember the time they were only eleven! Such wonderful how a kid can grow up...they've also grown in their way of acting. Such very nice. As I said, I liked the second part of the movie better as the first part. The Task-scenes were quite spectacular, I thought the Dragon looked quite real (I know, dragons don't excist, but I mean real in the way of a real creature). It was quite exciting, and so were the other two Task-scenes. The maze-scene was very nice...well-acted, and scary...the graveyard scene was even more exciting and scary...and in a way quite moving, I don't know why...I thought Robert Pattinson, whom plays Cedric Diggory, acted like he was death really well, it was such scary! One of the last scenes, where whole Hogwarts is sitting in the Great Hall, and where Dumbledore is speaking about Cedric, was moving too. Then something about the director, Mike Newell. A month after I'd seen Goblet of Fire I saw 'Four Weddings and A Funeral', also directed by him. I thought this film was wonderful. I won't say it's better as Goblet of Fire (I can't help it, I'm a fan, though GOF was disappointing), but I will say that Four Weddings was just directed better. So we don't know: maybe Mike Newell's a better director for comedies. Overall, I thought this movie was very nice, moving, scary, funny...but also disappointing.",7,0,0,2 March 2006
