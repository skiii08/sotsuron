The Ring," Better than the original in some ways, not as good in others
","This was a very impressive remake.  It was a much glossier production than the original and did a slightly better job of explaining some of the ambiguities than the original Japanese version.  The shocking scenes of this film had greater impact than did the original.  On the other hand, the original version had a much greater build-up in tension than this one.  The cast in this remake was also far less likeable than the original version (particularly the young boy).  Although these characters clearly understood that their 7 days were running out fast, they sparsely acknowledged it - those in the original version agonized over it.  I would encourage moviegoers to see both versions - particularly those unfamiliar with Japanese psychological horrors.  Those films can be razor sharp.",10,0,0,21 October 2002
