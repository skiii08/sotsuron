Requiem for a Dream," Main Stream avant-garde
","'Refreshingly eerie' is the only phrase that I can use to describe this film. The innovative screen shots and raw subject matter instantly make this movie a cult classic. Definitely not a film for 'pop tart' moviegoers, more of a filmmaker's film. Your imagination becomes your most disturbing image throughout the film and the montage transitions take you all the way back to the 1920s soviet film era. Oh yes, and the score is amazing. This film is very good on the brink of greatness. As an filmmaker myself I have advised some of my students analyze this film for its creative cinematography and editing. All have told me afterward that Requiem for a Dream is the only film that can make you feel its content. I must concurr, this is the only film that can make you feel as high and as paranoid as the characters in the diegesis. Masterful.",8,1,2,5 July 2007
