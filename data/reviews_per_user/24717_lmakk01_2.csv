The Sound of Music," Why isn't it on the top 250?
","This film is by far one of the best of all time. The beauty of the Austrian Alps in addition to a great score and supreme acting make an epic that is a great reminder of the grandeur of yesteryear's films. It is in the top ranks in terms of my favorite films.The film opens in a pristine Alpine fly-by and then zooms in on Maria and I sit back and relax as Julie Andrews delivers a performance that makes my heart soar away.Today my heart still races as the Sturmabteilung (Nazi Brownshirts) try to find the wily Captain and his family in the cemetery.If everyone continues to vote, maybe one day if can make the top 250 list!",10,3,11,6 October 2007
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," A disappointment
","Oh My Gosh! Why did they get rid of Christopher Columbus?! This movie has lost the charm of the rest of the Harry Potter movies. It doesn't help that Alfonso Cuaron never read the book! The one and only part that I liked was the Patronus charm, which earned 4 stars. The other one was for Alfonso Cuaron's Effort and the fabulous soundtrack by John Williams. I hope that the Goblet of Fire will be better. The Maruder's Map was cool. I do recommend the video game. I think this movie is worth seeing, even though I was disappointed. The bonus disc on the DVD has lots of cool activities. I hope Mike Newell will use Chris Columbus' style.",5,0,1,7 October 2005
