The New World," terrible and historically inaccurate!
","As a huge Colin Farrell fan it hurts me to write the next paragraph, but...SAVE your DVD rental money, this was one of the WORST movies I have ever seen! Not only was the pace extremely slow,the acting of the 15 year old girl who played Pocahontas (who is never even called that in the movie!)terrible, but 90% of the movie was done in 'voice over'.It was also disturbing and disheartening to see Malick rewrite history! Once again, we have what could have been an excellent portrayal of real life history and events, blasted apart by 'Hollywood'. If Pocahontas and John Smith ever did have a love affair, it would have been DISGUSTING, as the REAL Pocahontas was about 11 years old, ELEVEN people, and John Smith was about 29 years old, so that would have made him a PEDOPHILE, and that is NOT something to make an 'adventurous/love-story' movie about! And to top it off they had a half Swiss/half SOUTH American 15 year old, play the part of Pocahontas, why couldn't they find an 18 year or older Full blooded NORTH American Indian girl to play the part, against Colin Farrell's 30 year old butt, playing,John Smith? That too was disturbing in itself, First as in insult to NORTH American Native Americans and second in having a under age CHILD play the part. Then finally, when Malick decides to actually have some historical accuracy, Chirstan Bale who plays Pocahantas' REAL life, love interest and husband,John Rolfe, he gets about, 30 minutes of screen time, again almost all done entirely in 'voice over'! This was the first time that I have ever said to my husband, 'do you mind if we skip the last 15 minutes?, this movie blows!' As I have watched some mind-numbing movies before, but made myself watch until the bitter end, but not even Colin Farrell, Christan Bale,or even Christopher Plummer could save this meandering, inaccurate waste of time and effort and make me watch it until the end! SAD, SAD, SAD!",2,1,7,15 November 2006
