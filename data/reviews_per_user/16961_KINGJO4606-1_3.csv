Catch Me If You Can," Modernity calling
","This is a helpful movie. It shows the viewer that not all people are honest, despite Leonardo's character being likable. His world-view that most people were selfish encouraged him to trod down the path he had taken before getting arrested. The film also demonstrates how divorce affects people. The scene which sticks in my mind the most happened at the end of the movie; he met his younger half-sister for the first time. But he also discovered his French, biological mother reading a book, happily remarried and unconcerned with the troubles of his own son. The film is a wake-up call to me because it shows you that others often are generally not concerned with your problems. DiCaprio's character redeemed himself at the end of the movie by becoming a man in charge of dealing with check fraud. Overrated movie but highly recommended.8/10",8,2,4,24 December 2014
The Love Guru," Has re-watch-ability value despite not liking it the first time
","I saw this movie the first time when I was still a senior in high school. The two male members of the household and I watched this movie because we expected Mike Myers to deliver. I will admit that I was disappointed when I watched this movie for the first time; in fact, it was my sibling who had enthusiastically wanted to watch this movie more than I did.However, I am a person who gets bored with contemporary culture easily. I do not like modern movies and TV shows that much; I also lost my interest in video games. So I decided to buy this movie because it only sold for $3. To my surprise, I liked this movie a lot upon my second viewing. It made a lot of good philosophical and self-help points that especially seem relevant to the problems that a lot of young people my age tend to face. Despite the fact that the movie featured tasteless humor, I nevertheless did find it funny. The second time I watched it, I had not been grossed out as much because I was obviously more mature. I also like the music and the hockey in the film.I have the suspicion that many do not like this movie due to the fact that it features dated humor. However, I find Mike Myers' 'dated' humor to be funnier than movies out now such as Horrible Bosses, Pineapple Express and the Hangover Part III. Even though Mike Myers may be making enough money from the Shrek sequels to opt out on acting, writing and directing for now, I still do miss his comedy and would like to see more of it. I, for instance, would like to see him star in a movie with Jim Carrey eventually; maybe they can do something like the Odd Couple.I will conclude my review by stating how surprised I am that this movie received such low reviews. I, for instance, find this movie to be better than the original SpongeBob Squarepants' movie. I can obviously see how this movie received poor reviews from critics. I am also not surprised by the negative reception the movie got from the general populace, but I am surprised by comments that the movie is bad enough to have killed Mike Myers' career. Even if the movie does feature tasteless humor, I do not think anyone can deny that it manifests glimmers of Mike Myers' former brilliance. Finis.8/10",8,3,6,10 December 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," The best of the Hobbit movie
","This is not a bad movie. I am surprised that it received worse reviews than the first two Hobbit films. This sequel most clearly demonstrates the connections which exist between the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings franchises. It does not have as many lulling periods as the second movie. It is action-packed and fun, and it has very few dull moments. It is probably the best movie of the year, although that may not be saying that much. James Berardinelli was astute for giving the movie 3.5/4 stars and deeming it the best of the Hobbit movies.Although the Lord of the Rings franchise is over, the movie nevertheless says much about Peter Jackson's future. Hopefully, he will direct more movies that are action-packed like King Kong. Except for The Frighteners, many of his pre-Lord of the Rings movies were rather campy. Similarly, I was disappointed with the Lovely Bones.P.S. One perception I've had about his Hobbit movies is that they have more of a stale Harry Potter feel. I do not consider that a bad thing; he probably needed more variety in his franchise. Unlike some others, I was not annoyed by the CGI; perhaps the filmmakers were trying to save money.9/10",9,3,7,27 December 2014
