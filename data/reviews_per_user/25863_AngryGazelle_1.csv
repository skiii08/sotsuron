Skyfall," good but not perfect
","I'll start by saying that I did enjoy this film it had some good action sequences, great performances and packed in enough nods to bond films past to satiate any fan. But this film suffered from a fairly uneven script, and had quite a few gaping plot holes. Firstly the villains motive to get revenge on M was believable and refreshing but also poses a few big questions. How was he funding this revenge scheme? Where did all his henchman and helicopters come from? Why did he allow himself to be captured when it served no real purpose other than to serve as part of a far too elaborate to be believed master plan? why steal a list of MI6 agents kill a couple and then just give up on the rest? Also the bond girls character was basically superfluous and merely a plot device to get bond laid and in the company of the bad guy. And two words anyone will laugh at upon seeing this movie, komodo dragons! I very much enjoyed the scorpion scene, the scenes of bonds tests at MI6 bond and m's relationship was also a positive aspect of the film. The action sequences had a few very cool moments most of which were spoilt by the trailer, but overall felt slightly lacking I think the movie could of done with some more characters on the bad guy side of things I personally would of had the main villain sell the list of agents to a terrorist cell and use them to service the action sequences and have some cool assassination of MI6 agents sequence. But the film did is job by leaving me wanting more from Bond still.",7,1,5,2 December 2012
