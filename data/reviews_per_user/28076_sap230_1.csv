Requiem for a Dream," I hate this movie...
","I completely hate this movie, not because it is a bad movie, but because of how good the movie is. I am not going to get into any plot detail, but the movie is so strong that even though I hate the way it makes me think and feel, I seem to watch it over and over again. The movie portrays probably one of the worst situations a person can be in when it comes to drugs. It is a true 'horror' story for anyone taking any kinds of drugs, legal, illegal, prescription, or over the counter. Ths movie is a huge eye opener. I recommend this movie to everyone, however watch it during hte day and not in the middle of the night as I seem to do, for it probably will give you nightmares.",Null,6,11,28 June 2004
