It," Disappointing
","The first ten minutes were good (trailer bait). The rest of the movie consisted of;-Poor child acting
-Cliche horror characters doing unbelievably dumb things
-Disjointed shifts in tone (horror, comedy, horror, comedy)
-Inappropriate comedy
-No character arcs
-Antagonist isn't bound by any rulesIt's almost like two or even three directors were given the script for this movie, and the same actors and locations. Each went about directing their interpretation and when all was done, various scenes from all editions were combined to form one full length movie. A total mess.",5,3,6,27 June 2018
Us," Great first 30 minutes
","I felt the first 30 minutes or so of this movie were pretty great. Good acting, decent setup and plot but it fell apart once the Shadow People starting interacting with the family. Way over-acted their parts. How can they really be scary when the family members all have plot-armour?This movie would have been much better IMO if the Shadow's never talked and the entire movie was contained within the first house with the family's main objective being to keep them out - much like occurred for about 1 minute when they were trying to protect the door.At the end of the day, we're left with boring antagonists, an invincible family, a movie that goes on too long by about 25 minutes and a final twist that was so obvious.",5,1,2,27 August 2019
The Conjuring 2," Disappointing sequel
","I was hoping that the sequel would improve on the 2013 original. Sadly, this is not the case. The Conjuring 2 follows a very similar structure to that of the original, but where the original avoided most problems that plague other horrors films, the sequel stumbles onto most of them.The sequel makes two significant errors. Poor child actors and revealing far too much about the spooky entity. The first error, poor child actors, was avoided entirely by the original. The second, inexplicably, has the least capable child actor's character (Billy) stutter throughout the film. Completely unnatural and an unnecessary burden on the actor (and audience). B-B-Biscuits? (were the biscuits haunted?).The second error, turns the film into somewhat of a comedy at times. We learn far too much about the deceased old man. 'My house' always cracks me up, surely that's not meant to be scary? Hoping the third movie is better.",5,8,13,1 June 2018
A Quiet Place," Yeah, it wasn't great.
","Just kinda stupid. Want to beat these monsters? Spend a day quietly putting big spears around you and yell loudly. Oh, tough enemy.Want to beat these monsters? Stand near a big electrical fault and yell. Run away. They'll die.The fact that high pitched sound is the solution was moronic. Did no one else on Earth think of that? Did all the smart people die first?Edit; Bonus point for having the idiot child killed at the start. Otherwise, I'd give this a six.",7,0,0,8 August 2018
Midsommar," Wickerman ripoff
","Just a ripoff of a much better film. Midsommar definitely has some unsettling scenes but goes on way too long. Don't listen to the people who say 'casual horror fans won't get it', this isn't a complex story. It's long, slow and ultimately doesn't deliver.",6,4,6,27 December 2019
Mad Max: Fury Road," Unbelievably bad
","It's difficult to believe how bad this movie was. We're talking beyond Matrix Revolutions level of bad here. Some nice cinematography cannot save a movie that lacks any degree of character development, and a story line that centers around one big dull car chase (yes, the story is literally a big dull car chase scene). Explosions and gunfire fill the screen, and for the first five minutes it seems like a great way to start the movie... but then it keeps going, and going... before any break is taken, you've sat through a full half hour of generic car chase scene. And the movie continues like that until the end. Again, throughout this chase, there is no meaningful dialogue between the characters (not the mention the jarring Australian to American accent), there is nothing. This movie is junk, this is Mild Max.",5,24,49,29 June 2015
