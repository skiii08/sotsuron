Black Swan," Good job.
","I managed to get the hot ticket for TIFF, which was of course, Black Swan (if you don't count Bruce Springsteen). Wow. It took me a while to get into this, it takes a while to build and I was worried I was going to be watching a movie about a ballet dancer moaning about her life, but man does it pick up! The music does wonders, and the team have managed to fuse the movie well with music everyone is familiar with. Swan Lake, something everyone is familiar with, is suddenly all very new, and it's dark and disturbing territory.A wonderful performance from Natalie Portman with an excellent supporting cast (Winona seems to be clawing her way back).Excellent visuals which reach an epic crescendo in the 2nd and 3rd acts of the eventual opening night of 'Swan Lake'. As the screen faded to black with a roaring crowd and blasting classical music I got shivers down my spine.I would definitely agree with one of the other posters, at times this movie feels like a horror, I could see other audience members hiding behind magazines during one particularly tense scene.In the words of Nina, it's 'PERFECT'.",Null,8,18,19 September 2010
Drive," Great
","My advice is to go to this movie cold. Don't watch the trailer (it has a lot of spoilers) and try not to watch any clips.This movie is amazing. From the wonderful performances from the entire cast, to the great car scenes to the brutal violence. Excellent execution in every respect. Wonderful pacing. Extremely impressive direction. A hot contender for director of the year. While the actors do a great job, the characters don't give them enough to warrant any accolades. Direction however, must be commended.The good:Everything.Best Scene: Driver is on the beach, with passing car lights in the back- ground. Or the wonderfully tense robbery scene.The bad:Nothing.Worst Scene: The guy in the elevator (bad for all the right reasons!)",Null,5,11,24 September 2011
Cloud Atlas," Spectacular
","One has to admire the sheer scale of this project. At times it may be hard to follow and you have to just let go and give up trying to understand what is happening, but I assure you it comes together at the end.The chase scenes set in neo-seoul are heart-racing and extremely impressive. Doona Bae is spectacular as Somni 451.Towards the end of the movie I was fighting back tears as 2 stories reached tragic conclusions.The best part of this is that the Wachowskis/Tykwer have taken a massive risk and have done something new with a large 'pop' movie. It will no doubt divide audiences and a lot of the people who will be attracted by its sensational trailer will no doubt feel a bit alienated. But personally, I was blown away.",Null,129,234,11 September 2012
