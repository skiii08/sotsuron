Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Amazing
","There is something amazing with every Quentin Tarantino film. He is a god of film-making- his style sticks out like a sore thumb. From the opening monologue exchanged between Bill and the bride to Bill's final steps, you can feel Tarantino's power surge through your head. Some call Tarantino a pervert. Yes, he has a thing for excessive violence and sex in his movies, but that's why they are so amazing. He can put incredible amounts of exploitation in his films (even though this film isn't too violent) yet, when he mixes it with dialogue from heaven, can create a powerhouse. This is is greatest achievement in this category. Yes, most of the technology is corny, but that's why it is so freaking awesome. It's supposed to be that way, and that way is the best way anyone can do a movie of this type. Kill Bill is one of the best movies I have seen in my life.",10,2,4,2 April 2007
