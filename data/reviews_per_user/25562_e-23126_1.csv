Hereditary," A fantastic horror film
","Movie doesn't get much love from audiences, so I thought I'd chime in with some quick thoughts. This movie is incredible, but not for everyone. It definitely falls under the art-house category, although on the more conventional side (except for the last 10 minutes). The movie is a slow burn, and builds tension incredibly well through not only the weird stuff that happens, but the incredible sound design. Also, how could I not mention Toni Collete? She really didn't get enough love from the Oscars. As for flaws, there were a couple of scenes I found to be unintentionally funny, but those are short lived.Overall, 9/10",9,2,6,18 May 2019
