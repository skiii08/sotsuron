50 First Dates," Unbelievable
","This film, although i only saw it the other day is one of the greatest films i have ever seen and it really completely reflects what any normal person would do in Henrys (Sandlers) shoes. Drew played the part down to a tee and it was a real tear jerker and a definite film for any couples who want a film to make them cry and laugh in the course of 90 minutes. We can only hope that the pairing of Drew and Adam can be reunited again to give us another golden film to be proud of. I hope that Drew takes another risk and lets it pay off which can only help her fast growing reputation and bank balance. Its a real gem and one for Drew Barrymore and the set to be proud of.",10,0,0,8 April 2006
