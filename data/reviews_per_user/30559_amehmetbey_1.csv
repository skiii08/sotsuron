Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Disgusting and insulting.
","If you start laughing when you see a sh!t then probably you will find this movie funny too.How can someone insult, humiliate a nation like this and why? and they expect me to laugh at it. What is strange is most of the people are ignorant to see and really find it funny.Disgusting, racist, humiliating, extremely explicit.I don't understand what Sascha Cohen is trying to tell nor what he is up to. Was this a movie, a documentary?Even in this site they don't let me to write bad words but this movie goes far from it.",1,6,12,15 February 2009
