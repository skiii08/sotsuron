Skyfall," lazy, boring, nonsensical
","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Terrible story, plot holes around every corner. Terrible dialog and one-liners. Aside from early action scenes, very slow pace and boring. Bad character development. Unbelievable Bond doesn't even flinch when woman that helped him gain access to bad guy dies. Could have saved girl by pulling escape moments earlier. Bad guy is ridiculous. Bond survives fiery explosion by hiding around corner (like fire can't go around a corner?). Dismisses Bond movie staples the whole movie (e.g. gadgets), but then at the end adds scene that praises and cashes in on the old style. Tried to cover up entire bad movie by circle jerking audience at end with this classic bond 'reboot' promise. On a side note, I saw Roger Ebert gave this very high praise... that alone should be enough to warn you away.",1,13,28,19 November 2012
Silent Hill," An excellent horror movie not quite like anything you've seen before
","I've seen hundreds of horror movies over the years, and this one stands out. It was truly disturbing, and I found the story to be rather fresh. Although it is rooted in the 'wronged-spirit-gets-revenge' category, there is a definite twist in who turns out to be the entity that did the wrong. I Highly recommend this movie to people who like their horror without having to switch off their brains. Visually, this was a treat. Some of the direction reminded me of Kubrick... very atmospheric. I guess that's why some people complain about the pacing of the movie (as they do with some kubrick). The effects were top notch and quite disturbing (I coulda done without seeing a human being burned alive in such great detail, I prefer my horror to be more rooted in fantasy). Overall A+ for this flick, now I'm gonna have to check out the game.",10,1,3,13 August 2006
