Black Swan," This is what everybody loves to see!
","Talking about such a film seems to be tough as some scenes are too fast to be understood and it's needed to be watched at least 2 times. Darren Aronofsky who ignored '127 hours' to direct 'Black Swan' shows great ability to take watcher's focus and involve them in the story. Not a moment I paused the film but I only did when I was scared what will happen next.Story: Nina Sayers is a young ballerina who tries to be chosen as 'Swan Queen' in 'Swan Lake' ballet. Vincent Cassel, the group's coach, recognizes Nina to be perfect for 'White Swan' but so much weak for 'Black Swan'.Her demand to get the role adds more stress on pressure from her mother, a former ballerina. She got all the control over Nina and acts like a baby with her, wanting Nina to achieve all she couldn't in her professional life time.Nina's effort for playing Black Swan as well as White Swan didn't come conclusion except when she began to get more in touch with her dark side, as far as Black Swan indicates guile and sensuality but White Swan represents innocence and grace. This turning point starts hallucinations and changes Nina in a weird wayDetails: focusing on the details for the second or third time watching this movie helps finding out that even everybody's clothes color has been chosen for a reason. In bar Nina wearing white and Lily black is a sign of their position in the world and their completely different personalities. Sound editing: in most of the films cinematography is the main way to influence the audience. However in 'Black Swan' sound editing does the job. Nina's toes piping all the film long when dancing or massaging is so much real that you will have to get all parts of your face together to decrease the pressure. The moments of silence right in the middle of ferment takes you right inside of brain of actress to feel what she really feels.Actors & Actresses:Natalie Portman: having a hard job combining emotions with ballet was the main reason she got every reward possible. Her innocent face goes straight into your mind and reinforces you sympathy from the first scene. Great job! Vincent Cassel: carrying years of experience helps him to fit himself into the role. This special face which makes him attractive in some cases has specific effect on watcher that indicates a negative role just opposite of what he is.Mila Kunis: after 'Book of Eli' pretty Mila Kunis seems to become a celebrity who just knows what to do. Admirable play of her keeps the observer's negative look on her till the last scene.Darren Aronofsky: Absolutely my favorite as far as I explained about actors. All film long you can sense his presence and this is what I feel.",8,2,3,17 June 2011
Memento," Nolan a director or a star?
","Watching Memento needs a little former information on it's director. Christopher Nolan these days looking to be improving his skills, is kind of different from a typical director.Considering Batman new series & Inception, he is not going to direct a movie which he is not it's writer too & this is what appears to be his superiority in Hollywood.The only thing I can say about Nolan is that he wants to be his only films star. No matter who is the first role, Nolan's screenplay should be the part which absorbs everybody.Memento is telling a story on Leonard Shelby who lost his short-term memory in an accident which lead to his wife murder. The only thing he wants is a revenge & he is trying to find the person named J.G who is the suspect of this murder.Two story lines exist in the film. The first one is moving backwards. Two important events has been chosen, the story starts from the second one & moves back toward the first one. Another storyline is going forward until two story lines get together in the last scene.'Guy Pearce' that was chosen instead of 'Alec Baldwin' as Leonard looks to have a strong personality & is dead serious about what he thinks he should do. His short-term memory loss irritates him and the only way he has found to calm down is reminding himself a person who had the same problem named Sammy Jankis.Leonard believes not remembering things doesn't make them meaningless. So he continues looking for his wife murderer. However the last scene indicates that he is not going to find who he wants forever. Carrie-Ann Moss known as Trinity in Matrix series tries to be the center of attention by her movements as Natalie but seems to be more pretending than acting.my Persian criticize on Memento in this site: www.monalisa007.blogfa.com",8,0,3,18 January 2011
Heat," Best scene ever!
","Godfother 2 was the first movie which Al Pacino and Robert Deniro both had a role in. But they didn't have a scene together! The desire of seeing the 2 best actors of contemporary cinema remained till 1995 when Michael Mann decided to have them in 'heat' together. Mann, completely aware about people's expectations, keeps 2 actors away for first 90 minutes of the film. When Pacino as a police officer faces gangster Deniro in a café, the masterpiece begins. What would a police officer say to a gangster who is trying to arrest while He does not have enough evidence? What they talk about is the complete brilliance; life issues, their women and their jobs! Pacino and his hilarious body movements against Robert Deniro who only nods his head! It looks like to be a calm friendly conversation which is not. It's full of sarcasms. They both know one will have to kill the other but they are considering different possibilities. The scene finishes when both characters threaten each other enough. Strange look in Deniro's eyes tells us how much odd and perfect the scene has been.",9,1,4,15 March 2013
