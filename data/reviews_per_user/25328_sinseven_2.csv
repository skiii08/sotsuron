The Blair Witch Project," Greatest Ghoststory on Film EVER!
","This film brought to me, everything I remember about sitting around the fire and telling ghost stories as a child. Thats all this is, the perfect ghost story. Those who take it for more, will be disapointed. Those who love great story telling, will love this film! Rent it, turn out the lights, and let this film take you into one of the greatest ghost stories ever told on film!
*SPOILER* I refer to this as a ghost story, cause that's what it reminds me off. I can remember my father telling me a ghost story around a camp fire long ago, where the end of the story the teller grabs the arm of the person next to him, and yells 'GIVE ME BACK MY HANDS!' the final sceen in this movie with the kid standing in the corner IS that part of the ghost story. And if you let the film absorb you so that you are in that room and see him there, its like a revisiting of the camp fire story and you just got grabbed by the teller, yelling 'GIVE ME BACK MY HANDS!'I so loved this movie, and im sorry to see it spoiled by people who can't take it for what its worth. The greatest ghost story ever told on film.",10,2,4,30 October 2003
Big Fish," Quite Simply, One of the best films I have ever seen.
","The writer of this story and Tim Burton have really outdone themselves! This movie was so well done, so touching, and so magical; it left me breathless! I was lucky enough to see the prescreening last night and all this morning I have been telling everyone at work how wonderful it is! I highly recommend seeing this! 10 out of 10!",10,0,0,17 December 2003
