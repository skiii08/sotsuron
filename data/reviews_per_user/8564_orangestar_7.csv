The Ring," ***1/2 out of *****
","THE RING(2002)***1/2 out of *****Naomi Watts, Martin Henderson, Daveigh Chase, Brian Cox, David Dorfman
Plot- Some teenagers are killed when they watch a weird tape at a lodge. Rachel (Watts) is a journalist and she decides to find out what really happened to those kids, and the story behind the infamous tape.This Movie is not as bad as some people claim, I have to admit, it had me white knuckled, grabbing the arms of my chair, jumping and sometimes screaming. But, it used cheap methods to get me to do that jumping and screaming.The acting is top notch, Naomi Watts was meant for this role, this girl can act! Brian Cox is also wonderful as Richard Morgan. Little David Dorfman is my only annoyance, hes just to serious and over acts a bit.My huge problem with this film is all the loud noises that indicate scene changes. Horror movies like this should have you feeling suspenseful and wondering whats going to happen next, not sitting there panicking about when the next huge loud noise is going to be. And literally, panicking is the only word for it.This film in one word- CREEPY. I recommend it to anyone who likes horror and doesn't mind a ton of jump scenes.",Null,0,1,22 November 2003
Hostel," Better than Cabin Fever...but still not great
","If only I could get Eli Roth to sit down for an interview, there is so much I would like to discuss with him. I really enjoyed Cabin Fever the first time I saw it. Although the more I analyze it, the less I like it, it's not a bad movie. When I heard about this new sadistic thriller with Roth's name on it, I was immediately curious. I didn't get a chance to see it in theaters, but I rented it the day it came out on DVD to quench my curiosity. I made sure I avoided any reviews of it, so I went into it with expectations for a really, truly sadistic gory ride.I was not disappointed. Using three (almost)unknowns as the leads was a good idea. Jay Hernandez was especially believable and sympathetic. The story is not important...lots of booze, drugs, and foreign-girl sex. The good part starts in a dark basement of a huge warehouse. This is where Elite Hunting is headquartered. In the dingy, dirty rooms, people can pay money to torture and kill tourists. Yep...thats basically it.Roth took this idea and ran. He ran straight for the gore. If you're a gore hound like me, this film delivers. This contains one of the very few scenes which made me feel sick to my stomach. Overall, I recommend it...but definitely not for the faint of heart.",6,0,0,18 April 2006
Match Point," Worth The Wait
","I remember sitting in a theater, waiting for the feature presentation to start, and watching the preview for Match Point. It's always a fun experience, because in the trailers, all movies look great. When I saw the trailer for Match Point, I was in a mood where I was sick of Scarlett Johansson and all the attention she was getting. But then I saw the beautiful face of Jonathan Rhys Meyers, and I kinda got excited for this one. When I found out that Woody Allen was directing sealed the deal. Too bad it was rated R. Being only 16 with restrictive parents, this was a bad sign.When I turned 17 and got a Netflix account, Match Point quickly moved it's way to the top of my queue. I popped it into my DVD player at around 11 o'clock at night and settled in for a night of Woody Allen flavored goodness. It was nothing like I expected, yet still served it's purpose. Scarlett Johansson plays an almost-but-not-quite stereotypical obsessive, sexy, psycho mistress. Through the first hour, I was pretty sick of her because she looked like she was just showing up for the paycheck, and not really giving it the talent I know she has. Then when the big plot twist comes, everything changes. She turns in one of the best performances of her career thus far. Her and Rhys Meyers have explosive chemistry that lights up the screen from the first time they meet.This film was definitely worth the wait. It is a rare movie that can keep me awake past 12:30. It's so Un-Woody Allen, but you can see a few elements of his genius. I'd definitely recommend this to a friend.",8,0,2,29 May 2006
The Descent," A Claustrophobic's Nightmare
","Six adventurous twenty-something girlfriends go on a daring descent into uncharted caves. One woman is dealing with the loss of her husband and daughter, and by the end of the movie she has lost a lot more than that; including her sanity.With an almost all female cast, The Descent stands out in the field of horror movies. It's a fresh, original plot with creepy monsters and great jumpy scares. But with a misleading trailer and not-quite-wide-enough release, I'm afraid this one will get passed over at the box office.Throughout the movie, we are thrown into almost complete darkness many times. There are scenes which would make claustrophobics hyperventilate. There's no denying it: This is a scary one. But it's so much more than that. It's a study of how one emotionally damaged woman deals with circumstances that would make grown men wet themselves. Friendships begin and end, secrets come out, and we are left stunned as these women battle not only the cave monsters, but their own instincts.Final Score: 8/10",8,3,7,25 August 2006
The Lion King," Great Music, Great Movie
","First and Foremost, this is a great Disney animated film, as almost all are. The story is endearing and Simba, Nala, Timon, and Pumba all capture your heart. The other outstanding part of this movie is the wonderful music of Elton John, this movie showcases his amazing musical talent in a great way!",9,0,0,9 January 2003
Click," Surprisingly enough...an Adam Sandler movie I didn't hate
","Let my start by saying this: I have no respect for Adam Sandler. I hated Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, The Water Boy, and even Punch Drunk Love. I'm not a fan. However, my boyfriend is of a different opinion and insisted on watching Click the day it was released on DVD.I was very happily surprised.Adam Sandler plays Michael, a workaholic father of two who always lets his job as an architect come before his family. One day he walks into the waaaaay back of a Bed Bath & Beyond looking for a universal remote control. He is helped by an eccentric sales clerk played by the wonderful Christopher Walken. He gives him an 'experimental' blue remote control with the warning 'This item is non-returnable.' But this is no normal remote control. Michael soon discovers that he can pause, fast forward, mute, and (kind of) rewind his entire life. Soon, the remote begins fast-forwarding all by itself. Michael misses out on huge important portions of his life, but he can't rewind and do them over. He can only go back and watch how he ignored his family, and neglected everything except his job.This movie teaches us a very obvious lesson. Family is the most important thing, and it should always come first. I love the scenes when Michael realizes this, and falls in love with his family all over again. I'm not sure Adam Sandler would have been my first though for the role, but after watching it, I can't imagine anyone else.Overall, Click gave me a tiny bit of respect for Adam Sandler, and I'm gonna go try to watch Happy Gilmore again...wish me luck.",Null,0,1,23 October 2006
Evil Dead II," Classic? Maybe not
","I'm going to preface this by saying that I haven't seen Evil Dead 1 or Army Of Darkness, so I'm taking this movie at face value. I can't compare or contrast it to either its predecessor or its sequel.I watched this movie when I was in the mood for something scary...not hokey. I also watched it with someone who had seen it before and felt the need to warn me before anything happened. But even disregarding these factors, I didn't enjoy this movie. The one-liners for which this movie is so often praised were not only predictable, but they weren't funny. If I had to use one word to describe Evil Dead 2 it would be Boring.There were a few bright spots, however. Bruce Campbell is undeniably charming as Ash. The other actors were forgettable, but Bruce is a legend for a reason. Also the 'monsters' were well done and satisfied the need for a bit of gore in this flick.Overall, I rated it a 4. Maybe if I saw Evil Dead 1 it would improve the experience....then again maybe not.",4,4,10,5 April 2006
