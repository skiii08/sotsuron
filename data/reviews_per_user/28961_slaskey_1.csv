The Rock," Best action movie I've seen in a long time
","Always wanted to see this one but never got around to itJust saw the cut version on ABC   and can't wait to get it on DVD.    A total thriller from beginning to end with a hint of comedy.  Sean Connery was at his best,  but Cage stands out as a major star in this film.",10,2,2,5 February 2000
