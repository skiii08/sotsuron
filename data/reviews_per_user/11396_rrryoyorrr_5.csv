Black Swan," Silly Swan
","Where to begin? Just because you don't understand it doesn't make the movie a bad movie. What makes it a good movie anyway? Let's start with the story. Is it a good story? The story of the Black Swan is really simple - even though there are two stories weaved together. One is fantasy and the other is reality. Where fantasy and reality meet is The Black Swan Movie, and it can get really ... pointless. That's right, at first I could not find the right word to describe this movie, but the word, 'pointless', is just perfect. Of course, there are the obvious answers, like it's an Academy Award vehicle for Natalie Portman, or it's so pretentious directors like Darren Aronofsky can garner more praises for himself. I wonder if Aronofsky would be where he is today if he was Latino, Arab, or Asian? Not to say the Latino, Arab, or Asian Aronofsky would not be a director, but he probably would be just another guy without the glamorous job. The movie, however, does not really have a point. Is it that Ballerinas are all psychotic and want to be the Swan Queen? Or maybe have a gratuitous, lesbian, sex scene so it can potentially titillate the Men who were dragged to see the movie by their 'wannabe, dancer' girlfriends?",Null,1,2,12 July 2011
Yes Man," A Let Down
","I was really hoping Jim Carey would knock this one out of the park and have a really good movie. I understand he actually settled for 'points' and did not get paid any money upfront for this movie - that's risky, and he should fire his manager. The movie has an interesting concept and good message, but it falls flat for so many reasons. The movie was very contrived, lacked originality, and did not know how far to go with the comedy. Things were conveniently happening just to move the story along even though they were lazily thought up and could have been better. The comedy was not screw-ball enough and failed to capitalize on Carey's strong points. I like Jim Carey, but that's just about all this movie has going for it. This movie is definitely not for the analytical type, because your suspension of disbelief required to enjoy a movie like this would not be met.",4,3,10,27 January 2009
Mamma Mia!," Ruined, Just Ruined
","This movie is pathetic not because it's poorly directed, acted, sung, danced, filmed, etc ... but because it's really difficult to ruin a movie using an ABBA soundtrack - yet, unfortunately, this is the only thing the movie succeeds in doing. The musical presentations in the movie, SouthPark, was much better than in Mama Mia. The director of Mama Mia is proof that you don't need talent to be a director - all you need are ABBA songs.Just to give a sample of the awfulness: An aging Meryl Streep is shot with close-ups in the harsh sunlight singing and just ruining the song with all the distracting wrinkles on her face. Why do that to one of the most talented Actresses out there?",1,13,21,5 February 2009
Revolutionary Road," Proof that 'some Women' are Insane
","This movie is really great at revealing how some women are just insane, and they drag their husbands down like a ton of bricks. April, Kate Winslet, is great at playing a depressed, housewife, who has unfulfilled dreams of being an actress, let ruin both her and her husband's, Frank, Leo DiCaprio's, 'perfect life' in the suburbs. Unfortunately, this is a story that is played out everyday by men and women who live together in reality. Frank has no idea what he has done to cause April to stop caring for him, after all, he really loves her, does his job as the supporting husband, and even tries his best to understand her. Yet, despite all he does for her, she is still unphased, and could care less about him. For Frank, April's resentment towards him is unbearable, because he does not know what he did wrong. Frank even blames himself for April's absurd behavior, but it is really April's self-loathing that is ruining their lives. The end pretty much sums it up for Men who want to stay in a relationship. Watch the movie before you decide to get married.",7,0,1,4 January 2010
Gran Torino," Something Special
","I am totally surprised that 'Clint Eastwood' chose to make a movie like this - I mean, he has the clout to do 'anything' he wants, yet he did this funny, little, odd, but honest, and contemporary movie about the changing face of America. Although Eastwood does fall victim to his own type-casting as, 'Mr. Tough Guy'. The risk of taking on a story about an angry, Old Man, living next door to a Hmong Family in the Midwest isn't exactly the usual 'Hollywood' movie. Yet, the movie opened to better than competitive ticket sales. Also, the Hmong cast members were just right - Eastwood as Director does an excellent job not stereotyping and getting the generational points across. This movie is definitely worth watching for its original story. And though it has insight into race relations, race is not the pretentious message here.",10,5,12,19 December 2008
