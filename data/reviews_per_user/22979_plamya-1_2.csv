Black Swan," Anything stupendous is worthy of admiration
","...including stupidity. For two-thirds of this movie I was thinking 'this is a stupid movie;' about one-third was genuinely mesmerizing. The main theme is best reflected in the choreographer's remark to the heroine early in the film 'You must kill the sweet girl Nina in order to play the Black Swan.' There was a brilliant film in here somewhere, in the intersection between the plot of the ballet 'Swan Lake' and the contemporary story of rivalry among would-be prima ballerinas, but this wasn't it, unfortunately--although all the components were there. The evil sorcerer's magic spell is cast through alcohol spiked with 'Ecstasy;' Prince Charming and Svengali intersect.The film's aesthetic sense is one more likely to appeal to aficionados of horror films than those expecting a logic more typical of psychological thrillers: taut it ain't. We know that not everything is beautiful at the ballet from the dancers' point of view, but neither do the conflicts behind the scenes amount to mythological tales of good and evil. It doth make me mad.",6,2,8,29 December 2010
Avatar," Fantastic cinematography marred by simplistic screen writing
","The planet of Pandora is a visual wonder, and the 3-D effects mesmerizing. I found myself alternating between bring stunned by the images and angered by the way Cameron drew on every clich√© in the book. Me - G.I. Joe Six-Pack, You baby-blue Noble Savage. My guys bring you Apocalypse Now. I may be dumb, but I have heart and a good body. The guys in charged are corporate capitalist rapists of paradise, and they think YOU're the primitive ones. I'm sorry, but I'm the hero, so I'd rather wipe out my side's technology, along with the poor slobs who are hired to run it.Is this REALLY the intellectual level our audiences operate on? I'd rather think that it was the rush to make the most of the special effects that forced the director to give the back-story such short shrift. Can't we have three-dimensional characters and credible moral ambiguity along with the 3-D camera-work?",7,0,1,23 January 2010
