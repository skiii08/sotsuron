Hereditary," Pretty creepy
","I love Toni Collette, and I love horror, so was excited when I saw it included free in Prime. All of the actors were excellent and convincing, some of the scenes were a little slow (thank you fast forward), and some were shocking, sad, and pretty creepy. But I wouldn't have understood the plot if I hadn't read the trivia. Kind've like Killing of a Sacred Deer, strange characters, creepy events, watch til the disappointing end, and still bewildered. A lot unexplained in Hereditary. Think I'll watch it again without fast forward, maybe I missed something?",8,1,2,6 January 2019
Midsommar," OMG
","The message I got from this movie: White people are crazy! Okay, some cultures have their beliefs, rituals, laws, superstitions, etc. But all this movie does is show how stupid people are who fall into this cult crap. Okay so the main girl has PTSD and found a place 'she can call home.' I didn't find it 'artsy' like some reviewers. I had to keep hitting the 10 seconds ahead button on some scenes that were too drawn out. It was mostly disturbing that the characters found it acceptable what they were doing. Actually, I was surprised they didn't eat the other people. And, no, Will Poulter, referring to 'trivia', this movie was not better than Hereditary. At least IMO.",2,3,9,3 March 2020
La La Land," Not Best Movie caliber
","While I like Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone in other movies, I didn't think this one was all that it was hyped up to be. I love musicals, but this one didn't move me at all. Best Supporting Actress? C'mon! Best Movie nominee? Don't think so. Even the dance sequences were cheesy. Not a repeater.",6,1,1,24 October 2017
