Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," In Retrospect, a Fine Installment of the Skywalker Saga
","This is one of those movies that I have changed my opinion on as time has passed and one that I think when taken in context of the entire series serves it's purpose quite well. I think when it first came out, I personally had mixed feelings (as did most fans) because it was so different from the original 3 films. However, I love the story it tells. I think this is definitely a movie to watch with the understanding that its simply the backstory of Vader, Palpatine, even Obi Wan and how all of it came together. If its watched with the mindset of 'hey I really want to know how this all started' then its quite enjoyable. You could argue that there was a lot of wasted time here, like the Senate debates etc., but it fits in with the larger story so I think it all matters. I don't rank it as my favorite Star Wars film, but to me it's right in the middle.",8,2,2,16 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Nothing Groundbreaking
","It moved fast and didn't do a lot to focus on any particular plot point or character development but it also concluded the arc of Rey and Kylo, while giving a proper ending to Leia IMO. This is one of those movies I'll need to watch again since I probably missed something but I walked out of the theater smiling after this one.",7,1,6,20 December 2019
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Best of the X-Men Films
","I'm sure it has been said before, but still believe this is the greatest of all X-Men films to date (this is pre Dark Phoenix release). It brought together the actors from both X-Men universes, successfully. I felt it told their story in a more relatable way than ever before. the time travel aspect was so much fun and the performances were all well done as well.",9,0,0,7 May 2019
X-Men: Apocalypse," Doesn't Hold Up to it's predecessor
","I re-watched this film today in preparation for Dark Phoenix being released next month and while it was not as good as 'Future Past,' and there are some shortcomings, I think it still has its place in the X-Men franchise. My biggest issue with this installment is the time jump of 10 years after the events of 'Future Past' from 1973 to 1983. While there is some appeal to seeing the characters across the decades, aside from seeing them wearing 80's attire there is no plot reason for such a time jump (aside from Magneto's family I guess). There is no attempt to make any of the characters from the prior 2 movies, (Beast, Mystique, Magneto, Prof. X, Havoc) look 10 years older. I think they don't even look any older than they did in 'First Class.' If Magneto was supposed to be at Auschwitz as a child, then why is he in his late 30's/early 40's? Even if the character was born in 1935 or so, that would make him 48 at the time of the plot in 1983. I don't think there was any reason for the jump from the 60s, to the 70s to the 80s other than to say 'hey look at these guys all wearing different clothes.The biggest complaint I've seen about this installment is that the villain, Apocalypse, is generic. I think the idea of Apocalypse as the villain was a good one, but they didn't do a good enough job establishing his motivation for why he was trying to destroy the world. The opening sequence of him in ancient Egypt where he was supposedly transferring him consciousness to a new body was really ever fully explained. I thought there could've been more to show his origins since he was the first mutant.The introduction of the Dark Phoenix character was a highlight though and now that we know that is the next film I look forward to the retelling of that story.",7,1,1,14 May 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Review After 3rd Viewing
","Definitely in the camp of people who disliked this movie when it was first released in 2017. This is the first Star Wars movie since Episode 1 that I left the theater feeling disappointed. Every other time I have watched a Star Wars film in theaters (including Solo and Rogue One) I left feeling exciting and generally pleased with what I just saw. As I think back to how I felt when I left after watching TLJ, I just remember feeling empty and questioning whether the film franchise that had essentially served as a major part of my identity for the majority of my life was no longer going to be something that I could look at the same way.Now, I've gone back and watched TLJ 2 more times since then on Netflix, trying my best to look at it in a new light and from a different perspective after reading various commentaries and now in anticipation of Episode 9.My general view of this film now is that I place place it in my bottom 3 of the film from the Skywalker saga, but I would probably not place at dead last (which was my opinion 2 years ago). I think what caught me, and a lot of people, off guard was the way Luke was handled, the death of Snoke, the strange attempt at humor throughout the film and lack of answers regarding Rey's origin/parents.My thoughts now are that Snoke never really mattered much in the first place, and I think the return of Palpatine in EP 9 will like answer all of that. If anything, he was just a pawn being used by Palpatine but that really he was nothing more than that. As we know from Palapatine in the prequels, he is a a master manipulator and can use the Dark Side to control things in a way no other sith (or jedi) could ever imagine.I still am put off by the portrayal of Luke, but more so the way it was handled and not necessarily the storyline itself. It makes sense that Luke would want to go into hiding after failing everyone in training Kylo, but I think they could have handled his character better (throwing the lightsaber, drinking the blue milk etc. I thought were disrespectful to the character). I would have like to have seen more parallels between Luke's exile and Obi Wan's. Both went into hiding for similar reasons (they both failed their apprentices/padawans) and both were reluctant to rejoin the fight when a messenger was sent to them. Maybe this will come up on EP 9 as we know Luke will be involved somehow as a force ghost.A lot of people seemed upset over finding out that Rey's parents are nobodies (according to Kylo), but I have 2 responses to this. 1, are we really sure that is the case? It's very likely Kylo is pulling one over on Rey here. 2. Does is really matter who her parents are? It's not like we ever know who a lot of these character's parents are, so I don't really see what the big deal is. I have a feeling Palpatine will be tied to this anyway, either as a Anakin-style birth or as him taking away Rey's family so that she might eventually turn to the dark side... similar to Anakin.The humor still i thought was not 'Star Wars like' but it doesn't bother me as much as it did when I first watched it.I will say that I still believe the whole Finn/Rose/Codebreaker storyline was a waste of time. I felt this way upon initial viewing and I still feel this way today. i think they didn't know what to do with Finn after the last film, and had to some up with something to fill the time. The fleet not having enough fuel to get away from the First Order... oh but they have 'just enough' to stay out of reach of their cannons? Sorry but where did that come from? Since when has a star destroyer not been able to catch up with another ship?So, hoping that EP 9 can resolve a lot of the questionable things from this film, but I am still just going to keep it 6 starts because i don't think it deserves any better than that.",6,4,9,25 October 2019
Thor," Decent Origin Movie
","I re-watched this film yesterday as part of my effort to refresh my memory on the MCU prior to Endgame and while this one served its purpose as the origin story for Thor, it seems dated now and not nearly as good a film as others in the MCU. Watching this again in 2019, this movie looks like it was shot in the 1990's and has almost a Michael Bay type feeling to it. All of those slanted camera angles and quick shots during the action made it look out of touch.
Also (and I've seen other comments on this) the romantic sub-plot between Thor and Jane was just out of place and unnecessary in this film. I'm not that familiar with how their relationship was in the comics, but I realize there was some love interest between the two but it just seemed like an afterthought here and not done well.
Still, it sets the stage for the first Avengers film and does a good enough job with introducing Loki, Thor and the rest of Asgard to the MCU.",6,2,3,15 April 2019
The Godfather: Part III," A great film in its own right
","So I don't know why but I had gone 28 years without seeing Part 3 after having seen Part's 1 and 2 numerous times. I think I allowed some of the negativity from reviews I heard when this film first came out to deter me from viewing it all these years. After finally sitting down to watch it, I was glad I did because it was a fitting end to the saga and a fine film in its own right.
Now, I do not feel this film is the same caliber as the first 2. There is a lot missing from this film, but it tells a different story from those movies that I thought was well done. The biggest drawbacks for me are the actors, either some of the roles cast or the lack of characters from the first 2. Robert Duvall is sorely missed (I read somewhere there was a contract dispute and that's why he wasn't involved). Sophia Coppola's performance is not as bad as I heard it was, but it was still no a highlight of the film. I thought Andy Garcia was fine for the role he was cast in, but I wasn't too impressed with Diane Keaton in this movie. I didn't really think she was at the top of her game and felt there was more that could be done with that character, personally.",7,0,1,15 April 2019
