The Avengers," Mostly entertaining popcorn-flick with amazing action; not much else
","'The Avengers', first of all, is a good movie. While sometimes overlong, it's entertaining, and the action scenes are amazing. However, it doesn't have enough depth to be another one of those 'classic superhero films'. The reputation instead should be 'enjoyable superhero flick'. First off, if an effort is made to assemble all of MARVEL's Avengers, that effort must be made with a little more success than this. 'The Avengers' ends up feeling like more sequel than spin-off, instead of studying and developing each character. If we're supposed to care about all these superheroes...give them noticeable differences, more display of emotions, and a distinctive background. Just because they're superheroes who have some funny one-liners doesn't mean the viewers will automatically think they're the best people who ever lived. In other words, the characters have too little depth. Something that bugs me is that a few people have been saying this is better than Christopher Nolan's 'Batman' trilogy, yet the latter is a perfect example of a series of films that have greatly influenced (and perhaps even transcended) the superhero genre. In 'The Dark Knight' there wasn't a single character who was 'just there for nothing'. Meanwhile, Loki is an uninteresting villain and doesn't hold a candle to Heath Ledger's disturbing, brilliant portrayal of The Joker (who, on the other hand, actually seems like a villain even when he's just not doing anything). How come 'The Avengers' all have to work to defeat Loki and his army, while Hulk can simply toss him around like a plastic spoon? That said, the long action sequence where the assembled Avengers all defeat Loki's army is quite outstanding, and many detractors of this film admit that this is also the best part. It contains amazing cinematography, like a minute-long shot that steadily observes each Avenger and sees how they're doing with the aliens. Of course, the rest of the action scenes are also top-notch, considering there's fighting for most of the movie. The sequence with Black Widow running away from The Hulk is especially memorable, and displays arguably the most likable Avenger here, along with Iron Man. The two that we care the most about.Overall, I'd say that 'The Avengers' could have been cut about 20-30 minutes short to flow more as a superhero film. I had hoped for more character development, since there were so many characters to pay attention to. I loved the action, and was pleased with the clever action scenes, especially the last 40 minutes and the parts with Black Widow. It's undeniably entertaining, and while it's not transcendent and genius, it's a great popcorn-flick. Would I see it again? Yes, but not my #1 priority.",7,20,41,2 August 2012
Skyfall," Rightfully praised as one of the best Bonds yet
","'Skyfall' is certainly not flawless, but it is one of the best films of the year. The movie yanks the iconic character right into action, and he fights the murderer of an MI6 agent on top of a train. I really can't say much about the plot because there's suspense everywhere, and I'll feel as if I'm spoiling a part of it if I do say any more.The film, as expected, contains lots of action, as Bond jumps on the bottom of an elevator and dodges a falling train. In a good way, the setting jumps from set-piece to set-piece: the London Underground, a public inquiry, a casino, a childhood home named after the movie title - - so while there are some scenes that are a little slow and driven by mostly just talking, it's difficult to get bored.Some people have criticized the lack of chemistry between Daniel Craig and Naomie Harris, dismissing it as 'non-existent'. However, Eve is not a big character in the film; thus, it doesn't bring the whole movie down. 'Skyfall' doesn't have to be a romance.The third act also, to a few critics, didn't live up to what came before it, which I don't understand because the third act is practically non- stop action, and frankly the most entertaining part of the movie to me.Overall, 'Skyfall' is an awesome 50th anniversary present. It's stylish, it's action-packed, it has expansive set-pieces, Daniel Craig is a good Bond, and it's entertaining for a majority of its (somewhat long) running time. On a smaller note, the theme song is definitely an accomplishment for Adele. Highly recommended.",9,5,16,11 November 2012
Argo," Ben Affleck, arguably becoming one of the finest modern action directors
","Director and lead actor Ben Affleck is likely to get even more 'cred' for this one. That's saying a lot about someone who's already directed 'The Town'. Well, his new film is suspenseful, entertaining, and surprisingly funny.You may think this film is about the 1979 Iran hostage crisis. The reason is because it starts off with the beginning of the US embassy break-in, etc. However, it really does more of following Ben Affleck's mission to try to get the six hostage-evading Americans out, and the CIA's excuse: them being crew members of a fake film named...you guessed it...'Argo'. I won't reveal any more after that, but that's not really a spoiler.The acting was top-notch, especially by Ben Affleck. The casting was excellent except for a thing that some are already talking about: why does Affleck (a Caucasian guy) play Tony Mendez (a Hispanic guy)? Personally, I think it's not enough of a gaffe to bring the whole quality of the film down, but it's really something the crew should have considered a little more. The pacing is good; people should rarely, if ever, be bored by the combination of a fake sci-fi film and a CIA rescue mission in Iran anyway.The suspense is amazing. You'll constantly be watching to see what happens with Mendez and the six Americans. There's also a good amount of humor packed in these two hours, and it's not just a bunch of forgettable one-liners, it's recurring jokes, lots of them delivered by just the right guy: Alan Arkin, who is the producer of the movie-within- the-movie.Overall, 'Argo' is amazing. So many scenes are well-executed with good acting, pacing, camera angle choice, and obviously it handles the historic story well.",9,2,4,2 November 2012
Dunkirk," Good, but overrated
","'Dunkirk' is not a bad film, but it does not at all deserve the lavish praise that has been bestowed upon it by critics. Its chief problem is that it has no truly strong characters. Now, some people have said that this is a result of the nonlinear narrative, and they're wrong. The problem, rather, is simply inadequate character writing on Nolan's part. The narrative structure is arguably a strength, as it truly does cause us to feel – for a short while – the silliness and arbitrariness of war. The film's lack of strong character development, however, unsurprisingly becomes a more glaring fault as the film unfolds. Its best scenes are mostly in the last third, though the speech sequence at the very end is overly preachy and heavy-handed.'Dunkirk', ultimately, is an example of how realism to a film's subject does not make that film a masterpiece. Depth is needed; excellent characters are needed. I truly suspect that if you were to show any reasonably good film critic the first 40-50 minutes of this film and not tell them that Christopher Nolan directed it, they would likely see little difference between it and most blockbusters that they are forced to review every summer. Yes, Zimmer's score is strong, and there are moments of excellent camera-work. Nevertheless, the fact that this film is actually being lauded by not only audiences but even a fair number of critics as one of the greatest war films ever made makes me somewhat concerned about the future of film criticism in the United States. What makes 'Dunkirk' as significant a work of art as 'All Quiet on the Western Front', 'Paths of Glory', or 'Apocalypse Now'? Nothing, because it is nowhere near those films artistically and intellectually.",7,5,11,22 July 2017
To Rome With Love," Far from Allen's best, but undeniably entertaining
","'To Rome, with Love' is pretty darn close to a mess. Even those who very much like the movie (including me) should admit that. Yet, it's also hilarious and one of the most entertaining films of 2012. The odds are, you will see half a dozen films this year better than 'To Rome, with Love', but you won't enjoy them as much, and/or they won't be as much fun. It honestly had the potential almost to be a B-movie, except it wasn't actually bad.I wished that the stories had intertwined a little bit more. Having Jesse Eisenberg's character meet Woody Allen's character would've been great. The problem with non-intertwining stories is, difficult it becomes to put yourself in the lives of all these different characters. Sometimes, it felt like I was only watching the people instead of actually being able to put myself in their shoes. That said, some of the stories require treatment like that.Take the 'paparazzi story' as an example, where a worker suddenly finds himself famous. I thought this premise was brilliant; but at the same time, the execution was overlong...we get it. Satire on how someone doing everyday things will get in the paper as long as they're a household name...but that's mostly all we get every time Allen decides to switch back to this guy's story. However, I will say that the scene with his wife's torn stockings being mentioned on the red carpet is downright hilarious.I liked the story with Woody, and it was nice to see him acting in his own film, which he hasn't done since 'Scoop'. It was a bit silly, but still creative. I'd say that one has the greatest one-liners ('you're figuring that in Euros, in American Dollars it's much less'). It has a jesting, visual style of humor that worked well.The story with Penelope Cruz had a subtle and well-executed twist near the end, and it was mildly funny but not as much as the one with Allen's acting. I felt that the Jesse Eisenberg story was very stylish, despite being another one where you felt like you were just watching them.Overall, I'd say that 'To Rome, with Love' is guaranteed to be one of the most enjoyable films of the year, even though it has very little cohesiveness; none of the stories are really expansive enough for a feature-length film. At times, certain elements are silly and borderline implausible, yet the film stays fresh with great cinematography and visuals of Rome, as well as sufficient comedy. Nearly a mess, but a surprisingly charming one at that.",7,2,6,25 July 2012
The Artist," Beautifully directed and amazingly acted masterpiece
","It should be made clear: many consider this film to be the best of the year. Masterfully made, 'The Artist' soars in just about every redeeming quality thinkable: character development, exceptional acting, etc. It's difficult to talk about such a masterpiece without including a string of compliments. Actors in the film mostly use gestures and expressions rather than words, but it is still clear how they feel about something. It's full of surprises and is primarily a romance story, although it contains just as much comedy and drama. In one instance, music from the score of Alfred Hitchcock's film 'Vertigo' is used, but it ends up still fitting well with the scene it accompanies. There's really no reason to not see this, and there's a perfect reason it received an avalanche of prestigious awards.",9,3,5,31 January 2012
Moonrise Kingdom," Arguably, Wes Anderson's greatest yet
","MOONRISE KINGDOM, directed by Wes Anderson, is a quirky masterpiece; full of meticulous attention to detail, as well as stylish cinematography. Many of the auteur's signature filming techniques are on display here: optical zooms, deadpan humor; vivid and bright colors, long and smooth panning. But one thing that makes it better than, or equal to, other phenomenal movies of his like RUSHMORE or THE DARJEELING LIMITED is the character development of it all (maybe even mostly the characters themselves, including their costume design). Multiple people that differ greatly become likable through harsh, yet funny dialog ('That's a loaded question'), as well as their reactions to the sticky situations that surround them.This clever tool, also used in FANTASTIC MR. FOX, especially comes in handy for a film like this, because MOONRISE KINGDOM contains many different fragments making up a single plot: a storm striking, the romance of two people 12 years old, the town's frantic efforts to find them, etc. It's a busy movie, but also one of the best and most enjoyable of the year because of the way everything is handled; each character serves a purpose.Lines are delivered by great actors/actresses like Tilda Swinton (giving a great performance as Social Services) and the occasionally funny Bruce Willis. Bob Balaban is also there (dressed as a garden gnome) to occasionally give the viewers subtle narration on the history of the idyllic New Penzance (a New England island). Of course, there's a Jason Schwartzman role, as usual in Anderson films. At times, one might think that all of the famous actors/actresses are an overload and an attempt to give the film more buzz. But this is not the case; each actor/actress precisely fits the role of their character.With a gorgeous set, opulent-quality cinematography, nonlinear characters, and brilliant writing, MOONRISE KINGDOM is arguably Wes Anderson's greatest yet. It may not seem to be for those accusing the auteur of style over substance, but this one's got both, so there shouldn't be that many worries over that either.",9,4,8,8 July 2012
The Great Gatsby," Luhrmann's 'Gatsby' may seem gaudy at first, but overall, it works
","Baz Luhrmann's 2013 'The Great Gatsby' is the first adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's masterpiece that I've seen. Apparently, Hollywood has a poor track record with this novel. After five attempts that, according to some critics, would be better left forgotten, this one is a huge success in some respects.First of all, one can't see a Baz Luhrmann film and not expect an abundance of arresting visuals. 'The Great Gatsby' is a great example of it. The mansions and parties poetically described by Fitzgerald in the source material look just as good as I imagined them when reading the book.Secondly, Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is stellar, as usual. Maybe the Academy Awards will choose to reconsider their ridiculous grudge against him and at least nominate him this year. At first, it seemed like DiCaprio as Gatsby was a slight miscasting, although it didn't turn out that way. DiCaprio was able to capture the vulnerability of Jay Gatsby greatly.Now, the reason why I think that the critics weren't so enthusiastic about this film adaptation: because it simply isn't as profound. When Fitzgerald wrote the source novel and published it in 1925, he had written a poetic, cerebral masterpiece (I've read the book). It wasn't a love story so much as a statement about the Roaring Twenties and the bourgeoisie during that time period. The one problem with this film (besides some of the scenes being a little gaudy) is that it doesn't really seem to make that 'statement.' It's much more emotional than intellectual. I'm not saying it's Hollywoodized dumbed-down entertainment for the masses, but at the same time, it indeed seems to sometimes lack that evocation of the time period and its morals that Fitzgerald succeeded at.In other words, it's everything I expected in a Baz Luhrmann 'Gatsby': while it may not show the same intellect that its source material does, it's entertaining, well-acted, and contains amazing visuals that ultimately make it a great movie.",8,3,5,12 May 2013
