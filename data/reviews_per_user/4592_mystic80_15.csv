The Rock," One of the smartest action films made
","'The Rock' stands out as one of the best action films made.  A film that not only contains the big explosions and quick shootouts, it's faithful to it's storyline. The plot follows marine Frank Hummell, a fed up general angry at the government for ignoring the covert operations he was in that claimed the lives of his men.  Frank, along with his faithful group of marines steal 16 rockets from the government. These rockets contain a very deadly toxin that could wipe out humans in mere seconds by literally disintegrating them. Teaming up with a group of ex-marines intent on getting back in the action, they seize Alcatraz, make the tourists hostages, and threaten to launch the rockets at San Francisco. A worried group of military officials and FBI men enlist the help of an uptight FBI chemist named Stanley Goodspeed and an incarcerated British spy named John Mason who has been behind government bars for years with a knowledge of Alcatraz (a former inmate/3 time escapee).  The two embark with an FBI crew that is later wiped out leaving the two of them to stop the general and his band of marines.  'The Rock' manages to deliver the goods with spectacular car chases (an intense daylight car chase through the hills of San Francisco that results in utter mayhem and destruction with a wham bam finale) to excellent performances by the cast, Ed Harris as the disgruntled general, Sean Connery as the wise and wisecracking spy, and Nicolas Cage as the seriously uptight chemist. Other notable performances include David Morse, Michael Biehn, William Forsythe, Tony Todd, John Spencer, and Gregory Sporleder. One of Jerry Bruckheimer's best films. I seriously recommend 'The Rock' to anyone looking for a hard core action movie. Incredible action sequences are a major plus in this excellently crafted film.",9,1,1,24 January 2000
Fight Club," An anti-society film
","In a commercialized society where condiments are expensive, electric razors are mistaken for sexual objects, and where men grow abnormal breasts due to testicular cancer chemotherapy, some members of society can't help but feel alienated. You've got everything. A college degree, a good job with a major company, a luxurious apartment, nice furnishings, an expensive wardrobe, and a mail order catalog, you've got everything to fit the puzzle as a normal human being. But what if you didn't feel normal? What if you felt so crushed by the corporations of America that have literally consumed society with their Decaf Latte, Soda endorsed, motor vehicle comeback, video store chain feeling methods. Fight Club is a film that makes us look at a society that we have seem to forgotten. Where money is no longer currency but is a power and those who yield it invade. Fight Club is a throwback to all the old seventies films like Rollerball in which America is ruled by corporations instead of people, it's like Soylent Green where one corporation controls half the world's food supply, it's like Logan's Run where someone decides how long you'll live. You live in your 9-5 daily grind every weekday of every week of every month of every year of every decade of your life without realizing the fact that it is making you dead on the inside. You've become something you've forgotten. You live in a world where you don't control money but it controls you. You live in a world where your boss wears blue ties on blue tie day. You aren't an athlete, a movie star, a rock star, or a supermodel. You're an undignified product of the system. You're become a packaged slave to the world that looks at you as a drone. You've been brainwashed by a world where morals don't exist because they've been replaced by the rules of the corporation. This is without a doubt, one of the best films I have ever seen because it chooses to be something we're afraid to face. Edward Norton continues his DeNiro in waiting acting style alongside Brad Pitt who completely throws his leading man status out the window and eschews his pretty boy personality to play a seriously evil and twisted nihilist. Helena Bonham Carter proves she doesn't have to do JUST period dramas with her edgy role as Marla, a nursery home meal stealing, over the counter drug overdosing, laundrymat clothes stealing, chain smoking, support group meeting attending loser. The epitome of white trash in bad clothes. Fight Club is a film that is daring and dangerous.",7,0,1,27 March 2000
Fight Club," One of the best films that defines the 90's
","In a society dominated by Disney, Blockbuster, Pepsi, Starbucks, and Volkswagon, people can't feel but somewhat alienated from it. It seems our own pride has been commercialized by these mammoth corporations intent on making the big bucks while sucking the life out of you. You've got it all, a nice apartment, the $800 couch, the jars of expensive mustard in your refrigerator, and the set of overrated, overpriced designer clothes that are just popular because they're made by a millionaire. You go through your daily grind, go to work, take orders from your boss who is wearing his mandatory blue tie on 'Blue Day' but something is missing from your life. It's not your friends because you don't have any, it's not your family because you're not close to them. It's yourself. You can only survive so long from the sellout self help gurus who are trying to make a fast buck, You need something to fill your void which is your life. It's Fight Club where you can finally vent your frustrations in a no holds barred boxing match minus the gloves and protective gear. Fight Club is a film that defies the laws of a commercialized society. A film like Noah's Ark where a flood will destroy all those unworthy and that flood is Fight Club and those unworthy is the corporations of America. Fight Club makes a bold statement that we live in a daily grind that many people tend to break out of. It's a wake up call to the people of America where we have problems we don't know we have.",7,0,1,17 February 2000
Cast Away," Excellent, despite a s*it ending
","'Cast Away' goes down as one of those films that's excellent all the way until the end. There are several films that make that cut. I can't think of any off the top of my head but you'll figure it out. Hanks is Chuck Noland, a workaholic FedEx employee who's married to his job, and about to be engaged to Kelly (Helen Hunt). His job has him travel all around the world ensuring better FedEx services by serving as a hustling efficiency expert who shapes the offices. In one ill fated night, however, after proposing to Kelly, Chuck's plane over the Pacific goes down in a fiery storm and he's washed away to a deserted island. For the next two hours, Hanks finds himself surviving off his natural instincts and his smarts as he begins to salvage what he can in his life. The story is remarkably smooth that fleshes out Hanks' character as a decent man who's good at heart. It's a chronicle of his life as he lives day by day on the island and it's actually fascinating to watch how he lives. Whether it be discovering how to start a fire to gathering food, we watch Noland do it all. However, and there won't be many people that will disagree, the ending really sucks. It's on a so/so basis where you have absolutely no idea what happens to his character. I think part of the reason why the ending isn't good is because audiences want to see Hanks' character live the rest of his life and his re-adjustment to society, something you don't get to see much of. All in all though, Cast Away is a great film to watch.",Null,0,0,15 February 2001
American Psycho," Vanity is a dangerous thing
","'American Psycho' is a truly great film.  Unconventional and most certainly weird, it is a well crafted film.  Why? Because it literally follows an era obsessed with Huey Lewis, business cards, and dinner menus that are metal sheets. Christian Bale is excellent as the chiseled Patrick Bateman who just cracks and becomes a destructive force to any unfortunate soul who has the misfortune to end up in his apartment. From 'American Psycho', we take a look at the yuppie who is so caught up within their own pathetic existence that they are oblivious to the real world itself. An example includes a frustrated Bateman drawing a photo of one of his victim's decapitations on a paper table cover with crayons. His high maintenence girlfriend (Reese Witherspoon in a small role) is too busy looking over photos of herself. A friend had to explain the film to me after I saw it because there are a lot of details that go relatively unnoticed in the film. With considerable gore aside, 'American Psycho' forces you to look at yourself as a human being and has you ask yourself 'Are you happy with what you've become?' Mary Harron does an excellent job with the cast. The film centers on Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman so supporting cast members like Sevigny, Defoe, and Leto have small roles in the film.",Null,0,0,1 June 2000
Being John Malkovich," Bizarre, bizarre film
",The Twilight Zone is back in this oddball independent film in which a puppeteer discovers a portal behind his cabinet that leads to the mind of actor John Malkovich. Things get dangerous when his wife (a virtually unrecognizable Cameron Diaz) and sexpot office worker (Catherine Keener) fall in love through one person which is Malkovich. A very bizarre movie with a very weird ending. Great writing though and Charlie Sheen is in top form spoofing himself.,9,0,0,3 November 1999
Man on the Moon," Excellent Film
","One of Jim Carrey's finest films.  Carrey eschews his Ace Ventura/Dumb & Dumber persona to fill the shoes of Andy Kaufman. Man On The Moon is the story of Kaufman from his days as a television star on Taxi to his career killing intergender wrestling champ.  Danny DeVito plays George Shapiro, Kaufman's manager who finds himself defending Andy constantly. Paul Giamatti plays Kaufman's best friend Bob Zmuda and Courtney Love plays Kaufman's girlfriend Lynne Marguilles.  The film is fairly accurate in depicting Kaufman's life from his days doing standup where he introduced us to Foreign Man who later became Latka Gravas to his Carnegie Hall show to his death. Carrey does an outstanding job as the mysterious Kaufman with the cast doing just as impressive a job.",9,0,0,20 January 2000
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Awful Sequel meant to profit off of the original
","It's hard to believe Steven Spielberg, the man behind Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, ET, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and Jurassic Park, the latter being the better to this sequel I'm about to analyze. The Lost World is probably one of the most pointless sequels I've seen. The film is barely close to the book only taking a few characters from the book and making the movie meant to be a human buffet. The movie follows Ian Malcom, a couple years after the disaster at the original Jurassic Park being sent by sick millionaire Jon Hammond into Site B, a hidden site created by Hammond that surprisingly survived. Malcom goes in to save his girlfriend, Sarah, an all too ambitious nature scientist along with the help of a cocky photographer (Vince Vaughn) and a dispensible scientist (Richard Schiff). Of course, Hammond's snotty nephew (Arliss Howard) and his group of men go into the island as well to take some of the dinosaurs and put them into their San Diego park. All hell breaks loose leaving people to be attacked, eaten, and crushed by the dreadful dinosaurs. They decide to drag the action on by having a T-Rex come into San Diego which only breaks out into more disaster. I had high expectations for this movie and was quite disappointed with how it turned out. A particularly gut wrenching sequence involves Malcom's daughter randomly performing stupid aerobics moves on a raptor and knocking it on it's ass. A word to Michael Crichton: Write the script to your book.",Null,0,1,21 September 1999
The Game," Smartly crafted thriller
","The Game is the story of wealthy but coldhearted Nicolas Van Orton (Douglas), an emotionally closed off businessman who receives a gift certificate from his little brother Conrad (Penn) which entitles him to play the game, a mysterious game where the player doesn't know what he gets into. Soon there after, Nicolas signs up and gets a lot more than he bargained for as his life takes a turn for the worst. He doesn't know who to trust and who's in on the game.            An underrated movie, The Game is smart with plenty of plot twists leading all the way to the shocking climax. Just when you think things have gotten the worst, it gets worse. David Fincher's unique visual style is put on to this excellent thriller. Truly an excellent film. Particularly shocking moments occur after Nicolas is drugged and left for dead in Mexico only to come back stronger. By far, this is one of the best films of 1997 and should've gotten an oscar nomination for best screenplay.",Null,0,1,4 October 1999
Event Horizon," Not bad, not good either
","I remember catching this with my friends during the summer of '97 and I must say, I've never been so disturbed. After we saw the movie and left, my friends said whoever the hell wrote that film, is a very sick individual. I remember going out to dinner that night and not bothering to eat because of how disturbing this film was. My friends all understood. Eventually, time passed, and I saw this film. It's not necessarily a bad film, it's not necessarily a good film either. Besides a really poor marketing campaign, the movie is very dark. It's weaknesses rely on it's ability to scare people. It uses really loud sounds where loud sounds don't need to be used like the opening of a door was kind of lame. I'd have to say for gore factor, this by far, is one of the grossest films I've ever seen. I remember reading a review that said it seemed all the characters were tossed in a meat grinder. I couldn't agree more because the gore factor is seriously high. There's one stand out scene that I won't have to explain if you've already seen it. If not, you'll know what I'm talking about if you see it. To describe Event Horizon, it's The Shining meets Alien meets From Dusk Till Dawn in terms of blood. The spaceship is really cool looking and the cast is good but it's the story that kind of falls flat and that's where The Shining comes into play.",Null,0,1,17 October 2000
The Insider," Powerfully engrossing
","A film that is very gripping, 'The Insider' is very deserving of it's seven oscar nominations. Russell Crowe and Al Pacino are excellent as Jeffrey Wigand and Lowell Bergman respectively. Film follows Wigand, a tobacco exec who's been given the boot by his CEO boss on the basis of 'poor communicative skills' which in other words stands for 'c**p'. Bergman is a TV producer for 60 Minutes who convinces Wigand to go on the air with his story of why he may have been fired and releases some pertinent info about the tobacco company. A particularly brilliant opener follows the two main characters in their lives with Pacino's Bergman trying to prevent an already heated argument between a well known terrorist and Mike Wallace (a well done Christopher Plummer) and Wigand leaving his job. Another powerful scene takes place in a Mississippi courtroom where a lawyer truthfully tears into another lawyer and lets him have it. Christopher Plummer does an excellent job as the gruff Wallace who in one particularly scenery chewer, rightfully crushes the spirit of two CBS lawyers with some seriously hurtful insults. Michael Mann uses his visual flair to bring story to the controversial subject of tobacco, the media, and the destruction of man.",Null,0,0,20 June 2000
The Green Mile," If this film doesn't get one oscar nomination, then the academy sucks
","This intense prison drama has got to be one of Stephen King's best films. King and writer/director Frank Darabont once again deliver the goods as they did previously with the Shawshank Redemption. The film follows Paul Edgecombe, a death row prison guard in a 1930's southern prison who discovers one of the inmates, John Coffey, a convicted child murderer/rapist, isn't who he appears to be. He's a gentle giant, afraid of the dark who has a mysterious healing power and is a miracle of God. The performances are 100% in the can. Tom Hanks is in one of the best films of his career in this film that will make you laugh and cry. Michael Duncan is most definitely deserving of an oscar nomination for his role as the gentle giant. The supporting cast like David Morse, Jeffrey DeMunn, Barry Pepper, James Cromwell, Bonnie Hunt, Dabbs Greer, Michael Jeter, Sam Rockwell, Graham Greene, and particularly Doug Hutchison as the evil Percy Wetmore are incredible. The three hours quickly pass because of this incredible film. Frank Darabont stands out as one of the finest filmmakers who knows how to craft a film that can absorb it's viewer and make them sympathize for the characters.",10,0,1,25 January 2000
Rear Window," A classic
","Rear Window, is one of Hitchcock's best thrillers, giving Hitchcock total carte blanche to make the characters three dimensional, so the big finale will pay off. The story starts off with Jimmy Stewart's news photographer, sidetracked by an on the job injury with a leg cast and a wheelchair to prove it. His girlfriend (Grace Kelly) can't quite understand his refusal to commit to their relationship. He ends up developing a light taste for voyeurism, due to the inevitable view of the back of apartment building in full view of he. The story, however, kicks off when Stewart thinks he may very well have witnessed a murder in one of the apartments. He's dead intent on catching the murdering spouse (Raymond Burr in dyed white hair) as he catches glimpses of what he believes leads up to the incident itself. A majority of the film, is based on Stewart's paranoia, as he continues to watch continually at this particular apartment, and then the tension builds up in the forty five minutes. WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD! In the seat jumping climax, Kelly in a fit of obsession with whom she thinks may be the killer, enters the apartment after he has left, only to come back, catch her, and the police arrive. The girlfriend goes in search of the ring the victim may have had, and as she waves it toward our protagonist, the suspect has a glimpse of her waving the finger in her hand, and then looks up in the direction of the ring, to catch a dead on view of who is spying on him. The moment is truly electrifying, and very well qualifies it to be one of AFI's 100 Greatest Thrills.",10,0,2,22 July 2001
Casino," An engrossing film from start to finish...
","Synopsis: A film chronicling the rise and fall of a gambling empire in Las Vegas during it's heyday. Sam 'Ace' Rothstein has been personally appointed by the mob to head a casino which he proves himself, but at the same time a relentless obsessive whose meticulousness reaches so far as to the number of blueberries in muffins that the casino sells. His childhood friend Nicky Santoro has moved to Las Vegas with his crew to start up a business. In the midst of it all, Sam meets Ginger, a woman he eventually marries, but in a downward spiral of power and greed, they all find themselves in the middle of it all.Review: Absolutely one of the best films of 1995, 'Casino' is a truly good film with top notch performances from DeNiro and Pesci as usual, but the real surprise is Sharon Stone, completely eschewing her sex symbol from 'Basic Instinct' to playing a woman who lives in her dark side. The cinematography of the film matches the tone and look of the story with it's best performances from the entire cast. Unfortunately, Don Rickles and James Woods are wasted in fairly small roles but still provide depth to the film nonetheless. Leonard Maltin didn't know what he was talking about when he reviewed this film, because it's an engrossing story that needed to be told in a three hour length. It's not something you'd pay to see in a theater, but it is something you should see on VHS or DVD. Grade: A-",10,1,1,5 October 2001
The Thin Red Line," A big mess
","The Thin Red Line is awful. It's not poetic. It's not written well. It's just truly bad. Even the lesser known actors whom you'd think would have somewhat of a more substantial role in the film, don't. This film is really messy because it doesn't know where it's going but yet it manages to drag on for an unforgettable three hours. It seems like members of the cast must've smoked pot before they began shooting the film because that's what it feels like. Although the cast is truly impressive (Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, John Cusack, George Clooney, John Travolta), the film goes nowhere. The film is nothing more than an incoherent rambler about nothing. I'm glad all the big name actors only had cameos.",3,0,1,8 March 2000
