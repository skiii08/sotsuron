The Ring," The scariest film of 2002!
","Naomi Watts (who was absolutely stunning in MULHOLLAND DRIVE) gives a terrific performance in THE RING, Gore Verbinski's remake of RINGU (a recent Japanese horror film).The story concerns Rachel Keller, a reporter who decides to investigate the origin of a sinister videotape, following the sudden and unexplained death of her neice.The more the film goes on, the scarier and more hypnotic it becomes. It all comes down to a final 20 minutes that will have you squirming and screaming in your seat.Martin Henderson, Brian Cox, Daveigh Chase, and newcomer David Dorfman give god supporting performances (especially Chase and Henderson).No blood, no big name stars, just atmosphere, dread, and a great film!",10,0,0,21 November 2002
Minority Report," Spielberg's latest masterpiece!
","MINORITY REPORT is the latest vision from the legendary director, Steven Spielberg.Tom Cruise gives an excellent performance as Chief John Anderton. Samantha Morton also gives a riveting performance as Agatha.Steven Spielberg is a genius.MINORITY REPORT is one of the best films of the year.I have nothing else to say.",Null,0,0,1 September 2002
Training Day," An excellent movie!
","TRAINING DAY is a gritty, well directed, and (very) well acted look at the mean streets of Los Angeles.Denzel Washington (in his Oscar-winning performance) gives one of the finest performances of the year as corrupt narcotics detective, Alonzo Harris. Washington's performance is free, charismatic, scary, and loose. Also (unlike Russell Crowe in A BEAUTIFUL MIND), Washington never breaks character. His interpretation of a very evil man is flawless.He practically pops with theatrical sizzle.Ethan Hawke is just as good as naive rookie, Jake Hoyt. Throughout the film, we can actually see Hoyt come into his own and become a leader (as opposed to a beginner). In my opinion, Hawke should have also won the Oscar.
This is an unflinching look at one of the worst, most dangerous places in America.",10,2,13,26 August 2002
Insomnia," An exceptional thriller-drama!
","INSOMNIA is a creepy and meaningful drama by Christopher Nolan (the overrated MEMENTO).This film features tense music by David Julyan and excellent performances by Pacino, Williams, Swank, Tierney, and Jackson.Among other things, INSOMNIA is a well-written character study, with a pace that never lets up.",10,0,1,12 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," In one word: Wow!
","LOTR is unlike anything I have ever seen before! It captures just about every emotion that you could want in a film: wonder, love, humor, terror, adventure, drama, etc.! This is truly one of the most awe-inspiring movies ever made! The cinematography is sweeping, the storyline is beautifully constructed, and the acting is flawless! There is no weak link in this cast! Ian McKellen fills the role of Gandalf like no other actor has ever filled a role. He IS Gandalf! The rest of the cast deserve special recognition as well. Much credit to Peter Jackson, JRR Tolkien, and the rest of the production company for making this miracle of a movie possible!",10,1,1,5 March 2002
American Beauty," My favorite film of all time.
","In my opinion, AMERICAN BEAUTY is the best film ever made. To this day, no other film has impacted, shocked, or moved me the way that this masterpiece has.Everything is perfect: The amazing direction (courtesy of Sam Mendes), the fantastic acting (stand-outs include Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Wes Bentley, and Chris Cooper), the compelling story, the entertaining music, the dazzling cinematography, the messages, the beauty, etc.Need I say more?",10,0,0,22 August 2002
Ocean's Eleven," A classic caper-comedy!
","OCEAN's ELEVEN is a cool, slick comedy!Let me be brief. It features smooth performances by all (stand-outs include Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, and Carl Reiner). Steven Soderbergh's direction is inventive. Finally, Ted Griffin's screenplay is snappy and funny.If you want to have a good ol' time at the movies, check out this solid hit.",10,0,0,26 August 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Very, very good.
","Although it is nowhere near as enchanting and breathtaking as FELLOWSHIP, THE TWO TOWERS is an exciting sequel that (more or less) lives up to the hype. It is a very good movie.Peter Jackson did a great job, as did Andy Serkis, who turns Gollum/Smeagol into the best character in the film.",10,0,0,20 February 2003
Moulin Rouge!," I think I'm in love...
","...with MOULIN ROUGE! I'll start by making a bold statement: this is one of the most incredible movies I've ever seen! Everything about this movie is superb: acting, direction, style, music, etc.!Baz Luhrmann has really outdone himself this time! With this movie, he shows what you REALLY can do a movie camera. He's not like most other directors: he's original and interesting.Nicole Kidman gives one of the most dynamic performances of the year as 'Satine', a dazzling and mysterious courtesan/nightclub performer! Not only does she display a full range of emotions, but she also unleashes a glorious singing voice! Who knew she was a singer??!!Ewan McGregor is just as wonderful as Christian, a struggling young writer who falls in love with Satine. McGregor is a great actor and can do just about anything! He also sings very well... and does a fine job with the Elton John classic, 'Your Song'.John Leguizamo and Jim Broadbent also shine in supporting roles.If you have seen this movie, and liked it, then please purchase the soundtrack! Kidman and McGregor's soaring rendition of 'Come What May' and the Christina Aguilera/Pink/Mya/Li'l Kim pop hit 'Lady Marmalade' are entertaining highlights!If you have NOT seen this movie (for some strange reason...), I strongly suggest that you do. But when you see it for the first time, it is recommended that you view it without any distractions whatsoever. I guarantee that you'll love it!",10,0,1,19 February 2002
Mulholland Drive," One of the best films of 2001!
","From the brilliant, yet eccentric, mind of celebrated director David Lynch (TWIN PEAKS, LOST HIGHWAY, and BLUE VELVET), MULHOLLAND DRIVE is a wonderful film that shows audiences the dark side of Hollywood.Since I do not want to spoil anything for viewers, I will just say that it is an excellent piece of cinema that must be seen more than once to be fully appreciated. The cast is solid, the writing is clever and poignant, and the direction is atmospheric and eerie.MULHOLLAND DRIVE is an unforgettable, mesmerizing, kaleidoscopic, cinematic experience that should not be missed!My Grade: A",10,3,4,14 July 2002
A Beautiful Mind," An excellent motion picture!
","Although it was not, in my opinion, the best picture of the year (that distinction goes to MOULIN ROUGE), A BEAUTIFUL MIND is a wonderful film!Ron Howard is truly a genius, as he successfully displays the confusion and genius that was John Nash's mind.Thankfully, everyone in this stellar ensemble cast gives great performances: Academy Award winner Russell Crowe, Academy Award winner Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris, Christopher Plummer, Paul Bettany, Judd Hirsch, and the rest of the cast all are miraculous!A BEAUTIFUL MIND is a beautiful movie, and a beautiful story of confusion, love, mystery, and genius!",Null,0,1,22 June 2002
Vanilla Sky," A mind-blowing roller coaster ride!
","I don't care what people say. Cameron Crowe's stunning VANILLA SKY is one of the best films of the year!Crowe is a truly brilliant filmmaker, taking the audience on a real mind trip. He fills an already interesting story with fantastic visuals and a great cast!There are no weak links in this movie; Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, and Jason Lee are all incredible in their respective roles!Don't listen to the negative reviews. VANILLA SKY is an eerie, operatic, and entertaining science-fiction thriller!",10,0,1,22 June 2002
Signs," The best film of 2002!
","M. Night Shyamalan's SIGNS is an outstanding film about a priest (Mel Gibson) who loses his faith, following a family tragedy. But, after something very unexpected and other-worldly happens... Well... see the movie!SIGNS is well directed, well acted (especially by Joaquin Phoenix, whom deserves an Oscar nomination for his touching and accessible performance as Merrill), and just extremely well done.Thus far, it's the best film of the year!",Null,0,1,1 September 2002
Amélie," Funny, romantic, and charming!
","Despite what some people may say, AMÉLIE is such a sweet-hearted, feel-good movie. If you are not in the mood to see a challening, thought-provoking film, see this. Not only will it cheer you up, but it will make you feel differently about the way you interact with people.Featuring a great performance by Audrey Tautou, and brilliant direction by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, AMÉLIE is pure magic!",10,0,1,26 August 2002
Donnie Darko," A dark, original, and imaginative masterpiece!
","From the creation of up-and-coming director/writer Richard Kelly, DONNIE DARKO is the brilliantly bizarre story of a young man who is far from normal.Donald Darko (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) is a troubled high school with an intelligent, but cursed, mind. He is depressed, on medication, and likes to voice his opinions without any regrets. One night, he is visited by a monstrous, 6-foot tall, rabbit named Frank. Frank has come to Donnie, from an unknown dimension, to deliver a terrifying message: 'In 28 days, the world will end...'.What follows is an absolutely incredible movie that, unfortunately, did not get very much notice or publicity. DARKO is truly one of the best films I have seen in a VERY long time. Kelly has filled his story to the top with twists, turns, and enough dazzling images to last a lifetime.Jake Gyllenhaal (OCTOBER SKY) is extraordinary as the title role. You can tell, just by observing his performance, that he is aware of what acting is really made of. He is backed by a stellar ensemble cast, including Jena Malone (STEPMOM), Drew Barrymore (RIDING IN CARS WITH BOYS), Mary McDonnell (DANCES WITH WOLVES), Patrick Swayze (GHOST), Noah Wyle (TVs 'ER'), and even real-life sister, Maggie Gyllenhaal (HOMEGROWN)!In conclusion, if you are ready to take a psychological roller-coaster ride into a dark universe, look no further than DONNIE DARKO!Rating: A+!",10,0,1,19 May 2002
The Godfather," The most overrated movie of all time.
","Let me just start by saying that I am 50% Italian. I have nothing against Mafia movies. In fact, I have nothing against ANY type of movie. But, to say that this is the best movie of all time is simply insane.
I saw absolutely nothing special. I kind of enjoyed the performances of Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, and James Caan... but besides that, there is not one really exceptional feature in sight. And the fact that it is one hour too long only brought down my enjoyment. It's not the worst film of all time... but not the best either.",1,48,133,25 January 2002
