Scarface," Not really realistic
",Tony Montana behavior is not realistic. All this aggressive expressions wouldn't lead someone into a pole position in a drug empire.The conversations in the movie are so so bad.The movie itself is still entertaining though.,4,2,7,13 September 2019
Marriage Story," Best movie of this year... NOT!
","To slow, to weird acted, two long, to boring.Technically good, decent and good pictured.The character of miss johannsen is weird tho.In total I didn't like the movie at all.",2,7,24,10 December 2019
