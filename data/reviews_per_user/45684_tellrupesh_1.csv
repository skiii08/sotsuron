Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Sherlock getting better...
","I must say that I rather enjoyed the dialogues in this movie which was quite intriguing. Guy has done a good job not just with the words - but you'd be impressed with the action sequences too.The storyline is is not the best by far and though there might seem as if there are loose ends in between, it all fits right in once you're through the sequence of events happening in the movie.The bond between Holmes and Watson is as strong as ever. And then comes the Professor. Being the bad guy he does a pretty good job at it. Though not as fearsome as one would portray, he's one good opponent for someone like Holmes, nevertheless.This movie is not like a run of the mill good guy gets bad kind of a story. It may seem like it. It's about Sherlock Holmes and his ability to make his every move necessary just like what you would want him to do at that time. Go see!",8,0,2,30 December 2011
