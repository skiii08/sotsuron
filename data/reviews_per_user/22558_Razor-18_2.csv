The Blair Witch Project," Fun and determined to scare you, or else...
","I enjoyed the film as a whole and definitely felt the pull of despair that slowly swelled up out of the actors as time went on. This film had the uncanny knack of being able to keep you emotionally paced with the events at hand. Nothing particularly jumped out and scared me during it, but I was definitely feeling the uneasiness of the characters situation and that uneasiness rose with the characters as the film progressed. I don't think that this film corrects what has been going wrong with horror films over the last 20 years (i.e.: too many FX, not letting the audience imagine anything) but it is a good step in the right direction. The actors are uncanny in how believable they are and how they react to what is a formidable situation. Lost, inexperienced, hungry, in the throes of a nicotine fit and unaware of how each person in the group reacts to stress and the unknown or unseen. This film could be used to illuminate how humans deal with the unknown and fear. The fear, like I said, doesn't jump out and bite you....it simply puts you in its mouth and slowly swirls you around. Next thing you know you are nearly a participant, and you really don't want to be. Good film...hope this isn't a flash in the pan for these guys. Wake up Hollywood. We want you to use this as a horror platform from which to launch new horror from. BTW, don't sit too close to the screen...especially if you get motion sickness easy.",7,1,1,1 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," Very enticing....
","By far the film that Bruce Willis has done in a while but that is not to say that he carried this film. Bruce really needs to let himself into roles like this more often. He wears them well. If he kept it up he could be the American version of Mel Gibson. Cinematography was solid and considering Tak was behind the camera, it doesn't surprise me. Young Osmet actually appeared to put some thought into his acting. Most child actors appear to be nothing more than parrots for the director, mimicking the commands of the script but not having the  experience or emotional base from which to truly act the scene. Not in this case. Haley Osmet did a wonderful job making his character emote. Have seen most of the better films of the year and so far this one captured me more than any of the others. I really truly believe that to honestly experience a good film you must go into the theater weaponless, bring nothing but what you are, your life experiences. Otherwise, the experience always becomes something that was preconceived and you guard yourself from participating in the story. This one rattled the chains of my fathers death while I watched it. Anybody who has had someone close to them pass on will connect to this film in varying degrees. Things left undone and unsaid and so on. It is a tender and meticulously, well thought out story and it *will* get you in the end. Go see it and try to honestly find anything wrong with it. Some of you may be able to pick out the plot early but it shouldn't disrupt your enjoying the film. Doesn't depend on overwhelming buckets 'O' blood or viscous, needless cursing and people lathering each other with their tongues or computer generated whiz-bangs. Even a little spooky in places.....",9,0,0,8 August 1999
