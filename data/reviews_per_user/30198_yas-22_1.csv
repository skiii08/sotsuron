Resident Evil: Afterlife," What happened to good movies??????
","Firstly, I created an account on IMDb just so I could review this movie. I wish I could have put 0/10 but I could only choose 1/10. I don't usually waste my time to review movies which I didn't like but seriously I have to get this out of me.Nothing is good in this movie from start till end. I would rather go and clean toilets for an hour and a half.There is so much to explain on how bad this movie is I honestly do not know where to begin, you have probably read it on other reviews so I wont ramble on. I found myself laughing at the slow motion scenes which happen every 2 minutes for no reason. I feel like an idiot wasting my time watching this hoping it would get better, it just got on my nerves.People actually pay money to watch these films, no wonder more and more people are watching them online because the quality of films recently is just so bad its not worth spending money to go and see them. Everything is fake, there is no creativity in films at all, surely there are smart people working on these films, cant they tell how stupid and ridiculous the films are.Crap film, don't waste your money, don't be curious to watch it, end of.",1,28,56,13 September 2010
