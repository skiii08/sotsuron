The Blair Witch Project," Can you say 'Over-hype'?
","This was the longest 1 1/2 hours I have ever spent in a theater.  If you want to stare into a dark forest through a VCR camera for a whole movie, then go ahead and watch it.  When the movie ends, you are left with a void and you ask yourself, 'What in the hell was that?'.  When you leave the theater you will be tempted to ask for your money back.  This movie has been over promoted/hyped and it is just a way for the movie owners to make a lot of money before the real truth comes out.",2,0,2,1 August 1999
Life Is Beautiful," This is my favorite movie of all time
","I highly recommend this funny, touching and very inspirational movie. A joy to watch over and over again.  It demonstrates that people's experience of life is all a matter of their perspective of it and that they are able to choose to view it however they wish.  Guido chooses to see life as being beautiful, and that's how it occurs for him and his family.  Many of the other characters do not see life this way and suffer because of it.  Life is what you make of it.  This movie is wonderful.",10,1,2,16 December 1998
