Vertigo," best film ever
","Contains Spoilers This movie i´m talking about, is for me and many more people the best film ever done. Why? there are thousands of reasons: Starting from the opening titles, Saul Bass put us directly in the spiral of love and death that is Vertigo, also with the red eye. The screenplay is perfect, each image, look, note from the great Bernard Herrmann's soundtrack, color, or any ditail in the screen, is correlated with all the story and gives it a tremendous dimension. There is a fact that, assuming that is a classic movie, reveals that it´s breaking with the way to tell stories of the classic cinema. When the film seems to be over with the fall of Madelaine from the tower, Hitchcock goes further and another film bagins. The point of view changes from Scotty to Judy, and we now that Judy is Madelaine but not Scotty. But all on this final part is related to all in the first, creating an eternal spiral.Wonderful, perfect, is really a very surrealistic picture. Although is a detective story, exceeds it by all sides from the start.With this film you can watch it ten times and continue discovering ditails. Is inexhaustible. The photography is sublime, many times blurred as it were a dream. Definitely any factor in the film is right: The music, the photography, the credits, the actors, the story, the planification, the effect of vertigo, the flachback, the nightmare, that moment on the forest. . . and of course the one and only Hitchcock.",10,2,4,12 September 2001
Amélie," the best of decade
","The best film in last ten years, Amelie is all a prodigy of talent, with a director who comes from the advertising world. A film that has created an style, that tells a lot about life -this is very important- and uses the visual effects for a reason of script or for the art of tell, not as simple firewarks. The cast is very full, the supporting roles are many and very good, with a lot of characters with nuances. The film is very beauty visually, and morally too, with the hippy spirit. Each story is round. I love it! The main actress looks terribly good!!, but that doesn't count much. wish there were more like this. . . movie",Null,0,1,2 May 2002
