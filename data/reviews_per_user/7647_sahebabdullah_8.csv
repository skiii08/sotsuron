First Man," A deeply personal take behind the moon mission
","First Man is a deeply personal and grounded story behind the landing of Neil Armstrong on Moon in 1969.It tells about the story, the politics the struggles, the journey, the failures behind the Apollo mission.It tells the story behind the failures of 10 missions prior to success of Apollo 11 mission.It also doesn't shy away of the criticism and protest behind spending so much public money on the missions.Neil Armstrong is shown as motivated & busy man who has set his goals straight, how much he sacrificed for the mission.The losing of his daughter, the environment in his family, the relationships.He is seeing the moon mission as an escape from Earth & that's where is becomes a personal story.
The film is slow in it's narrative, and the lead character doesn't speak much.The shaky camera scenes were odd.But the film lands successfully for the penultimate moment which is the moon landing.And that is the obviously the best moment.I liked the film, but it could have been better.The pace and narrative is the issue.",7,0,0,7 March 2020
Your Name.," Lovely movie
","This Japanese animation movie is lovely and dreamy as it can get.If you are bored with regular clich√©d rom-com, you should definitely give it a try.It is fresh, unpredictable and very satisfying.It tells the story about a high school boy in Tokyo and a high school girl in a rural town who suddenly and inexplicably begin to swap bodies.And if you think it is that simple then be prepared to be amazed as it gets crazy and somewhat sad midway.I loved the film very much and it gets me excited to watch other Japanese anime & movies which are usually more original, creative & interesting than Hollywood movies.There is already talks about Hollywood remake of Your Name but this one will always remain special.",9,0,1,9 February 2020
About Time," Heartfelt story
","It's flawed but heartfelt story about time travel, family and life",7,0,0,9 February 2020
Drive," Awesome movie with less dialogues
","One of those rare films which i loved instantly.This is the kind of film which i seek for, which doesn't need much dialogues but a good story with stylish cinematography.The movie even gets away without even revealing the name of the character of Ryan Gosling, it's most important character.The silence & peace in the film is beautiful.The music is soulful & goes with the context of the movie.'Nightcall' in the starting is pleasant to hear while 'A Real Hero' in midway & ending is soulful.Everything about the movie is beautiful.Already watched it thrice in last few weeks and i am sure i will keep watching it in future.This will be my another usual revisit movie after Swades, Shawshank, Fight Club, Rognorak.It is available on Hotstar Prime",9,1,2,9 February 2020
Joker," Great performance but decent film
","Even since i watched 'The Dark Knight' i was deeply interested in the philosophy of Joker.The Heath Ledger performance made it so iconic.So, i was really excited when the solo Joker movie was announced.I was hooked & hyped from the teaser & then both the trailers were extraordinary.They gave the exact ideas about the film.And i really liked the film.But you know what's better than the film? The performance of Joaquin Phoenix, I was so submerged in his performance that i forgot how flawed and one-tone the movie is.I have no problem with dark & violence stuffs but the movie went too far, when Arther killed his mother, friend & the host.And that's where Joker is born & evolved.Though it's completely justifiable why he killed those three wall street guys in metro.But as a movie it needed more plot.
I read on twitter that one should watch Martin Scorsese's 'The King Of comedy' before watching Joker, & i did.Todd Philips pays homage to the 37 years old film in many ways & even lifted many scenes & subplots from the very same movie.I will recommend everyone to watch the same if they are interested.
Joquin Phoenix is an excellent actor.I had watched him in Gladiator & HER, & both were great performances.Joker is another addition, and i am yet to watch 'The Master'.How does his joker faired in comparison to Heath ledger's?? This one will be remembered too, but Heath's one was something else.This gave a completely different view to the Joker storyline, his past, his struggle, his suffering.
Talking about the film, it's really great, but i will remember it only as a great Joaquin Phoenix performance & a haunting climax.",7,0,1,9 February 2020
Parasite," Revolutionary movie which everyone must watch
","Parasite is already an International sensation now, the four oscars are icing on the cake.I used to watch dubbed versions too, but from last 3-4 years i am watching movies only in Original language and with subtitles.I will suggest everyone to do the same, avoid dubbed version and watch in original language with subtitles (Intitially it can be tough to read but you will catch up soon).As director Boong Joon Ho famously said 'Once you overcome the 1-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films,'
Talking about the film, Parasite is kind of a revolutionary film.The first half seems like a smart con movie, but 2nd half is a big surprise. It talks about class division, discrimination on poor. It talks about limits the poor can go to live a better life and earn some money. Boong Joon-Ho's direction is flawless, the story is relevant to international level.I liked it very much.Asian movies needs more recognition Internationally",8,0,1,20 February 2020
Vanilla Sky," Extraordinary movie with some ordinary elements
","'Every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around' This line for me is the highlight of the vanilla sky.It's no ordinary movie, but it appears to be ordinary.But after some twists and turns it gets good heading to a lovely and memorable climax.I have watched it thrice already and i still can't predict some of these twists.Penelope Cruz is so lovely & adorable in the film.Vanilla Sky is flawed & inconsistent but watch it for the interesting concept, unique storyline and thought provoking climax.Watch it for Tom Cruise",8,0,1,9 February 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Fun & sweet anti-hate satire
","Jo Jo Rabbit is very fun & sweet movie despite dealing with such a serious subject.The story is from Nazi Germany period where Hitler is ruling.The 10 year boy joins the youth training camp, and he has Hitler as an imaginary friend played by director Taika Waititi himself.He has nothing but hate for jews.
The film is a satire/parody of the Nazi Germany period.The film gives message of anti-hate.There are obvious flaws here & there.The Nazi Germany period isn't explored well, the Jew side isn't shown much except one character.But the film still turns out very well, and we get conclusion of War & Hate in the later part of the movie, and that is what the film aims for.
The child is the highlight of the film and we see everything from his prospective, he is sweet & likeable, Scarlett Johansson played his mom.She gave an amazing performance in the table scene, maybe that's why she was nominated for Oscar.The Jew girl was really good too.The final scene was very lovely",8,0,0,17 February 2020
