Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Looks like Titanic is still King of the Box Office!!!!!
","Titanic, which is superior to Episode I, sustains its top position in the battle of the mainstream blockbuster films. As earlier commented by George Lucas himself and me, Episode I would do well in B.O. sales, but will never topple Titanic.  Episode I was a worthy opponent, but such a film with great effects, but a mediocre script, and a stupid annoying character like Jar-Jar Binks, hurt its chances at being number one.  Titanic had great special effects, but it also had a good script (I didn't say great, but it was engaging...forget if there were some fictional storylines or characters in Titanic. ..isn't that what film making or Hollywood is all about? The general story of Titanic was real history.  Besides Star Wars is fictional altogether, so there!!!!!)All I hope now is that Lucas will ditch Jar-Jar, add more on-screen appearances of Sam Jackson's character, Mace Windu, and make Episodes II and III, better than Episode I.  Natalie Portman is one fine actress, and I do hope this part of the trilogy, will skyrocket her film career, and get the recognition she deserves.",5,0,1,17 July 1999
American Beauty," WOOHOO!!!!! AMERICAN BEAUTY TOPPLES THE GODFATHER FOR #1 SPOT!!!
","Just went back here to review the newer comments about AB, and I'm glad that a huge majority of you out there who've seen AB enjoyed as much as I did. It's only once in a while where I would love to see a film over again on a huge widescreen theatre screen.  Personal examples would include Braveheart, The Shawshank Redemption, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Titanic (a guilty pleasure of mine).  AB is definitely one of these films.  I'm going to see AB again!!!!!If you haven't seen it yet, what are waiting for.....shut down your computer, and go now a buy a ticket to see this masterpiece!!!! C'est un tour de force!!! (translation, see last English word typed)  To those who have seen, you know that it's worth a second viewing....no, it a film that you could see again and again.....",10,0,0,19 October 1999
American Beauty," American Beauty is my pick as one of the best films ever made
","Great cast, great script, great acting...what more do you need in a great film!!!  10 out of 10.  Spacey definitely should get a nod for an Oscar! Annette Bening's best performance to-date!  Thora Birch, 16 (now 17), Mena Suvari, 19 (now 20), and Wes Bentley have promising acting careers with proof shown in AB!  Supporting cast which included Chris Cooper and Allison Janney was superb!After reading in Entertainment Weekly that certain scenes such as a different beginning and ending were deleted, I'm glad the director and editor made those changes, or else, my feelings for the film may have been different.MY ADVICE IS 'GO SEE IT IF YOU HAVEN'T YET!  AND IF YOU DID, GO SEE IT AGAIN TO ENJOY AGAIN!",10,0,0,9 October 1999
Titanic," Even George Lucas says Titanic would still stay at number one!
","Titanic was one of those films that people as a whole, embraced and took it to their hearts.  Though there may be inaccuracies in this film, (and which films out there really do not), that's besides the point.  Titanic was created by this great storyteller named James Cameron, who incorporated a fictional love story and wove it in the actual moments of the Titanic from its initial departure to its inevitable sinking. Knowing a good story when they see one, people literally came in droves to see such a masterpiece as this film was.  If you are one of the few people in the world that missed this film, either try to catch it a local 2nd-run movie theatre (the choice of medium), or rent the Widescreen version of it.Note:  Early in 1999, there was talk that that prequel to Star Wars: Episode 4, A New Hope, would destroy box office numbers, and dethrone Titanic to be the all-time champion of all films.  Personally, I dismissed these claims that this would happen.Titanic was a movie phenomenon, while Star Wars: Episode One, will stay a marketing phenomenon, with its true success in merchandise sales.  Titanic will be remembered as the film of the 1990's, not the first Star Wars prequel.  I say to the naysayers who said Titanic would be toppled in the box office by Star Wars I, that you all will turn out to be saddened to find out that this will never come to happen.  While George Lucas himself says that the Phantom Menace would be fourth on the list of films with the highest box-office receipts, I say that this Star Wars film will end up in fifth or sixth place.Where Titanic would be on my top ten favourites list:1.(tie) Braveheart, Glory, & Titanic  4. Raiders of the Lost Ark 5. The Shawshank Redemption 6. Malcolm X  7. Forrest Gump 8. Boyz N the Hood  9. Terminator 2: Judgment Day  10.  Saving Private Ryan",10,1,3,23 May 1999
Donnie Darko," It was a treat to find such a great film!
","The script, the cast, and the soundtrack are all superb!  A perfect first effort from director Richard Kelly!  Can't wait to see Kelly's future projects! Too bad when 'Darko' was first released theatrically, it received little press, had poor marketing, and was poorly distributed.  But 'Darko' has found a home in DVD (I now got a copy), and it's one of those films that lives on through word-of-mouth.  Tell all your friends!If it's your first time seeing 'Darko', please be sure to wait for the whole story to unfold, and you will not be disappointed!",10,0,1,19 November 2002
