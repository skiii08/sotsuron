Howl's Moving Castle," A somewhat lesser yet imaginative fairy tale from Hayao Miyazaki.
","With HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE, Hayao Miyazaki takes a popular British children's book by Dianne Wyanna Jones and transforms it into yet another breathtakingly gorgeous and sumptuously animated work of art. Indeed, from the opening shot where we see the title structure--a bizarre amalgam of iron, steam, and unexpected surprises--loom ominously out of the mist, audiences will find themselves on a roller coaster of visual delight and imagination.The story, set in a 19th century British countryside, involves a young woman named Sophie who is literally swept off her feet by the handsome yet enigmatic wizard, Howl--despite warnings from her fellow friends that this 'lady-killer' of a magician eats the hearts of young girls alike. Soon after, Sophie finds herself cursed by the jealous Witch of the Waste--where she is transformed into a ninety-year-old crone. Forced to flee from her hometown, 'Grandma' Sophie (who occasionally reverts from old to young as the film progresses) takes refuge in Howl's fortress, where she makes a pact with a wisecracking fireball known as Calcifer in order to break his own curse, and likewise, her own.The plot gets a little bit more complicated from here on out, with various side-stories that involve a war, a stern queen who wants Howl to serve in her name, and--wouldn't you know--Howl conquering his inner demons of despair and selfishness through true love. Yet this kind of complex-storytelling has been a well-known trait of Japanese animation, and should be no different here.Fans of the novel that this film is based on have argued that Miyazaki's movie is a poor interpretation of Jones' story (apparently he changed things from the original to suit his imagination). Not having read the book, I can't comment on what parts of the story have been altered or which remain faithful, but as a genuinely huge fan of Miyazaki's work, I have to say that his adaptation is a charming delight on its own ground. Probably the best way to appreciate this film is to approach it as an inspiration for a masterpiece of animation, and not as an undistorted incarnation of Jones' world.This is not to say, however, that Miyazaki's HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE is flawless--far from it. For fans spoiled by his more action-packed classics such as NAUSICAA and CASTLE IN THE SKY, this film offers little in the way of exciting set pieces. The overall story unfolds at a leisurely pace; this worked in favor of his more quieter, gentler children's tales such as MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE, and of course the surrealistic SPIRITED AWAY, but here it sometimes comes off as a bit of a detriment. Given the war subplot and a few occasional action-sequences, one would expect HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE to at least have a grand climax. Regrettably, it concludes in a manner that is slower and more drawn-out than SPIRITED AWAY does, undermining its potential for an epic fantasy. I lay this blame, however, on myself; I had unrealistically high expectations for this film, and so I couldn't help but feel a little bit let down by the finale.Still, in spite of its pacing problems, HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE has a lot to offer in the way of visual fiestas, characters that one can identify with, and of course, Joe Hisaishi's richly romantic underscore. This may be a lesser film from Miyazaki, but HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE is nonetheless leaps and bounds above the weakest animated features out there and certainly better than the cute but inspired THE CAT RETURNS though not as memorable as his more well-known works. Nonetheless, it earns my highest recommendation; see it on the big screen while you still can, for it's one of the ultimate ways to truly experience this film.On another matter, I am reluctant to choose a favorite out of the Disney/Miramax-produced English tracks for Miyazaki's movies because I have found every one of them to be of five-star quality and always a pleasure to listen to (even the ones that some folks are somewhat divided about, notably PRINCESS MONONOKE, CASTLE IN THE SKY, and KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE). But for the record, Disney once again provides a very capable cast to lend their vocals to the characters and two skillful people to direct them (PIXAR's Pete Docter and Disney's own Rick Dempsey).As Howl, Christian Bale displays charisma, emotion, and charm; he tends to speak softly, except for when he throws a fit about his hairdo, but this actually works for his character. Emily Mortimer is excellent as the sweet, sincere young Sophie, as is elderly Jean Simmons as her 90-year-old counterpart. This triumvirate is amply supported by the gravel tones of Lauren Bacall as the Witch of the Waste, Josh Hutcherson as the childlike sorcerer Markl (who can make himself look older than he really is), Blythe Danner as Madam Suliman (an astonishingly minor part for a role that appears to command great presence), and longtime Anime voice-over (and huge Miyazaki fan) Crispin Freeman in a brief cameo at the end. (You can also hear him play various roles in the English version of GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES.) Yet as with all the Disney/Miyazaki dubs, there is always one actor who will steal the spotlight from the others (not that this is a bad thing; I don't mind!), and this time it's the ever-amusing Billy Crystal. As the wily fire-demon Calcifer (who reminded me a lot of Phil Hartman's Jiji from KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE in both sarcasm and tone), Crystal scorches up the scenery and provides all the best moments as well as laughs (hey, he's hot). All told, yet another A+ grade Disney production on a solid little movie from Miyazaki.",10,9,13,27 June 2005
Your Name.," Hilarious and heartfelt.
","Makoto Shinkai's YOUR NAME achieved what would arguably be a most improbable feat: it dethroned Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away to become Japan's most successful film. And what a movie it is! Heartfelt, hilarious, moving, thrilling, and enthralling, this movie cleverly mixes together the central idea from Disney's FREAKY FRIDAY with a bit of BACK TO THE FUTURE for good measure.It's about two teens -- Taki and Mitsuha -- who somehow find themselves switching places in their bodies periodically. (A running gag involves Taki waking up in Mitsuha's place noticing 'his' breasts.) Stakes get higher in the latter half when the two star-crossed strangers use that connection to avert a tragedy. Sounds like a bizarre story for an animated film, doesn't it? But it works. The first half in particular, where we see the difficulties that Taki and Mitsuha experience during their supernatural 'body swapping' episodes, is hysterically funny. It's only in the second half when things get a little slower, but even then, Shinkai manages to maintain a lot of interest for the viewers, notably in the form of a stylized 'time travel' sequence and of course the chemistry between the leads.The dubbing is very well done as well, as per usual by NYAV Post. Both Mike Sinterniklaas and Stephanie Sheh voice the lead characters (and apparently directed each other as well), and turn in great performances. The show stealer, though, is young Catie Harvey as Mitsuha's little sister Yotsuha, who arguably gets the best lines in the film: 'I see you're not touching your boobies today!' she snarks at her sister.YOUR NAME is more of a story for teenagers and adults, but kids might enjoy watching it, too, for aside from the occasional sexual innuendo (which is mostly played for laughs and frankly, is tame compared to what you would see in raunchier Anime), there's little else to offend.",10,1,1,21 August 2018
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 'There's always a bigger fish.'
","In 1999, George Lucas' STAR WARS: EPISODE I--THE PHANTOM MENACE was arguably the most widely anticipated movie of its year. Hot on the heels of the massively successful STAR WARS trilogy which began back in 1977 and wrapped up in 1983, the public was hungry for more adventures in that 'galaxy far, far away' audiences fell in love with. So much so, that expectations were high - perhaps TOO high with some people. To the point that when the film finally debuted on May 19, audiences and critics were sharply divided with the results. Although there were audiences who were thrilled to have another STAR WARS adventure, many, many others were crushed with disappointment, to the point that THE PHANTOM MENACE, despite being a massive box office success, became not only one of the most widely maligned movies in the franchise, but one of the most hated films ever. Indeed, it was hard to encounter a genuine fan of the first entry in Lucas' prequel trilogy, if at all. Stripped of all the brouhaha that surrounded the movie and its reputation in a revered legacy, is THE PHANTOM MENACE really as wretched as made out to be? No. But neither does it live up to the famous trilogy that so many people gravitated towards. The faults many have found with it are a lot more glaringly obvious, especially in the light of the newer, arguably better produced STAR WARS movies in recent years.Rather than serving as a proper introduction to the saga, THE PHANTOM MENACE plunges us into a conflict with characters rapidly introduced that we barely have time to connect with them. That they don't evolve into characters as compelling as the likes of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, or Leia is also problematic. Of them, only Obi-Wan Kenobi (played here by Ewan McGregor), Yoda (Frank Oz), and the man who will eventually become the Emperor, Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) are the ones who resonate the most with the viewers, but that is primarily because we know how they are going to tie into the original trilogy. More controversially, the prequels aims to tell the tale of the origins of Darth Vader, when he was first known as Anakin Skywalker. Conceptually, the idea is interesting and Lucas, to his credit, does make some effort in world-building in his prequels, but THE PHANTOM MENACE unfortunately falters in some of the more important areas.For one thing, we are never really clear on who we are supposed to identify with as the main protagonist. Ideally, it should be Anakin, but he doesn't appear until a good 30 minutes into the picture. And when we meet him, he isn't at all who we would expect. Anakin, here, is portrayed as a surprisingly cherubic, baby-faced, high-pitched little boy, enslaved by a greedy alien. It's difficult to imagine seeing this boy growing up to become one of cinema's most iconic villains, least of all one who ends up saving the day by accident. In-between, we zigzag back and forth between the likes of Obi-Wan's counterpoint (master) Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson), the regal and rather deadpan-sounding Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) as well as her servant Padme (Portman again). Neither come across as compelling or interesting.Which brings us to Jar Jar Binks, an amphibian-like alien who has gone on to be one of the biggest turn-offs of the picture. Lucas conceived this character as the first to be created entirely by CG, and as a major role. In some ways Jar Jar is more interesting than his human counterparts; at the very least he has a personality and Ahmed Best does what he can to make inject life into this role. Unfortunately the character's primary function is comic relief more than anything else, and he's greatly overused, to the point where a lot of his clumsiness gets old fast.In fact, this character's presence also contributes to one of the major drawbacks of THE PHANTOM MENACE. As opposed to the more gritty, all-ages appeal of the original trilogy, this episode suffers from an overdose of cartoonish goofiness which even the original trilogy's last entry Return of the Jedi just managed to avoid, even with its similarly controversial Ewoks. That there are two moments of scatological humor for no specific purpose is also a problem. Even the original STAR WARS trilogy's humorous bits weren't this childish.The real issue with THE PHANTOM MENACE is the abundance of overlong, dull scenes and not enough momentum to the story. Most of these consist of characters delivering exposition and no major action. The most sluggish scenes involve the ones at the Supreme Council, which are mostly just political debates: nothing at all what viewers would come to expect from STAR WARS. The bits involving humor attempt to liven up the picture, but ultimately causes Episode I to be a rather schizophrenic and inconsistent entry to the franchise. Fans have also taken issue with the introduction of 'midi-chlorians' which are supposedly intended to be the cause for the Force. This is also at odds with what the first STAR WARS movie lays out that concept as. Then there's the issue of the villainous Trade Federation aliens speaking with obvious Asian accents. It would have been preferable for Lucas to give these characters their own language, ala Jabba the Hutt (who incidentally makes a brief but very welcome cameo appearance during one scene).Lucas has never considered himself a particularly great director, and some taken issue with his lack of communication to actors. He lucked out in the first STAR WARS movie because the ensemble had genuine enthusiasm with their roles, and made their characters into the iconic household names still remembered after all these years. Sadly, the same cannot be said of the prequels, least of all THE PHANTOM MENACE (or successor ATTACK OF THE CLONES). Neeson does what he can, but his role as Qui-Gon is underwritten and as such his performance is only adequate at best. McGregor, looking, at least at this point, nothing at all like what his character will eventually become in A NEW HOPE, at least deserves points for emulating the late Alec Guinness. Like Neeson, he only comes across as only decent, with the occasional genuinely believable moment.Pernilla August, as Anakin's foster mother, provides a warm, vulnerable quality appropriate to her character, and Anthony Daniels continues to do a decent job as the bronze droid C-3PO (who bizarrely is revealed to be made by Anakin, and has only a cameo where he appears 'skinless'). In addition to Daniels, everybody else in the cast is upstaged by both Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine and Oz's Yoda. Both are very charismatic characters, and it is gratifying to see these two continue to command the screen during each moment they're on.As for the rest of the cast, young Lloyd is a rather odd choice for the role of young Skywalker, yet whatever shortcomings of his turn are not his fault at all, but with iffy direction and dialogue, (both of which Lucas takes a lot of flak for). The same is true with Portman, who comes across as negligible in both of her roles (particularly the deadpan-sounding Amidala), and Samuel Jackson doesn't get a whole lot to do as Jedi Master Mace Windu, who, like everyone else, is underdeveloped. Unfortunately, the rest of the performances are non-existent at best.Lucas' major strengths have never been in dialogue or directing actors, but rather in fashioning worlds and bizarre creatures, and here THE PHANTOM MENACE at least delivers on several of these premises. The different planets in the galaxy exude with imagination and detail, and much of the credit goes to Lucas' Industrial Light & Magic. Even 20 years later, the sets still look quite impressive, even if some of them were obviously down through green-screen and computer technology. The visual effects, while in some ways the major attraction to THE PHANTOM MENACE, are also a bit of a double-edged sword. Stunning though they are at many places, there are moments where it seems as though Lucas was getting a bit carried away with pushing CG visuals, to the point where some of them look too obvious. It's particularly noticeable on some exaggerated looking characters. On the flipside, there are other characters, mostly the ones wearing masks, who do display the kind of quirky out-of-this-world quality that can be expected.That said, THE PHANTOM MENACE still offers two major highlights that prevent it from being an altogether waste: an extensive Pod Race sequence straight out of Ben-Hur, and the climactic deal between Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and the film's other solely compelling character, the evil Darth Maul. Maul, although underused, is a scary-looking character and while he doesn't say much, he's no less menacing for it. True, he does get bumped off rather fast (spoiler alert), but there is a reason why he has remained a fan favorite over the years. At any rate, that showdown, underscored to yet another powerful score from maestro John Williams, is the film's real tour de force.If all the other elements in STAR WARS: EPISODE I--THE PHANTOM MENACE matched those moments, it could have at the very least been a decent enough new adventure. Unfortunately, its weaknesses do drag it down. In all fairness, though, this is by no means the worst STAR WARS movie (successor ATTACK OF THE CLONES qualifies), but nonetheless is toward the short end of the stick. Once the novelty and premise wears off, it's only mediocre.",6,0,0,6 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The second coming? No. A good film? Absolutely.
","When word came out that George Lucas would be making the three prequels to his STAR WARS trilogy, word-of-mouth was roused, and so was the hype and advertising. The year 1999 saw the release of the first of these prequels, THE PHANTOM MENACE. But even though it was the biggest moneymaker of its year, the film has split STAR WARS fans and critics of every kind alike. While some critics and fans jumped out in favor, a majority of others attacked it savagely and condemned it as a disgrace to the franchise. Even to this day, THE PHANTOM MENACE is mentioned with growls of disgust and/or disappointment. Almost everywhere I go there are many who take turns slam-dunking this movie and badmouthing George Lucas.As a longtime STAR WARS fan, I do agree that the original trilogy is a tough act to follow, but I don't think Lucas deserves the negative backlash he got from this film (and its follow-up, ATTACK OF THE CLONES). Sure, it's not the Second Coming like many expected it to be, less lively than the other three films (in other words, more slow-going), and heavily reliant upon state-of-the-art CG effects for much of its shots. And the characters are not as appealing as their predecessors, and, yes, I COULD have done without the digital flatulence gag. But do I think STAR WARS: EPISODE I--THE PHANTOM MENACE is everything the disgruntled folks say it is? Do I think George Lucas has gone greedy and decided to squeeze every last ounce of cash from the franchise? No on both counts. The truth of the matter is that THE PHANTOM MENACE is a visually amazing movie. Every time I watch it, I am just in awe at the computer-generated setbacks, designs, and bizarre alien characters -- something that the previous STAR WARS movies could accomplish by miniatures, animatronics, and/or pyrotechnics. This was exactly the kind of technology Lucas would have wanted to use in order to make STAR WARS more than 25 years ago, but of course that was not possible. (This is why he made those 'SPECIAL EDITIONS' of the films incorporating new footage and/or special effects shots.) Seeing this movie is almost like watching Lucas letting his imagination run wild; a lot of the sequences are both spectacular and invigorating, particularly the underwater journey through Naboo's core and the Pod Race on Tatooine. But my favorite part of the movie is the climactic lightsaber duel between Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi VS. the demonic looking Darth Maul. This battle is outstandingly staged and choreographed with impressive stunts and swordplay at its most swashbuckling.Moving onto the plot analysis, yeah, I can understand why some would think the characters (including a younger Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Queen Amidala) may not be what viewers best remember them as, but I'm not sure if Lucas was really INTENDING to make these movies in the same carefree spirit as, say, A NEW HOPE was (although there ARE some great one-liners, though spoken in a somewhat campy manner). Especially since the first three movies involve Anakin's descent into Darth Vader. This first movie features him as a young kid, played by Jack Lloyd. While his acting is a bit awkward in places, he didn't really detract me from the movie at all. He does display appropriate gloominess and has a somewhat distant look in his eyes, something that is ominous enough to remind us about what will happen later on. I loved Liam Neeson's performance as Qui-Gon Jinn, and Ewan McGregor is a great younger Obi-Wan. Natalie Portman is also a capable young actress doubling as Queen Amidala and her alter-ego Padme. Ian McDiarmid, who played the Emperor in RETURN OF THE JEDI, is bang-on yet again as Senator Palpatine. The rest of the characters are, shall we say, somewhat underdeveloped. However, this is best to be expected, since this is supposed to be the beginning of it all. This also could explain why there are some plot points left unresolved by the film's end (Who's Darth Sidious? Where did Darth Maul come from? What's the deal with those Trade Federation guys?). Most of these loose ends are tied up in EPISODE III--REVENGE OF THE SITH, which probably explains why the whole movie is difficult to evaluate individually.Probably one of the biggest reasons why a lot of people hate this movie is the inclusion of the CG-created comic-relief Jar Jar Binks, played by Ahmed Best. Just about everywhere I go on the net do I see his name mentioned with death threats and utter annoyance. Speaking for myself, I actually LIKE Jar Jar Binks. I think he was an interesting new character for the movie, but there were times where I felt he was overused. I didn't have the same problem with his pompous ruler, Boss Nass; while he speaks with the same 'offensive' dialect as Jar Jar, his deep voice, provided by Brian Blessed, more than made up for it.But while many people have come up with arguments about hating Episode I with a passion (or even the other side who speaks in favor), it has been continually hard for me to do so. True, it's not perfect, and yes, there are some scenes I would have cut out, but I still have found no legitimate reason whatsoever to dislike this movie. It's still STAR WARS, after all. And even though I don't think THE PHANTOM MENACE is on the same level as the original trilogy, I think STAR WARS at its least is 'OK' and, after seeing REVENGE OF THE SITH, I now see what place it has in the saga--this is the beginning of a six-part saga which will nonetheless be a bumpy ride. And as it progresses, one will find spectacles worth revisiting as well as occasional dead space. But it's a ride which ultimately has its rewards.",6,0,1,20 May 2005
Akira," Controversial Japanese Anime classic
","This ambitious, multi-million dollar animated adaptation of Katsuhiro Otomo's best-selling graphic novel series is spectacular, both on a technical and visceral level. A lot of effort was obviously put into making the animation as fluid and lively as possible, with stunning results that rivals Disney's finest. Most Japanese animated films tend to have a somewhat stilted frame rate (for economical reasons), but one look at AKIRA and you would definitely think otherwise.It is important to note, however, that this is NOT a Disney/family-friendly kind of film. Neither is it for the squeamish of viewers (or the shallowest of minds, for that matter). This is a gritty, futuristic, post-apocalyptic tale involving juvenile delinquents, corrupt government politicians, and a cautionary message about the misuse of supernatural powers. Trying to describe the plot line may be a bit of a challenge, because at times it comes across as convoluted and difficult to follow. (This can mainly be attributed to the fact that Otomo was trying to compress his 2,000+ page graphic novel into one two-hour film.) It will take more than one viewing to make any sense out of this labyrinthine story, yet there are cautionary messages that one can ultimately take away from the experience.AKIRA is obviously not targeted at young children, but at a more mature audience. Good thing, too, because the film contains an extreme amount of intense violence (and very graphic at that) as well as one brief but very disturbing scene where a female character is almost raped. The really gruesome stuff occurs in the last thirty minutes in which a young teenager (who happens to be the angst-ridden anti-hero of the story) has his arm amputated by a space satellite (with bloody results), gets a metallic replacement, and transforms into a gross, indistinguishable mass of flesh and gore. The latter sequence is one of the multiple 'bizarre' set pieces present in the movie (others which include a nightmare in which cuddly, innocent-looking toys grow to enormous size and threaten a medical patient). The obviously frightening aspects of such moments will obviously alienate family-friendly audiences, yet at the same time explode with imaginative, grotesque visuals rarely matched in other films (unless you count Hayao Miyazaki's works).Also worthy of mention is the background music by the Genioh Yamashiro Gumi, an eccentric concoction of percussion, electronics, chimes, and chanting. Like the movie, it thunders through the speakers with an aggressive, fast-forward pace and bizarre, surreal tones, ranging from energetic to mellow. It sounds like an unconventional accompaniment to such a movie, but it works.The film is considered the pinnacle of Japanese animation, yet, as with many of the greatest films of our time, it has had its share of detractors. In particular, it took me more than one viewing to finally accept AKIRA. I first saw the movie when I was thirteen, totally unprepared for such a violent, confusing yet beautiful animated movie. To be honest, I disliked it. When I saw the movie again five years later, it wasn't the bloodletting or the plot that offended me, but the dubbing (not produced, but released by Streamline Pictures), which grated on my ears and ranks as the worst English Anime dub I ever heard. (To those of you who are fans of that dub who may be reading this, I'm sorry, but I absolutely can't stand listening to it again.) But after obtaining this more polished, professional sounding version by Geneon/Pioneer (more on that later), I at last came to accept AKIRA as a remarkable achievement in animation with strong, universal messages resonating within its turbulent, gory nature and multi-layered storyline. Even so, I wouldn't recommend this movie for the casual fan, but for animation buffs and as an exercise in artistry, action, and morality for adults, few films match AKIRA as a worthy contender in that category.For the record, I have to tip my hat off to Geneon/Pioneer for putting a lot into remastering this controversial classic, and providing an all-new English re-dub. Produced by the folks responsible for top-quality productions for shows such as COWBOY BEBOP and OUTLAW STAR (AniMaze, inc.), this new version is superior to the original in every way. The new English cast (which includes stalwart Anime voiceovers such as Johnny Yong Bosch, Joshua Seth, and Wendee Lee) is talented and give it their all, and their efforts are amply supported by a script which is not only more coherent but faithful in spirit and meaning to the subtitles. (Using a direct literal translation in a dub can sometimes result disastrously, but this happens to be an exception.) The only weakness is that the spoken lines do not always mesh with the moving mouth since AKIRA's original Japanese dialogue was, unlike most Anime, recorded BEFORE animation began (hence why the animation is obviously synched more to the Japanese language track). While this new version may not be perfect, it certainly comes close, and everyone involved obviously cared about this legendary film to do it justice.I understand that some folks have problems accepting this new version (given that they've grown up with the original), but all I can say about this is, if you don't like it, then don't watch it. It's that simple.",10,2,5,18 July 2005
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A pleasant surprise.
","What's this? Can it be? A STAR WARS prequel that's actually -- GASP! -- great? Believe it or not, yes. Although technically not a prequel -- it's more of a spin-off 'anthology' movie -- ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY could very well qualify. It's easily superior to the prequel trilogy (even REVENGE OF THE SITH, good as it was, was held back by flaws, none of which exist here, thankfully). While not necessarily a better made film than THE FORCE AWAKENS, I actually enjoyed ROGUE ONE a lot more than I thought I would. Which was not something I was expecting to say.But ROGUE ONE works as both a movie and a bridge to the opening moments of the first STAR WARS movie (rebranded as EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE). It's also one of the few STAR WARS movies to actually show the tragedies of going into war -- something that we have not seen from entries in this galactic saga. A new cast of characters propels this tale, of which K-2SO is easily the most successful. Voiced by Alan Tudyk, this droid is very much in the vein of C-3PO, what with his deadpan, dry humor and prissy personality. He's also very badass -- can you name a scene in which C-3PO wielded a blaster to save his colleagues? No. The fact that this robot does makes him a very memorable newcomer.The most surprising moment of the movie is the return of Death Star Governor Grand Moff Tarkin, as portrayed by Peter Cushing in A New Hope. Apparently CGI was used to make this possible, but honestly, I'd be hard-pressed to know if it were, because the onscreen results are convincingly real. Since the actor has now passed, Stephen Stanton supplies the motion capture work for him. His voice is supplied by Guy Henry, who does a dead-on job of impersonating the character's chilling mannerisms. (The same is true of a surprise cameo at the very end of the film -- you'll have to see for yourself to find out.)The real jewel is the return of Darth Vader, complete with James Earl Jones' unmistakable baritone. Unlike the prequels, we get to see this iconic villain as his usual nasty self, berating an Empire leader one moment, and at the climax, slashing at rebels with his familiar crimson lighter. Although his appearance is brief, he is still the highlight of ROGUE ONE. In fact, the last thirty minutes are where this movie really dazzles.Fault-wise, ROGUE ONE has very little to speak of, other than the fact that it starts off somewhat slowly and occasionally dips into lulls. However, performances across the board are very well done all around (a commendable feature of these Disney-produced STAR WARS movies), and while their characters don't register with us in the same emotional way as Luke Skywalker and company did, they are at the very least soulful and believable characters as opposed to anyone in the prequels. And of course, as usual, the visual effects are of the same standard we've come to expect from the STAR WARS trilogy. It's refreshing to have this movie refrain from overusing computer graphics except for necessary purposes.One could easily ditch one of the STAR WARS prequels and replace ROGUE ONE with the one in question. This movie really is that good.",9,2,3,4 October 2019
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Disney and Walden Media do C.S. Lewis right.
","The genre of fantasy has long been ignored for quite a long time in cinema (especially after a period of hit-and-miss entries in the 1980's), but now it has been heavily revitalized, thanks to the runaway success of both Peter Jackson's LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy and the HARRY POTTER movies. Based on this, it is probably no surprise that another beloved fantasy literature series would get the big screen treatment. And what better choice than C.S. Lewis' enchanting CHRONICLES OF NARNIA? In a surprising collaboration between Disney and Walden Media, the first book in the series, THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE, hit the theaters in 2005, and went onto become both a critical and popular success. The film may not be a replica of THE LORD OF THE RINGS, but that is hardly its purpose. All it has to do is bring this beloved tale to the screen with a touch of magic and heart, and thanks to the craft of highly advanced special effects and fine performances, it manages to do just that.The story begins in World War II London, where four Pevensie children--Lucy (Georgie Henley), Susan (Anne Popplewell), Peter (William Moseley), and Edmond (Skandar Keynes)--are forced to live in the mansion of an enigmatic professor. During a hide-and-seek game, the children discover a wardrobe which turns out to be a portal to a mysterious magical world called Narnia, a land inhabited by talking beasts and mythical creatures. Unfortunately, this kingdom is under the rule of the evil White Witch (Tilda Swinton), who has cursed the entire land to an eternal winter. Only the great lion king, Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson), and the children can put an end to her evil reign.The story has been told several times before Disney's rendition. There was an animated feature produced by Bill Melendrez which aired back in the 1970s, and a three-hour long television adaptation courtesy of BBC. Both of these adaptations showed their age in production values, yet remained fairly faithful to the source material. For those of you who fear that Disney's acquisition of NARNIA means a 'Disneyfication' of a classic story, DON'T. As with Jackson in LORD OF THE RINGS, director Andrew Adamsom shows tremendous respect for the source material, and does a first class job of transitioning it to the big screen without sacrificing its magic or substance. If you're expecting a totally literal adaptation, though, chances are you might be disappointed, because there are a few scenes from the book which are obviously shortened and/or altered, as well as some which were added in. However, none of these 'changes' compromise the story in any way; the magic of Lewis' world is imperishable, and overall this adaptation is commendably faithful while adding to it in the same way that Jackson's LOTR did.There are a few places where the visual effects, as produced by LOTR's Weta Digital in New Zealand, lack polish, but are otherwise breathtaking, particularly the talking animals (including a pair of gently funny beavers) and especially the climactic showdown. What ultimately makes this NARNIA are the sincere, believable performances courtesy of the excellent cast. Young Georgie Henley as Lucy, in particular, sparkles the screen with a radiant innocence and cuteness without being saccharine. Her siblings acquit themselves fairly well, too, although William Moseley's Peter is a bit on the wooden side. Liam Neeson has the perfect voice for Aslan, while Tilda Swinton oozes both evil and charisma as the White Witch.I'm sure that the ages-old book vs. movie debate will last for eternity (in addition to comparisons to previous filmed versions), but this brand-new NARNIA is still most welcome. It doesn't have the depth or complexity of THE LORD OF THE RINGS, but it does have a special charm and childlike wonder which makes it a treat in its own right. It will be interesting to see how subsequent adaptations of the remaining books in the series will turn out.",9,0,2,27 April 2008
My Neighbor Totoro," A wonderful Miyazaki masterpiece in either version.
","What more can be said about MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO? Get this movie. Immediately. Without a doubt one of the best animated features ever made, Japan or otherwise, TOTORO is an outstanding original creation from Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli. It's about two sisters -- Satsuki and spunky little Mei -- moving with their somewhat scatterbrained but loving father to a new home in the Japanese countryside. But the place isn't just deserted; wonders galore lie within their household. Tiny, fuzzy black balls of soot ('Soot Gremlins') scatter every nook and cranny of the walls, frightened away only by laughter. A tall, luscious camphor tree towers above the other trees in the back yard. And, lastly, the Totoros themselves, absolutely adorable little creatures who look like a cross between a raccoon, rabbit, owl, and guinea pig (a personal bias here, since I owned such a pet who reminds me so much of the Totoros here), live in this very forest, carrying acorns, making huge trees grow at night, and playing ocarinas on the branches of the trees. There is even one really BIG Totoro who sleeps under the tree, so cuddlesome and gentle that you'll swear that he's the equivalent of your pet. Of course, he doesn't just allow Mei to snuggle on his chest. He lets out thunderous roars, shake the ground by jumping with full force, grins as wide as a Cheshire cat (albeit with warmth and generosity), helps others when they're in trouble, and gives acorns wrapped in bamboo leaves in return for gifts. The story isn't all hearts and flowers, however. An emotionally charged subplot involving the sisters' ailing mother (shades of Miyazaki's personal life here) gives TOTORO a dramatic edge. This is particularly evident in the third act, when the girls receive a distressing telegram about their mother. Both Satsuki and Mei are extremely traumatized by this as any real child would be if such a situation occurred in their lifetime. What follows is a tearjerking sequence that builds to a truly happy ending. This mixture of real-life situations, emotions, and magical discoveries found in your nearest back yard make TOTORO feel authentic (even with its fantasy elements). One cannot help but find this quality in any of Miyazaki's films, this one included. MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO was not a box office success in either Japan or America, but the film has won over millions of children around the world as well as animation buffs for its gorgeous animation style; the backgrounds are lavishly detailed and imagination is galore in much of the sequences. (It was KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE that would catapult Miyazaki's animation company, Studio Ghibli, into box office success status.) The movie was originally dubbed into English by Carl Macek and his infamous company, Streamline Pictures in 1993. Believe it or not, this was one of the 'best' dubs they've ever produced. As Disney has acquired the rights for Ghibli's movies, though, it was inevitable that they would produce their own version. This has infuriated many, but as someone who fell in love with TOTORO with the Mecak version, I have to say that this new Disney production offers charm and emotion on its own ground. The script is a fresh new translation from the original Japanese (clarifying the origin of Totoro's name), and remains faithful to the meaning of Miyazaki's screenplay, despite a few line changes here and there (nothing major, though). At first, I was a little worried about hearing Dakota and Elle Fanning as Satsuki and Mei, but both ended up captivating me from the start; personally, I think it was great for Disney to cast two actual sisters to play the young girls--it helps their chemistry come alive. The other actors, including a warm, understated Tim Daly, and delightful Lea Salonga provide similarly top quality work. My favorite performances? Pat Carroll, displaying maternal charm and whimsy as Granny (not sounding anything like her most-famous role, Ursula from THE LITTLE MERMAID), and Frank Welker, who does outstanding vocal foley for both Totoro and the Cat Bus. The OP and ED songs have the same lyrics, but are sung by a different singer (Sonya Isaacs), who may please some and annoy others. I'm sure that there will be many who will draw comparisons between the two dubs to the very bitter end, but I think it's great to have more than one adaptation of a beloved story, especially when done by folks who obviously love Miyazaki's works.As far as the long awaited 2-DVD set from Disney goes, the widescreen visual transfer is absolutely gorgeous--Miyazaki's visuals really shine with pristine clarity on the screen, and the Japanese language track features literal subtitles, too. The extras are the same-old voice talent featurette, storyboards, and trailer we saw on most of the other Disney-Ghibli DVDs, which is sparse to say the least, but better than nothing.Folks who want the old dub will obviously flock to the FOX pan & scan DVD, but personally, I'd suggest getting both the FOX and Disney releases--the former for nostalgia, the latter for a more professional sounding upgrade. Either way, however, MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO is far from just another kid's story. With a little bit of luck, grown-ups (and those who consider themselves too 'sophisticated' for cartoons) will enjoy it too.",10,8,10,7 March 2006
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," All things must come to an end... even a classic space saga.
","This final entry in George Lucas's STAR WARS movies is often regarded as the weakest of the lot. However, this is not to say that it is a totally worthless entry in the series. On the contrary. Sure, it's not as groundbreaking as its predecessors and a bit more slow-going at times, but RETURN OF THE JEDI still offers a lot to warrant the price of admission.The first third of the movie, where Luke and his friends rescue Han from the palace of Jabba the Hutt, is a classic. Jabba, a truly disgusting blob of bloated flesh who speaks in his own language, not only makes a great villain, but a memorable one, too. It must have been a nightmare to construct this giant puppet, much less give it the spark and life that we see on the finished product. Actually, what also makes this sequence fun is the clever use of puppets for the various members of Jabba's court, including the intimidating, slavering Rancor and scary Sarlaac pit monster. It builds masterfully to its climax and pulls punches all the while.Things get a little bit slower around the second act, where Luke discovers that he and Leia are related by blood and when we travel to the forest planet of Endor, home of the cuddlesome yet stalwart Ewoks. Most of the complaints about RETURN OF THE JEDI that I've read seem to be centered on these furry creatures, in that they somehow disrupt the tone of the saga. I don't totally agree with that, although this moment is probably played out a bit longer than it should. However, their leader, Wicket (played by Warrick Davis) is a delightfully memorable creation, and watching how they handle the Imperial Troops' technology with their simple, natural weapons provides a nice contrast.By the time we get to the third act, though, the pace picks up again, as we intercut between the Ewoks battle against the troops, Lando and the Rebel Forces launching an attack against the Empire's all-new half-completed Death Star, and Luke's final showdown with Darth Vader and the Emperor. The latter ties with the Jabba Palace sequence as the highlight of the movie. Mark Hamill flexes his acting chops once again as Luke Skywalker in these scenes, and watching him as a fully matured Jedi Knight makes for an unforgettable performance. Also, as iconic as James Earl Jones' voice as Darth Vader is, he is rivaled only by the shriveled, crone-like Emperor, played with deliciously raspy, frightening evil by Ian McDiarmid. The tension between this trio heightens the excitement of this climactic moment, which is appropriately darkly lit and menacingly underscored.The STAR WARS movies have always set standards for special effects, and the technical work in RETURN OF THE JEDI can easily hold a candle to its predecessors. The space battle fights are as exhilarating as always, and the speeder bike chase through the forest is a knockout. Of course, given that this movie was made after A NEW HOPE and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, it probably shouldn't be so surprising that the special effects have reached an even greater level of excellence. The acting is classic STAR WARS fare; Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher all mature and deepen into their roles, and Anthony Daniels provides more hilarious moments as C-3PO. Frank Oz's Yoda only appears in two scenes, but he makes the most of it. And yes, there's also John Williams' music.All told, while RETURN OF THE JEDI falters a little bit in the middle, the first and third acts deliver in style, making this a rather satisfactory finale to one of the greatest sagas ever.In 1997, George Lucas re-released the classic STAR WARS in digitally restored (and revamped) 'Special Editions', which featured added-in effects and/or shots as well as some enhancements. Of the three, RETURN OF THE JEDI appears to have caused the most commotion with STAR WARS fans. Perhaps it can be due to the jarringly out-of-place (albeit funny if you're not so easily offended) 'Jedi Rocks' musical number in Jabba's Palace, which, although technically amazing, does disrupt the flow of the film. However, I DID like the ending montage scenes where we see victory celebrations occurring on the various planets of the galaxy. This DVD version features yet more tweaking--we get to see more montage finale scenes (notably on Naboo, where we hear what sounds like Jar Jar Binks screaming, 'Wesa free!'), and, in what is probably the most controversial change, Hayden Christensen as the specter of Anakin Skywalker in the closing scenes. Probably due to the intense (and unfair) disdain fans have for his somewhat shaky work in EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES it seems inevitable that fans would put this edition down for that alone. However, if you're watching the STAR WARS saga chronologically (and contemplating about it), chances are you may react a little differently. Nonetheless, it is an issue that fans have raised, so it's probably best to be warned beforehand.As nice as it would be to have Lucas release the original versions of these three classic films, he nonetheless stands by what he said about these revamps being the 'definitive' editions of his classic trilogy, and, when viewing the STAR WARS movies altogether as one complete saga (as Lucas intended), it actually makes sense to keep them technically and aurally consistent. The original films will always be engraved in our memories, but these new incarnations are just as much fun, if one can give them a chance.",10,29,40,2 September 2005
Tangled," Some magical moments, but no match for Disney's better films.
","Disney animation certainly hasn't been what it used to be. After a share of mediocre to bad animated movies, they churned out an instant classic with the traditionally animated THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG. But that film didn't catch on with the public as much as it should have (of course being released around the same time as the mega-super hit AVATAR didn't help matters either). Blaming the underperformance of their film on an assumption that boys were turned off by the phrase 'princess', Disney decided to rename their subsequent feature, RAPUNZEL, a similar fairy tale in digital 3-D CGI. This name change is something that I still can't shake my head over. I realize the motivation was to try and attract more people, but c'mon, TANGLED? Sounds more like self-parody if you ask me! As expected, RAPUNZEL -- OK, OK, TANGLED -- is a very loose retelling of the famous Brother's Grimm tale. The title character is a young woman with the largest amount of golden hair imaginable shut away in a tower deep in the forest. Her only guardian is Mother Gothel, who stole the child away from her parents when she was very young. Rapunzel's hair has magic powers; it can heal cuts and make even a centuries-old being still appear young. It is for this latter reason that Gothel keeps Rapunzel captive, although of course our blonde heroine is told by her 'mother' that the world is a dark and scary place and that she should stay in the tower. (If this doesn't give you echoings of Disney's HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, then what will?) Of course, Rapunzel years to explore the outside world, namely to attend the 'festival of lights' held once a year on her birthday. One day, Flynn Rider, a runaway thief who has just stolen a jeweled crown, sneaks into the tower to hide. Knocking him out cold with a frying pan, Rapunzel forces Flynn to take her to the Festival in exchange for the stolen crown. At first Flynn tries to weasel his way out of the deal, but as he falls in love with her, his motives naturally change. But Mother Gothel wants Rapunzel back at all costs....There are many moments when TANGLED truly shines, mainly anything involving genuine heart or magic. In the latter half of the film there is a breathtaking moment where glowing lanterns literally float up into the night sky while Rapunzel and Flynn sing the obligatory love song, 'I See The Light'. This is a truly colorful and imaginative sequence that ranks among the best at Disney. Similarly inspiring is when Rapunzel uses her enchanted hair to heal a cut on Flynn's hand. And the last half hour offers some powerful drama and heartbreaking emotion on the way to its happy ending (surprise).Arguably the triumph of the film is Mother Gothel, who ranks as one of Disney's finest villains in a long time. She has shades of Lady Tremaine from Cinderella, but there is also a little bit of Frollo from HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME. She's selfish, manipulative, greedy, and deceptive in every way imaginable. The dynamic between her and Rapunzel is both one of the strongest points of the movie and reminds one of the Witch/Rapunzel relationship from Steven Sondheim's dark fairy tale musical INTO THE WOODS. In fact, Gothel's signature song, 'Mother Knows Best', one of many to be written for this film by Alan Menken, is strangely reminiscent of a Sondheim song. (The score is another highlight of TANGLED; Menken's songs are very pleasing to the ear, with some emerging as true stand-outs.Unfortunately TANGLED falls short of Disney classic status for the following reasons. One of them is the overemphasis on slapstick comedy for much of the first two-thirds of the film. Most of this consists of Flynn getting whacked around by Rapunzel's frying pan, comical sight gags, and Looney Tunes style goofiness. This gets pretty tiresome quickly after every five seconds. Other sources of comedy comes from Rapunzel's chameleon sidekick, Pascal, as well as a gang of burly bandits who break into song at one point in the film. Both are absolutely useless in that they don't contribute anything valuable to the plot. The bandits, in particular, only show up in one scene that by the time they reappear again toward the finale, I forgot who they were! Pascal seems to be mostly the typical Disney cartoon sidekick intended to provide laughs and/or lure kids into the theater, because that's exactly what he functions as. He doesn't even do anything during the finale.As far as the lead characters are concerned, Rapunzel is an appealing enough heroine, free-spirited and alternatingly schizophrenic (her various mood swings when she ventures out of the tower for the first time, for instance), while Flynn starts off as a smug, self-centered rogue who has a change of heart as he learns about Rapunzel's past. But while they both have a solid chemistry, there isn't enough of it in the film to emerge as emotionally impactful as it could have been. (Consequently, the climactic moments of the film, while otherwise very strong, don't resonate as dramatically as they would have with better realized leads.) Had the comedy level been cranked down by several notches and the story much tighter, TANGLED would truly be worthy of being Disney's 50th animated feature. THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG was a much better production to earn that status. I did enjoy TANGLED overall, but I don't think it's one of Disney's greatest.",7,2,10,12 December 2010
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," 'This will be the final word in the story of Skywalker.'
","As the final chapter of both the sequel trilogy of STAR WARS and the Skywalker saga in general, THE RISE OF SKYWALKER comes with quite a burden. It is a burden that is inevitable with any final chapter in a trilogy, but George Lucas' space saga which began over 40 years ago especially has it tough, particularly when it comes to both the original and prequel trilogies. For the latter, REVENGE OF THE SITH was the best of of an otherwise underwhelming set of prequels, and even then that can sound somewhat backhanded, as it did still contain a lot of the faults of its predecessors. Still, it was at the very essence, the least flawed of the prequels and certainly servicable, which is more than could be said about the likes of THE PHANTOM MENACE and ATTACK OF THE CLONES. RETURN OF THE JEDI meanwhile, was something of a (minor) step down from the fantastic duo of A NEW HOPE and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, respectively. That said, RETURN OF THE JEDI was no slouch, and only marginally inferior. It still delivered lots of memorable sequences and was a fitting closure to the original trilogy.Which brings us to THE RISE OF SKYWALKER, where J.J. Abrams once again returns to the director's chair, having helmed the fantastic THE FORCE AWAKENS. (Actually, the final chapter was supposed to be directed by Colin Trevorrow, but honestly, I don't mind Abrams taking the reins for this last one.) There are oodles of questions to be answered in the film to be sure, but to this viewer, the major question is, where does this latest finale rank? Critics were rather mixed on the film, with many finding it 'uninspired' and less daring than Rian Johnson's THE LAST JEDI, which, while critically lauded, divided audiences bitterly. But opinions are always going to be subjective no matter what, but as far as I am concerned, THE RISE OF SKYWALKER, for me, ranks somewhere in-between RETURN OF THE JEDI and REVENGE OF THE SITH. Admittingly, I did like THE FORCE AWAKENS and THE LAST JEDI a tad more, but while THE RISE OF SKYWALKER is probably among the lower end of the spectrum, that isn't to say that it isn't any good, much less entertaining. On the contrary.However, I do have some quibbles. The film gets off to a rather frantic start, filled with action scene after action scene and random jumping to different planets. Although it's not by any means bad, the first act is the least compelling part of THE RISE OF SKYWALKER, coming across as overstuffed, with little time to breathe. New characters portrayed by Keri Russell and Naomi Ackie are, at best, underdeveloped. One moment around the 30-minute mark or so struck me as very odd and off-putting. Viewers who may have appreciated some of the more ambiguous edge that THE LAST JEDI provided will probably be disappointed to discover that this film disregards much of it in favor of a 'faster, more intense' (to borrow a phrase from Lucas) adventure. In that aspect, THE RISE OF SKYWALKER is probably a bit guilty of playing it safe. Rose is also criminally underused, perhaps on account of the hideous backlash her character undeservedly received, and some might see her smaller role as a way of catering to those people who disliked her so much.Despite all this, THE RISE OF SKYWALKER still manages to offer a lot of positives. The film settles into groove after this hectic first half and offers a second half full of emotion, action, suspense, and genuine heart. The final 30 minutes in particular will evoke tears. Throughout, the film maintains the same standards as the previous entries. The performances from everyone involved are absolutely fantastic, especially Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver as Rey and Kylo Ren, respectively. Again, the dynamic between these two characters remains the most compelling part of the film, and it is the commitment both give to their roles that sells it. Oscar Isaac and John Boyega are also in fine form as Poe Dameron and Finn, and Anthony Daniels' C-3PO, who finally gets a lot more to do in this film than in the previous entries, is, as always, a delight. Even better, Billy Dee Williams gets to return as Lando Calrissian, and while his screentime is limited, he nonetheless shows he's still got it.Carrie Fisher died before work on THE RISE OF SKYWALKER could be completed, and so any footage involving her are actually deleted scenes from THE LAST JEDI. One can only wonder what could have been had she lived. As it is, Adrams still manages to do an excellent job of making use of her. It's bittersweet seeing her in this movie knowing that she's no longer with us, but Fisher still provides enough warmth with every minute of her screentime.At the risk of providing a spoiler, I was at first a bit uncertain of having Emperor Palpatine brought back as the villain for this movie, as he was meant to have been killed off for good in RETURN OF THE JEDI. Having said that, though, watching Ian McDiarmid exude gleeful nastiness and chewing the scenery as this ruthless character is always a delight, and this is no exception here.The special effects and production design are no less great; the cinematography, while perhaps not as rich as in THE LAST JEDI, is no slouch in this film. Each set is rich with detail and exudes a sense of realism. It helps that the film achieves a nice balance between practical effects and digital ones. John Williams, as usual, contributes another fantastic score; easily one of the best for the whole saga. Considering that his music has consistently been the strongest asset of each STAR WARS saga, good or bad, that's saying a lot.As mentioned earlier, THE RISE OF SKYWALKER is tasked with answering oodles of questions that viewers might have from the previous two entries. There are plenty of answers to be given, sometimes to the detriment of the pacing, and not everyone will be satisfied with them. However, whatever faults lie with this picture are not on account of lack of trying. Abrams and company clearly gave their all. (The director admits that endings aren't his specialty, but to be fair, he does a fairly good job with what he has to do here.) However you respond to this final chapter will depend on whether you've been on board with the whole sequel trilogy or not.Personally speaking, though, in spite of my quibbles, I found THE RISE OF SKYWALKER to be a uproariously entertaining work. It IS a bit of a step down from its predecessors, to be sure, but it's still good fun overall. And that's exactly as it should be.In the end, we can argue again and again over the merits or deficits of each of these movies, and whether it was a necessity or not. For me, however, the sequel trilogy comes very, very close to capturing the magic of the original trilogy, which was something that the prequels never could. While Episodes I-III had some reason to exist and offered what we may call 'different' experiences from this one, all three were very problematic on account of lackluster execution. This new trilogy has faults of its own; occasionally underdeveloped new characters and at times delving into nostalgia. However, the direction, visual effects, performances, character dynamics have all been consistently excellent across the board. For all that, I would gladly visit this sequel trilogy again any time. It ranks just a notch below the original trilogy and above the prequels. Only time will tell if it ages well, but at present, these three movies are great fun, overall.THE RISE OF SKYWALKER is the final goodbye for the legendary heroes we've all come to love from a saga that began way back in 1977. While there have been some occasional missteps on the way, we are very fortunate to have endured such a long journey with these movies at all.",8,1,8,20 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," 'Begun, the Clone War has....'
","It seems as though there is no way to dispel negative atmosphere once it has been started. George Lucas's STAR WARS trilogy was well-loved by audiences (even though critics were split) but for some reason (and I can't figure it out), the first entry in the prequels, THE PHANTOM MENACE, earned a HUGE onslaught of critically divided posts just about everywhere in the world, from the press to the internet to fans in real life. While I do agree that the original trilogy is a tough act to follow, I wasn't as grossly let down by this movie as some were.The same thing has happened to the second of the STAR WARS prequels, ATTACK OF THE CLONES, released in 2002. Many predicted that this movie would satisfy those who disliked Episode I with a vengeance, but alas, such was not the case. Once again, critics damned the movie for one reason or another, and the heated debate on whether Lucas 'trashed the original trilogy' or not is still going on. I find it very sad that Lucas would still receive unfair critical attack, even after making a much darker, somber, and ominous movie in ATTACK OF THE CLONES. I'm guessing that such naysayers will continue to say nay to Lucas no matter what just like rabid fans of Anime would continue to slam-dunk dubs... even if a lot of them have recently proved to be excellent.This is not to say that ATTACK OF THE CLONES is a flawless film. It actually has its share of problems that THE PHANTOM MENACE didn't have. The dialogue, although nowhere nearly as bad as critics and some disgruntled fans say, lacks the spark of the original trilogy. My biggest gripe with the movie is that it moves at a leisurely pace, with lots of weak, unsatisfying sequences that last too long. Most of these scenes consist of a love subplot involving Anakin Skywalker and Amidala Padme. When not interacting with each other, Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman are fine in their respective roles. (Christensen's monologue about his slaughtering of not only Tusken Raiders but--horrors!--women and children is frightening.) But there is a sense of awkwardness when they contribute to scenes which involve schmaltzy lines and screen kisses. I'm guessing that they both felt uncomfortable doing these scenes, hence why the chemistry between them isn't as interesting as, say, Han and Leia's from the original trilogy.Only when the movie is in action does ATTACK OF THE CLONES become worthwhile--there's a dizzying chase through Coruscant on floating cars, maneuvering through a dangerous asteroid field near a planet, and a half-hour long showdown that showcases a lot of amazing CG work. Actually, what also make Episode II worth watching are the fantastic set designs. Every location in the movie, from the metropolis skyscrapers of Coruscant to the water planet where prototypes of Stormtroopers are being constructed literally bursts with imagination and eye candy.Of the performers I liked Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan) the best; his acting is still a little shaky at times, but here he seems more comfortable with the role. Christopher Lee makes a surprise appearance as the new villain, Count Dooku, and once again he delivers first-rate evil with this character. And it's great to see C-3PO and R2-D2 up to their usual banter again (although sometimes some gags occur when not necessary). Ultimately, however, the film belongs to Jedi Master Yoda, played to perfection by Frank Oz. His appearances in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and RETURN OF THE JEDI featured him as a rubber puppet (and a delightful creation), but in this movie he really comes alive, thanks to first-rate CG effects. His mouth is perfectly in sync with every word he says, and the final showdown between him and Dooku is an absolute highlight.While ATTACK OF THE CLONES is, in some ways, a lesser entry in the STAR WARS franchise, its assets outweigh its weaknesses; most of the questions I had from the first episode seem to be addressed a little bit in this chapter, and, frustratingly enough, provides more questions for Episode III. Flawless or not, this is still a STAR WARS movie, and for what it is, it's still worth a look.",4,253,413,20 May 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," 'I don't like sand.'
","George Lucas' long-awaited STAR WARS prequel THE PHANTOM MENACE divided critics and disappointed many fans, but the film still earned enough money to justify continuing the new trilogy. Still, it was clear that fans were shocked by EPISODE I's uneven mix of childish goofiness and stoic sluggishness, and many hoped Lucas would make amends with the subsequent entries. Unfortunately, the second prequel, ATTACK OF THE CLONES, is no improvement; in fact it comes across as the nadir of both the prequel trilogy and the whole STAR WARS franchise. While some might argue that THE PHANTOM MENACE is more deserving of that title, in reality, it was EPISODE II that truly brought a once respected series to a new low. Carrying over many of the same faults as its predecessor (stale acting and dialogue, overuse of CGI), and introducing two major new ones, it was almost enough to make many wonder what had become of Lucas' talents in the years since the original trilogy. Even with the argument that its primary purpose is to function as a transition between Episodes I and the far superior III, it still comes up short, the occasional decent moment notwithstanding.Lucas chose to shoot the film digitally, which unfortunately results with a cold, artificial look. It's especially noticable with the visual effects; although some pieces are stunning, such as a car chase above the streets of Coruscant, too many others come across as too distractingly obvious. The scenes involving the plastic glass spaceships especially look distractingly fake.The real problem with ATTACK OF THE CLONES is that it is much too slow going, with an abundance of weak, unsatisfying scenes which last too long. A good majority of this comes from a love subplot between Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman). Christensen and Portman never really come to life in their roles. Neither is there any genuine chemistry and the scenes where they're together suffer tremendously because of that. The less said about the laughably inept dialogue they are slapped with, the better.On the flipside, Ewan MacGregor does a fine job as Obi-Wan and Christopher Lee adds some gravitas in an otherwise negligible villainous role, but Yoda walks away with the show in this episode. In the past episodes, this memorable Jedi master was seen as a rubber puppet as operated by Frank Oz. Oz still speaks for the character, but here he becomes more fully animated and expressive, thanks to computer technology. His lightsaber duel with Lee at the end of the film, in particular, is a knock-out (if sometimes too goofy).As mentioned, however, there are too many long, dull scenes with the protagonists, not enough action, an overabundance of unconvincing visual effects, and a love story that falls flat on its face.",4,1,1,18 December 2019
Spirited Away," A masterpiece of art from the Walt Disney of Japanese animation.
","As with Miyazaki's films, SPIRITED AWAY is a magical tapestry of sights and sounds filled with exotic creatures, mythical settings, and, for its heroine, a little girl named Chihiro who is cute and sweet and thankfully not a selfish brat or bad-tempered hysterical bitch (unlike some of the other Anime I was watching around this time period). She starts off as initially sulky, but mainly because of a situation we can all relate to: she is moving with her parents to a new home, and thinks that her new life is 'gonna stink'. She becomes understandably panicked and suspicious when her parents decide to cross through a forbidden tunnel to a restaurant-filled village where they gobble up food that is sacred and cursed. Yes, CURSED -- her parents are transformed into pigs! To free her mother and father, Chihiro must find work at the town's central bathhouse (populated with all sorts of bizarre and unconventional spirits). The bathhouse's contemptuous owner, a greedy sorceress named Yubaba (who has, MY GOODNESS, THE HUGEST BABY I HAVE *EVER* SEEN!), grudgingly agrees, and in doing so renames her Sen. Although our ten-year old heroine is at first frowned upon by many of the bath house workers, Chihiro finds true friends in Kamaji, the six-legged(!) boiler man, Lin, the gruff but loyal bath house woman, and of course, Haku, a mysterious pale-faced boy whom Chihiro seems to have a deep connection with....To reveal anything more about this masterpiece would be a crime, but I will emphasize that the artistry is jam-packed with weirdness, imagination, and creativity, from the bathhouse's exotic-looking guests to a mysterious shadowy specter called No Face, who voices anyone he swallows -- and tempts people with gold. The sceneries also deserve special recognition; every location in the film, from the bathhouse's atrium to a breathtaking train ride across a glossy seabed (my personal favorite sequence in the movie) is painted with love and care... so stunning that one feels tempted to grab it like candy. Joe Hisaishi's music score, although not as memorable as some of his earlier works for Miyazaki, is a fabulous accompaniment for the picture; some of the tunes work better for the scenes than as a listening experience. The characters, as always, are believable, full-fledged, and multi-faceted -- there are no cardboard cut characters or caricatures present.Under the supervision of John Lasseter, a longtime fan of Miyazaki (and creator of many PIXAR productions, most notably TOY STORY, MONSTERS INC., and FINDING NEMO), and Disney director Kirk Wise, the film was dubbed into English -- with phenomenal results that rank with Disney's previous dubs for Miyazaki's films. The cast is quite good, although Daveigh Chase's performance as Chihiro is a little too shrill and whiny at times (albeit excellent overall). Out of the performers who lend their vocals to the characters (including Jason Marsden in what is probably his best role yet, Lauren Holly, Susan Egan, Michael Chiklis, Lauren Holly, and even a cameo from PIXAR regular John Ratzenberger), it is Suzanne Pleshette who steals the show; she plays Yubaba's greedy, loud-mouthed nature, pampering maternal side to her baby, and her twin sister, Zeniba (who, by the way, is the opposite of Yubaba -- she is IDEALLY Granny!) to perfection.I wouldn't say it is the best Miyazaki dub, though. Practically all of them have been excellent (not counting WARRIORS OF THE WIND, which I haven't seen), and I am therefore reluctant to compare the Disney/Ghibli English tracks to one another as a result. But SPIRITED AWAY's dub, although a bit too overrated IMO, is absolutely well done, and I commend everyone involved.SPIRITED AWAY received a modestly successful limited theatrical release in America, but it made many of the Top 10 Best Films of 2002 lists and even earned a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Animated Feature of 2002. Indeed, it is almost an understatement to say that if it were not for it's success in America, Disney probably would not have decided to go ahead and release a good remainder of Miyazaki's first-class, imaginative output.",10,2,3,20 March 2005
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," More frantic and action-packed with the occasional deviation.
","I don't know how one is supposed to turn a rather short book like J.R.R. Tolkien's THE HOBBIT into a trilogy, but that's exactly what Peter Jackson has done. No stranger to Middle-Earth, having helmed the phenomenal LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, the best things that can be said about his re-imagining of this classic tale is that at least the production values and acting are on par with its predecessors. As with the aforementioned trio, THE HOBBIT was shot back-to- back in New Zealand, resulting in the release of one sequel per year. For better or worse, AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY kicked off what would be an all new adventure, albeit on a rather sluggish pace, particularly its overlong dinner party sequence and character introductions that made up most of its first half.Luckily those problems do not extend to the second part of the trilogy, here titled THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG. Having already established the cast, the film picks up from where we left our heroes after being rescued from orcs by eagles. The pace is certainly tighter and less slow, although there still is the occasional lag. The film begins, oddly, with another prologue scene: this time a conversation between the battle-hardened dwarf prince Thorin (Richard Armitage) and the ever-wise Gandalf (Ian MacKellen). After that we cut back to where we last left the Hobbit and his dwarf companions. As before, THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG really comes alive during the moments which readers are familiar with. Lots of new hazards await our heroes in the form of monstrous spiders, suspicious elves, more and more orcs, corrupt townsfolk, and ultimately, the titular villain himself.Speaking of which, the crowning jewel of this second part is the fated scene where Bilbo confronts Smaug the dragon in his treasure-laden lair. Like Gollum, the folks at Weta Workshop, through the wizardry of motion capture technology do a bang-up job of rendering this beast a truly dangerous, terrifying monster. Benedict Cumberbatch, too, deserves credit not only for performing the motion capture movements of the dragon (similar to Andy Serkis as Gollum), but for providing the beast with a rumbling, floor-shaking baritone that sends chills up one's spine. For audiences more familiar with Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes and Martin Freeman (Bilbo) as Watson, the scene, perhaps unintentionally, is also dryly amusing if you make the connection. Either way, Smaug is a real triumph, emerging as one of cinema's greatest dragons.That said, DESOLATION OF SMAUG takes quite a while to get there, and as with its predecessor, it ultimately depends on whether the viewer is prepared to accept the changes and additions Jackson made from the book, appreciate the film at face value, or are prepared to grumble with disappointment. En route, the film zigzags back and forth between talky bits and CGI effects as well as other additions. The fight with the spiders in the Mirkwood forest is chillingly handled and builds to its climax with true terror, the arachnids themselves being the stuff of nightmares. There's also an extensive roller-coaster style escape in which our heroes escape downriver in barrels while dodging attacking orcs. For the most part this sequence is viscerally exciting, but there are a FEW moments when it gets a bit silly, particularly in the sometimes implausible choreography of the elves as they fight back against the attackers. There's an even lengthier showdown between the dwarfs and the dragon in the Misty Mountain which mostly works on a crowd-pleasing level (especially for audiences who want to see Thorin face off against the beast that destroyed his home), but may infuriate Tolkien loyalists expecting an untarnished adaptation what they see as a work of art.Then there's the inclusion of two new characters, one of who is familiar to audiences of LORD OF THE RINGS, Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and a skillful she-elf named Tauriel. While it's nice to see Legolas again, I'm not quite sure what Jackson is going for by including him in the incidents where the dwarfs are taken prisoner. There's also an implied 'love story' subplot between the youngest of the dwarfs and Tauriel which, although not fatal to the film, is a curious addition nonetheless. We also see Gandalf and Radagast (Sylvestor MacCoy) trail a mysterious evil to stone ruins, which turns out to be the ghost of the major baddie from THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy. This is obviously meant to tie THE HOBBIT to the more famous trilogy, which is quite understandable given that this is, after all, a prequel to LORD OF THE RINGS. Lake Town is also stunningly realized as a destitute but simultaneously seedy village with a corrupt mayor. Luke Evans also makes a very pleasing Bard, and the addition of his family brings a lot of emotional weight to his character.In short, THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG's length and additions will understandably annoy anyone expecting Jackson to adapt the novel more 'accurately', but my 'criticisms' are mostly just shameless nit-picking, because on the whole I really did enjoy THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG. It's certainly more frantic than its predecessor and never boring. The only major drawback of the movie is its cliffhanger ending. This is intentional and meant to make audiences come back for the final film, but it's still done in a way that feels very abrupt. On that level, then, THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG is not meant to be a standalone film, but a two-parter in the same way that HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS ended up being.Love it or hate it, Jackson's enthusiasm for the material still shines through even in places where it occasionally goes off the rails. While it may be in the shadow of its predecessor trilogy, it's nonetheless great to go on another adventure with Jackson, Weta, and company.",8,0,2,20 December 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Well executed and good fun overall, but also quite long. Best when it follows the story.
","More than seventy years ago, J.R.R. Tolkien wrote a story called 'The Hobbit', in which the title character somehow gets mixed up with a bunch of dwarfs to reclaim missing treasure. The success and acclaim of this book led to the highly acclaimed 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy, which years later was transformed into one of the greatest movie trilogies of all time by Peter Jackson. It was perhaps inevitable that one day Jackson would return to this territory to tackle the trials of Bilbo Baggins, but because this movie follows on the heels of a towering achievement like the LORD OF THE RINGS films, comparisons are bound to be inevitable.Adding to the burden of the brunt is the controversial decision to extend THE HOBBIT into a trilogy. That approach worked ideally well for Jackson's THE LORD OF THE RINGS, but because THE HOBBIT is a considerably shorter book (more like one third of the trilogy), it doesn't really merit the decision for three two-and-a-half hour movies. A more ideal approach would have been to film the book as a two-part series, not a trilogy. On a technical level there's nothing majorly wrong with Jackson's direction; the casting and performances are both excellent, the cinematography breathtaking as always, and the visual effects, for the most part, are as impressive as ever. The problem is that the movies are just too unnecessarily long.In fact, it takes a whopping 45 minutes to get Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) out of his cozy home in Hobbiton to go out on his fateful quest with the eponymous wizard Gandalf (Ian MacKellen), as well as a pack of dwarfs led by a brooding fellow named Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage). En route, we first see a lengthy, ten-minute prologue in which the old Bilbo (played with a wavering sincerity by Ian Holm) begins writing his book about his adventures, starting with the downfall of the Dwarven city of Erebor. The subsequent half hour is basically the first chapter, in which Bilbo's quiet humble life is turned upside down when the dwarfs intrude into his household and take over his pantry in no time. The nature of this scene is also noticeably more lighthearted than even the prologue of the first RINGS film, THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. In all fairness, the tone of Tolkien's HOBBIT is more of a children's story and what's on the screen is more or less true to the original, but it also requires a subjective approach. Fans familiar with the book will get the gist of it and more or less be fine, but for more antsy audience members, it does require patience to sit through this scene.Extending scenes like this aren't the only aesthetic choices that Jackson chooses to approach when tackling the story to screen. Sometimes he ends up culling information from the footnotes of Tolkien's fantasy, even borrowing bits of THE SIMILARION for good measure. For instance, we meet the wizard Radagast, an eccentric fellow who cares for animals and goes around riding on a massive 'rabbit' sleigh. There is also a shady backstory involving a conflict between Thorin against a nasty-looking orc named Azgog (a mostly computer-animated villain with a vicious grin and a prosthetic arm). Finally we get a surprisingly long scene at the Elven city of Rivendell in which Gandalf converses with his colleague, the ill-fated sorcerer Saruman (Christopher Lee) about the potential return of Sauron. This is obviously meant to tie THE HOBBIT into THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, which is understandable because this is, after all, a prequel, but again, whether one is willing to sit through such slow scenes depends on the nature.THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY really comes to life during the bits when it actually sticks to the story. The sequence where Bilbo and company are captured by giant trolls does justice to the book. In the second half, we get a scarifying roller-coaster style confrontation with two stone giants to a visit to the infamous Goblin City, ruled by a bloated fellow called the Goblin King. But the film's real highlight is the 'Riddles in the Dark' sequence, a cunningly choreographed, thrilling confrontation in which Bilbo must outsmart the twisted Gollum (again brought to life by the remarkable motion capture and hoarse voice of Andy Serkis).While Jackson's choices may be questionable for some, to his credit, the man hasn't lost his ability to extol performances from his cast. Freeman was practically born to play Bilbo, embuing the character's neurotic reluctance with a charm that easily makes even the slowest parts of the film tolerable to sit through. Armitage mostly portrays Thorin as a grumpy, dour fellow who doubts his new charge, but he does so with hints of a tortured personality. Sylvestor McCoy is also quite good as the eccentric Radagast, and the dwarfs are all well cast and fitting for their roles. And of course, it's gratifying to see McKellan, Lee, Serkis, and even Cate Blanchett (as Galadriel) reprise their roles.Is this HOBBIT trilogy on par with the original LORD OF THE RINGS? No. But it's still well-made and executed with a style that only Jackson can do. In short, whether you decide that THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY is for you depends on how much you are willing to overlook the eccentric decision to extend what is essentially a shorter story and embark on another adventure. Having said that, though, I still quite enjoyed the movie and if nothing else, it left me eager for the next chapter.",8,1,4,19 December 2014
The Chorus," A moving French drama, well-told and with fine performances (acting and music-wise).
","Despite viewing many Japanese Anime, I cannot consider myself a foreign movie fan. I don't mind watching occasional live-action flicks from places other than America, but most of the time it's hit and miss for me. That said I was pleasantly surprised to discover how much I enjoyed LES CHORISTES (or, as the Miramax DVD release calls it, THE CHORUS). Gently told and beautifully photographed, this drama from first-time director Christophe Barratier struck both an emotional and musical chord with this viewer--in fact it was enough to bring back childhood memories for me. But before I get all sappy, onto the movie itself.Set in 1947 France, LES CHORISTES tells the story of Clément Mathieu, a music composer and teacher who finds himself taking a job at Fond de L'Etang, a run-down boarding school consisting of troubled boys who are either orphans or borderline delinquents. Mathieu, a patient, compassionate fellow, eventually turns the entire school upside down when he communicates with the boys through his special talent of music. Before long, the insubordinate wards are transformed into a melodic chorus, much to the chagrin of the school's cruel and abusive headmaster, M. Rachin, who emphasizes corporal punishment as the method for dealing with misbehavior. Mathieu, on the other hand, has a different --or, if you will, kinder-- method for dealing with rowdy boys. For one thing he does not tell on them and instead sentences them to lighter consequences.Over the course of his continual (albeit forbidden) chorus sessions, Mathieu sees potential in one Pierre Morhange, a surly boy with an absolutely stupendous voice and musical gifts which enables him to become the choir's soloist. But first Mathieu must bring the troubled, quick-tempered kid out of his shell. This task is made less easier when Mathieu develops romantic feelings for Morhange's single mother, Violette; it only earns Mathieu Morhange's wrath. Eventually, however, things work out and Pierre eventually finds a career as a highly successful conductor. This is actually displayed at the beginning of the movie, where we see Morhange, as an elderly man, leading his orchestra, and later, reading through the personal journal of his former music teacher. (The whole story, in case you didn't figure out by now, is told entirely in flashback.) As entertainment, LES CHORISTES is heartfelt and uplifting without being too sappy, but as a story it is especially winning. Okay, so it may not be the most original tale --other movies have reprised many of the themes expressed in this movie countless times-- but director Barratier makes this movie 'sing' by providing both credibility and real emotion to the characters and their situations. Aside from the numerous moments where we see the boys singing songs Mathieu writes for them, some of my favorite sequences in the movie involved Mathieu gently persuading any troubled boy into confessing their misdeed without reporting them. A subplot involving a boy stealing money from the school, in particular, turns out to be a touching episode, especially when we discover the real culprit and learn that his intentions are to free himself from the unloving walls of the school.Personally, however, this movie struck me as a delightful trip down memory lane. I used to attend a musical summer camp for several years, where I've sung in chorus. The scenes where Mathieu and his boys are performing, in particular, were strong enough to recall that special feeling of inclusion for me during the good ol' days.Speaking for the movie itself, LES CHORISTES is handsomely photographed and well-acted--particularly noteworthy are Gérard Jugnot as the kindly music teacher, Jean-Baptiste Maunier as the talented but emotionally troubled Pierre, and Maxence Perrin as a sympathetic orphan in search of his father. Naturally, since music is the subject for this movie, one would expect nothing less than the angelic sound of a boys' choir, and LES CHORISTES delivers this in full. Particularly spectacular is the song during a performance for the French countess. It helps, too, that the boys have excellent voices. (By the way, the singers are none other than the professional boys' choir Les Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc Choir.) Some may argue that LES CHORISTES lacks originality, especially for a film that was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film, but for what it is, this is a very moving, touching story, well executed and heartfelt. I recommend it heartily, especially for music lovers and fans of feel-good movies.",9,1,1,6 May 2007
Frozen," Exceeds frozen expectations.
","I have to admit I almost feel a little embarrassed giving FROZEN my highest rating. However, in spite of my reservations about this retelling -- er, Disneyfication -- of Hans Christian Andersen's SNOW QUEEN -- being a CG film and not a traditional one (the latter format could have been used just as effectively for a film like this) -- FROZEN is surprisingly really good. Which is not something I was expecting to say given how disappointed I was with TANGLED. However, FROZEN earns my highest rating for the following reasons.While this is a 'Disneyfied' SNOW QUEEN, it's not done in the manner one would normally expect. This is arguably a darker, edgier re-imagining; the title queen in this story is Elsa, one of two sisters whose primary motivation for causing eternal winter is not out of outright evil, but for more complex issues. The whole conflict starts off because of an accident that traumatized her and her sister, Anna, in childhood, leading the girl to become emotionally distant. This lends a surprisingly more 'adult' angle to the story.But the best part about FROZEN is how Disney turns two of its tried and true clichés completely on its heels. There IS a handsome prince, yes, and he does romance Anna, but not for the reasons one would expect. Furthermore, the climactic 'act of true love' needed to break Elsa's spell isn't romantic, but sister related. It's because of this that FROZEN emerges as one of Disney's best fairy tales in a long time.The chemistry between the principal characters is also very well done, especially the sister dynamic between the more aloof, distant Elsa and the outgoing, socially awkward (but sweet- natured) Anna. Prince Hans, as mentioned, isn't the picture perfect figure you'd expect. If anything, the most interesting character has to be Kristoff, a somewhat grumpy ice hauler who grudgingly agrees to help Anna find her, but naturally he turns out to be a real soft- hearted gentleman. Naturally, this DOES give this film a 'love triangle' angle, but to reveal how it is resolved would be the equivalent of giving spoilers.The music is also great, especially Elsa's charged ballad 'Let it Go.' (The only exception is a gospel-flavored song involving trolls, which isn't BAD by any means, it just struck me as out of place with the tone of the story.) Even the occasional comic relief (from a snowman and a mute elk) doesn't overpower the dramatic depth of the story. There ARE a few places where I think Disney could have toned down the laughs, though, but it's nowhere nearly as grating as in TANGLED.I'm not quite sure where FROZEN ranks in terms of Disney's all-time greatest films, but I WAS pleasantly charmed by it and it exceeded my expectations.",10,7,15,16 May 2014
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," Early masterpiece by Miyazaki finally gets the treatment it deserves.
","Before I start my review, let me state that I did manage to see this film subtitled at an art museum in New York. For me, it was a very interesting experience to discover Miyazaki in his youngest days. While some may find the quality of this film to be a bit dated upon initial glance, it is important to remember that NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND was made back in 1984, so the animation, likewise, does not have as much polish as Miyazaki's later work displays. But this is not to say that NAUSICAA is unwatchable because of that. This is a deeply complex, imaginative tale set in a post-apocalyptic world which will remind many of PRINCESS MONONOKE, only the protagonist is a girl. Nausicaa is a compassionate princess who prefers to solve problems with peace, not vengeance. Her struggle to resolve a bitter conflict between two warring kingdoms and prevent them from reaching her home valley is not a good vs. evil tale. The characters are all flawed, believable people with their own agendas and redeeming qualities.In a testament to Miyazaki's admiration of nature, the film offers a sub-plot involving a supposedly poisonous jungle. The product of a terrible global war, this thick, lush forest not only showcases Miyazaki's imagination (those insects sure are creepy-looking!) but also emphasizes the dangers of world pollution.While NAUSICAA is an older movie from Miyazaki, it manages to hold surprisingly well--most classics have such staying power.Its long journey to America is a story in and of itself. In 1985 (a year after the film broke records in Japan), NAUSICAA was brought to the America--retitled WARRIORS OF THE WIND, drastically altered, and cut by a quarter of its two-hour running time, much to the outrage of Miyazaki and his colleagues. Since that time, Miyazaki declared that any adaptations of his films for American release must be done under the supervision of his company, Studio Ghibli.As much as some folks love to hate Disney these days, one can credit them for taking the time to strike a deal with Miyazaki to distribute his films globally. While the Mouse House has made their share of marketing mistakes with his films, the dubs they've produced thus far--KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE, PRINCESS MONONOKE, SPIRITED AWAY, and CASTLE IN THE SKY--all have maintained a quality of excellence and strong performances from a solid cast of well-known actors and actresses. This brand new English version of NAUSICAA is no exception.As the title character, Alison Lohman provides commendable sincerity, compassion, and vulnerability, and is amply supported by a grand cast of side characters, which include Uma Thurman (the embittered empress Kushana); Chris Sarandon (the sneaky, smarmy Kurotowa); Edward James Olmos (feisty, loyal Mito); and unexpected appearances by veteran character stalwarts Tress MacNeille, Jeff Bennett, Tony Jay (who does a brief opening voice-over), and the Little Mermaid herself, Jodi Benson. Shia LaBeouf's Asbel sounds a bit rocky at first, but he grew on me. Mark Hamill, fresh from his outstanding turn as the evil Muska on the brilliant yet under-appreciated (on some places anyway) CASTLE IN THE SKY dub, plays a small role as the Mayor of Pejite. He only appears in two scenes, and consequently, his performance here isn't as remarkable as his work in CASTLE IN THE SKY, but it's nonetheless great to hear his golden voice in another Miyazaki dub. Arguably the highlight of this dub is Patrick Stewart as Nausicaa's mentor, Lord Yupa. He speaks with strong Shakespearian diction and carries the dub as a whole through his subtle, charismatic rendition of this skilled swordsman.Miyazaki declared that any new adaptation of his masterpiece should be nothing but a straight translation and no cuts. English dub scriptwriters Donald H. Hewitt and Cindy Davis Hewitt (who worked on SPIRITED AWAY) honor his wishes through their adaptation, remaining faithful to the story while tweaking a bit of terminology for comprehension purposes.As with Miyazaki's other works, Joe Hisaishi provides the music score. Compared to the more lush soundtracks he composed for Miyazaki's later films, his score for NAUSICAA, while undeniably beautiful, occasionally comes off as a tad primitive, notably when it breaks into sometimes jarring techno-synth jingles. For better or worse, his score remains intact in the new cut of NAUSICAA which will no doubt please purists. I was a bit disappointed, however--especially when his ambitious reworking of the CASTLE IN THE SKY score (composed exclusively for that dub) turned out so well IMO. A film like this deserves a 5.1 remix! Nonetheless, it's my one quibble of this otherwise top-notch English track of Miyazaki's most revered masterpiece.The DVD sports a near flawless visual transfer and a humble serving of extras--which include the typical English voice talent featurette we saw on Disney's previous wave of Miyazaki's films, trailers and TV spots, and a second disc devoted entirely to storyboards. The most noteworthy feature on this disk is a 30-minute long documentary, 'The Birth of Studio Ghibli', which is undistractingly dubbed into English. For fans that are curious about the upbringing of this animation studio and wondering which of their films have yet to be released, this is a must-see.As someone who has been very pleased with Disney's releases of Miyazaki's works so far, I am delighted to say that they have done yet another bang-up job on polishing this legendary classic for new generations to cherish. Don't be fooled by its primitive looks; NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND's status as a masterpiece resonates from the first minute to the last.",10,25,30,20 March 2005
Grave of the Fireflies," Heartrendering, moving masterpiece from Isao Takahata, and a triumph for animation.
","Truly one of Studio Ghibli's greatest crowning achievements, GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES is a brilliant masterpiece fully deserving of a place in any of the best movies ever made. Not just an astonishingly great (and, at the risk of coming off as cliché, perfect) work of art, this is a moving, thought-provoking, and ultimately heartbreaking tale about the loss of innocence and the tragedies of war.Based on an autobiography by Akiyuki Nosaka, the film, set during the bombing of Japan in --of all times-- World War II, centers on Seita, a loving, headstrong Navy soldier's son and his innocent little sister, Setsuko. Their fatal struggle for survival begins right at the start, when both are bombed out of house and home by American B-29s. Mom is seriously wounded and found wrapped in bandages at a hospital, where she dies shortly after. The children move to Nishinomiya to stay with their aunt. Auntie, a cold, bitter, self-serving woman, has no patience with Seita or Setsuko, especially when they would rather chase after fireflies at moonlight, play by the beach, or lounge around the house instead of helping out. After butting heads with Auntie long enough, the children decide to run away, setting up home in an abandoned cave by the lake. Both try by all means to live off of vegetables or whatever food they can afford to trade and/or steal, to no avail....The outcome of the story is actually showcased at the opening of the movie, where we see a ghostly specter of Seita watching a more malnourished version of himself die a painful, lonely death at a train station. Indeed, as we see how these events came to pass, we find ourselves rooting for Seita and Setsuko to find a way to stay alive, but alas, it is not to be, given Seita's stubborn pride. The overall tone of the movie is of a very tragic nature--even such lighthearted moments as the aforementioned sequences involving Seita and Setsuko playing around the house or gathering fireflies as lights for their cave are all tainted with a touch of sadness, for we know that these brief scenes of happiness will not last.Who is to blame for the plight of these children? The movie never addresses this question to the audience, nor does it really care to. It would be easy for director Isao Takahata to make this an anti-American movie, but he does better than that. Instead, he aptly conveys that war can spell serious--and deadly--consequences for victims. He also eschews casting any character as a hero or villain, and instead makes this a very human story, with no clear-cut 'good' or 'bad' characters. The aunt, for example, is not evil; she is merely an angry, desperate woman who is only struggling to survive just as much as Seita and Setsuko are. Atrocious as her treatment of the children is, we somehow never see her as a true baddie, but a very flawed, multi-faceted human being.Normally one would think of this kind of story as suitable for live-action, but GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES proves that it can be told through the art of animation as well. This is no mindless showcase of gorgeous visuals--although the artistic merits of the movie are, as with Ghibli productions, sumptuous and at times breathtaking--but a display of real characters struggling with very tangible emotions. And the most amazing accomplishment about this movie is how much we grow to care for Seita and Setsuko--their inseparable bond of love and companionship is the heart and soul behind the movie.There are long stretches of silence on the soundtrack, with music used very sparingly, yet the movie is all the more powerful for it. The most effective moment is where we hear a scratchy rendition of 'Home, Sweet Home' over a montage of Setsuko playing by the shelter. It's a simplistic, sweet, yet very saddening moment that not only works in the context of the movie, but on its own as well.I don't normally say this in my reviews, but I would definitely recommend watching this movie in its native language of Japanese for a truly powerful and memorable experience. That's not to imply, however, that the English dub, produced by New York-based Central Park Media, is inferior; on the contrary. It is, in fact, surprisingly good, with an effective lead in J. Robert Spencer and noteworthy cameo appearances by Anime voice-over actors Veronica Taylor, Crispin Freeman, and Dan Green. Rhoda Chrosite's Setsuko is the one voice that doesn't fare so well; she sounds more like an adult pretending to be a young girl, and comes across as strained during most scenes (save for when she is sick from diarrhea). Still, for those who can't read subtitles, the dub is more than adequate (although not as high-profile as others that I've heard).Even in a genre as multi-faceted as Japanese Anime, there are few films that literally everyone really MUST see. GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES is one such movie.",10,32,35,18 August 2005
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," 'This is not going to go the way you think.'
","It can't be denied that the original STAR WARS trilogy is one of the most iconic cornerstones of filmmaking -- an ambitious mixing pot of space-blasting action, alien cultures, and mythological nuances that has captivated so many audiences for years. The namesake suffered something of a stall, however, with George Lucas' flawed prequel trilogy, which, with the exception of REVENGE OF THE SITH, couldn't live up to the reputation of the original trilogy. In a bizarre twist of fate, Disney of all companies purchased the rights to STAR WARS, beginning work on a new trilogy with other movies to come in the subsequent weeks. 2015's THE FORCE AWAKENS, handled by J.J. Abrams, while perhaps too much of a copycat of A NEW HOPE, was nonetheless breezy, flashy, and entertaining -- a great love-letter to the trilogy (with the exception of one character death). The subsequently released ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY was arguably even better: a thrilling tale which was arguably everything the prequels should have been.Now along comes the eighth canonical episode in the STAR WARS series, THE LAST JEDI. Unlike predecessor THE FORCE AWAKENS, this one is helmed by a different director, one Rian Johnson. Naturally, expectations for this were going to be sky-high no matter what, and regardless of how the movie plays out there are always going to be naysayers who will say nay. THE FORCE AWAKENS had a lot of detractors, despite being highly reviewed by critics. THE LAST JEDI, ironically, is suffering the same outcome. Critics have greeted the film with rave reviews, and of course the film was a box office smash, but already there's a huge debate on how this film compares to the original trilogy, and whether this newest chapter charts the series in a bold new direction or if it derails it like the prequels did.I personally find the latter a very questionable claim, as I didn't particularly enjoy the prequels all that much -- ATTACK OF THE CLONES was the weak link. THE LAST JEDI is nowhere near that territory -- the performances by everyone involved are terrific and the dialogue is thankfully devoid of any laughable, groanworthy lines. There isn't any winceworthy love story either. Which isn't to say that THE LAST JEDI is flawless.Picking up from where the last movie left off, Rey (Daisy Ridley) meets Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) on planet Ach-To, but the latter is reluctant to help out on account of a tragedy that he blames himself for. Meanwhile General Leia (the late Carrie Fisher) tries to evacuate the Resistance from Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and his First Order, while hotshot pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaacs) disagrees. Meanwhile former Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) tries to take the situation into his own hands. All of this makes THE LAST JEDI the longest of any STAR WARS movie, clocking it at a whopping 153 minutes. For the most part it moves along at a breathless pace, but the second quarter of the movie stalls when our heroes take an unexpected detour to Canto Bight, a newly fashioned casino city planet. Although visually intriguing, this scene takes too long to get through and ultimately builds to what seems to be a pointless attack on Ren's ship, which is nonetheless negated.There are also a few moments that seem to break plausibility in bizarre ways, particularly one moment where General Leia is literally blown out into space when a photon torpedo smashes her starship, and she somehow uses the Force to pull herself back on board. This scene comes across as too goofy to be believable, more along the lines of SUPERMAN than anything else. Considering that Fisher tragically died last year, it probably would have been better to have her killed off at that point. (Yet she survives anyway.)Then there's the handling of Supreme Chancellor Snoke (Andy Serkis), a shadowy, bald crone who appears to be the brains behind the whole operation. Surprisingly, however, we get to know very little about him, and he's unexpectedly discarded halfway through. Although at the same time it does provide an interesting twist to how we think the story is going to turn out, it is a bit of a letdown that we don't know who he is or where he came from. On a similar note, some of the film's newer characters, like a potential love-interest for Finn (Rose), a self-appointed codebreaker, DJ, and a female commander who temporarily takes Leia's place on the Rebel ship feel underdeveloped as well.Despite my quibbles, there's a lot going for THE LAST JEDI. The dynamic between Luke, Rey, and Kylo Ren is compellingly presented and all around engrossing, thanks to the skillful acting of all three performers involved. Hamill, in particular, deserves a shout-out. Although Luke here is portrayed as a depressed, demoralized hermit who initially refuses to have anything to do with the Force, Hamill succeeds in making this incarnation very three-dimensional and sincere. He gets to have an especially epic moment at the end of the movie (no spoilers for what it is). The man is a genius at voice acting, but as an actor he's very underrated, and this is arguably his best work as Luke yet. Ridley, Boyega, Isaacs, the late Fisher, and especially Driver as the emotionally conflicted Ren are all at the top of their game as well.The cinematography is also deserving of a shout-out; this is probably the best shot of the STAR WARS movies, with a lot of iconic moments that rival any in the series. One very poignant scene toward the end in which Luke gazes off at the binary sunset on the island, in particular, is a fitting callback to A NEW HOPE. The visual effects are top notch, as well, without being overly showy or upstaging the actors. The prequels had gone overboard with this problem, seeming to overload CG-effects for the sake of it. Here it's not so much of an issue.Perhaps the thing that struck with me most about THE LAST JEDI is how daring and bold this newest entry is. Aside from showing familiar faces in a different light, it also makes the controversial choice of deconstructing some of the tropes that fans have come to expect from STAR WARS, therefore charting a new direction for the series. For some who feel the franchise may grow stale with every entry, this change of pace will be refreshing, but others have been miffed by it. This also very well be the darkest and bleakest STAR WARS entry yet -- there's a high body count in this movie, and one spectacularly staged kamikaze attack (with a brief pause of silence for good effect) is something that we haven't seen in STAR WARS before.The humor didn't really stand out to me that much, it was more or less there. The only jarring moment for me was when Luke takes time to milk an alien -- but even then it's only brief.All in all, THE LAST JEDI does take the series in directions that I sometimes agreed with and at others I didn't, but I would be lying if I said I wasn't entertained by it. On the contrary. It's miles above both THE PHANTOM MENACE and ATTACK OF THE CLONES, and arguably more original and less derivative than the (still enjoyable) FORCE AWAKENS. I'm not quite sure where this newest film ranks in the STAR WARS saga -- perhaps a few extra viewings and the eventual next chapter will provide me with a new light. Despite my quibbles with some aspects of the story (mostly in terms of space logic and in a few rushed moments), I found a lot of THE LAST JEDI to my liking, and can recommend it wholeheartedly, if mainly to see Hamill go badass at the finale. Even after seeing it twice, I stand firmly by what I said. It is in no way the nadir of the STAR WARS movies and still surpasses the prequels by far. Just a few (minor) quibbles hold it back from my highest rating.",8,2,17,31 July 2018
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Uneven but overall solid closing chapter for Bilbo and company.
","The first thing I should mention about THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES, is that in order to truly enjoy this film you have to be prepared to come to terms that this is not meant to be a standalone movie, but the final act of a story. Because each of these movies are meant to be viewed together as a single unit, viewing this without seeing the first two parts is not recommended. Tolkien purists will also find plenty to carp at for the occasional additions and liberties Jackson chooses to take. If, however, you're prepared to accept all of that, then it's much easier to appreciate the movie at face value.THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES starts off with a thunderously explosive bang as Smaug takes out his fiery rage on the village of Laketown. This spectacularly staged sequence is nothing short of visceral as we see buildings topple and others torched by the dragon's fiery breath. Everything about this scene all the way up to the climactic showdown between heroic Bard (Luke Evans) and Smaug (who gets to have several new lines) is magnificent, and arguably the highlight of the movie. The story takes a more slower but essentially darker turn, however, as the once proud Thorin Oakshield (Richard Armitage) becomes greedy and refuses to part with any share of the gold in his now reclaimed home. Naturally, Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) doesn't take too kindly to this and, in an act of daring defiance, hands over the Arkenstone to the Elf King in order to prevent a bloodbath. This and Thorin's paranoia strain their friendship and ultimately build to what Jackson promised to be the longest battle ever committed to screen. And long the battle of the five armies itself truly is, taking up a good forty-five minutes of the film's 144-minute duration. (Ironically, this is the shortest of the Middle Earth movies!)In between that and en route, there are other positives to this final chapter. The dynamic between Thorin and Bilbo is powerfully presented, with Freeman and Armitage both providing strong, emotionally charged performances. The chemistry between the two is very powerful, and arguably the real heart of the movie. Indeed, it makes the final parting scene between them all the more heartbreaking and misty-eyed. Armitage also does an expert job of portraying Thorin's conversion to an avaricious tyrant -- at some points his voice melds with that of Smaug's, providing for a rather chilling and frightening effect. This change of character culminates with Thorin having a nightmarish vision of being swallowed by the gold he craves; a somewhat surreal but nonetheless very effective scene.The performances in THE HOBBIT have always been among the strongest points of this trilogy. Aside from Freeman and Armitage, Evans is a very charismatic and instantly likable Bard, and the addition of him having a family of similar strength provides the character with an arguably greater dynamic both for taking down the beast. He is easily another hero to root for, as are returnees Ian MacKellen as the wizard Gandalf, Hugo Weaving as the elvish Lord Elrond, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, and Orlando Bloom as Legolas. Christopher Lee also gets to show off some real fighting stunts in his return as Saruman. Billy Connelly, although mostly seen on a CGI-rendered pig and wielding an unrealistically huge sledgehammer, is a pleasant new addition to the cast as Thorin's uncle.For all its positives, though, THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES isn't without its faults. Although most of it is just excessive nitpicking on my part, there were several bits that I felt could have been handled differently. Although the battle between the armies itself is dramatically staged for the most part, there were times when I felt disconnected from it, not necessarily because of the onslaught of CGI characters. Legolas' heroic action stunts such as catching a ride on the talons of a bat, slaying said bat with his arrow, and dodging falling bricks like Super Mario also border on goofiness. Even his antics in the LOTR trilogy weren't as 'cartoonish'. The climactic showdown between Thorin and the nasty Orc Azgog is also too drawn out to have any major emotional impact one way or the other. (That said, the final parting from Bilbo and Thorin that follows this showdown takes the movie's emotional heart back on track.) I'm also unclear about the love triangle between the she-elf Tauriel, the young dwarf Kili, and Legolas. Although all three actors involved play it well, and the resolution is indeed heartbreaking, it doesn't feel very necessary to the momentum of the story and I do question why Jackson thought to include it. Admittingly, Tauriel is a pretty cool character, but again, her presence feels extraneous at times, as if there needed to be a heroine. Probably the only really useless character is Alfrid, a corrupt town official who, aside from having a getaway disguised as a woman, is otherwise a fairly forgettable character.But these are only minor negatives. Everything else about THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES excels; the production values are as top notch as you'd expect from Jackson, Weta, and company, Howard Shore's score is, as usual, magnificent, and as mentioned, the casting and performances are all spot-on. Aside from the opening and the dynamic between Frodo and Thorin, the other major highlight of this last chapter is the ending. It is brilliantly done and faithful to the book, concluding with a very clever lead-in to THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING as the older Bilbo (Ian Holm) goes to greet Gandalf for the first time in years as the camera slowly trucks in on the map before the closing credits begin.For all that, THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES, although sketchier than one might expect, is still worth a good recommendation and ranks as a solid final chapter overall.",8,2,5,20 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The darkest--and best--of the prequels. Period.
","It is difficult for me to evaluate the STAR WARS movies individually because each has been intended to be viewed as one whole saga. But EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH is a definite step-up from its last two flawed yet serviceable predecessors, THE PHANTOM MENACE and ATTACK OF THE CLONES, respectively. Whereas the aforementioned prequels took their time to set up exposition, this one unfolds at such a fierce, kinetic pace that you'll be hanging on for dear life.The extended action sequence which opens the movie, where Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan MacGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) rescue Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) hearkens back to the visceral excitement and spectacle of the very first shot from the original STAR WARS (or as we should be calling it by now, EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE) and here we get to see (gasp!) electrifying chemistry between MacGregor and Christensen as well as stunts (plus humor provided by R2-D2!). This also sets up the introduction of a new villain, a hulking CGI-crafted droid called General Grievous; admittingly, his malevolent demeanor, thick accent and constant coughing does come across as one-dimensional, but his final showdown with Obi-Wan (where he arms four lightsabers!) is something to see.Things get a little slower around the second quarter of the movie where we get treated(?) to a few love scenes between Anakin and Padme. The overabundance of these scenes were my biggest issue with ATTACK OF THE CLONES (and in REVENGE OF THE SITH, they occasionally come across as a little shaky, with a few awkward lines I counted), only this time there aren't as many, and the overall chemistry between Christensen and Portman is greatly improved into something respectable if not outstanding. Actually, the best moment between them (SPOILER ALERT!) occurs before the fateful showdown with Obi-Wan Kenobi on Mustafar. I was surprised at how emotional and heartbreaking this exchange was.Speaking of Christensen, I didn't have much of a problem with him in ATTACK OF THE CLONES (even though his scenes with Padme were hardly something to call praiseworthy), but here he really seems to have grown into the role. His descent into evil is surprisingly well acted and comes off best during the climactic moments. MacGregor, too, is excellent. He was a tad wooden in Episodes I and II, but in this chapter he really sinks into the role and comes close to matching Alec Guiness's legendary performance as Obi-Wan. The same is true for Samuel Jackson as Mace Windu. Whereas he was pretty stiff in the earlier chapters, his confrontation with Palpatine carries a grand dramatic weight and he actually had me rooting for him. Yoda once again steals every scene he's in, upstaged only by Ian McDiarmid, who delivered a deliciously raspy evil to the Emperor in RETURN OF THE JEDI and played Palpatine for the prequels. He speaks his lines with intonations so chilly that he tears into every scene he's in. REVENGE OF THE SITH is, without a doubt, his movie.It is the final half of the movie, though, that really makes this episode--grittier than even THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and tragic in almost every way, this is George Lucas at his darkest and best. His gift as a storyteller shines throughout the movie and I was deeply engrossed in every minute of it.It's not perfect, mind you. The dialogue is clunky at times and there are at least a few moments that come across as laughable and/or didn't live up to the rest of the movie (in particular, Darth Vader screaming 'NOOOO!' toward the end sounded more restrained than believable).However, as probably has been said countless times, these 'weaknesses' are par for the course with the STAR WARS movies (yes, even the original trilogy)... and the strengths REVENGE OF THE SITH provides outweighs its shortcomings, making it probably the best of the STAR WARS prequels, and a very fitting match for the original trilogy we all know and love. It was quite a long wait, but in the end, it was worth it. As the tag-line proudly states, the saga is complete at last.Bravo, George Lucas.",8,2,5,20 May 2005
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Superior to the prequels and an overall great film, but not quite on the same level as the original trilogy.
","Ten years after the lesser STAR WARS prequel trilogy wrapped up with the mostly solid if not perfect REVENGE OF THE SITH, George Lucas' ever-popular space opera saga gets yet another trilogy in the making, this time in the hands of J.J. Abrams, the man behind the magnificent SUPER 8 and the equally enthralling STAR TREK reboot.This time, he reunites most of the original cast members (including Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Anthony Daniels, and yes, Peter Mayhew as Luke, Han Solo, Leia, C-3PO, and Chewbacca, respectively) while introducing a welcome host of newcomers. These include Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, and even LORD OF THE RINGS' Andy Serkis. Rather than relying on the mostly CGI approach of the prequels, Abrams also opts to use models, bizarre aliens, and lots of action as well as surprise twists out of nowhere.Does it all work? For the most part, the answer is yes.This is certainly a much more spirited and lively chapter than the more sluggish prequels, emphasizing humorous byplays between its characters over sometimes overdone CG effects. As impressive as the visual effects are, they never overcome the way of the story. More importantly, the acting is consistently great from everyone involved: something that could never be said for the prequels. Both Ridley and Boyega get into their roles and exchange rapid- fire chemistry in the same manner as the original, and of course Ford, despite being older, obviously hasn't lost his swagger and badassery as Han Solo. Although villains Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine are missed, the mentally unstable, bad-tempered Kylo Ren makes for a promising villain (Driver), and his big boss (Serkis) also emerges to be just as menacing as the late Darth Sideous.Some have quibbled that the plot line for THE FORCE AWAKENS is mostly a retread of the original STAR WARS movie 'A New Hope', what with the usual destructive space weapon + secret map + hidden weakness formula as well as a little bit of THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. In that aspect, the movie is probably the least 'original' of the movies. But the end result of a movie isn't measured upon its originality or derivativeness, but in its delivery. While the prequels were not guilty of repeating themselves, they still suffered from stiff acting and dialogue. On that level, this movie improves on both of those weaknesses by far. The return to the jokey banter atmosphere is more than welcome, and while there is humor, it's never of the juvenile kind.All in all, THE FORCE AWAKENS IS better than PHANTOM MENACE and ATTACK OF THE CLONES (as well as even REVENGE OF THE SITH; good as that film was, it was still held back by flaws), but I cannot recommend it as highly as the original trilogy as I would like to because it just slightly misses the mark due to a shocking and less effective final third. Having said all this, though, you'll of course want to see this first entry in a new trilogy; even with my quibbles, it does show promise.",8,3,21,2 January 2016
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The beginning--er, fourth entry of the greatest space opera epic ever!
","'A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...' From the moment these words filled up the screen to ecstatic audiences in May of 1977, a legend was born. That's a pretty cliché way of putting it (since, chronologically, this happens to be the fourth chapter in the saga), but there is some serious truth behind the impact that this, the original STAR WARS, left upon many viewers. It's hard to believe that this movie ever got made, too. It was George Lucas's brainchild project since childhood, but when shooting this movie, he ran into production problem after problem after problem--many executives predicted that STAR WARS would die at the box office. And now look at what place it has in the history of moviegoers. If STAR WARS had not been the megahit that it was, there would be no sequels, no prequels, no fans going around reciting memorable quotes from the movie ('May the force be with you!'), and, well, all that it is.Looking upon STAR WARS, or should I say, EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE, it really is not hard to understand why this film became such a status of pop culture. Sure, it doesn't have the flashy graphics of today's big, loud and noisy CGI films (although this reincarnation does; more on that later)--but what makes this movie such a classic is simply because, at heart, it is great FUN. The storyline is epic and action-packed (those starship battles and the climactic Death Star Trench fight are always fresh every time), the atmosphere that Lucas created is imaginative and engaging, and, best of all, it has a cast of characters that have quickly become household names--eager, earnest young hero Luke Skywalker; dashing, courageous Captain Han Solo; tempestuous yet regal Princess Leia; furry Wookie Chewbacca; wise, saintly Obi-Wan Kenobi; ruthless helmeted villain, Darth Vader; and of course, those lovable robots (sorry, droids), C-3PO and R2-D2.It helps, too, that talented performers bring this eccentric cast to life. Indeed, it is hard to imagine a better trio than Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher as the three human leads, Alec Guiness as the elderly Jedi Master, Anthony Daniels as the golden, worrisome robot, or even James Earl Jones' memorably stentorian voice as Vader (one of cinema's greatest vocal performances ever). Say what you will about George Lucas' directing abilities, but these guys bring an infectious, lasting appeal to their roles that it makes those in the prequels pretty stiff by comparison.Equally memorable is John Williams' soundtrack, the title fanfare has been used in every STAR WARS movie to date, and of course, the motifs Williams creates for the characters fit them to a T. One can only imagine the atmosphere of STAR WARS had it been scored by someone else....With all this, and more, it's no wonder that STAR WARS's impact is still going strong, and, at the risk of causing controversy, the original trilogy can easily hold its own against some of the more cinematically complex and impressive trilogies of our time such as THE LORD OF THE RINGS, THE GODFATHER, and BACK TO THE FUTURE.However, George Lucas wasn't satisfied with his original version of STAR WARS (the miniscule budget he received could hardly be enough to develop some of the story's more ambitious scope), so in 1997, he and his company, LucasFilm Ltd., re-released the film as a 'Special Edition'. This version consists of some added-in and/or altered scenes as well as some more enhanced visual effects. Purists have opposed these additions, especially since Lucas has not decided to release the original print of STAR WARS on DVD. While this is a valid argument, Lucas himself has stated that this revamp of A NEW HOPE is HIS vision. But I don't want to get into the fan controversy about the Special Editions. On this account, I will say that watching this more beefed-up version is a treat in and of itself; it's interesting (and fun) to pinpoint the differences between the original and the new incarnations. Admittingly, some of the added-in stuff isn't really necessary (in particular, I COULD probably have done without the altered scene where Greedo shoots first at Han, although I'm not nearly as anal about it as others are), but they hardly affect the flow of the story and just add another level of enjoyment to the experience.For this DVD release of A NEW HOPE (which coincides with the DVD release of the original trilogy), the movie has been tinkered with yet again, this time to fix some of the more glaring flaws that were present in the Special Editions. Although it's not completely perfect (I did notice some matte-boxing around some of the starships in some shots), this version is about as good as it can get. Yes, I would like a chance to own the original on DVD as well, but this presentation is still excellent--the hard work that went into the visual and aural restoration is very commendable and is especially spectacular if you have a widescreen TV or state-of-the-art sound system.No matter which version it is presented in, though, STAR WARS is still, well, STAR WARS.",10,1,2,2 September 2005
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," One of the few movies to set a new standard for sequels.
","Given the enormous popularity that STAR WARS received upon its release in 1977, it seems inevitable that a sequel would be produced. It is usually common for a follow-up to an original to be a let-down, but THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is not one such example. Directed by Irvin Kirschner, this new chapter in the saga doesn't just live up to its predecessor, it surpasses it--and then some. The storyline takes a darker, more heavy-handed spin as Luke, Han, Leia, and the Rebel Forces find themselves under assault from Darth Vader and the Imperial troops. As the movie progresses, we root for our heroes to prevail--only to find ourselves downcast when we come to the somewhat sad (yet hopeful) conclusion. Yet the movie is all the more magnificent for it.THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK also gives a chance to expand upon the characters' relationships with each other--to entertaining and occasionally amusing results. The give-and-take banter between Han and Leia (which, of course, turns into a romance) is hilarious and made all the more memorable by Harrison Ford's swaggering portrayal of Han and Carrie Fisher coming off as a perfect foil for his bluster. The chemistry between them is definitely a lot more lively and interesting than, say, the love sequences involving Natalie Portman and Haydn Christensen in the prequels (not to put both down, however). Mark Hamill is best known to us today as one of Hollywood's best voice actors ever, but his acting as Luke Skywalker deserves special mention. In EMPIRE, he displays an incredible range of emotion and growing pains, which helps the audience to identify with his struggle. His eventual growth from a reckless, unthinking youth to a mature, confident hero is completed full-circle in the final entry of the STAR WARS movies, RETURN OF THE JEDI, but tracing where it begins in this movie credits that.Not only are we introduced to all-new worlds such as the freezing, snow-covered ice planet Hoth to the musty swamp bog of Dagobah, we are introduced to new characters. For example, on Bespin, we meet Lando Calrissian, a charming yet shifty rogue who shares a somewhat shaky friendship with Han Solo. Billy Dee Williams conveys the character to effectiveness; the transition from traitor to ally is well handled and believable. Of course, the most memorable character in the movie is Yoda, the crotchety yet benign Jedi Master who takes it under himself to lead Skywalker down the straight and narrow path. In the prequels, we see him flex his facial expression chops through computer animation, but in this film (in addition to JEDI) we see him as a rubber puppet operated by Frank Oz. His playful yet wise nature exudes through the latex and comes across as a staple character--an astonishing triumph for a non-computer generated creation.The production values are spectacular, with unforgettably visceral action sequences highlighting every minute on screen such as the snow battle against giant dinosaur-like walkers, the daredevil chase through the asteroid field, and of course, the climactic confrontation between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader.There are lots of great moments in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK one could go on and on about, but none so greater as--**SPOILER**--the instant where Darth Vader reveals that HE is Luke's father. I can only imagine what the impact of this emotionally charged scene must have been for audiences; of course when seeing the STAR WARS movies in chronological order, this moment may create effects different than from what audiences in 1980 (and frankly, those who have seen only the original trilogy) experienced.In short, not only is THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK one of the best entries in the STAR WARS saga, but one of the best sequels ever.In 1997, George Lucas revamped this film (along with the other two entries in the original trilogy) as a Special Edition. Most of the enhancements aren't as noticeable as in STAR WARS, but one of them is breathtaking--the expansion of Cloud City allows us to see an entire depth of dimension to the world that we haven't seen before. By contrast, the moment where we see the ice monster approach Luke (the original version has only two brief cutaway shots of this creature) doesn't amaze us as much as the former. This DVD release features a bit more tweaking, most noticeable is a new conversation between Darth Vader and the Emperor (played, in this scene, by Ian McDiarmid). Some may oppose such changes, but I liked this particular enhancement a lot. It really helps bridge the entire saga together as a whole (not to mention it makes it more consistent). Combine all that with a state-of-the-art visual remastering and sound remixing, and you have a splendid edition of THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK on your hands.",10,1,2,2 September 2005
Princess Mononoke," Breathtaking. Watch with 'eyes unclouded.'
","In its theatrical Japanese release of 1997, PRINCESS MONONOKE was the hugest box office grossing movie of all time in the land of the Rising Sun until it was overtaken by James Cameron's TITANIC, and, four years later, director Hayao Miyazaki's own SPIRITED AWAY. No wonder. This movie, like an earlier project of Miyazaki's, NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND, explores man's relationship with nature, hatred causing destruction, and, more importantly, real characters (in other words, no real 'hero' or 'villain') trying to get by in a world continually torn by war.This is not a movie for young children, as there are disturbing shots of decapitations, amputations, and occasional blood spurts. Sometimes these elements of violence turn squeamish viewers away from Anime (especially when they're done gratuitously), but Hayao Miyazaki presents it not to sicken people but to show it for the horror that it is (plus, in this film, the violence is not overdone). Take, for example, the scene where the protagonist, Prince Ashitaka of the Emishi Tribe, possessed by a curse he received from killing a Demon God (in trying to protect his village), tries to stop samurai attacking innocent people, and in doing so shoots the arms off of one man, and, later, takes off a man's head with two arrows. The sight is horrifying to see, but the deed also increases Ashitaka's demon mark on his arm, which is slowly preparing to take his life. This is a truly horrible depiction about the dangers of violence.Also worth noting is Princess Mononoke herself, a human girl named San raised by the Animal Gods, and her struggle against Lady Eboshi of Iron Town, who is destroying the forest merely for her people's own good (the folks are outcasts, including lepers and prostitutes). San distrusts and despises all humans, and is especially determined to destroy them all (particularly Eboshi)... or die trying. When she's rescued by Ashitaka, however, a conflict within her begins to surface: are *all* humans evil, or is there at least one who is trustworthy? If there is any character who could be considered a villain, it would be the monk, Jigo, who wants the head of the Spirit of the Forest to bring to the Emperor. Such a deed would destroy the entire forest (as we find out in the film's chilling climactic scenes) but even Jigo has his own motives, too. He is not so much evil as much as he is just 'trying to get by'. This pretty much sums up the conflicts between all our characters here.PRINCESS MONONOKE may not have enjoyed similar box office success here in America, but at least a lot of work and care went into the translation. As with Disney's other English language tracks for Miyazaki's films, this one is very, very well done. Acclaimed writer Neil Gaiman worked on the script, rewording it only to a) fit the mouth flaps, and b) make it understandable to a non-Japanese audience who would probably not comprehend a lot of the cultural nuances found in this film. Added to which, the voice cast includes a commendable list of stars; Billy Crudup is perfect as Ashitaka, eliciting just the right amount of warmth, kindness, compassion, wisdom, and courage, while Claire Danes delivers passionately angry, conflicted turmoil to San. (Folks said she was miscast, but I beg to differ; her character is *required* to be outraged and aggressive, and Danes does have a strong voice to carry such emotions.) The rest of the cast includes Billy Bob Thornton as Jigo (a grossly underrated performance; his Southern drawl adds to the character), Minnie Driver (elegant choice!) as Lady Eboshi, Gillian Anderson as the Wolf-Goddess Moro, and Jada Pinkett-Smith as the friendly (if no-nonsense style) worker Toki. The translation flows smoothly to those who are not familiar with Japanese folk tales, and the story succeeds in making its point, too.This movie may not be for everybody, as it is the kind of film that may disturb young children, but older audiences will find themselves absorbed in the artwork, which showcases gorgeous, unmatched imagination, from the finely detailed forests to the cute little Tree Spirits who appear and disappear at will to the Forest Spirit itself -- a huge deer who makes plants grow with each step he takes. And at night he becomes a ghostly specter known as the Nightwalker, traveling higher than the trees. Such images warrant the purchase of this film. Better yet, its message is not too preachy, and rarely do animated movies (save those from Japan) showcase characters portrayed as, well, human beings.",10,44,51,20 March 2005
