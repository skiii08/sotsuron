Ford v Ferrari," Great Movie
",I watch this only by seeing the title and did not exspect how good this movie is plus all the great actors. Ive seen it 4 time and its one of the movies I could rewatch over and over. Its also the untold story of ken miles. Plus at one time we owned a cobra mustang so my kids learned how ford and carol teamed up. Great job on this movie.,10,2,4,29 January 2020
