Iron Man 3," Exciting and Attractive
","I saw this a weeks ago. This is very exciting and attractive film. The characters are very good. Robert Downey, Jr is always cool and funny, and just right for the role of Iron Man and Tony Stark, and Gwyneth Paltrow /Pepper Potts's action scenes are really exciting. The plot is unique and interesting. There are not only uniqueness of Tony but also suffering and love for Potts. This movie starts from the cause of the story and includes the ending. The special effects is near perfect, and the action is very great. The armor's battle and explosion scenes are heart stopping. However, I think that the soundtrack lacks a little stylish. There is not peculiar style of Iron Man. Moreover I want to see scenes about the mechanism of Iron Man, what ability, what purpose, how to assemble.",8,1,3,5 January 2014
