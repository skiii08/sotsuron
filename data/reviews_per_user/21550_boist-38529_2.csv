It," this movie was great!!!
",This movie was great with a lot of different scares not only from the clown. The cgi was overall good but at times it could look overdone. The casting was great with very likable kids and a very good played clown. It was very nice seeing that this movie came out about 27 years later from the old movie series.They should not have spoiled so much in the trailers because if saw all the trailers you would what would happen in certain scenes. But overall very enjoyable,10,3,5,19 September 2017
Logan," greatest marvel movie to date!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
",this movie was a great experience seeing. It had it all from the gore to the character story. One thing missing was the weak bad guy in this movie. It had also very emotional moments not mention any spoilers. The ending is what you expected but they did it in a very good way but at times the story was leaning to another type of ending but ultimately we got what we all wanted which was a great ending to the wolverine franchise .,10,3,9,7 July 2017
