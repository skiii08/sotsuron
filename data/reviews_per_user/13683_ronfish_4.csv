The Blair Witch Project," German version
","According to other user comments on Blair Witch Project this film has to be a really impressing experience with a unique atmospheric. I did see the movie, too, but I somehow feel like not being able to rate it. I have seen the version which is in German language and all I can say is: if you are going to watch Blair Witch Project, you should not see a dubbed version. The German speakers could not transfer the atmosphere from the original, it just isn´t that impressive seeing someone crying from fear and it is not the actor´s voice. Apart from that the story is on average level and the characters seem to be a little bit...let me say 'stupid', even after days they act like: '...Where to go now ? We´ll see, just let us go into any direction...' I mean in recent history there has been something invented called 'mobile phone'. I guess nowadays no one would go deep into the woods for some days without having the possibility to contact civilization in case of emergency.",5,0,2,15 August 2001
Saving Private Ryan," overwhelming war scenes, but...where is the movie
","I was really impressed by that 20-minute introduction, that´s what cinema is made for. It crash-boom-bangs just from everywhere and you seem to be incapable moving from your seat. Great work, 10 points...SO FAR. But what comes next ? As it is forbidden to use spoilers in this text I can just say: what comes next is one of the most stupid stories in film history ever. Spielberg must have been of the opinion that the audience might be busy thinking about that impressive introduction until the movie is over and in this case the film doesn´t need no such thing as a sensible storyline. According to the imdb-members´ rating of 8,6 making it the 12th best movie ever, Spielberg was obviously right. And even if the story is missing there is enough patriotism in this film to make it successful in the U.S.. My rating: 6 points and far away from the being one of the top 20 movies.",6,0,0,6 February 2000
Final Destination," 'Innovative' is something else
","There could certainly have been hundreds of ways to make a better movie out of this 'Death hunts people'-topic. The first mistake was to choose highschool pupils as the main characters, which is surely good for making teenagers go to the cinema to watch the film, but concerning the acting this was catastrophic. The whole plot is built to impress the low-expectations-14-to-19-years-old-audience, not only is the plot as predictable as what day comes after Monday, this ever present 'death has a scheme and all I have to do is find out how it works' is just ridiculous. Moreover there are five to ten hints every time a person is going to be killed, I think one or two NOT SO OBVIOUS hints would have been enough (I just remind of one scene: 'Tod' cut out of a newspaper, it really canÂ´t be more obvious!!), but I guess that was necessary to make sure that everybody in the audience would get it. Some special effects were nice but I bet the higher the rating on imdb.com the lower the age of the voter. Hopefully those highschool-films will soon reach their final destination.",5,2,3,4 August 2001
The Matrix," Laurence Fishburne can tell you
","THE MATRIX is overrated quite a lot, I think. Visually strong the movie really cannot stun me with such a poor story line. The real contents seem to be: impressing the viewer be revealing new facts about the amazing Matrix-world. But after having caught in which way the Matrix works it is just boring seeing Laurence Fishburne explaining and explaining what has already been explained. His never ending monologues nearly ruin the whole movie. It is not that interesting hearing ´´it is like this´´ and ´´it works like that´´ for half an hour. The rating of 8.4 points in the IMDB is too high, I think. I rated the Matrix 6 points.",6,2,4,28 January 2000
