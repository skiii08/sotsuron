Scarface," You won't sleep through this one.
","Mountains of cocaine, pools of blood, piles of dropped f-bombs, and only one Tony Montana. Was Al Pacino's performance exaggerated? If, for a viewer, Al Pacino's performance was sub-par, so then was Scarface as a whole. Indeed, Pacino's portrayal of a Cuban immigrant and future drug lord, makes or breaks the film, and I'm quite sure both Brian De Palma and Oliver Stone knew this. De Palma did his best to fashion the film around Pacino and, as a matter of fact, he's in every single scene of the film. So, again, if Pacino's Tony Montana irritated you, then you didn't like the film. The thing that amazes me is the way De Palma made this film appeal to so many people. For those of you who can't get enough of shootouts and bloodbaths, here's one for you. For those who love gangster films, enjoy! Stone brilliantly shows Tony's ascent in the drug industry. Personally, Scarface made me understand the workings of the illicit business world more than The Godfather did. Allow me to explain. The Godfather began with The Family already established and illustrated how difficult and competitive that part of the world can be as well as the concept of retribution. Now, I know the Godfather II showed Vito Corleone's ascent, but that just got me thinking: 'Is it that simple?' Scarface I believe is more patient. It really takes its time. We really see how Tony made a name for himself and how he gets his connections. Apart from establishing Tony's creds and his handling of business affairs, the film is out of control; not in the bad sense, most of the time. From Tony's first job, involving Colombian cocaine pushers to a certain chainsaw, to the last out-of-whack scene, the film just won't let you go. It's smart, concise when it wants to and necessarily brutal. The film would probably not be considered a classic if it was all powdered up and had less blood, gore, swears and drugs than it does. It lives up to its material alright; it doesn't just talk big, it lives big.",9,0,1,16 October 2006
Fight Club," Great Films Club for Fight Club.
","If we're all just 'polishing the brass on the titanic', and everything is going down anyway, what's the point? You get up in the morning, you go to school, study and succeed with the hope of one day becoming a doctor, a lawyer or a whatever. But if we know as we do that humanity will cease to exist in the near future, what with global warming and all, why do we bother improving existence? Shouldn't we give in to the beast we all know exists inside man? For the little time we have left, isn't a better idea to destroy, fight and kill? Anarchy seems to be the best thing to abide by in these dark times. Of course, David Fincher's Fight Club doesn't advocate these ideas; it brings them up in order for us, the viewers, to think of reasons why they are wrong. With recourse to the everyman, Edward Norton's character, only known as the Narrator, Fight Club involves us in the film. We are the Narrator. We are the ones who need every piece of furniture in Ikea catalogues for our homes in order to feel whole. However, the everyman in the film happens to have a day only seen in the movies, but we still identify with him: His luggage is lost at the airport, his house blows up and all his possessions, even the furniture, are gone. As a direct result, he is no longer a person because his possessions have been destroyed.Now he meets a guy, Tyler Durden, who tells him he could be more than his possessions, he could be free of the superficial society which creates the needs he does not ('in the hunter-gatherer sense') actually have. He could be, that is, if he hits his friend as hard as he can. Our Narrator does; he likes it. Soon enough, other young men begin to like it too. These young men are also tired of mindless work which consists of helping a society that just enslaves them more as they make it more powerful. What's the point? So they all listen to Tyler, a fervent leader of men who initiates a club in which, every night, these young men can pound on each other. As they experience real freedom through pain and domination, Tyler, the giver of this wonderful experience, hands out homework assignments. His minions happily execute.This is how anarchy begins: A fervent and relentless leader with the wrong idea. I will not divulge any more, because of the many surprises this film has near the end. Any film with these ideas can just as easily fail. Fight Club does not. It is masterfully wrapped in a package of light, sound and images by David Fincher. The film looks good and has the smarts to back it up. Proponents of classic films see modern day cinema as being all style and no substance. Scenes are cut too fast to even get a feel for them, a little gift, they say, from television. Well I say look at Fight Club. What we have isn't so bad. It makes us think as well as being entertained. Edward Norton gives us many performances in one: he is an insomniac who knows there's a void in his life but doesn't have the will power to fill it, preferring to merely go through the motions of a life headed nowhere. Then he becomes 'enlightened', finds meaning. Then he discovers what his life really is... Brad Pitt is a charismatic leader able to subdue any lost soul. Helena Bonham-Carter has fun with her intermediary character. Great acting and great directing have always been essential to great films. So has being thought provoking, and you know what? For 7 years ever since its release, everyone has been talking about it. It hasn't stopped; even people who hate it love to talk about it. So should we just stop our productive lives? Boys, let's just pound each other because, hey, it's more productive then anything we're doing now. It liberates us, for a given time period, because short term desire satisfaction is more useful than anything else. Somebody please prove that wrong, because that's what the film wants us to do, and I'll be damned if Tyler Durden is right.",7,3,5,15 October 2006
Big Fish," Fact or fiction?
","Was Ed Bloom making up all the tall-tales in Big Fish? Or, could they really have been his life experiences? The ending of Tim Burton's film leaves that up to the viewers. This 'open to interpretation' ending will reveal those who are more down to earth and those who are more liberal minded. But regardless of the extraordinary elements in Big Fish, there is plenty of entertainment for both sides. I'd like to be Ed Bloom. Whether or not he's inventing all these stories to bury some kind of childhood trauma or something like that, he still believes he's lived all that he says. I think this character is rather refreshing; of course, for some, he may be irritating, and I respect that position. Instead of just telling everyone, while recounting his childhood, that he and his friends had a lot of goofs together, they met a witch. Instead of saying that he got tired of his home town and just left, he actually rid the town of a big bad giant and had to leave with him. And instead of merely dying on a hospital bed like everyone else, he was carried through his wishful memories and left this world in the arms of his son, surrounded by people who hold him as a king. And what if he isn't lying? As a matter of fact, all the people Ed talks about actually exist. If he isn't, then Tim Burton constructed a beautiful and credible world of magic, bizarre creatures, people and towns (Specter). Believe it or not, it doesn't hinder the film. The acting is strong, especially by Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor. The latter makes the surreal events in the film look completely natural, and Finney plays old man Bloom to perfection, masterfully relating to us that he is totally convinced that his tall-tales are fact. Interestingly, Burton doesn't really choose a side. He gives huge hints that Bloom's are just 'enhancements' of reality, but then again, we're talking about Tim freakin' Burton here. He never takes us once for fools. He seems to tell us that since we've been putting up with such lousy, half-baked films lately, then he's going to reward with something special, a treat. And indeed he does. Take the scene, for instance, when young Ed Bloom meets his true love. The script clearly states 'They say when you meet the love of your life, time stops. And that's true'. Burton does not allow himself to merely point this out to us and proceed. He acts it out; he actually makes time stop. Now, this isn't so-called 'ingenious' film-making, but it is truly unexpected and quite hilarious. So, why such a high grade for Big Fish? I guess I'm a sucker for these films. It's getting harder and harder to make feel good movies, that is, without falling into the 'corny' category. So when one comes along that is so visually agreeable, well performed and clever, I fall for it.",8,0,0,17 October 2006
A Clockwork Orange," Singin' in the Rain
","I saw this film recently. 'Legendary', 'cult classic', 'extreme violence', 'agonizingly crude scenes'; all these were but a few terms used in reference to it. I was quite uneasy before seeing it, worrying that I might not appreciate it enough. Or maybe I wouldn't 'get it'. I had heard that this film contained very important social messages which viewers were not allowed not to grasp. So with all this hype, I rented A Clockwork Orange and learned what classics are all about. The first thing that people who approach classics warily must learn is that these films are deemed so because they are highly accessible and let you go filled with ideas you did not have going in. Classics are not work, they impress you with their looks and their styles, their stories and the innovative ways in which they are told.One could interpret Kubrick's classic anyhow desired. One could say the film's message is you cannot 'cure' someone from what is inherent, in this case, a sociopath. Or, one could say the message of the film is you reap what you sow; you can never escape the mistakes of your past because they will end up coming back at you in any way, shape or form. Of course, there are a plethora of other social messages in this film. Independent of the derived messages of the story, the film is brilliantly constructed. First and foremost, the main character's evolution throughout the film is admirably conveyed by both Malcolm McDowell and Kubrick. McDowell presents us with an absolutely ruthless Alex Delarge whom everybody fears, regardless of his stature; for all we know, he's eighty feet tall with that demonic look in his eyes. The actor shows, through his character, all the signs of a true sociopath, as seen when Alex gives us his first rendition of 'Singin' in the Rain'. In this early scene, we literally witness our main character (or as he deems himself, 'your narrator') break into a married couple's residence, beat the man and rape the woman, all this while singing the aforementioned song. In stark contrast, after the controversial treatment he undergoes sets him free, he is not at all the same person, and only a great actor can genuinely convey that. In addition, what really got to me was when they put him in that restraining chair and they forced his eyes open. There was no cinema magic involved there, they were actually doing that to McDowell, yet he remained totally in character, albeit the physical discomfort. Now with regards to what Kubrick does in order to bring life to Alex's evolution throughout the film. There's a certain quality great directors have when making their great films and I believe it is that they immerse themselves so completely, heart and soul, into their works that all throughout them, there is a reigning atmosphere which screams that they are creations of artists. A Clockwork Orange bears these qualities. Unlike bad directors (whomever they may be), great ones do not dissociate themselves from their films, undertaking the shooting as a purely technical process riddled with time constraints and budget concerns. The first part of ACO (that is, until Alex is captured) is dominated by the classical music that Alex loves. Even during the beatings and the rapes, the background music is always happy, feel-good music. This is a means Kubrick uses to show what a sociopathic monster Alex is. Killing is fun, rape is a blast. This is Kubrick's message for the first part of the film. Consider this: Kubrick could just as easily have played heavy, dramatic music, or nothing at all, through all this. But he didn't. The reigning atmosphere here is surreal: the attacks are surreal, the homes are surreal and the characters are surreal. It is as if Kubrick is Alex during the film. A classic comes down to these pretty basic components: great acting, great directing, a score that improves the action instead of hindering it, great writing and all the offshoots of these. Don't break your heads over what we call classics. They are just damn good films.",10,1,3,15 October 2006
Pulp Fiction," Nu Comedy
","I don't think I've ever laughed so hard during a movie. The brilliant thing about Pulp Fiction, the reason it is so highly regarded, is because it isn't cheap comedy. It's black comedy. Personally, it took me about 2 or 3 seconds after the punchline to actually laugh. I had to think about it. I could picture people seeing it for the first time in 1994, a time when most moviegoers weren't used to as raw, violent and graphic movies as we see today. Not many films leading up to Tarantino's made use of free violence for no moral reason at all but just to laugh. This type of comedy generally makes us ask of Tarantino : 'Can he do that? Is he allowed?' A perfect example of this is when Jules and Vincent are coming back from a whack ordered by crime boss Marsellus Wallace. They've brought back with them their snitch Marvin. In the car, both hit men are having a lively (and utterly comical) discussion, as is typical of Tarantino characters. Then, Vincent turns around, gun still in hand from the job, and asks Marvin his opinion. All of a sudden, his gun goes off and blasts Marvin's head off. 'Oh man, I just shot Marvin in the face,' says Vincent, to which Jules replies 'Man, I've seen some ****** up **** in my day but this is really ****** up!' There is no moral reason for this to have happened; it's just a hilarious lead up to the introduction of another hilarious character. Oh and by the way, I almost died of laughter, I'm not joking.All the characters are so original yet so real. Just look at the dialogue. Most of it is unimportant to the plot of the stories in the movie, yet that's what makes Pulp Fiction... Pulp Fiction. The thing is, it's so damn funny. The very first scene we see with Vincent and Jules, a few minutes after the beginning, their dialogue seems quite irrelevant : they talk about the little differences between America and Europe. For example, what we know as a quarter pounder with cheese at McDonalds is called a 'Royale with Cheese' in Paris. Oh, and they dip their fries in mayonnaise. At first glance, this dialogue is just killing time until something big happens, but with a skillful writer-director like Tarantino, no time is wasted. The said conversation keeps coming back and is useful to understand Jules and Vincent's relationship. This is not the only instance in which there are conversations like these; the whole movie is a goldmine of one-liners and witty conversations that seem irrelevant, but always come backTarantino green-lighted a movement in cinema that was to follow. Of course, the nineties and the eighties before them had their share of violent films : Scarface, Platoon, Apocalypse Now, Natural Born Killers and many others. But never had there been a movie that poked fun of people getting killed. Tarantino allowed filmmakers to have fun. Movies like Platoon and Natural Born Killers used violence in an attempt to criticize the behavior. But Tarantino uses it as comedy. There's nothing wrong with that; we can handle it. Bringing his ideas to film, Tarantino touched a sweet spot in film audiences. Nowadays, there are plenty shoot-em-up movies, and we thank our pal Tarantino for it.",10,1,4,12 November 2006
The Good Shepherd," Good. Merely good.
","Short and sweet should have been Robert DeNiro's motto while making 'The Good Shepherd'. He managed to get top performances out of his A-list cast that complement the film, his facts on the beginnings of the CIA are incredible, and, most of all, his screenplay, written by Eric Roth, is nothing short of brilliant.DeNiro is used to epic movies that span long periods of time and draw extensive character portraits. I think back to The Godfather II, Once Upon A Time In America and Goodfellas (among others). He learned from the master, Martin Scorsese.'The Good Shepherd' is an epic film. It spans more than 20 years and follows the lives of many characters, never overlooking any detail about them. Matt Damon's character Edward Wilson was taught by his father never to lie or lose face to his friends, or else he won't be respected. He then kills himself. Edward hears the gunshot. So, it comes as no surprise that Edward remains cold, hard and impenetrable throughout the entire film.I cannot say enough about the screenplay. Nothing is forgotten. A predominant theme in the movie is weakness. Everyone has at least one, for example, for an ex-soviet soldier turned cold warrior, it is the cold and for a CIA man, it is his homosexuality. Edward doesn't want to have any but does have one: Laura. He is truly in love with her. In fact, most of the few times he smiles in the film, it is with her. But as soon as he learns that she is his weakness, he coldly lets her go. Weaknesses destroy many people during the film and they resurfacing in this shadowy world. There is also Edward's son, who appears to be a weakness of his, but he learns to be dispassionate about everything, and overcomes his weaknesses. He is probably the ultimate CIA agent because he sees them in other people and appears not to have any himself.The screenplay does an admirable job at connecting everything. Edward's neglected son, Edward Jr., yearned most of his young life to be appreciated by his father. His psychology is just as fragile when he grows up, and longs just the same for his father's approval. This even leads to a heartbreaking moment near the end that fuels the film at the same time as it reinforces the nature of Edward Wilson.That said, as much as this project looks great on paper, the transformation of it to the screen is not as admirable. The world in 'The Good Shepherd' is a cold and dark world which DeNiro darkens and makes colder. He populates them with shady people and shady locations. However, the movie is too long. This makes it hard to keep up with all the goings-on: KGB, CIA, Cuba... As the movie goes on, we lose the feel for the atmosphere and the characters that just keep coming.I saw this film twice and drew the conclusion that it is not so much about remembering all the names of all the people and who's working for who and all that, but about the feelings we get. Don't get me wrong, this is a great thriller. The beginning of the movie is great because DeNiro introduces us slowly to this shady world. The codes they use ('tie your shoes' and 'there's a stranger in my house'), the promise of cool things to come all seduce us. But, about midway through, things just get too plain. There's nothing exciting. The stuff in this part of the movie are interesting, but as far as entertainment value goes, it doesn't match the first half.'The Good Shepherd' will undoubtedly be nominated for many academy awards, mainly, best original screenplay. But it just didn't hit it for me. Seeing the previews for this movie, I was expecting more. I was a little disappointed. Nonetheless, go see this movie, it is well worth it. 'The Good Shepherd' is an intelligent, good looking thriller. It just isn't concise.",7,8,15,23 December 2006
Casino Royale," Mission accomplished, and then some.
","After seeing Casino Royale, I wanted to be James Bond. So right off the bat, the new 007 film succeeded at something.His lifestyle is awesome and not one kid, or even a grown man for that matter, doesn't aspires to be him. At least for one day. He 'meets' pretty girls, blows stuff up, runs after bad guys and plays with amazing gadgets. So how have recent Bond films been so bad? Bond works for some undisclosed, and obviously non-existent, agency. Right there, Bond-story writers can exploit this. Nothing is grounded in reality; Bond can do whatever he wants. He has everything at his disposal.The problem, however, was that most James Bond actors were unable to get this character off the ground. Sure, Brosnan was suave and witty, but he wasn't bold enough. Nor was he rough enough. He was the type of guy who, just before killing a bad guy, would think like hell to deliver a one-liner. Or drink a martini.But Craig just shoots them in the face. Then kids around.Daniel Craig is key to this film. He's cold and unbreakable. A perfect example of this is when he's being tortured for information. Let's just say he keeps his mouth shut (and puts his manhood aside).The plot is also key. The main difference between this one and the other Bond films is that the plot is easy to follow. It takes its time to unfold. We aren't rushed into things.I admire the director who decided to layer the Bond character first and foremost. Here, Bond has just been given the '007' status. Instead of just telling us this in order to situate us, it is taken further. The second or third scene, which takes place in Uganda, is as exciting an experience as real-life sky-diving. Bond is a new 007, we know this already. Being a rookie, he takes things kind of far; all to our benefit though. Instead of abiding by strict international rules of engagement (for 'secret servicemen'), Bond chases a rather acrobatic Namibian bad guy around some Ugandan city, breaks into the Namibian embassy, kills the bad guy (which he can't do, really) and blows up the joint (which he also can't really do). All for a cell phone. His boss is mad as hell, but we, on the other hand, are quite content.Now, I don't know much about stunts. But, I do know when they're well executed and appreciate them when they look real. In Casino Royale, they do. The best example is the Uganda chase. However, I really enjoyed the choreography involved in a certain stairway fight inside Casino Royale. Bond is fighting an African bad guy. Just before the fight though, the sexy Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) was with 007. So when the fight breaks out, she's in it too. The two men fight their way down some stairs. I simply found it ingenious to have Vesper there, dodging stuff as she gets dragged along. The continuity is kept, and I appreciated that.As I said, Daniel Craig is key. I'm very happy that he's signed on to do at least one more Bond movie. I think he's THE ONE. In CR, he's a stone cold killer. In one scene, he's making out with a beautiful girl whom we were led to believe, by way of a sensual close up, he fell for on the beach. A love at first sight thing. Her husband, a bad guy that Bond is trying to corner, is gone for the night, and she tells Bond this. The bad guy has left for Florida. Bond is in the Bahamas. Without thinking twice, he scrams. This could have been done without the girl. But in getting her involved, it just goes to show us how dedicated Bond is.Craig also shows flexibility when he has to. Bond falls in love with Vesper. So much so that he quits 'the agency'. So, Craig does it all: hard-nosed and emotional. Props to him.Casino Royale drags a little at some points, especially in the long poker game. But, I enjoy poker and understood what was going on. Even if you don't though, it doesn't matter. The point is not what happens during the game. In the end, we know someone will win and someone will lose. Look at the actors' expressions; look at what's going on in the background with the other characters. These say it all. But the poker part of the film drags a little anyhow.This movie is a must. You'll be entertained, no doubt about it. And the character is absolutely compelling. Girls, you'll be charmed by him, and guys, you'll want to be him.",10,0,2,17 November 2006
The Pursuit of Happyness," A little too dreary.
","For a film that deems itself uplifting, The Pursuit of Happiness is quite depressive. Most of the movie ('most' meaning not half but about 9/10 of it) deals with Chris Gardner's (Will Smith) struggles with poverty, the raising of his son Christopher (Jaden Smith) and his tired wife (Thandie Newton). Chris' pursuit gets very long and by the time we get to the end, the reward is not at all worth our wait. Besides, we knew it was coming.Chris longs to be a stockbroker. He marvels and the lifestyle that comes with it. He has no education above high school, he has one suit for special occasions and sells out-dated bone scanners to hospitals which do not want them. However, this is a true story, so instead of being improbable, the plot is feasible.What gets out of hand is the adversity Chris faces. Steve Conrad, the screenwriter, goes out of his way (really out of his way that is) to emphasize the fact that this guy had it tough. Don't get me wrong, this is necessary in order to fully appreciate the feel good ending, but too much is too much. His wife leaves him, he gets kicked out of a few motels, takes his son to homeless shelters, then ends up staying in a subway bathroom, all this in a background of more oppression and intimidation at the broker firm.I thought the film would make me feel good (not that I'm feeling bad or anything, I'm just saying), but there's too much going bad for Chris and only at the end do we get the emotional, tear jerking moment. And let me say, it's not that spectacular. Take The Shawshank Redemption for instance. Andy, the main character, wasn't continually put down, yet Shawshank has one of the best, most memorable emotionally uplifting endings in history. We got uplifting moments during Shawshank, which is what Pursuit omits. The key is not to keep beating down your main man in order to have an effective ending. Will Smith's performance makes the movie worthwhile. Not at all over-the-top, it is just masterfully controlled. We totally buy his character. Too bad Pursuit is so dark and dreary.Happiness is spelled wrong in an early scene to show that Chris hasn't found true happiness yet. He asks to spell it right so as to not lead his son into error. Funny, I would have asked to make the whole movie right, because it is spelled all wrong.",6,8,18,16 December 2006
