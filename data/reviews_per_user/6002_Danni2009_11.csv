The Rock," Its Action But With No Class
","Definitely full of action, but NOT in same class as 'Escape From Alcatraz,' its no nail-biter thats for sure. Sean Connery was much better in 'The Untouchables.' Don't get me wrong plenty of action but lacks in depth substance in my opinion. Its worth a watch I gave a 6/10. Just another prison film, action reminds me of the movie 'Speed' to a degree.",6,0,2,10 September 2003
Meet the Parents," NOT A CLASSIC OF COMEDIES BUT STILL FUNNY
","I too an a Robert De Niro fan who is plays the father parent (Jack Byrnes) of daughter (Pam Byrnes) Teri Polo. While Blythe Danner, a fine complement wifeparent (Dina Byrnes). Ben Stiller as (secret Jewish) boyfriend (Greg Focker) to WASP daughter, wind up staying at her parents home. Like 'Father of the Bride' to some degree, but variety of oddball events between the father Jack ByrnesDe Niro (ex-CIA employee) critical of boyfriend Greg Focker's moves ishilarious. Stiller fine acting stands out, rest of cast fairs well too. Must See! Not bad movie made in year 2000 relaxed morality of the new century. 7.5/10",Null,0,0,19 January 2004
Citizen Kane," A Fine Slow Burner Mystery Classic
","Like vintage wine taste better with age, no need for high tech gimmickry like some todays movies. One should see this fine classic few times, since its more relative to the mystery maker Orson Welles fine artistic values. BTW, in my opinion 'ROSEBUD' I believe relates to the childhood of Kane torn from his mother's love. Growing up without  that love, took it out becoming of wealth & status. Left dying with the memory his 'ROSEBUD,' early age when once loved by his mother. Usually, mother's love like a rose with tough love thorns along it. Must see more than once to appreciate this old classic. A 10/10",8,0,2,11 September 2003
The Best Years of Our Lives," TOP 10 MOVIES ALL TIME BEFORE WOMAN'S LIB TEAR JERKER
","First I missed the beginning plus many reviews detailed names, acting anddirecting, WON WORTHY OF AWARDS THIS CLASSIC WWI AMERICA FILM.Briefly, it's about the the PERSONAL lives of WWI veterans with some anti war sentiment Pro American viewed one actor put it, 'America should have not gone to war to Fight the Wrong People,' Ironically, nothing has changed in America as we see with IRAQ WAR America is divided over the war. Main point is thelives with GETTING ADJUSTED TRYING TO GET A JOB, GET MARRIED TRYTO FORGET AND LIVE CIVILIAN LIVES IN A QUAINT HOME TOWN WHEREWOMEN WERE SO RESPECTIVE TOWARDS GUYS, THOSE THAT FOUGHTTHUS WOOED THEM TO THEIR LIKING FOR HOLY MATRIMONY with someTWIST along the way. Yes, not just marriage regardless of religious background 'MARRIAGE' was considered Sacred before God and Man. I personally notfamiliar of the actors but did FINE ACTING ROLES though movie seemed slowpaced, compared to movie making today. But, for one key actress role  was asmore independent leave her husband to find her own niche in life. Most partswere WOMEN IN TRADITIONAL HOMEMAKING ROLES. Boy, nothing better ina marriage keeping the Flame of LOVE MAKING going and being served withHOME COOKED MEALS by your 'better half female wife.' Some us guys don'tneed lavished gifts gadgets boy toys like their classy cars high- tech televisions/ computer/audio systems while that may be costly and sterile, I''ll trade that in for loyal faithful submissive practical loving homemaker any day of the week. Hmm! home baked Apple Pie ala mode! This movie IS a 10 in my book, since missedbeginning seem slow and a little uneven, but that may be not seeing the usually setup from the beginning. IN THE LEAGUE OF 'IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE'caliber, without holiday flavor.10/10. As a traditionalist, yes the is 'The Best Years of Our lives!'",10,2,9,28 February 2004
North by Northwest," Overall Classic but not Hitchcock's Best
","After seeing several films including Cary Grant, James Mason, and some other fine actors who worked under one of the BEST 20th century thriller directors Alfred Hitchcock,  is a culminating of several films Hitchcock and others made. I thought of 'Charade,' A Stranger on a Train,' just to name a couple. Mistaken identity, and mystery. Lots of one liners/phrases , like in 'Charade,' or in 'An Affair To Remember,' except slanted to mystery than romance. Overall, a good one to watch as your relaxing. 'Nothing to write home to mom about' cliche",10,0,0,3 September 2003
Apocalypse Now," THE 2001 VERSION APOCALYPSE NOW 1979
","This was more diverse though times seem slow but more DISTURBING! Well,the movie based on Oscar award original added footage though not reallysignificant, still made more of a diverse dimension, thus more likely howrealistically disturbing bizarre, Vietnam war was. The complaints of the playboy bunnies added footage was typical of a USO Bob Hope Entertainment gavemore moral boost to an already downtrodden depressed US troops felt hung out to dry, by US Gov. since the USA was so divided over Vietnam, seemed more ofa political war at expense of American troops, lost the war to the communists anyway. Oddly, great cast  from excellent director Francis Ford Coppola to cast Martin Sheen( Capt. Willard lead his crew seek out Kurtz),Marlon ( went loony colonel role Kurtz) Brando among other prominent actors had difficultythroughout film making, based on reviews I read on the original 1979 version, like had their own mini bizarre Vietnam experience. All in all,  thissemidocumentary/ war film depicted the diverse yet dark side of humans whenhope seems light years away. 9/10 A Must see over again, WARNING! getplenty of rest & protein bars to hang in on longer version 203min. This WASVietnam NOT ABOUT Vietnam.",9,4,5,7 December 2003
Singin' in the Rain," Brilliant! One Of Top 5 Comedy Musicals All Time
","Just watched on TCM, As always Gene Kelly's magical tap/dancing moves arefantablous! especially, Donald O''Connor stoled the show with his moves, won himself an award. Nominated, infamous director Stanley Donen, actors GeneKelly, Jean Hagen, and composer Lennie Hayton (Musical Score) guess ArthurFreed producer/composer missed out, anyway the music is great not much tosay as a storyline. After all, it's a film about 'making it big' within Hollywood all the while the main character Gene Kelly secret affection is for the up andcoming actress character Kathy Seldon played by now infamous DebbieReynolds who was barely twenty years old at the time, but don't quote me. Idon't blame character Don Lockwood (Kelly) trading in Lina Lamont, played byJean Hagen (who to her credit, played the dumb SQUEAKY talking blonde) wasthe on screen partner to Lockwood who CAYNT stand Lina! (she can not saycan't) I HATE squeaky voices! I used words I HATE( phrase Jack Nickolson used in'As Good As it Gets,' a great comedy flick) in the affirmative. (aside my pet peeves) All in all, a great just a FUN entertaining musical, just happens to be one of the TOP FIVE COMEDY MUSICALS ever! Need I say more. 10/10",10,1,6,19 September 2004
Some Like It Hot," A Classic But Not Best Comedies of All time
","Just briefly I agree this is overrated, Jack Lemon really comes through as far as comedies go.(As Always). Marilyn Monroe just because she's a bombshell Ireally don't rate her a classic actress as say a Kathrine Hepburn quality. Tony Curtis does well for his part, I never cared any for his movies. Overall 6.8/10",7,2,9,5 February 2004
When Harry Met Sally...," Modern Culture Romantic Comedy Is A Classic
","I commented on this romantic comedy, should be included in Top 250 IMDb list. A definite for as other mentioned for a first date etc.. Do opposites really attract? Fine acting combination of comedian/actor Billy Crystal as Harry and Meg Ryan as Sally. Fine supporting cast played by Bruce'Bruno' Kirby Jr. as Jess courting Carrie Fisher as Marie. Rob Reiner director, I believed was clever implemented a cute segue way to next segment of movie, using documentary couples givecute insights to their relationships ,in this case older married couples, small but funny part as Harry and Sally's relationship develop negative and positive. As story moves on, background narratives of Crystal and Ryan voices where's nodialog, their minds speaking adds a flare in my opinion, helps me be in Harry's shoes. Same applies if your a female to Sally's perspective. I know othersmentioned this part but worth repeating since it does not happen in 'real life,' where Sally is dared by Harry in diner scene publicly faking orgasm, that'salmost the climax of movie no pun intended. Another patroness glued to looking at Sally replies to waiter, 'I'll have what she's having' may not be verbatim sure was FUNNY. replayed that part over again so good. DEFINITELY A CLASSICboth genres to enjoy, bonus if dating or even married. So many scenes one can relate to. 8/10.",8,1,2,23 December 2003
When Harry Met Sally...," MODERN CULTURE CHANGED, THIS IS A ROMANTIC COMEDY CLASSIC
","Sort of a follow up of 'Annie Hall.' classic based in New York, also can be used as a holiday film as well a dating film. First, fine directing by Rob Reiner, uses documentary couples which are SO CUTE AND COMICAL as a segue way tothe next segment as story develops. It's mainly the relationship between Harry Burns played by funny Billy Crystal and the intelligent/dizzy beautiful yetversatile Meg Ryan played Sally Albright, a becoming classic actress should get Kathrine Hepburn type scripts made her Best Actress of 20th century. IMHO.Also, as a secondary developing relationship is Jess played by Bruce 'Bruno'Kirby Jr. and Marie played by Carrie Fisher which become best friends withHarry and Sally perspectively, do fine supporting acting roles. I believe the first half of 20th century some movies gave respect of reflecting the culture,whensleeping with your friend then love of your life was taboo, like in 'It Happened One night' pushing moral envelope was 'An Affair To Remember' and classicsimilar throwback fine romantic comedy 'Sleepless in Seattle.' Both receivedFAIR ratings ironically. My heartthrob Meg Ryan stars in it, is well becoming a classic actress as well comic/actor Tom Hanks. The moral issue once calledfornication, now is normal lifestyle for most, 'When Harry Mets Sally' is a classic fairs with 'Annie Hall,' should be in Top 250 IMDb List. My folks of 1920s stayed with moral traditional role as orthodox catholics, when choosing a lifelongpartner. Religion played significant role from dating to marriage, unlikeHollywood stars past lived like today's standards. Even though influential,Hollywood is not the blame for the moral culture changes, we baby boomersturned away from Orthodox to Reform (Rebellion). Moral issue aside, oneintensely memorable moments, was Sally (Meg Ryan) fake public orgasm in thediner as another patroness sitting by mesmerized,' I want what she's having.' 11/10 for that segment. All in all, A Romantic Comedy Classic! Both male andfemales will enjoy. Oh Harry! (wish I was playing Harry with Sally. (Meg is one of my Favorite Hollywood Hotties)",8,1,2,23 December 2003
From Here to Eternity," OLDIE BUT GOODIE PARADOX WAR & LIFE
","A  REAL CLASSIC 50's FILM! 'They don't make 'em like they use to' a cliche quote applies to this finely directed by Fred Zinnemann. The host main stars all great performances. My two cents is that though the movie setting is around the prewar (pearl harbor) while watching the lives of actors/actresses roles evolve in trying accomplish goals despite setbacks in each of their lives. It's military life relationships between genres, the struggles of human life FROM HERE  TO ETERNITY. In war you prepare then figure all angles out to succeed in the goal overtaking the enemy. Well this movie in my opinion FOCUSES on the INDIVIDUAL battles with their PERSONAL goals. THATS THE PARADOX. A GREAT MOVIE! Similar to Heaven Knows Mrs. Allison An Officer and a Gentleman, just name a couple. New films rely too much on special effects technology e.g. modern actor Ben Affleck similar Burt Lancaster's role in new Pearl Harbor, not in same league of acting ability in my opinion. Pearl Harbor 5.5 rating co,pared to 7.9 (s/b) 8.5 still much better over all romance/drama/war movie.",8,1,2,13 August 2003
