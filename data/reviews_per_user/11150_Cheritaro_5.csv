The Terminator," Fiction, but real
","The Terminator is very iconic movie. Music, quotes, and other elements are very impressive. Especially, Arnold Schwarzenegger's action is amazing. I am overwhelmed by his power and forget that this film are taken 30 years ago. A killer cyborg sent back in time doesn't have any emotions. His character scare the Sarah and her mates, and the audience. It implyes the developed AI technology's fear. 'cyborg'and 'Sky net' might be not science fiction. It is not impossible that robot get self consciousness. Also it is not impossible that the system always look us.We saw a lot of technology like Skynet on the news.Spy, beaurocracy, and many IT crime are there.In short, this film is very interesting in the terms of science 'fiction'and action.",Null,0,0,29 September 2015

Travis looks the parts of New York society he wants to see removed from his taxi. He also stokes Betsy, beautiful woman works at the office of an assemblyman, and Iris, a prostitute. His voyeuristic acts make fantasy and give him dangerous doing. Also, voyeuristic camera angles are used in a variety of ways. The effect this has is that there is someone watching them talk and does not want to be noticed. Audiences are put into the film as invisible character. When Travis calls to Sally, the camera moves away from Travis and we can only see a corridor. Since his miserable talking is painful to watch, so we give up seeing. This camera work is very interesting. We peeping Travis as passenger of the world in the film. With some tension, we pay close attention to move of character and what is spoken. We are introduced to Travis by seeing his eyes and their reflections in the rear-view-mirrors of his taxi. The self-reflection is the one of theme and it is illustrated in the famous mirror-scene that Travis speaks to mirror. But Travis is also a voyeuristic substitute of us as audience.

Enchanted," They lived happily ever after.
","At the first, Enchanted looks like ordinary fairytale animation. However we are surprised because the scene changed into the N.Y. city. Then we realize that this film changed fusion of real and fantasy. Disney masochistically pay homage its traditional princes story. It's make us fun. Firstly, we assume that prince marriedÂ  with prince. Zisel often sing a song of love. She teaches about love for Fillip. Her act gradually affect him. He remember fantasy of love. On the other hand, Zisel break the old woman's view. Finally, we realize what is the real and what is the true love. It images us the word 'They lived happily ever after.'",Null,0,0,29 September 2015
