50 First Dates," All stars/co-stars were excellent, funny, enjoyable, contriburtive.
","Drew Barrymore is very good in this movie. She shows very good and growing acting ability and, I believe, carisma. The premise of the movie was done very well and all the actors in this movie were excellent together. I can see a posibility of a lot of new comedic actors being discovered and presenting their talents. I would not hesitate to recommend this movie to anyone. Let your emotions have free reins on this one; you will enjoy the movie more.",8,0,0,17 February 2004
Spider-Man," Movie was much better than I though it would be.
","There was a bit of a likeable love store mixed in, the special effects were done well, and the conflict seemed possible. I enjoyed watching this movie. It's a good one to see; for a lot of adults as well as children. I would imagine that those that enjoy fantasy would enjoy it.",6,0,0,16 September 2002
