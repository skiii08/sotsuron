Hereditary," A movie about the Devil and how he hurts and destroys a family.
","My wife and I watched this yesterday and I must say that I just don't understand the people who are praising this movie. It has a very high rating on rotten tomatoes and on IMDB. The one positive thing I can say is that the performance of everyone involved in this film is superlative. But that's it.This is a movie about the devil and how he hurts and destroys a family. Where the devil reigns there is darkness, confusion, anger. Where the devil reigns there are mysteries, suspicions, accusations. Where the devil reigns there is unresolvable guilt, an inability to forgive, homicidal rage. Where the devil reigns there is hopelessness, despair, a descent into madness. Where the devil reigns there are occult practices, mediums, hallucinations. Finally, where the devil reigns there is blasphemy, death, destruction, and the flames of hell. This is what this awful movie is about.",1,14,34,17 June 2018
Train to Busan," Edge of your seat horror!
","This movie is two hours long, and from the moment the zombies appear about 20 minutes into the movie, it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Some of the scenes are almost unbearably tense. It is exciting but also sad because you grow to know and to like most of the characters in the movie and you don't want them to fall into the hands of the zombies.But by the end of the movie I felt not only sad but also burdened for some reason. I couldn't understand why because the movie itself was very well-made and enjoyable. And I wasn't bothered that the movie didn't end the way I wanted it to. No, it was something else.And I thought about it and I think it has something to do with the filmmakers way of looking at things, of their way of understanding the world. I know it's a fictional story of course, but what kind of a world is it where the reward for the incredible acts of bravery and of self sacrifice that some of the characters in the movie go through is to turn them into unthinking, ultra-violent bloodthirsty monsters!And then it occurred to me that it must have something to do with the filmmakers way of looking at things. It's a sad place indeed where your reward for incredible acts of bravery and of self-sacrifice is to become an ultra-violent unthinking monster. There is no redemption for these people, so they are running and fighting for nothing! Everyone here was hopelessly doomed from the very beginning.They say Jesus name in the movie but they use it merely as an exclamation as they often do in American movies. God cannot save anyone here because no one believes in him!",7,0,3,6 May 2020
The Babadook," A superior horror movie!
","The Babadook (2014) (spoilers)This is a superior horror movie. It's extremely intense and very well-made. The actors in it are outstanding. Great acting can suck you into a movie like nothing else about the production can. You watch Amelia, the mother, played by Essie Davis, with a growing mix of fascination, apprehension and terror as she slowly descends into madness. It's like something out of Edgar Allan Poe, arguably the best horror writer of all. The best horror is the kind that reminds of our fallen and vulnerable condition living in a world ruled by the devil, something Poe (and the makers of this movie) was very good at. Also, great horror makes you care about the person or persons who are being subjected to it. And you care about Amelia deeply. You care because you understand that she's vulnerable and helpless and therefore susceptible to the power of the devil who comes to her here in the form of the Babadook, a demonic character in a children's book.You care about Amelia and you care about her son Samuel. In fact, he ends up melting your heart. Samuel is played by Noah Wiseman who is every bit as talented as Haley Joel Osment (he of 'The Sixth Sense' fame) was. At first Samuel is annoying. He is disobedient and hard-headed and extremely needy. But once the demon, the Babadook, invades their home, Samuel, frail and small though he is, is the only one who can help free the home from the evil attacker.
The Babadook is a tale about demon-possession and about a love that understands deep things and knows no limits. Children are like that in the way they love. Samuel is like that:Samuel: I know you don't love me. The Babadook won't let you. But I love you, mom, and I always will.One of the sad things about Amelia's and Samuel's predicament is that they are utterly alone in their misery. Their friends have deserted them, leaving them to face their formidable foe on their own. When Amelia goes to the police station to tell the police about the Babadook and what he has been doing, the officers look at her like she's a crazy person. No one can help her and her son.This movie reminded me of other movies. In 'The Sixth Sense', the little boy, Cole, is the only one who can see dead people. In 'The Babadook', at first, Samuel is the only one who knows that the demon is real. The movie is also like 'The Shining', but instead of the father and husband, Jack Torrance, losing his mind, it's the mother. And, finally, the images and pictures in the children's book brought to mind the movie 'Coraline'.",9,0,1,2 May 2020
