Requiem for a Dream," One the best film that I never want to see again.
","I had heard about that this movie would be a real downer. But there is few thing in life that can make you feel awful, and at the same time loving it. This is one of them. The story are following a bunch of drug users from the early days of euphoria towards the downward spiral of destruction. It is told excellent and you are starting to feel so sorry for the characters in the film, that if you thought about doing drugs., think again. I think that Empire said it best: 'If you ever find yourself inexplicably contented with your lot, slip this into your DVD player and normal service will be resumed... this is a film you watch once, then repair to the pub to stare fixedly into your beer for the night, vowing never, ever to watch it again.'I hope that if any drugs user see this film, they will stop and think about their choose in life.",9,0,1,8 December 2012
