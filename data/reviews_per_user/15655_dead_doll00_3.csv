Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Utter garbage
","I went into this movie with some fairly high expectations, considering the amount of hype it received and the effort that went into its marketing. For about 5 minutes, I thought it might just live up to that hype. Sadly, it degenerated into the worst piece of garbage that ever crawled its way past the MPAA rating board. How this sort of trash could have made its way into any format (let alone a theater release) escapes me. In a time where we can't watch a good horror movie with a few scenes of blood and gore because everything gets cut out and yet we can sit down and watch what must be the director and producer's racist fun-fest, we live in sad times indeed. A worst piece of trash couldn't have made its way into the public eye short of defecating on the screen. If I could, I would rate this movie less than 1. How it has worked its way up to a 7.9 utterly escapes me. This entire movie is built on racial slurs and disgusting imagery. What sort of mind-set must you possibly have to find any of this funny or well-done? We live in an age where we need tolerance and understanding, not this racial-hate sponsoring garbage. Apparently, the times of elevating a movie to cult status for talent and good work are over. This is entertainment for entertainment's sake.",1,7,15,17 December 2006
Spider-Man 3," Thanks for BUTCHERING Spiderman!!!
","Wow...just...wow. If I had to talk about all the things wrong with this movie in-depth, I could probably go on for hours. Hours that would be better spent than the hours I wasted sitting at this cornball cry-fest. First thing's first: Where exactly has Spiderman's 'Spider-sense' gone?How does someone who can sense even the least amount of danger to himself (ie. getting hit by a car, etc.) not sense or see the spiraling meteor of fiery, gooey-black death falling 10 feet away from him? Oh yeah...he's too wrapped up in making googly weepy-eyes at Mary-Jane. That's another thing. This is in NO way a superhero movie. If you go into this expecting to be as blown away as you were during Spiderman I and II, allow me to pop that bubble. At most, amidst the random singing, dancing, weeping, angsting, and general 'WAH' from Peter Parker, this comes off as a musical romance. A dramatic, musical romance. And here I thought I was sitting down to watch...oh, I don't know...Spiderman? All the awesome CG and special effects and acting of the last two movies seemed to have vanished into the night, as it seems the makers behind this little suck-fest hit bottom of the barrel and vomited out the worst possible script in superhero history. This was even more painful to sit through than The Hulk. The villains are non-existent. Want to know why? Because there are NO villains in this movie. Only...*sniffle*...misunderstood victims :'( Aw...waaaaaah. Sandman and Hobgoblin both are but beaten-down shadows of themselves, and the only semi-saving grace in that particular department has to be Brock in his Carnage-suit, and even that was a far stretch.As for Mary-Jane and Peter...never have I hated both characters more. Peter Parker is reduced to a whiny, emo-spouting gothchilde (seriously, he wears eye-liner at one point...EYELINER!) and Mary-Jane is sufficiently slutified, becoming a jealous, entitlement-obsessed ninth-grader, just enough to send Parker over the edge.All in all, avoid at all costs unless you want this particular franchise ruined for you.",1,14,24,7 May 2007
Batman Begins," It Makes Up For Everything....
","Finally. FINALLY. A movie that makes up for the utter and complete waste of money that Batman Forever turned out to be. It makes the pain all better. Particularly since it's neither sequel nor prequel to the existing series, but rather a whole new bit, with the possibility of becoming something truly great. Batman Begins takes away from the unrealistic, almost cartoony-like franchise that the movies became and comes out with something darker and far more believable. The characters are a step and leap more realistic than they ever were before (with the exception of Katie Holmes, who I had no complains on really, but for the fact that she looked far too young for her particular role) and Batman himself is the best Batman to date (respect to Adam West, of course). Totally worth the money I paid to go see it and then some.",10,1,1,25 June 2005
