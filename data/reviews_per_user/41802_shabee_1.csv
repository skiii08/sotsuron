Kill Bill: Vol. 2," This is what I was expecting!
","After the movie ended I was still sitting in my chair with a big smile.I was actually a bit disappointed by the first part (Vol 1), because of the overload of action and the lack of a solid story. In that way I thought of part 1 as kind of boring (to much action can really bore me). Part one also lacked the cool characters and conversations I expect in a Quentin Tarantino movie. Part 2 (Vol. 2) totally makes up for that! ..It is the right blend of action and story. Just like part one it can go quite 'over the top' sometimes (a bit like desperado), but being the style of this movie I consider it cool. Uma really shines too. I didn't really have a favorite actress, but now I do.8/10",8,1,2,30 April 2004
