The Ring," Genuinely Disturbing
","Upon rising from the seat I had been at for the duration of the film, I felt both exhilareted and terrified. Hours earlier, I had assumed this would be some tacky, poorly put together horror film, almost synonymous with the new horror emerging from Hollywood, and not even touching various masterpieces like the Cabinet Of Dr Caligari or Halloween, unsurpassed since.A Videotape that kills people a week after they watch it ? It almost screams cheesy horror, something to waste your time one saturday evening with nothing better to do. But what emerges is an excellent mix of plot and horror and still makes the audience jump out of their seat. Like the main investigator ( reporter ), the audience learns more about the tape as she does, leading to a lighthouse and a family, all culminating in a spectacular finale. Watch it now.",Null,1,1,28 February 2003
