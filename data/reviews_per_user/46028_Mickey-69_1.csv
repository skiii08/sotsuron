The Blair Witch Project," Three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods and no one cared.
",After all the excitment and hype I finally decided to go see the Blaire Witch Project.  I found this to be a major disappointment.  I applaud the film makers and Artistan for making so much money on a movie that anyone with their own video cam could have done better.  This would have been a little better if Heather would have been the first to disappear since she is the most annoying of the bunch.  I view this film as an education experience.  How not to make a movie 101.This was a mix of bad acting combined with constant swearing.  The writers had a good idea but just couldn't convey it properly.,Null,1,1,21 August 1999
