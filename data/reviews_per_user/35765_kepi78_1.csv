Men in Black 3," No spoiler, but this movie was not too good.
","Let me start by saying, I had low expectations for this movie and the movie turned out to be worse than I expected. First thing first JOSH BROLIN did a Phenomenal Job as a young K, PHENOMENAL!!! Will Smith, I am a fan, but you failed to provide the comedic relief in this one. I will not lie, yes I did laugh, but for the most of it, the only jokes I really found to be actually funny made most moviegoers at our showing(white audience) cringe due to the racial nature and historical facts of most of the punch lines. While I have definitely seen worse, what upsets me the most about this movie is that we supported putting this movie ahead of THE AVENGERS!!!!!! The Avengers was an AWESOME movie from the corny jokes to the story, action, acting, everything about the Avengers was great.I do appreciate how MIBIII attempted to fill the holes in time traveling deaths, but at the end of the day, they failed at that as well. Put it this way, if you're over the age of 10, turn your brain off and enjoy because even my 11 year old twins were left unsatisfied by this film.",3,5,13,28 May 2012
