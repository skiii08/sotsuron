The Ring," What a Load of Nonsense!
","Other than the pretty lead actress Naomi Watts, this movie went aroundin Rings! Around and around with nowhere to stop! I mean, if that is themeaning of the movie, that as long as people see this video they willdie, then of course it makes sense. Once you start watching the hypnotictape, you're hooked and then the phone rings and wallah! 7 days andyou're a stiffie! To be honest, the videotape you weren't suppose towatch is the BEST part of the movie! It was kind of like some 1920'ssilent movie! However, there were too many loose ends! Like the little boy acting likehe was the twin brother of that kid from The Sixth Sense with his creepyeyes and posessed looks! And how did he know so much about that deadgirl? And what is with the whole movie being shot in that aqua-green hue? Isthat what it is like in the Northwest? I would of killed myself if Ilived in a world as grim and glum as that place! Forget about watchingsome videotape! And why did they leave out so many scenes that were inthe DVD that might of helped the viewers actually care about thevictims? All in all, it was just another waste of",Null,0,1,9 June 2003
The Bodyguard," The Way Movies used to be...
","It struck me as extremely funny that 2 of the biggest box-office movies of all-time, The Bodyguard and Titanic, were and are considered BAD MOVIES!!! So what is it that people want? A serious interesting movie with great acting and great writing,or a bad movie with likeable attractive stars and great music..which both Titanic and Bodyguard both have! Why is it that many comments about this movie are either Loved it or Hated it! Seems that box office is what matters when deciding if a movie is entertaining or not! People go to movies to be entertainedand escape the reality of everyday life! This movie is like an old hollywood movie from the 1940's when big stars would fill the screen with thier glamorous looks and charm and persuasive personalities that would pull us in and not let us go till the credits rolled! So sit back and grab a coke and enjoy a throwback movie! 4/5 St",Null,1,6,14 January 2004
The Fast and the Furious," Fast Furious and DUMB!!!!!
","Okay, so I am 42 and a little too old for the teenyboppers this movie was made for, but I am not hip to all the new Nitrous-fueled rice-burners that represent this generations muscle cars! It all started with the superfast rice-rocket Ninja-cycles of the 80's and evolved into Jap cars with Nitrous! Isn't that the same gas used to discharge whipped cream out of cans you buy in the grocery store? What a JOKE! If you want fast, get a Corvette! Get something that has a rumble, not a sound like a pack of bumblebees! God, that awful whining noise! And the movie was visual eye-candy for the young and the dumb! The lead actor, Paul Walker is handsome enough and looks like a Brad Pitt clone and Vin Diesel plays the machoman with the WWF voice real well too! But gimme a break..the cars have nice paint jobs but they are Japanese crackpipes with 4 cylinders! I would rather have a Z28 or a Trans Am",Null,0,1,27 October 2002
American History X," We are all racsist to a degree..
","and I for one liked the film for it's brutal honest opening. That kindof crime does happen and it's good to see it out in the open where wecan all be affected by it. Ed Norton gives a great performance thatwould of fallen far short of the mark had it been acted out by MattDamon or a Chris O'Donnell. Ed nails it with all the fury and hatredthat boils up and out from his maddening existence! He does what manyhave done and many more will do. When we can't accept that our fate isin our own hands and of our own choosing, we lash out at who or whomeverwe feel is responsible! We all do it to each other in one way oranother. It may not be a masterpiece like the Godfather, but it has enough goodmoments to make it stick in your mind and that alone makes it a prettydecent film. How many of you can remember much about the last 25 moviesyou spent 9-10 bucks on? But how many of you, 5 years later, still hearthe cracking of the skull on the curb? How many still see the insanedemonic eyes of Ed Norton's character as the cops drag h",Null,0,0,20 September 2003
American History X," Blackballed by Jewish-controlled Hollywood...
","and the best acting performance of the last 10 years was totally ignoredat the Oscars!!! This movies was a career defining acting job by Edward Norton. So muchso that even the great Robert De Niro said in an interview the Nortonwas the finest actor of this generation! Too bad Norton waste hisconsiderable gifts on silly roles like the one where he plays a Priest?It is too bad that there aren't enough good parts or great directorsaround like Martin Scorscese to get this kid his Oscar, which hedeserved in 1998! No-one did a better acting job in the last 10 years,yet he wasn't recognized by the Jewish run Hollywood Establishment! Imean the movie was AGAINST Adolf Hitler! You would of thought AHX wassupporting the skinhead movement! The movie was great. The opening scene was so harrowing and raw inviolence that it stays with you long after the ending credits roll. Tothis day, when someone mentions the movie, the first thing you think ofis the opening scene where Nortons character goes beserk on some blackpunks trying to rip off his car! When was the last movie that did thatit's viewers? The Russian roulette scene in The Deer Hunter in 19977starring DeNiro was the last one I can remember and maybe the Ox beingslaughtered at the end of Apocalypse Now. It seems that senseless violence and revenge rule movies these dayswithout any real reason for it behind them. At least this movie had areason for the violence even though the actions of the skinhead movementis hardly a reason to be violent towards another race. I liked the movie when I saw it in 1998 and HIGHLY recommend it toanyone who wants to see a first-rate acting performance! I doubt Norton will get another role as juicy as this one to prove hisacting talent. What a waste that he has to be part of the same actinggeneration as Oscar-winners/real-life losers like Ben Affleck and",Null,0,0,3 June 2003
Flashdance," Will the real JLo(Jennifer Lopez) please stand up!
","The one over-riding theme in a lot of the comments here about Flashdanceis how it does not hold up to the test of time! What a load! It doesstand up and it is very relevant. Just check out all the dance studiosand comedy clubs full of wannabees. Most of us have dreams or had them.When I first saw this movie I was 23 and I was full of hopes andambitions. And looking back now, this movie makes me see what happenswhen you don't go for them. I loved Jennifer Beals when I saw the movie back then. Little did weknow that Jennifer was the original Jennifer Lopez. The whole PuertoRican babe with the bubble butt that drives men crazy these days wasactually on display in Flashdance! This movie sparked a fashion craze with the torn and cut-up sweats andthe leg-warmers. Who can forget the scene where Jennifer and MichaelNouri character(who seemed too old for her actually) are in herapartment and she takes off her bra from under her ripped up sweat top.Was that erotic or what?!! It also had a memorable sound-track thatstill has numbers like 'What a Feeling' and 'Maniac' being played onthose 80's disco radio shows. All in all this movie was like  the movie Rocky! Instead of Philly yougot Pittsburgh! Instead of a boxer, you get a dancer! Instead of thetheme song ' Gonna Fly Now' with the line ' feeling strong now', you get'What a Feeling'. Like the nobody club boxer with no real formal boxingtraining, you get a dancer with little formal training who rises to thetop. Of course we know that in the real world, these characters wouldhave very little chance of becoming successes. Rocky Balboa would ofended up a punching bag just padding future champions records, andJennifer would",8,22,42,29 September 2003
Days of Thunder," Movie predicts the coming Jeff Gordon!
","What amazed me about this movie is how it tells the story of a young wiz-kid stock car driver that takes the circuit by storm! The kid(Tom Cruise) comes from California(just like Jeff Gordon) raced  and dominated open-wheel(just like Jeff Gordon) and became the youngest winner ever of the daytona 500 and the Winston Cup. The rookie upstart vs.the grizzled vet and all of this 3 years before Jeff Gordon arrived on the scene! Talk about premonition! Tom and Jeff both have simialr looks and builds and even simalr speech patterns. In the movie, Cole Trickle upsets the establishment with his immense driving talent and ambition to be the best just like Gordon did! Even the late Dale Earnhardt nicknamed him the wonderkid. The characters and the story line are pretty simple yet the drama unfolds like a true hollywood classic of an underdog rising up and winning it all..i.e Rocky. It's a fun watch and the action is fast and furious! Forget the goofs and the inaccuracies because most movies like this have them, and usually they are only noticeable to people who are really experts. Forget that you can't slam and bash cars up like they did in the movie and still go really fast enough to win races. Just en",Null,4,8,24 November 2003
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Unbelievable!!
","You can't honestly tell me that any one of the Lord Of Rings movies is better than Cuckoo's Nest! The fact that One Flew.. dropped to #12 because of the entry of LOTR The Return of the King, is outrageous! LOTR is nothing but overblown CGI! It doesn't reflect anything at all but fantasy! Give me a break! It goes to show you that there are more geeks and nerds on this planet than people with common sens",10,1,2,14 January 2004
The Shawshank Redemption," Not as Good with repeated viewings..
","To me, for a movie to be in the Top 10 all-time, it has to hold up torepeated viewings. This one does not. I can watch Jaws, City Slickers,Goodfellas, Titanic, everytime they are on because they exude a certainfeeling of a certain time and space. I am sure everyone here has moviesthat do that to them. Yes, I enjoyed Shawshank Redemption immensely whenI first saw it. I was suprized at the ending and found it holding myattention throughout. But just like Usual Suspects, after you know theending, and the cat is out of the bag, so to speak, the movie becomesjust a collection of characters and acting. And unless you aremesmerized by the performances, the movie just loses it's appeal. Unlikemovies that have more of a attitude or aural feel to them where you getcaught up in the ambience of the movie(stuff like City Slickers,Godfather, Goodfellas, Chinatown..) this movie just doesn't hold upbased strictly on the performances. I love Morgan Freeman and will watchmost anything he is in, especially Driving Miss Daisy and Seven. Itamazes me how this movie is considered the #2 movie alltime by thiss",9,0,0,30 September 2003
The Shawshank Redemption," Shawshank Not an Original idea but...
","does it come off as a great movie? Perhaps, but I still think that other than the fact that this movie's premise was a ripoff of ESCAPE FROM ALCATRAZ (made in 1979..a full 14 years before Shawshank).. I guess it's still not bad. It is an  interesting story, albeit not entirely true, or false. Yes, there was a prisoner who dug his way out of an alleged impenetrable prison. Yes, there was the usual bad warden who could make your life miserable and did when you did not tow the line. What  Stephen King did was change the timeline(1950's) and the digging. You never see Tim Robbins character digging! You get an  idea he might try it but upon first viewing the movie, you really have no clue except the feeling he is up to something!  He  is just to smart not to have a plan. Afterall,  he is the prison accountant and personal investment broker! So in the end, the  audience was just as surprized as the warden at the discovery of his amazing escape!In 'Escape from Alcatraz' we see the digging and the entire plan unfold..so what is left for us to enjoy is the satisfaction of  seeing that jerk of a warden get what's coming when the prisoners break out of the Rock! Stephen King created a great piece  of work and the director made it work as great cinema. So it doesn't come off entirely as a remake of a similar type of prison  break movie but a character study of 2 men who desperately want out and some who don't. But I thought you all ought to  know where the original story of digging thru a prison wall came from. To me the twist was Tim had to swim thru 500 yards of crap and Clint Eastwood had to swim across a freezing San Francisco bay! Whereas Shawshanks characters end up free, happy and in paradise, we never will know if the Alcatraz prisoners survived  the swim across the freezing SF bay..it's still",9,0,1,3 December 2003
Heat," Basis for the North Hollywood Bank shootings in 1997
",I rented this movie after the infamous No. Hollywood Bank od America Shootout back in April of 97. I had heard on the news that it was eerily similar to the movie with the assailants wearing body armor and high powered rifles. I went down to the scene and it was quite a scene!Almost like a movie set! Holes and chunks of cement blown off buildings and curbstones! And the movie was great,Null,0,0,27 October 2002
