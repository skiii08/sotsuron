It," Interesting visuals, poorly constructed
","The film's a tremendous disappointment--especially given the hype. 'It' is chaotic and unfocused. Mind you, there are some moments that feature truly spectacular visuals, and the film wants to have heart, but it's never scary and the narrative is--at best --picaresque. What's the mystery of Pennywise? The movie doesn't care. Why is Ben being sought out for special attention by town bully Henry Bowers? Forget about it. As a result, there's no real sense of drama, and some of the adult characters are so terribly stereotypical that any scene with a grown-up in it is difficult to watch. I'm crushed. i really hoped that this film would do for horror what Avengers did for Superheroes. That is, I hoped it would signal the start of something really epic. Instead, it felt like flipping through a bunch of movie channels on Oct 31. Sure, you see some scary images, but you just can't seem to care that much about them.",4,26,53,9 September 2017
Us," Ambiguity, Artistic Vision, and Spectacular Cinematography
","Don't believe the haters. Jordan Peele's second horror film is probably the most ambitious movie in the genre since Stanley Kubrick's version of The Shining. I was amazed by what the film tries to do--and by what it succeeds in accomplishing. Replete with references to other films (Hitchcock, Jaws, The Lost Boys, Halloween, etc...) to TV (particularly The Twilight Zone), to literature (the plot runs on a social dynamic similar to the one depicted in H.G. Welles's The Time Machine), and to Painting (the mirror image at the film's beginning is remarkably like Ren√© Magritte's 1937 piece, 'Reproduction Prohibited'), Us is driven by intense performances and tightly constructed scenes. In the end, it's a brilliant allegory for and deconstruction of class in America, but, beyond all of that, it's a riveting film full of irony and clever twists. Do yourself a favor and see it.",10,15,33,30 March 2019
The Dark Knight," The Most Ambitious Superhero Film
","The Dark Knight is to the superhero film what The Godfather is to the gangster movie. Nolan's filmmaking always teaches us to question the truth--to question what we know to be true, and the Dark Knight is no exception to the Nolan rule. A blistering deconstruction of the superhero genre--the most popular genre of the decade--The Dark Knight questions how far a hero should go in pursuit of a villain. The film responds to the problems caused by GW Bush's war on terror by offering us one of the most compelling and terrifying characters in modern cinema: Heath Ledger's version of The Joker. Like Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter or Anthony Perkins' Norman Bates, Ledger's Joker is so frighteningly fascinating and magnetic that I faced a conundrum when first watched the film: I couldn't wait for him to come on screen again--and i was cringing with horror every time he did. The film is visceral, accomplished, and spectacular. Bale's Batman is a study in contradictions, and in that way, he reflects his historical moment--the moment of the war on terror--very effectively.",10,0,1,14 July 2016
