Black Swan," Masterful acting, yet a bland and predictable plot
","Change the drug addiction in 'A requiem for a dream' with a dancer's obsession for perfection and the wreaked mentality of a young person, being put under tremendous pressure, and you've got the plot for 'Black Swan'.Don't get me wrong - the acting is indeed a masterpiece, Natalie Portman is incredibly convincing, so are the rest of the cast, who portray the older teacher trying to seduce his pupil, the obsessive has-been mother and the rival, determined to get the part. The ballet scenes are masterfully directed and depicted with true passion.However that didn't keep me from asking myself (after having watched the first hour of the movie) -'When is this going to end'?. The first time I saw the tearful Nina crumbling under the stress of her or her moms obsession, I could already sense where the movie was leading the viewer and what it was trying to say - an innocent and very inexperienced young girl is thrust into a world of competition, absurd physical requirements (read anorexia), unclear personal motivation, talks behind one's back and of course the obligatory overexposed sexuality.Not even once did I feel so enthralled by the plot in order to believe the portrayed images and delusions. The 'Fight club'-style plot twist was obvious from the start of the movie and could only manage an underwhelming climax.In my opinion the movie as a whole is not worthy of an Oscar Nomination. But if it is pretentiousness and fairly obvious conclusions of the 'Crime doesn't pay', 'Drugs destroy life' and 'Obsessions will swallow you whole' type Hollywood is looking for - than by all means, two thumbs up for art for the sake of art.",6,7,15,26 December 2010
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Enjoyable, fast-paced, good mix between drama and action
","I have to admit, I was put off by the multitude of negative reviews. I thoroughly enjoy the Star Wars digital universe - I've seen the movies and the animated series, I've played the Jedi Outcast and KOTOR series, The Force Unleashed, the first Battlefront title and recently - Fallen Order.I had mixed feeling when Disney took over and 're-wrote' the canon but I was never greatly attached to it. Having that mix of involvement in the saga but some healthy distance when it comes to a dogmatic reading of what the force is and what force ghost can do, I had great fun in the cinema tonight.Episode IX adds sufficient twists and original content on top of the references to the original trilogy and some voice cameos from the prequels to help it stand on its own. I disagree with the statement that the actors lack chemistry - both the lightsaber-wielding duo Ben-Ray and their friends connected on many occasions on the screen. At no point did the emotions feel forced or cheesy like with the Rose-Fin 'romance' of Episode VIII. The threat was believable, the allure of the Dark Side as real as in Revenge of the Sith. On more than one occasion I hoped for Ray to give in and give us a true twist. All the same, the price that the heroes pay does not appear trivial at any moment and the battle for the galaxy's freedom is costly, albeit at the cost of mostly secondary characters.The score was yet again a highlight for me. I've been listening to the original Binary Sunset all evening :)The 2h+ I spent at the cinema were worth it and the saga came to its second end...hopefully for good this time. And no, it's not canon, and yes there are lose ends but that goes for every of the 8 movies before it.",8,2,7,22 December 2019
