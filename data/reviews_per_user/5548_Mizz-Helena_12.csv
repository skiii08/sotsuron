The Blair Witch Project," The best horror movie i ever seen.
","This movie scared me to death. I cant spend the night in forests anymore. Josh, Mike and Heather comed to Maryland, Burkitsville to film about the legend Blair Witch. They drived to the Black hills forest looked for the witch, but something has going not as planned. After few nights there, someone was tricking them. The students were hunted, scared and had almost no food. They all disappeared and one year later theyr footage was found. This movie deserves 6 or more.",10,2,4,14 October 2003
Underworld," The best of all vampire movies
","I know there's people who doesn't understand what the story was really about..and they unrated the movie because they didn't think it was good..but in my opinion: THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER..Kate Beckinsale did a great job in this movie as the werewolf slayer Selene. She has been added to one of my favorite actress since. I always liked vampire and werewolf movies, but this is the most fantastic i ever seen. With this great dark picture and the great soundtrack. This genre of rock music relates perfect to this thriller. It makes the whole movie really Gothic and i like that.Selene who has hunted werewolves for many hundred years is now ready to make her mission bigger when she meets the future-hybrid Michael Corvin. Michael is protected by her, but he doesn't know that its time for his life to protect her from future danger.I love all of the characters and especially this fascinated story about the fights between werewolves and vampires and which side who will survive the war. I don't think anyone could play better as these actors here. And they could have been won more awards for their incredible job at this movie. My favorite scenes was when Mickael turned into the hybrid at the end and when Selene finally killed Victor, when he tried to kill Michael. The werewolves was perfectly created like the vampires..Rating 10/10;)",10,2,3,21 July 2007
The Day After Tomorrow," i liked it
","I don't understand what was wrong in this movie, most people thought this was a bad idea, but not me. It had great entertaining and was good as the other said before i watched it. Not so popular actors, but they did a hell good job. I liked all the scenes, and some of them was so exiting, some scenes i never seen in a movie existed here, so its not bad at all. This was excellent and I'm impressed. since this movie comparing to Deep Impact and Independence Day, I'm sure its getting nominated or hopefully getting an award. rating 6/6Some people think its also are based on a true story, that this will happen in the future. If it does, blame it on George Bush. He will probably shut the greenhouse effect/motive power that will cause the ice on this earth just as this movie.",Null,0,0,11 June 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," this first part you have to pay attention
","I love this movie, and i love the Lord Of The Rings-trial. As you see i am a Lotrfan. i have seen the two movies right now; Fellowship and Two Towers. And i cant wait for the third one, the last one; The Return Of the King.The Fellowship Of The Ring is about Frodo Baggins who got the power-ring by his uncle Bilbo Baggins, who took the ring from the disgusting creature Gollum(Smeagol).and is about to lead it to Mordor, where it only can be destroyed. Nine fellowship leaded the ring to Mordor; two men, Aragorn and Boromir(died),one alf; Legolas, one dwarf;Gimli, 4 hobbits; Sam, Frodo, Merry and Pippin, and a warlock; Gandalv the grey.They went in adventures and in the end they splitted. Some people died in the fellowship; Boromir and Gandalv(maybe). Frod left with Sam to take the ring to Mordor, Merry and Pippin was captured by the orks when they attacked, the three hunters Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli looked for them. So in the next movie you will see how they ended up. This first part, The Fellowship deserves a 6.",10,1,2,13 October 2003
Grease," Fantastic and memorable
","Awesome movie, especially if you love musicals..you will enjoy this movie. This movie has everything you need if you seek comedy, high-school, musical, cars..it has absolutely everything it needs of a memorable high-school fun.I have watched this movie over and over ever since i was a little girl and i still cant forget this movie, its so enjoyable. I remembered ieven acted as one of the Pink-Ladies at school..pretended to be one of them..it was so much fun. Me and my friends laughed and having fun, i cant forget those times. This is absolutely the best classic ever made and Olivia Newton John was so fantastic in this movie. She was like my idol in life before. And John Travolta was really sexy in this movie. i loved the comedy of the T-Birds and especially the teachers ..lol.Greeat especially for family and teenagers:D",10,5,8,28 October 2007
Edward Scissorhands," mr.scissorhands
","Spoiler This is a beautiful story about a not-completely builded man who lives up in the mountain alone in the dark-tower. And the Avon-lady found him to sell some make-up. She understanded how he lived and brought him to her home. He lived there for a while and fell for her beautiful daughter Kim, who soon felt the same way about him. Edward got many friends by his intelligence, cutting with his scissorhands, maked arts and haircuts. But that destiny didn't live for that long, his love for kim changed him which brought him to the mountain in the dark-tower. He killed Kim's crazy boyfriend after a fight. Kim then sayed goodbye to her true love, Edward and they never saw each other again.well i thought this film was excellent, but its a long time ago in the late 80s. That explained Winonas hair and her younger look and especially Johnny's look. it took time for me to figure out if that was him, he looked adorable which he still is. I give this movie 8/10",Null,0,0,10 June 2004
Van Helsing," great adventure
","I absolutely loved this movie, Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale is just wonderful. Now Hugh Jackman have turned to my 'one of the sexiest man i ever seen' list. Last time i saw him was in x-men. I love Kate Beckinsale, she is one of my favorite actresses, and she was so cool in the movie, i loved her in 'Pearl Harbor' and 'Underworld'. She must keep playing in more movies too. And David Wenham was too funny in the movie, but it was to weird for me to understand that he played the brave, tall, warrior in Lord of the Rings to a little comic munk in Van Helsing. But he is a great actor, no doubt with that.This movie had an incredible storyline, without the vampires i think it would be better. But it was exiting to see wolfman again and also Frankenstein. Dracula wasn't that kind of scary, it was just an ordinary man who wanted to create his own family, by using Frankenstein's monster into an some-sort of cave. But the real Dracula looked real ugly. i rate this movie 10/10",10,0,1,29 May 2004
Dirty Dancing," Best classic movie ever
",I love everything about this movie. i have seen it for years. and the actors/actresses are perfect for the movie. Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze are matched for eachother. This movie must always exist. i loved the songs and the type of dancing they danced. Dirty Dancing deserves a 6!!!,Null,0,0,12 October 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," better than the first one!!!
","I thought that two towers is better than Fellowship Of The Ring. it has more fights and more creatures. The ents where so funny and interesting. The orks was getting worse. Saruman became more evil. Frodo became obsessed with the ring. We saw more of Gollum. Someone mentioned Boromir. Eowyn showed up and shes so beatiful. I hope Aragorn and Eowyn get together. I dont understand why Arwen and Aragorn dreams to be together. Aragorn should go to Arwen then,its like they dont have a realitionship at all.i dont understand them!!!I hope i can see more of Sauron in the next movie, The Return Of The King!!!Its exiting. I cant wait also for the fight of Middle-Earth. Two Towers is impressing and deserves a 6!!!!",10,0,0,15 October 2003
Titanic," Fantastic and excellent movie oded to the huge disaster..
","I've have seen Titanic many times, and it is one of my favorite movies. Every time it is still so sad, because of all the people who died there. Amazingly directed by James Cameron, who must be the greatest director out there next to Peter Jackson.Now it is 10th anniversary since it has been released in 1998 in February. But it still looks like it has been made like yesterday to me, because of the amazing directing and the picture. I don't think anyone could make a great performance than Leonardo and Kate. They were the best couple ever.The real story didn't include Rose and Jack, but it was great idea to make a great story before the sinking, and it was the sadest love story also. When Rose just found the greatest love of her life, she loosed him when the ship was sinking. Think about the great time they could have if both of them survived Titanic. And it was weird when the old Rose didn't tell anyone about Jack after 80 years. I wonder who she went to when the survivors came to land in New York. We know she didn't went to her fianc√©, Cal. Did she really went to her weird mum? Did she go back to her dad? thats a mystery.i would love anyway to go to a Titanic museum. I find the sinking story very touching and sad. If only all those people could have survived, i wonder how it would be now.",10,4,7,11 December 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," creative filmmakers
","I loved this one. Of the all Lotr-movies, this one is the best. Peter Jackson is sure the best producer in the world. I liked all the scenes in this movie. The one with Gollum/Smeagol ended up like a creep, was scary though. Didn't know that Gollum was that evil. He had the chance to be good, caring and against The One Ring. But if he hadn't the conversations with himself he wouldn't ended up like a pointless loser who died because of one little thing. Didn't like him at all. The whole Gollum/Frodo/Sam storyline, scared the crap out of me. Especially when Gollum attacked Frodo at Mount Doom and bite his finger off(eeew).And Sam was a quite of a hero,i understand why he didn't trust at Smeagol at all, duh!!!And Shelob..oh my god, he was the scariest one, when he tricked frodo and was about to eat him.He was so ugly, the ugliest spider alive and twice as that big. Im glad that they destroyed the annoying ring at the end, glad that thing ended well for them, even when i was in doubt with it,he he..The other fellowship did as twice as big great performance. I liked so much the Pelennor Fields-battle and Minas Tirith. And plus Aragorn became the king. He is my fave character in this whole story, he showed a lot of intelligence.I liked the connection between the dead ones and Aragorn, and when they showed up to fight in the last battle. Eowyn and Aragorn should have ended together, they had much in common, i only wished Aragorn could see that, but ended up with Arwen instead. Arwen isn't so good of a character, i didn't actually understand why she cried for. Eowyn showed more feelings actually and proved what she was meant for(when she was in that last-battle). I love Eowyn, and she rocks more than Arwen does. By the way her brother, Eomer is extremely hot, true hero that man, the most sexiest man i ever seen in a armour and in a battle, talking about a true hero I've got. And too bad Treebeard and other ents wasn't with them, they were so funny, liked them!! And too bad Sauron didn't show himself in any other form than just eye. again like he did at the first movie. When i first heard about Return of the King, i thougth it was Sauron who is supposed to be the evil king and that he should return in the last movie, but i guess i was wrong. The subject is about that Arogorn should be the king, and he become too. well this movie was very exiting and different than other movies and showed how good Lord of the Rings is. I rate 10/10.",10,0,2,30 April 2004
Braveheart," memorable and historic
","This movie is great, but too long. And it was not actually the best made ever as i thought it will be. Battle-scenes and especially the love scenes were my favorite, Murron and William had been added to one of my favorite couples of television/movies. I cried when Murron died and when they buried her. It was very touching. I also liked the relationship between the princess(don't remember her name...) and William. They were always more than just friends because she wanted him since she heard about him, i saw it in her eyes.And about the battle-scenes...hmm, they were good, but too much violence, do i need to say something about when they showed their ass and their dick? i think it was disgusting..my GOD!! Damnit that William Wallace was brave, i became scared when they was going to torture him, i closed my eyes. I heard he was being cutted to pieces, but glad they didn't showed. I thought they showed it the last time i saw it, but that was long time ago, maybe something is wrong with my memory.",9,3,8,27 November 2004
