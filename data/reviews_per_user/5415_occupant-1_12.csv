The Blair Witch Project," Not close and definitely no cigar, but...
","... at least there was a kind of punch line at the end, where you get a twist from the viewer's perspective.  Too long in coming, however, and the bouncing handheld camera bit asks too much of the audience, many members of which got dizzy from watching so much jerky movement.  You could actually make something out of this idea if you stabilized the gear and used about triple the establishing shots to fix where these people were supposed to be. As it is, it appears - dare I say - slapped together.",1,3,7,2 September 2001
The Sound of Music," Increases in relevance with passing years...
","...due to the way the songs are framed.  This, I formerly thought, was the last musical of its kind (post-1920's Hollywood standard) but later realized it's a transitional point in the change from past standards to a more stark and spare approach, be it the stylized method of 'Yentl' to the MTV-oid manner of the di Caprio Romeo/Juliet redo.  In 'Sound Of Music', the story is a frame for the songs in higher relief than previous film, but in lesser relief than in Streisand's work, where the character lines meld with the songs.    The film, of course, has value above technique, showing an earlier, less crass approach to dating than today's, and in a modern, accessible language. It manages as well to note the potential terrors of wars past, along with the almost nineteenth-century lack of moroseness and pessimism that probably explains Europe's survival through that period.",Null,0,5,7 November 2001
Casablanca," '...a world that no longer exists...'
","... as a previous commentator noted - and it's a good thing it doesn't. This film is instructive in that it describes the tenseness of a world possibly about to lose its freedom to implacable conquerers.  This theme is as old as Athens and Sparta, which (thanks to public education) is just as unknown a story for many.  Against that background is a man (Rick) with a choice to make.  Few films get both the setting AND the foreground story right.  A milestone in film art.",10,0,0,2 September 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," More than acceptable
","Decent acting, decent costume design, decent music... quite a fairtreatment for this fable of good and evil thus far.  Toward the closeof this installment it's a bit difficult to follow the separation andreuniting of the various fellowship members in the forest - butthen, there's a lot to follow in the books as well.  As in the DiLaurentiis DUNE, the questions I'd have of the film would bequestions of the book.",Null,0,0,4 April 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A worthy addition to coverage of this story
","To separate myself from possible spoilers also commenting here,I won't criticize the Bakshi and Rankin/Bass efforts of previousyears, but this first Jackson film is quite worthy of a look - even ifthe viewer hasn't gone on to the novels - which everyone should. Not only is more detail there regarding this story of good and evil,but Tolkien, a contemporary of Winston Churchill and an Oxfordphilology professor,   wrote with a quality comparable to thewartime Prime Minister.  The reader gets an education in Englishoratory in the most painless of circumstances: read the books!!",Null,0,0,3 January 2002
Doctor Zhivago," Close but no cigar - perhaps a Panatella
","It all comes down to the writing - and Robert Bolt apparently did what he could, but the wandering story robs the setting of what could have been great.  Still, this is an instructive movie in all areas BUT story: cinematography (or the painterly framing of scenes), set design, integration of music to scene, acting, costumes... much was done well.  But for every scene in which Zhivago is realistically called away from a cheering crowd to a bloody hospital, there's a scene from the framing story that contrasts the rough revolutionary days with the 'better' present as represented by the hydroelectric dam, actually a chimeral PR boondoggle. 
Even the poster work was above average, foregoing photography for actual paintings.  But not a focused or aware story to be found...",6,3,6,19 September 2001
Saving Private Ryan," SPOILER: Is it pacifism or is it lack of direction?
","A script that begins with a credible concept of wartime legal necessity, then winds up at the dead end of a Private baldly disobeying a superior officer - and STAYING in the war - is almost unworthy of comment.  More believable scenarios (with laugh-track) came out of 'Hogan's Heroes'.Maybe there's a pacifist motivation in having the guy disobey his superior, then having the superior meaninglessly die.  ('War - what is it good for?') But the other half of that 50% chance is that the writer or writers just didn't know what else to do with this thing.  After all, they clearly didn't intend to write 'Midway' or 'Patton'.",3,1,2,3 September 2001
Patton," Underappreciated gem
","This is not a war movie.  It is a biography of a man who happened to be a US Army General.  It shows us how he operates, thinks and perseveres to his victories, some after repeated failure.  And Goldsmith's music is provided appropriately to the scene, as the composer of Doctor Zhivago was able to do; fortunately there's a coherent story with 'Patton'.",10,1,6,19 September 2001
Groundhog Day," What would you do if you had the time?
","Self-improvement would be no problem if we had an infiniteamount of time to allot to all the options - but we don't and the factthat there exists a choice of what to do with the years or months ordays left to us is the whole point of this film.  And it's nice for a filmto have a point in the first place.Some other comment writer summarized this point as 'Do it now!'. Hear, hear.  Without some internal, self-generated change in one'slife, every day is pretty much like the last.",8,0,0,6 January 2002
The Producers," Nobody does bad taste like Brooks.
",I was almost clubbed to death for suggesting this one for a film night among friends.  But it was worth it.  Mostel was woefully underutilized in his career and one of the few filmed examples of his prowess at full tilt is this film.  And Wilder's schtick was never better used than by Brooks - and not really understood by any other writer or director.,9,1,1,27 August 2001
The Matrix," The return of internal consistency in plotting
","... but considering the quality of writing these days, it won't return again for awhile.  This film requires the usual sci-fi suspension of disbelief but has several things going for it:  the characters are actually developed in a detective-movie-noirish way, the hero and others struggle with decisions and THEN act, as opposed to JUST doing something, and most obviously the film has a color-and-costuming visual style that remains a bold statement throughout the production.    This is a film that chronicles the style of the turn of this century in the same way that 'Georgy Girl' caught the London of the 1960's, and that 'Laura' captured the deco-elegant look of the 1940's.",7,1,2,3 September 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Good delivery - bad concept
","Respectable contributions of acting, directing and production are delivered in order to make light of 'The Odyssey', one of the cornerstones of literature.  This film is one of the clearest indications of how modern movements bite the historical hand that feeds them.",2,1,5,2 September 2001
