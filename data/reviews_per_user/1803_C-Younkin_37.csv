Angels & Demons," Doesn't have a prayer
","Every time a new pope is selected the Vatican blows smoke in the air and it seems as though every time Dan Brown is ready to make another couple million, he blows smoke up an audience's ass. 'Angels and Demons', sequel to the equally controversial 'The Davinci Code', will no doubt come under fire from Catholics and movie fans alike, yet still be a license to print money somehow. It's tedious, one-dimensional, bland, and the action (if you even want to call it that) is not only boring but it's also ugly. And as for Tom Hanks and director Ron Howard, well, you don't hear much about either one slumming for a paycheck but it looks as though 'Davinci' has started a trend.   Hanks reprises his role as symbologist Robert Langdon, this time called to Rome by the Vatican to investigate the re-appearance of the secret scientific sect called the Illuminati. They have captured 4 Cardinals and are threatening to blow up the Vatican with anti-matter (basically much more lethal bomb). It turns into a race-against-time scenario when Langdon and physicist Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) find out that the Illuminati appear to be killing the cardinals at the four alters of science. But are the Illuminati really behind this? They are aided by the Swiss Guard (led by Stellan Skarsgard). While this is all going on, the pope has recently died and the other Cardinals have been sequestered to pick a new one. Overseeing it all is Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor).   Think 'Davinci Code' without the big reveal in the middle. The screenplay, written by Akiva Goldsman and David Koepp, is just a lot of running around. Langdon uses his theological knowledge to ridiculously make everything his compass. A pointing statue means go that way. A dot on a map here makes a cross so that must be the next place they have to go. C'moooooon! As they race from point A to B, director Ron Howard's rapid camera and Hans Zimmer's pounding musical score are poor substitutes for the plot's lack of thrills. There isn't much action. A one-sided shoot-out where an assassin basically just picks people off, some gruesome deaths (including two where characters are burned alive), none of it entertaining. Howard does a nice job of panning the camera along the various monuments and architecture of Rome but he can't save this tedious plot that completely jumps the shark in the third act with an obvious and hooey-filled conclusion.   Hanks is a pro at comedy and drama but he gets next to none of those things here. Instead he's a stuffed-suit without the slightest hint of personality, spewing out knowledge but never anything worth caring about. McGregor gets a nice speech about the religion vs. science debate, which he knocks out of the park, and Stellan Skarsgard and Armin Mueller Mueller Stahl both offer some menacing intrigue but these characters suffer from a script that relies heavily on contrived plot conventions over interesting characters.The movie deserves some defense from the Catholics. Leave it alone. It's garbage. People know it's garbage before they even enter the theater. In fact, why even go to the theater? These stories may offer some guilty pleasures about Church secrets and conspiracies but in all honesty you can barely even call them stories. 'Angels and Demons' is the last in the Robert Langdon series that I know of, and with any luck, it will stay that way.",4,19,52,14 May 2009
Changeling," Not Clint's best, but fascinating still
","'Changeling' begins with the old-fashioned Universal Pictures logo and it really sets up what's to come. If this story were set today, a DNA test could have ended this movie in 5 minutes but it's set during the late 1920's, which makes it a complicated mess worthy of being unraveled by a big Hollywood movie. The film is based, unbelievably, on a true story about a Los Angeles woman who loses her son. The LAPD finds who they believe to be him, but its not him. It's a strange story and in less competent hands it could have gone way off track but Clint Eastwood is at the helm and a fantastic cast including Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich are out right in front. 'Changeling' is dense and twisty but it remains interesting nonetheless.Jolie plays Christine Collins, a switchboard supervisor who comes home one day to find that her 9-year old son Walter is missing. It's during this time that the LAPD is already under constant scrutiny for its corruption and incompetence, even being the focus of sermons given by Pastor and radio evangelist Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich). Christine is about to get a good look at how they do business when she gets a call that her son has been found. Only when arriving at a train station to see him, she knows immediately that the boy is an imposter. This leads to many verbal sparring matches between her and Capt. J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) and to police reports in the newspaper that Christine is neurotic and an unfit mother. Jones even goes so far as to throw her in a mental institution, where more police corruption is revealed to her by an inmate (Amy Ryan). Her only support comes from the pastor and from one good cop investigating murders committed by a serial killer (Jason Butler Harner) at a ranch.The movie is more of a chronicle than an emotional journey. It takes us down one path only to yank us down another one later on, going from the sad loss of a son, to a ludicrously shocking display of how the police use their power, to the grisly and disturbing murders committed at the ranch, and finally to the inevitable trials and calls for justice. This movie has a lot to cover and really doesn't spend much time trying to pull at the heartstrings in between. The timeline of events is shocking, ugly and is pretty much guaranteed to leave you fascinated and disturbed just I wish the story stopped every once in a while to dive into character psyches. But regardless, I liked the sort-of chess match being played between Collins and the police, her move being the constant evidence against this boy being her son and theirs being the laughably awful explanations to the contrary, my favorite being that shock can lead to 'spine shrinkage.' And again this is an uncomfortable yet probing film from Eastwood about the evil that men can do and if you can handle it there is a lot worth watching here.Eastwood's film is also very authentic. The cars, big red trains and drab looking costumes all look very 1920's. And amid all this background and design is Angelina Jolie, one of those old-fashioned Ava Gardner-type beauties who seems to fit into everything like a glove. There hasn't been a lot of talk concerning the Best Actress race this year but that should change with Jolie, who fills the character with fight, determination, and a strong sense of hope. Her best quality though is that she brings a restrained dignity to the role, never falling into a melodramatic trap once. Malkovich is phenomenal, providing us with a character whose rock-solid both in his intelligence and in his resolve. And the villains also shine, Jeffrey Donovan giving a slick and slimy performance while Jason Butler Harner makes for a disgustingly pathetic and sick human being.'Changeling' works as a report. It's more of a this happened, this happened, then this happened type of movie, with the characters going through motions. But that's really the only thing that keeps the movie from being really exceptional. The cast does fine work and fills the emotional holes the best they can and Eastwood again makes a compelling movie about the evil in the hearts of men. 'Changeling' could have been better but it's good nonetheless.",7,6,12,1 November 2008
The Hangover," Hungover with laughter
","'The Hangover' is the work of Todd Phillips. You know him. He made 'Road Trip'. He also made 'Old School.' Getting a bunch of buddies together and throwing in sex, drugs, beer, and all kinds of frat-boy hi-jinx is a formula that's served him well in the past and it does the same here. At the outset the movie is simple. One wild night followed by a couple days of trying to figure out what happened. It's a buddy comedy and mystery, reminiscent of 'Dude, Where's My Car', except this movie happens to be funny.The cast is mostly unknown but Phillips has worked with that before. Comedy is about chemistry, not big stars commanding big paychecks. Bradley Cooper (last seen in 'He's Just Not that Into You'), Ed Helms ('The Daily Show') and Zach Galifianakis (idk, 'This') play Phil, Stew, and Alan, three guys taking their buddy Doug (Justin Bartha) out to Vegas for his bachelor party. Phil and Stew are the best buddies, Alan is Doug's mentally-askew soon-to-be-brother in-law. After a wild night, the three guys wake up the next day to a trashed hotel room and several odd, unexplained phenoms. They find a baby in the closet, a tiger in the bathroom, and Doug is nowhere to be found. Other mysteries include why did Stew marry a stripper (Heather Graham), why are Asian mobsters after them, and dude, where's the car? The guys must retrace their steps to figure out the night and also find Doug.Fresh surprises keep coming as the story moves along. Some, like the baby and the marriage to the stripper are missed opportunities, but for the most part they're pretty hilarious. The tiger is a great bit, as are the Asian mobsters. What happens to be lying in the trunk of the car is another good one. What powers it all is that the guys remember nothing of the night before. The movie is like a fish-out-of water tale, just replace the water with Jagermeister and roofies. Phillips ties it all together with crude laughs that nonetheless come off very funny. Masturbation, sex, drugs, stun-guns, f-words, condoms, and a couple of baby gags that I'm pretty sure will cement his place in hell but still make people laugh pretty hard are just a few things in his comic arsenal.The three guys are great together. Allan is awkwardly clueless, unpredictable, and a little crazy. His speech, inviting the guys into his 'wolf pack of one', is fantastic, as is what comes after that. The chubby and fully-bearded Zach Galifianakis is a scene stealer. Stew is the opposite, a guy so whipped into submission by his girlfriend that they might as well share brains. He's a nervous nerd prone to unraveling at the first sign of pressure. And Phil is the cool, clear-headed straight-man to the other two who get most of the laughs. Cooper, Helms, and Galifianakis know their roles well and convince that these three very different guys could actually be friends. The supporting cast, which includes Rob Riggle, Rachel Harris, Mike Epps, and Mike Tyson (in a very funny cameo) help out as well, but the best one comes from Ken Jeong, playing Mr. Chow, leader of the Asian mob. His flamboyance and exaggerated speech make him a ridiculously quirky villain.'The Hangover' is a comic adventure well worth taking and when it finishes, don't leave yet cause you'll miss the hilarious trip photos playing over the closing credits. The movie is fresh, lively, fast-paced, and the cast is all game. Drink it up. It's a lot of fun.",7,31,61,3 June 2009
Star Trek," Best of summer so far
","JJ Abrams does what I never would have expected him to do, make a Star Trek that was accessible to everybody, even those who never really thought much of it (namely me for one). This is an eye-popping, heart-racing thriller of a movie with fantastic special effects, make-up, and exhilarating action sequences. It has a fantastic supporting cast including Zoe Saldana, John Cho, Anton Yelchin, Simon Pegg, and Eric Bana, being perfectly twisted as the main Romulan villain Nero. Leonard Nimoy also appears in a cameo that should have fans drooling. But what I loved were the two central performances coming from Chris Pine, as the cocky, restless, and wild James T. Kirk, and Zachary Quinto as Spock, torn between logic and emotion, Quinto finds the humanity. The power struggle between the two is one of the highlights of the movie. I can only hope that Abram's 'Star Trek' will live long and prosper.",8,3,9,17 May 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Let's go kill some Nat-zee
","The strongest part of Quentin Tarantino's new flick, 'Inglorious Basterds', is surprisingly the talk. Sure, there is blood aplenty and lots of gruesome looking sights but Tarantino does his best work in the drawn-out, talky scenes (and most of the movie is either in German, Italian, or French subtitles, but you won't seem to mind), usually keeping the audience in rapt attention and never letting-down in terms of payoff.And there is no one better at shaping Tarantino's dialogue here than Christoph Waltz, playing Col. Landa, a Nazi-hunter during World War 2 promoted by Hitler to round-up French Jews. Waltz creates a villain of outstanding cunning, talking pleasantly and allowing some comfort before he unleashes the underlying snake within. The movie opens on one of many outstandingly well-written scenes, where Landa faces a man suspected of harboring Jews. After his speech comparing Jews to rats, the man is in tears and the audience's skin is crawling. This is how every villain should be introduced.Other highlights come later. Melanie Laurent is gut-wrenching as Shosanna, a Jew who got away from a slaughter, initiated by Landa, but her family was not so lucky. Years later, she's hiding her Jewish roots while running her own cinema in France. This is a chance for Tarantino to let his love of movies play a big role, referencing facts of 40's German film, like propagandist Joseph Goebbels, making a movie critic one of the heroes, and setting the finale in Shosanna's theater as Goebbels plans on premiering his war hero film there. This puts Shosanna face to face with Landa, in a suspenseful and haunting scene. Shosanna agrees to host the event, but only so she can set the theater, populated with Nazi bigwigs, ablaze.A second plot hatched involves the Basterds, a group of Nazi killers led by Brad Pitt. They are involved in Operation Keno, the brainchild of a traitorous German actress (Diane Kruger) to blow up the theater. A barroom rendezvous between some Basterds dressed as Nazis and the actress unfolds in fantastic plotting and tension, as the bar is unexpectedly overrun with drunk Nazi's. A German soldier who can tell a phony German accent, a guessing game, and some drinking keeps the suspense simmering and keeps the audience fully involved before Tarantino finally lets it boil over into the violence.He's brought the idea of the Western standoff to other genres before and does the same thing here. The trumpeting music, stare-downs, and conversations in between moments of scalpings, head-bashings and carvings, throat cuttings, and other gruesome ordeals only serve to make the eventual violence that much more fun. And it all explodes off the screen by the finale, in which flames, tommy guns, double crosses, and all-out mayhem ensues.Brad Pitt gives one of his best performances, playing all-American Tennessee-boy Aldo Raines. After his opening anti-Nazi rant, he tells every member of the Basterds that he wants 100 Nazi scalps from each of them. Pitt is in great form here, putting on a rough monotone and coming off like a bloodthirsty John Wayne. He also gets some of the best dialogue. 'Were in the killin Nazi business, and business is a-boomin.' Some other notable Basterds are the Bear Jew (Hostel director Eli Roth), a character who likes to beat Nazi to death with a bat, and Stiglitz (Til Scheiger), a German who killed 13 Nazi soldiers and then got recruited by the Basterds. As Raines points out, when it comes to killin Nazi, he has 'great talent.' Tarantino's trademark foot fetish leads to another great scene later on and a David Bowie song nicely sets up the last act. And the movie is funny. Aldo and some of his cronies pretending to be Italian filmmakers (with the southern-accented Aldo massacring the language) is a comic highlight, as is Mike Myers in a cameo as a General.'Inglorious Basterds' never lets you forget that Tarantino is a consummate filmmaker, plotting everything with originality and tremendous cool. This is by far one of the best films of the year.",8,1,7,22 August 2009
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Apatow: King of Comedy
","Jason Segal is a relatively no-name actor whose biggest role so far has been playing a character on the TV show 'How I Met Your Mother.' He's now managed to write his own screenplay, get it sold, and actually get the lead role on top of all that, despite being a no-name. What I'm saying is, it's damn good to be a friend of Judd Apatow. And so far, nepotism seems to be paying off for everyone. No winging it here, Apatow knows some really funny dudes. Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Steve Carell, and now add Segal to that list with 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall', a laugh-out-loud funny movie about breaking up. He stars as Peter Bretter, a struggling musician whose life is pretty lame, except for the one bright spot of having a gorgeous television star girlfriend, Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell). Peter continuously finds himself pushed to the background while she lives the perfect life and still, he puts her up on a pedestal. So he is shocked when she dumps him. He takes it hard and after a terrible time of trying to get back on the horse and an on-the-job nervous breakdown, he decides to take a trip to the Oahu beach resort to clear his head. Only horribly enough, Sarah is also vacationing there with her British-rocker boyfriend (Russell Brand). Just as things look there worst, a resort employee named Rachel (Mila Kunis) takes him out for a good time, leading to a flirtation that tempts him to regain some confidence. Sex and nudity gags are the movie's bread and butter (in fact the film starts off with one of the funniest male nude scenes I've ever seen) and it takes some really good pot-shots at murder mystery shows, but like 'Knocked Up' and 'Superbad', the real charm is in the personal journey of the main character(s). A break-up can leave you a sad, pathetic, obsessive shell of a human being and Segal mines the material with a good eye for comedy but also sends Peter on a path toward not only new love, but toward his own self respect. That Peter and Sarah wind up reluctantly together again is another comedic highlight, especially during an awkward dinner scene and an even more awkward sex scene afterwards. The romance also works. Segal does a nice job of playing emotionally scarred and timid while Kunis counteracts it well with energetic positivity. Not to mention she is still ridiculously hot, as is Kristen Bell, who makes Sarah a little more than just a bitchy overachiever. And Brand is hilarious, not just in the heavy British accent he puts on but also in the laid-back and self-involved way he portrays the character. And Jonah Hill pops up every once and a while as a creepy waiter. He's a funny guy, I wonder if he has a screenplay in him as well. 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is another Apatow movie about learning how to grow up and deal with life's curveballs, and oddly enough, there are a lot more crude gags in that process than you might think. What's interesting and ultimately winning about these movies is how flawlessly they manage to combine the two.",8,3,11,19 April 2008
The Rocker," Wilson is not Will Ferrell
","Late August used to be a dumping ground for crappy movies, but now look at how 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' has changed all that. The 'sleeper hit' genre has become a key part of August, so much so that it's hard to tell the difference anymore. Take 'The Rocker' for example, the first starring role for Rainn 'Dwight' Wilson from 'The Office', a seemingly crappy movie that is already bouncing around the title of 'The Summers Sleeper hit.' Now usually the 'sleeper hit' genre has been attached to Judd Apatow-related flicks like 'Virgin' and last summers 'Superbad', and its really hard to picture Wilson in a lead role at all so this all seems like a pretty hefty claim, but the question remains, is 'The Rocker' a crappy movie or is it a sleeper hit? Wilson plays Fish, the drummer for up and coming 80's metal band Vesuvius. Just when the band is about to make it big, Fish is cut out of it, leading to 20 years of working dull, soul-crushing jobs while Vesuvius quickly becomes one of the biggest bands ever. Some salvation comes his way in the form of his nephew's High School band, A.D.D. The band has just lost its drummer to a High School prank and is in desperate need of a replacement, leaving them with no one else to turn to except Fish. The band, which includes nephew Matt (Josh Gad), brooding lead singer Curtis (Teddy Geiger), and lone girl bassist Amelia (Emily Stone) is at first reluctant to accept the nearly forty year old drummer but in a plot twist that can only happen in movies, a Youtube video they make leads to big time fame. Soon A.D.D is playing the clubs and Fish is even romancing Curts' young mom (Christina Applegate). Just like all bands, they are not without their conflicts.Wilson comes from the Will Ferrell school of comedy, in that he goes for cheap and sophomoric material. The movie relies on vomit, sweating, Wilsons flabby body jiggling in the wind, and when all else fails, him getting hit with something or a pratfall. Sure the shock value from these things is worth a chuckle sometimes but he doesn't have the same sort of buffoonish innocence that Ferrell does and a lot of what makes this kind of material hilarious is the sort of personality doing the delivery. Wilson doesn't seem to have it and so a lot of the jokes just look like what they are, cheap and sophomoric. And the story doesn't help either. It follows 'School of Rock's' storyline pretty closely of build a band, learn life lessons, encounter a problem, and finally rock out in front of a huge crowd. Just 'Rock' had an infectious enthusiasm for music as well as a sweet side but this is more a generic retread of most stories about the successes and perils of starting a band. No real surprises here.The cast does OK. I'm not saying Wilson is a bad comic actor but this material doesn't seem suited for him at all. All the 80's headbands and weird outfits can't disguise the fact that he's better playing a much weirder character like Dwight from 'The Office'. Christina Applegate seems to light up any film she's in and I wish she was given more screen time here. Emma Stone, Josh Gadd, and Teddy Geiger each get do their best in throwaway roles as musicians dealing with teenage angst. Will Arnett and Fred Armisen are both pretty funny as Fish's old band mates and Jeff Garlin and Jane Lynch are pretty much wasted in unfunny roles. There is one person who makes out like a bandit in this movie though and that is Jason Sudeikis as the A.D.D's asshole manager. Known to me only for a recurring role on '30 Rock', he gets the best lines and when he gets them he knocks them out of the park.'The Rocker' itself just doesn't rock though. It just felt too cheap and sophomoric, too conventional, too much of a waste of talented actors, and above all, a completely wrong type of vehicle for Rainn Wilson.",5,31,58,20 August 2008
Public Enemies," Wow!
","There isn't much character development here but Johnny Depp scores as the self-assured, fly-by-the-seat-of-his pants, Robin Hood-esquire Dillinger who spat in the face of Johnny Law at every turn. As a member of Hoover's 'take off the white gloves and hit hard' FBI, Melvin Purvis, Bale does more than just be a stuffed shirt. The cat and mouse game between the two is suspenseful and the bullets crackle and explode in intense shoot-outs and the prison escapes and bank robberies couldn't be more daring. The production values (the classic cars, night-clubs, costume design, the old movie theaters, etc) look fantastic and bring the 1930's to life and the tight close-ups of characters faces adds to the grit of Michael Mann's outstanding looking film. Cottillard is a classic beauty, a strong presence, and her scenes with Depp are some of the best romance you'll see this year. But it's Depp, layering on the cool, that has us rooting for the bad guy. This all leads to one of the best and most powerful endings of the year.",8,5,8,13 July 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Jackman has claws, but the movie doesn't
","It was a lackluster and underwhelming movie year when suddenly 'Wolverine' injected some life into it, a full month before anybody actually thought he would. A fan boy wet dream came true as the movie, in perfect quality, appeared on the internet absolutely free of charge leading to new debate over piracy and manic containment control by Twentieth Century Fox. A Fox columnist was fired, the FBI was brought in to investigate, an Australian visual effects company was implicated but nothing was ever proved. What a way to start off publicity for the clawed super hero, definitely the most charismatic of the 'X-Men'. He finally gets to show off his chops without all the extra baggage but the result is surprisingly tame and standard, both in terms of plot and action.It's a prequel so were starting all the way back in 1845 with Logan as a young boy. After some complicated Daddy issues, he mistakenly kills his biological father and runs off with his brother Victor. Both know they're special, Logan with his claws and Victor with his sharp nails and fangs. They will grow up together, Hugh Jackman playing adult Logan, a.k.a Wolverine, and Liev Schreiber playing adult Victor, a.k.a Sabretooth, and stand side by side for every war from Civil to Vietnam, not aging a day in that time span. They are eventually recruited by William Stryker (Danny Huston), running a Special Forces team of mutants to do secret missions around the world. Victor sinks his teeth into it but Logan soon tires of the violence and splits to become a logger and takes up with a schoolteacher girlfriend. Just it isn't going to be that easy. Victor kills his girlfriend and Stryker tricks him into an experiment involving having his skeleton bonded with the metal, adamantium. Just what he doesn't know is that Stryker wants to harness his DNA afterwards and erase his memory. Logan manages to escape and sets out for revenge, finding that what happened to him is just the tip of Stryker's plans.The execution is oddly flat. Much of the movie is based around encounters Wolverine has with characters with different special abilities. Some are very cool. I really enjoyed Deadpool, a character who can deflect bullets with his swords, and Gambit, who can manipulate kinetic energy. Sadly the screenplay by Skip Woods and David Benioff reduces these roles to brief cameos so it can shoe-horn in a lot of other unnecessary characters, campiest of all is the Blob, a Fat Bastard clone if I ever saw one. No one makes much of an impression, perhaps because their only given a few lines before being tossed into underwhelming fight sequences with a lot of aimless swinging, thrashing, clawing, hand-waving, and beating. In the entire movie there is only one action sequence that even deserves the right to be called Blockbuster and that one involves a motorcycle, some military hummers, and a helicopter. Some of the special effects are good. Wolvie showing off the claws is cool, as is Sabre-Tooths 4-legged speed but for the most part the special effects don't add much.Jackman is perfect for this role though. In the 'X-Men' movies, Wolverine has really found more of a following than any other character and all of that lays right at Hugh Jackman's feet. Wolverine fits him like a glove. He's got an awesome physique complete with rugged good looks and total grit. Another notable here is Liev Schreiber, who really finds the menace in this reckless, hot-tempered character. And Danny Huston is at his slimy best as the evil William Stryker.Just 'Wolverine' is pretty tepid and that's unfortunate. The backstory is really your average revenege flick. We don't find out a lot about what Wolverine stands for or how he got his claws in the first place. I also wondered how Wolverine ages since Jackman seems to cover 100+ years of the characters life. And what surprises me even more is that the action is a little on the lite side, being less about inspiration than about just random fights. Summer is about bringing the A-game and despite being a watchable movie with a good sense of humor and an ending that sets up the Bryan Singer X-Mens very well, it just doesn't live up to expectations, coming up short in quite a few categories.",6,2,7,1 May 2009
Terminator Salvation," Summer popcorn fun
","'Terminator Salvation' is the best offering this series has given in quite a while, not saying much considering the lackluster showings of both the third movie and the television show but still better praise than I was expecting to give it. We're still far from the narrative brilliance of a 'T2' and that will undoubtedly put this movie under scrutiny from the hardcore 'Terminator' fans, but if I may, I'd like to turn those vengeful eyes away from director McG. Despite its short-comings, this movie looks terrific and it's every bit the big, dumb, loud, thrill-a-minute action movie that usually defines the season of popcorn fluff. You may be disappointed by the overall lack of story and meager character development (I know I was), but it's a damn entertaining action movie nonetheless and for that I credit McG.John Connor (Christian Bale) has grown up. He is not the leader of the resistance just yet but he does command a unit of his own and he does address most of the other units through the radio every night. In addition to his role as a general, Connor also spends a great deal of effort trying to find teenager Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), who will later grow up to go back in time and knock-up John's mother, thus creating John. The other part of the story centers on Reese traveling with a man named Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), a stranger whose last living memory is being on death row. When the machines catch on to Reese's destiny and capture him, Wright wakes up to find he is Connor's prisoner. It seems that in addition to having a human heart, he is also made of metal. Connor thinks Wright is there to assassinate him but Wright is just as confused as Connor. The men form an alliance, both with the objective of saving Reese.McG creates a bleak 2018 future. Everything has been bombed to rubble, resources are scarce, and it's all real dingy-looking, the perfect playground to go nuts with technical toys. Aircraft rumble through the air, giant transformer-like robots suddenly come out of nowhere and grab people like rag dolls, motorcycles break off from the robot's feet (which leads to one of the movie's best chases), land-mines are another big surprise, as are robotic snakes. The T-600 is pretty scary and the T-800 very much so, the T-800 also features a very familiar face from the past that will have fans cheering. There is a ton of fire-power and explosions and the final raid on Skynet is thrilling to say the least. So much is happening here that it's a shame the movie also feels hollow. There is no real dramatic tension until the third act when the birth of John Connor again must be saved. It's a familiar plot line with a too predictable outcome to add the dramatic weight the film could really use.The human cast finds itself pretty much overshadowed by the electronics as well. Watching Christian Bale I couldn't help but think back to his rant, where he berated a photographer for taking him out of a scene. I find it funny because the role never really requires him to go that deep. Much of his performance is a lot of yelling and shouting, that's about it. The female cast, which includes Bryce Dallas Howard, Moon Bloodgood, and Helena Bonham Carter have even less to do. Worthington is the only one who gets much of a conflict and he plays the robot/human angle to tragic effect. He will definitely be an actor to watch this year as he also has a role coming up in James Cameron's (not just movie) but 3-D event 'Avatar' coming in December.'Terminator Salvation' proves that there is still more fun you can have with the 'Terminator' franchise but it needs to find more of a narrative focus. Movies about humans trying to preserve humanity only work if those humans figure more into the plot. Here they're fantastic action stars and the actors playing them are likable enough but overall they don't leave much of an impression. Neither does the story, which is still all about saving John Connor. It's time for Connor to step up, be a leader and end the war once and for all. Unfortunately that will probably only happen when the studio sees the money from the franchise start to dry up but one can only hope that a proper send-off will eventually be put in the works. Until that day comes, movies like 'Terminator Salvation' aim to add a little bit of enjoyment to your summer day and in that it succeeds mightily.",7,73,139,20 May 2009
Yes Man," A career low
","'Yes Man' confirms what you already thought about Jim Carrey's career. It's struggling and it's struggling bad. His movies hinge on him, I get that. He's supposed to be his wild and zany self and the rest is supposed to work itself out but jeeze, in the past he's at least gotten workable premises. Now he's worrying about the number 23 and yelling yes to everything and everyone. 'Yes Man' marks his career-low, a movie so awe-inspiringly bad at times that I just wanted to walk out and try to remember the good times with Carrey that now seem so far removed.He plays Carl Allen, a lonely, sad-sack whose been avoiding his two best friends (Bradley Cooper, Danny Masterson) and refusing to go out at all since his wife dumped his boring, say-no-to-everything-ass. He works in a bank approving loans, a perfect job for him since he declines all of those people too. But on advice from a friend, Carl is invited to some crazy seminar run by some crazy guru (Terence Stamp) with some crazy ideas about saying yes to everything. Carl buys into it and soon all of his yes's are opening doors to different opportunities, including a date with a free-spirited musician/photographer/exercise teacher/missionary worker (you get it, she's a free spirit) named Allison (Zooey Deschanel).The problem with this movie is that the yeses also open the doors to the jokes. One involves him having to give a homeless man a ride (the homeless man also kills his cell-phone battery, which is the big laugh pay-off I suppose). Another yes gets him into a bar-fight. One more leads to him repeatedly and hyperactively shouting out 'Red Bull.' And the near walk-out moment for me was the old lady who offers him oral sex. And I don't even want to get into his sing-a-long of Third Eye Blinds 'Jumper', as he's trying to get a man off the ledge. If anyone finds this ludicrous and near desperate material funny, consider getting an MRI on Monday right away.Which brings me to Carrey, who really has to go above and beyond here to even get the few chuckles he does get. He wraps tape around his face, dresses up like Harry Potter, drives a motorcycle bare-assed through the street but not once does this premise allow him the same thing he was allowed in 'Liar Liar', a movie a lot of others have compared this to. It just looks like he's doing random things for the sake of doing them here, whereas in 'Liar Liar' his schtick fit in better. I used to be a big fan of this guy but it looks like his great dramatic work in 'Truman Show' and 'Man on the Moon' has dissipated into things like 'The Number 23' and his comedic career all hinges on doing another movie with Charlie Kaufman.And Zooey Deschanel is no help. She looks much younger than Carrey, can't match him in energy at all, and sounds as if she's drowsy. If she's watching this movie, I can understand why. 'Yes Man' is one of the worst comedies and movies I've seen all year long.",4,8,18,20 December 2008
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Nice visuals but very little excitement
","'Hellboy 2' comes in the middle of a superhero sandwich, what with last weeks 'Hancock' and next week's already proclaimed king of summer 'The Dark Knight'. I'm curious as to the legs this movie will have. The first one did OK, though I seem to recall a mixed reaction to it. The first one came out in April though, away from all the summer blockbusters. Since that first film, director Guillermo Del Torro has made somewhat of a name for himself with Pan's Labyrinth (tho I was one of the few who thought it was overrated) and he seems to be primed to become the next big thing in Hollywood. A mainstream hit would do wonders for him. I'm also interested in Ron Perlman, the man behind the Hellboy mask. He was the best thing about the first movie, sympathetic and cynically funny, and I feel this franchise should turn him into a star, or at least a better known name. All this was going through my mind this weekend as I entered the doors to see 'Hellboy 2'. This second installment begins with an ancient tale of truce between humans and fantasy creatures. King Balor of the fantasy creatures created a golden army controlled by his crown but he was so ashamed at the result that he had the army hidden away, the crown destroyed into three pieces, and a peaceful resolution was settled. Jumping ahead to present day, his son, Prince Nuada (Luke Goss), is appalled at what the humans have done to his father's land and he seeks the pieces of the crown to control the army and take the land back. This is a job for the team at the 'Bureau for Paranormal Research', the amphibious Abe (Doug Jones), pyrokinetic Liz (Selma Blair), and big red, i.e Hellboy (Ron Perlman). Just they have problems of their own. No longer sure that Agent Manning (Jeffrey Tambor) can control the team, Washington has sent by-the-book Special Agent Johann Krauss (Seth McFarlane), who I'll describe to the best of my ability as white steam in a Scuba suit (he's also apart of the creature world if you haven't already guessed). With the help of Nuada's sister (Anna Walton), the team seeks to stop the Prince before he can get his hands on the army. 'Hellboy 2' is a minor entry in a big budget summer slot. It has its moments but it just doesn't have the overall gravitas of your usual big bang popcorn flick. There are a few things I liked, the biggest is that it's thankfully never boring. Like the first movie, this doesn't take itself too seriously. There are a few really funny tongue-in cheek moments, some of the best come from a scene in a troll market ('I'm not a baby, I'm a tumor' is a great line by the way) and visually Del Toro proves himself a talent as well, showing us evil looking trolls, demonic looking angels, and a whole slew of mechanical soldiers. Just even with all this going for it, I can't think of one scene that excited or thrilled me, and I can think of a few, including a gigantic plant-like creature, that actually turned into gigantic let-downs. The villain is introduced as very quick and agile and he actually excited me at first but the movie gives him very little to do until the finale, and when that finally does come, it seems like he's being held back. And the other fights just seem like stuff you would find in any standard creature feature. A lot of clobbering but nothing especially cool. The plot on this one is a little by the numbers, sort of a CSI: Paranormal, and there are two romantic sub-plots involving Hellboy and Abe which, other than a funny scene where the two drink beer and sing Barry Manilow, don't really add much. But I'm an action guy and the lack of 'wow' is no-doubt the films biggest flaw. The actors don't seem to be having as much fun this time around either. Ron Perlman does the bad-ass thing and quips well, Seth McFarlane (yes from Family Guy) gives a very comical German accent for Krauss, and Jeffrey Tambor offers a few comedic bits but the rest of the cast is pretty wooden, Selma Blair being the biggest perpetrator as she holds a glum and bored look on her face through the entire movie. It's too bad that they didn't have David Hyde Pierce back for this one because Doug Jones' voice really threw me off. And while I enjoyed most of the movie's overall cheesiness, the opening scene featuring boy-hood Hellboy just made me cringe and hope that he would go away soon. He thankfully does, but all for the purpose of presenting a mixed bag of impressive visuals, some funny moments, but overall no real excitement. In looking back at my review for the first movie, I noticed I said the same thing. 'Hellboy 2' paves the way for a third installment and I'm sure I'd be interested in seeing it but by this point I'm wondering if I'll ever be truly impressed by these movies as a whole.",6,13,28,12 July 2008
Watchmen," Great effects but plot lost in translation
","'Watchmen' the book has been called one of the 100 best novels of all time. If that's the case then 'Watchmen' the movie is missing a lot. I've not read the book but I've seen some of the art and from a technical stand-point director Zack Snyder and his team have done very well for themselves. Just the plot is lost in translation and it's one big 3 hour mess, a long and unpleasant string of flash-backs, subplots, exposition, bloody violence, and overall just a flat-out exhausting jumble of different things that never get a chance to breathe or work into any sort of entertaining narrative. It makes you wonder just how anyone thought Alan Moore and Dave Gibbon's multi-layered graphic novel really could have ever worked on film? I was hoping to love this movie. Instead I wound up enjoying the Advil I took after it was over.The time is 1985 and the soviets are about to attack within the U.S. It's 5 to midnight, which is like saying code level orange. Tricky Dick Nixon has been elected to a third term and, in the first of many flashbacks, we find that throughout current events between the 1940's-1980's regular human beings with no super powers have donned masks and costumes and become superheroes until Nixon forced retirement on them. When the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is killed, it effects the group in different ways. Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) is determined to uncover the murder, while Dan Dreiberg, formerly Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson) and Laurie Jupiter, formerly Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman) just seem content to live normal lives, and Ozymandias (Mathew Goode) has turned his hero status into financial gain by harnessing cleaner energy. Meanwhile, the only hero who actually has powers, Dr Manhattan (Billy Crudup), is trying to divert the Soviet crisis while at the same time deal with rumors that his blue glow has caused his colleagues and several others to get cancer.This is really only the set-up. From here it goes in different directions but still doesn't really add up to much. The script by David Hayter and Alex Tse is so backstory-crazy it makes 'Memento' look linear, centering on everything from a controversy between the Comedian and Jupiter's mother (Carla Gugino), a stint between him and Manhattan in Vietnam, Manhattan's creation, a lot of childhood stuff with Rorschach and Jupiter, various scenes where these characters become disheartened or disillusioned, and a lot more. And when not in flashback, we're treated to everything from a character vacationing on mars and building some indescribable circular thing, Dan and Laurie having odd super hero fetish-sex, a prison riot, an irrelevant revelation about a character's father, and of course so much more. And then we have the actual action, which seems to come just as randomly as the rest of this movie and features every bloody thing from cheeks being bitten off, arms being chopped off, a meat cleaver taken to a guy's forehead, and unexciting slow-motion fights where arms, legs, and various other body parts are broken in two.The movie spares nothing in regard to what's in the book but surrounded by all this bloat is some type of deep, mature point about heroism and humanity that just never comes through. The movie holds itself out as too serious and important. The constant shifting back and forth and from subplot to subplot, the scenes that just can't play out dramatically because they suffer from crammed explanations and characters who seem to just randomly come and go rather than feel apart of the movie just make this effort a bore. And what's worse is that most of these people are either just assholes or bland, monotonous, and cheesy and it makes it very hard to be anything but indifferent to them.If anyone makes a jump to being somewhat interesting here it's Jackie Earle Haley's Rorschach. He's a gruff-voiced bad-ass and I loved the character. The rest don't really make a dent, but Akerman and Crudup respectively increase the sexy by a lot. As does Zack Snyder. Like most comic book movies nowadays, he gives it a dark, seedy, grimy, and depressing look that complements the effects nicely. I thought the make-up, especially on Nixon, gave the movie a nice comic touch and Rorschach and Dr. Manhattan are each done beautifully, the former with his entrancing mask of moveable ink and Manhattan with his gorgeous blue electrical light and ability to duplicate, transport himself, and take things apart and put them back together just with a move of the hand. The Owl copter, the circular thing I described on mars, and the big ball of light that comes in the finale all look great as well.This movie also has one of the best soundtracks probably ever put on one CD. Simon and Garfunkel's 'Sound of Silence', Hendrix's 'All Along the Watchtower', and the movie opens up with a Bob Dylan 'Times they are a Changin' montage. In general this movie was just lost on me though. I have no idea where it was trying to go or what any of it means and to me it just looks like a nice-looking jumble of different things that just didn't work.",5,31,63,4 March 2009
Knowing," Senseless
","Some really horrific action sequences are on display here but the rest of the movie is just laughably bad. The plot hinges on ridiculous contrivances and bypasses so many plot holes. The characters increasingly are called upon to do the dumbest, craziest thing you can think of, while the actors go at every line with a heavy-handed seriousness, which would work if the movie made an ounce of sense. Instead, Cage and Byrne just look like they're trying too hard. The worst is the ending, which jumps the shark into flat-out parody of itself. How anyone thought this ending was the best they could have done is a mystery to me. During the screening I had the idea that this movie could have had the intense paranoia of 'Arlington Road'. Instead it does the laziest and most senseless thing every time.",5,11,22,24 March 2009
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Younkin Reviews Movies
","'The Men Who Stare at Goats' is a fascinating subject that gets the 'Saturday Night Live' treatment. It's all based on fact (from Jon Ronson's book) but the concept is so silly that director Grant Heslov and George Clooney (both worked on 'Good Night, and Good Luck) really can't help but make fun of it, and there are some good laughs here. Just no real story.Ewan McGregor plays journalist Bob Wilton, a jilted husband who goes to war to forget his backstabbing wife only to end up wiling away in Kuwait. One night he meets Lyn Cassidy (George Clooney), a familiar name to him from a previous interview he did years before about psychic-spies. Lyn was the best in what was called the 'New Earth Army', started by Vietnam-Vet Bill Django (Jeff Bridges) in the 80's to create soldiers with super-powers who could prevent conflict. The Army was later dismantled and used for evil purposes by the movie's antagonist Hooper (Kevin Spacey) but Lyn tells Bob he's been re-activated, and has a secret mission to do in Iraq. Bob, thinking Lyn crazy but interesting at the same time, decides to team up with him and go where the action is. Along the way, Lyn tells him stories of others dubbed, 'Jedi Warriors.' Most of the movie is flashbacks, beginning with Iraq War 2003 and chronicling all the way back to the beginning of New Age warfare. There are weird and crazy laughs to be had like Lyn's initiation, where Django urges him he will never be a soldier unless he can free the dance. The lines are good too. 'We tried invisibility but then worked it down to just not being seen', Lyn tells Bob upon their first meeting. Clooney is perfectly eccentric as a guy who lives by the mindfulness-over-warfare principal and McGregor is a whiny, but solid straight-man. Bridges is also terrific as this free-spirited hippie. Only the laughs and flashbacks (which feel like a series of sketches) aren't enough to distract from the fact that 'Goats' really has no compelling narrative. The forward-moving story in Iraq 2003 has very little momentum. Spacey appears later on again as the villain but the conflict is weak and the movie has more than over-stayed its welcome.",6,68,128,5 November 2009
Shrek Forever After," Shrek has lost a step
","Another summer, another 'Shrek.' This time Shrek (Mike Myers) is unhappy with the monotony of marriage and fatherhood and goes to Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohrn), who promises to magically give Shrek a day in his old ogre lifestyle if Shrek willingly gives up a day in his childhood. What Shrek doesn't know is that Rumpel has been after the throne to Far Far Away ever since Fiona (Cameron Diaz) was locked in the tower and Shrek signing his life away is the perfect opportunity for the crazy little dwarf to take power. Not only that but since Shrek technically never existed, nobody remembers him, not even Donkey (Eddie Murphy) or Puss (Antonio Banderas), the kingdom has been ravaged by Rumpel, and Fiona has given up on finding a knight in shining armor and become one herself. This all amounts to some harmless stuff for the kids basically, which is kind of sad since the first two were such clever fairy-tale satires. This fourth and last installment in the series plays out predictably, relies on the same stale themes (love conquers all, life was never meant to be a fairy-tale), goes for the easy jokes (poop, pee, belch, and Puss has let himself go for the fat gags), and also relies way too much on characters with funny voices or who sing and dance to pop culture songs. This is also the first in the series to be presented in 3-D but the unremarkable action doesn't even come close to warranting a 3-D viewing. While not as bad as 'Shrek the Third', 'Shrek Forever After' nevertheless feels something like a direct-to-DVD knock-off that might excite kids looking for some mild entertainment, but I think even they'll notice that Shrek has lost a step.",5,27,54,15 May 2010
Quantum of Solace," Not the same old Bond, but entertaining
","Roger Moore came out this week and said that he doesn't like the new, ultra-violent Bond movies and that they were a sign of the changing times. Some moviegoers will probably feel the same way. 'Quantum of Solace' lets us know in the first scene that Bond is a changed man, less concerned with cool and more with kicking ass. I recall only one scene, and a short one at that, where he beds a pretty Brit chick and I don't think I saw a shaken and stirred martini in the house. What I did see were some pretty nifty action sequences, surprisingly all of which look like director Marc Forster ('Finding Neverland,' 'Stranger than Fiction') lifted from director Paul Greengrass and the Jason Bourne series. They all have that shaky, hand-held, fly by the seat of your pants feel to them. I'll give Forster some credit though. I found the action impeccably realized, breathlessly fast-paced, and really suspenseful and new Bond Daniel Craig has brought toughness and swagger back to a character that seems to have been missing some of each in the past couple decades or so.The plot is a little eh. It has something to do with the head of an eco-company named Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalrac) putting together a master plan to promote some Bolivian general or something like that to president and in return he gets control of a Bolivian pipeline. It's supposedly a bad thing but I didn't really care that much. Bond gets involved because Greene is also responsible for the death of his love, Vesper Lynde, at the end of 'Casino Royale.' He teams up with latest Bond girl Camille (Olga Kurylenko), who oddly enough also has a score to settle and is sleeping with Greene in order to accomplish it. The two bounce around from Haiti to London to Bolivia trying to figure this whole mess out while M (Judi Dench) is under repeated pressure to get 007 under control.The script, by Paul Haggis, Robert Wade, and Neal Purvis does what it sets out to do somewhat. It's a little weak but there are more than enough double crosses, red herrings, and frame-ups to distract from the fact that the story is underwhelming and hard to follow. Also a little hard to follow are the action sequences themselves, but like the 'Bourne' movies, they also have adrenaline-pumping thrills. 'Quantum' opens with what may be the best car chase of the year (cars narrowly evade other cars, smash into things, fall off cliffs, it's all fast-paced and brilliant) and from there goes to the best foot chase, going along rooftops and through windows and ending with two guys having a gunfight while dangling from ropes. It's undeniably impressive and I haven't even gotten to the boat chase or Bond narrowly escaping an attacked airplane. It's all really exciting thrill-a-minute stuff, and doesn't let up for a second.Unfortunately a key plot device does get lost in all the mayhem. The idea of revenge and Bond's vulnerability at having lost his love never really come through as well as they should. It's too bad because Daniel Craig, along with being one of the most bad-ass, handsome, and lethal Bonds ever, also tries to dig a little deeper to find the vulnerability that comes with the super-spy job. It's not something you normally see and the filmmakers don't give you very long to see it here either. The rest of the cast is all game, the best being the always classy, dignified, and authoritative Judi Dench. Mathieu Amalrac does his best but his character represents one of the bigger problems with the Bond franchise in the last couple installments. We keep seeing the same average guy with a lunatic fringe and it's a pretty weak characterization. And Olga Kurylenko holds her own, being one of the hottest and most fiery Bond girls to hit the screen.'Quantum of Solace,' with all its flaws, is still entertaining due to some really nifty action sequences and Craig's overwhelming appeal. The posh locations and the OO7 name may be the only things that have hung around, and in trying to bring itself into the 21st century it may be trying too hard to be a 'Bourne'-clone, but the series is still showing strong signs of life and for a guy coming up on his 23rd film, that's quite an achievement.",7,1,3,16 November 2008
The Hurt Locker," Lack of character and story hurt it
","Iraq War films have proved to be box office poison in the past and most have met with varying degrees of critical success. Watching 'The Hurt Locker', I doubt that there is enough here to warrant much of a commotion. If you're looking for a comparison, much of it will remind you of the second half of 'Full Metal Jacket'. Yes, that's the half that most people call the lackluster one. We're invited to a birds-eye view of what its like on the ground, right in the middle of a war zone, but the limited amount of character development and story hurts it.Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, and Brian Geraghty star as an Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) team. Renner is the leader, a cowboy who likes to do things his own way and the other two are his more conservative underlings. As they struggle to reign in the wild man, the men must contend with danger and urban combat at every turn if they want to make it out alive and get home to their families. Guy Pearce (Memento), David Morse (16 Blocks), and Ralph Fiennes (The Constant Gardener) make brief cameos as superior officers.Director Kathryn Bigelow has proved she's the real deal before with 'Point Break' and 'Strange Days.' She's a good action director who knows how to up the suspense. Action is not this movie's problem. It utilizes an effective use of quiet and Barry Ackroyd's frenzied hand-held cinematography gives the movie a documentary-style approach and feeling that a threat could be just around the corner, on top of a roof, or a couple miles away. And there are lots of gun battles and bomb defussions, something that serves the movie well at first but not as they keep going on and on. Repetition of straight action and not enough scenes where we get to know the characters are the real hurt on Mark Boal's screenplay. The movie clocks in at over 2 hours and staying with it for that long is not the easiest thing to do.As far as performances go, Renner is the one stand-out..Playing a cocky adrenaline junkie who doesn't really fit anywhere but on the battlefield, the actor known for roles in 'The Assassination of Jesse James' and 'SWAT', hits the performance out of the park. He's very effective, especially in a scene where he stands fully clothed washing off other people's blood. It has the kind of power that the rest of the movie just doesn't have. Had it gone with more scenes like this, 'Hurt Locker' would have been a much stronger recommendation. As it is, it's hard to see this movie making much of a splash.",6,6,22,21 June 2009
Taken," Taken with 'Taken'
","After meeting a cute guy in the airport, a teenage girl proclaims, 'I'm going to sleep with him' to her best friend. It's in these opening moments that 'Taken' is very unnerving, showing naïve teenagers ready to cut loose from mom and dad only to discover that there is a darker side to the beauty of the international world. Yet this movie is an actioner from France filmmaker Luc Besson, known more for escapist entertainment like 'The Transporter' and 'The Professional', so its safe to say the seriousness of it starts and ends with that. This movie comes from a very real place, but its pure popcorn. The screenplay is by Besson and writing partner Robert Mark Kamen and cinematographer Pierre Morel makes his English-language debut behind the camera, and despite some things that go over the line, it gets the job done.Liam Neeson stars as Bryan Mills, who we can assume did some pretty shady, black-op type things for the government. Now divorced and retired, he finds himself competing for the attention of his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) with her new richer father (Xander Berkeley), while being constantly at odds with his ex-wife (Famke Janssen). Against his better judgment he allows Kim to go on a vacation with a friend to Paris and as if he predicted it, he receives a call from Kim right as kidnappers are taking her friend and coming after her. From piecing together the background noise he overhears, he places them as an Albanian group with their hand in drugs and the sex trade. It's up to him to fly to Paris and put his 'particular set of skills' to good use in order to save his daughter.What follows is really a string of martial arts, gun battles, explosions, and car chases. The movie goes by in a brisk hour and 25 minutes and for the most part it's a well-made thriller with a good central performance from Liam Neeson. It's his show for most of the movie. Besson isn't interested in the heartbreak of the parents back home or what horrible things the girls being preyed on are suffering. Even the villains remain off-screen and one-dimensional for most of the time, unless Neeson is beating the bloody crap out of them. What Besson (and I'm sure the people looking to see this movie) is interested in is an intimidating badass who knows how to kick-ass and take names without mercy and Neeson covers that and more. He also shows the sadness and finds the humanity in a man desperately trying to find his daughter.What bothered me about this movie though is the torture angle. I know the last thing your supposed to do is look for morality in what's basically a revenge fantasy but there are times when you just feel like Mills goes too far. Electrocuting a man for the schere joy of watching him suffer or shooting an innocent woman in the arm so as to get information from someone else isn't entertaining or the stuff that makes him particularly rootable. 'Taken' works in the same vain as 'Out for Justice' and is, for the most part, a fairly thrilling revenge flick, just sometimes it gets too carried away and crosses a line that you wish it knew not the cross.",7,3,5,27 January 2009
Alice in Wonderland," It's a mad mad mad good world
","Tim Burton's 'Alice in Wonderland' is actually a sequel of sorts (think Steven Spielberg's 'Hook', only much better) which again sees Alice go down the rabbit hole but imagines it in a completely different way. Linda Woolverton's script is like a blending of Lewis Carroll's books with 'Lord of the Rings', which is actually a bit like 'Chronicles of Narnia', only much darker and more eccentrically fun. Enough with the comparisons! What I'm trying to say is 'Alice in Wonderland' brings an excitement to the fairytale that I've not seen in a long time. Mia Wasikowska does a superb job as Alice, now a teen being forced into marriage. She runs off and falls down the rabbit hole and into a strange world of talking rabbits, caterpillars, and Tweedle-dees and Tweedle-Dums. There are also dangerous creatures as well, like a humongous dragon that Alice is prophesized to fight in order to save wonderland. The evil Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) has taken over wonderland from her sister, the White Queen (Anne Hathaway), and plunged it into darkness. The Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) has taken this especially hard and gone a bit loco (more so I guess). Is this all a dream? Has Alice been here before? Alice eventually must learn to come into her own as a hero and help the white queen and the other creatures beat the Red Queen or all will be lost, starting with their heads. This is thrilling stuff made predictably better by Burton and his production team. This is a wonderland scorched black by evil that still manages to keep a Gothic beauty (the make-up and costume design is perfect), a disturbing darkness (the red queen's castle is surrounded by a lake filled with dead heads) and eccentricity (the red queen's abnormally huge head and little body was a favorite of the characters). The cast is also game. Depp gives a surprisingly sweet-natured performance that erratically shifts into a crazy little giggle or Scottish accent on occasion, but he is wisely made a supporting player here. Wasikowska is the real find, as the conflicted and spirited Alice, probably one of the best female heroines to come around in a while. Hathaway is pure elegance as the white queen and Bonham Carter seems to be having the most fun as the queen of mean. It's also nice to see Crispin Glover, doing what he does best as the red queen's sinister henchman. Burton again makes the fairy-tale his own. I loved it.",8,15,27,5 March 2010
Drag Me to Hell," I thought this was supposed to be scary
","For all the loan officers expecting another scare to go with their economy woes, rest assured, Sam Raimi's trip back to horror won't send you running for your mommies. Raimi likes to combine humor and gore and from what I understand, 'The Evil Dead' trilogy is considered classic for it's great combination of the two. There are people who love the Raimi brand although after watching 'Drag Me to Hell', I can honestly say that I'm not one of them. This is campy horror, with more of an emphasis on cornball than on actual scares.Alison Lohman plays Christine Brown, a loan officer fighting for a promotion from her boss Mr. Jacks (David Paymer), but continuing to come up short in the male-dominated office. She is told that she needs to show she can make the tough calls so when an old gypsy woman named Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) asks her for a third extention on her mortgage, Christine denies her, sending the old woman into hysterical begging. Christine just shrugs her off, insulting her. That night in the parking garage, Ganush gets her revenge, pulling the young girl out of her car and placing a hex on her. Thinking Ganush is just a crazy old bitch, Christine tries to forget all about it but it doesn't take long for her to realize that the curse is real. She starts to see strange, haunting things, even a deformed Ganush keeps appearing in her dreams. Her college professor boyfriend Clay (Justin Long) doesn't believe her and neither does her boss. Her only source of help comes from Rham Jas (Dileep Rao), a psychic who explains to her that she has been cursed and is being tortured for three days by the demon Lamia before being dragged into hell for all eternity.Raimi prefers going the over the top route. His scare tactics include letting the screen go very quiet before turning the soundtrack up to a deafening level. It's not so much scary as it is repetitive and irritating. Plus what were watching is all just ridiculous. Take the scene where Ganush attacks Christine. The two women staple and knock each other around in a moving car that bounces off other cars in a parking lot, the scene mirroring something out of a ' Three Stooges' script more than anything 'Stephen King-ish.' There is also a séance scene with a lot of silly looking special effects (one a talking goat) and another scene where Christine is attacked by a haunted scarf. Things squeak, rattle, bang, and creak for dramatic effect. And Raimi doesn't stop there. Just cause the flick is PG-13 doesn't mean you can't be disgusting. Projectile vomit, spit-up, a gushing nose bleed, dentures, poor hygiene, flies, and various other mouth-related incidents are used to increase the gross-meter every couple minutes. Lohman is a trooper. Raimi throws all the torture he can at her and she takes it with equal parts dread and strength, easily being one of the best horror heroines to come around in a while. Long is always nice to see but believing him as a college professor? No way.'Drag Me to Hell' really fails in it's scares though. They're cartoonish, PG-13 rated, and more funny than they are scary. They fall in the genre of comedy-horror, one that I don't have much experience with and hope not to have more of in the future. This movie reminded me of Eddie Murphy's try at this type of genre in 'Vampire in Brooklyn' and I consider that movie to be one of the worst I've ever seen. The story here is thankfully a bit better but it's still not really worth caring about, which only leaves the guilty pleasures. And those only come if you like your scares in the laughable variety.",5,3,25,27 May 2009
Invictus," Strong themes overcome predictable plotting
","Morgan Freeman's made a career out of playing inspirational second fiddles who always steal the movie. Now with Clint Eastwood's 'Invictus', we finally get to see this amazing actor take front and center and run with it. The movie, based on a John Carlin novel about the event that changed South Africa, fits Freeman like a glove and it's hard to imagine he's not a front-runner for that lead actor Oscar he has so deserved for so long now.He plays Nelson Mandela as a born leader, an authoritative yet empathetic uniter who preached forgiveness and looked for common ground when elected president of South Africa. His election caused unrest among whites, and blacks still had hard feelings for years-worth of oppression. The one thing he saw that could unite was the Rugby team, a shamefully rag-tag bunch facing extinction because many still saw the team as a left-over from apartheid. Mandela knew ending the team would mean more unrest among white Rugby fans so instead he presented a challenge to team captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon); win the world cup,unite us.Do they? It's all predictably plotted and there are times where you wish Eastwood had employed an announcer to explain what's happening on the Rugby field but the great themes of forgiveness, unity, and determination make this a sports movie well worth seeing. There are really wonderful elements here. The relationship between Mandela's white and black security detail. The Rugby team reaching out to the community by going to the slums and teaching kids how to play. Pienaar's visit to Mandela's prison cell to understand the man's courage. The people of South Africa rallying into something of a community. And the bond between Mandela and Pienaar, very well played by both Freeman and Damon, of two men looking for their country's pride, it's center, and it's heart. By the final Rugby match, the movie has built up such good-will that any predictability or confusion on screen becomes an afterthought to the joy and excitement on display. Eastwood's film shows how sports can unify people, a simple yet inspirational and lovable message that should leave audiences cheering.",8,107,136,9 December 2009
Up," Pixar soars again
","'Up' is a winner, and I couldn't be less surprised. Anyone still putting a limit on how new and inventive they think a Pixar film can be deserves to have their socks blown off. For the rest of us, just buy a ticket and expect to be taken away. This new flick is the work of writers/directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson, two guys who have each been around the making of Pixar flicks before. Docter was a director on 'Monsters Inc', a writer on 'Toy Story' and a co-writer and director on 'Wall*E.' Peterson was a writer on 'Finding Nemo'. Both know the guidelines for success and while 'Up' doesn't reach the heights of say a 'Wall*E' or a 'Toy Story', it's still a fantastic movie because, well, I don't think the people Pixar hires know how to make anything other than fantastic movies.This one is about Carl Fredericksen (Edward Asner), a 78-year old retired balloon salesman living alone in a house full of old memories. Carl and his wife Ellie met each other as young children, both enamored by the newsreels about adventurer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). They eventually married and planned on seeing the world together, especially Paradise Falls in South America, but life kept getting in the way and before he knew it, Ellie died.As the world changes, Carl refuses to change with it. When developers threaten to move him out of his house and into a retirement home, the old codger rigs his house up with thousands of balloons and before you can say 'way to go Carl', he floats away, determined to have the adventure he and his wife never had. He doesn't plan on taking 8-year old chubby wilderness explorer Russell (Jordan Nagai) with him or crash landing on the other side of Paradise Falls, or finding an exotic female snipe (that Russell names Kevin) or a group of talking dogs (one named Dug befriends them) tracking down the bird for Muntz, who it turns out is a sinister villain, but things kinda turn out that way.You're grabbed instantly. The adorable opening montage of the Carl and Ellie love story is more endearing and moving in its dialogue-less 10-minute entirety than any other romance this year by a long shot. This is another Pixar flick that goes in a daring direction. We next see Carl as a heartbreaking old man, his wife dead and the world no longer needing him. You forgive him his bitterness and you love him for the sentimental streak he has towards the things he and his wife shared together. His crabbiness is a little funny but there are also some heavy scenes early on as well. It sets up a beautiful, multi-layered story about enduring love and learning to live life without limits.When a thrilling rainstorm crashes Carl and Russell on the other side of Paradise Falls, the two must each harness themselves to the house floating above them. The characters each look terrific and share a good chemistry. Russell is the usual 8-year old kid, talkative, inquisitive, and annoyingly overeager. He is a good comic foil to crabby Carl, his big, rosey smile and plump round stature a counter to the stout, frowningly square-faced Carl. As the two spend more time together, a wonderfully written friendship develops.The movie is full of visual gags and the talking dog-henchmen are great fun. Muntz, an adventurer who travels around the world in a big blimp, offers a menacingly evil villain to chase Carl and Russell through rough mountainous terrain before the exciting final house vs. blimp in-air showdown. Plus the movie looks fantastic, a lush array of candy color and grand scenery. And the vocal cast, from Edward Asner to Christopher Plummer and Jordan Nagai each deftly voice their roles. 'Up' is one of the year's rare treasures, a movie that flies in every way possible and from Pixar, you shouldn't expect anything less.",8,51,84,26 May 2009
How to Train Your Dragon," Sets the bar for animated 3-D
","'How to Train Your Dragon', or as I like to call it 'That Viking is out of my League', is the second film in as many weeks where Jay Baruchel plays a scrawny nerd looking to find himself. It also happens to be infinitely more entertaining. He voices Hiccup, a hapless young Viking living in a village overrun by flying dragons. He longs to be like his great dragon-killing father, Stoick (Gerard Butler), and charm the likes of the beautiful Astrid (America Ferrara), with whom he is enrolled in dragon-battle training. While dragon-killing isn't for him, he soon finds a particular knack for dragon-whispering, subduing the beasts with his wits and even making a friend in one that he names Toothless. He soon realizes the reason for why the dragons are attacking and tries to convince dad that the winged creatures really aren't so bad afterall. Directors Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois have created a tremendous 3-D experience, setting the bar for animated 3-D much like 'Avatar' set it for live-action. The dragon battles are thrilling and the flying scenes between Hiccup and Toothless soar with joy and pulse-pounding danger, and are magnified perfectly by John Powell's fantastic musical score. And at its heart this is a movie of friendship and learning to follow your own path, both movingly portrayed by Sanders and DeBlois' screenplay. The animation looks great, from the large, bushy-haired Vikings to the comically goofy looking dragons. The voice cast is also well-matched. Baruchel has a wheezy comic charm, Craig Ferguson gets the best lines as the village blacksmith, and who better to voice a Viking than Gerard Butler. 'Dragon' is as heartfelt as it is impressive to look at, a family film perfect for all ages.",8,3,11,23 March 2010
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Long but well improved
","Is this the must-see movie event of the summer? Yeah, you know it is. Despite critics (myself included) complaining about almost everything except how cool the special effects were, the first one was a huge hit so Michael Bay brings all of his toy cars back to the big screen in 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.' This newer model comes with some of the same problems the first film had, a few improvements, and an altogether more cohesive and entertaining experience, albeit slightly longer than one would really like out of such a popcorn movie. This one picks up two years after the events of the first film.With Megatron (Hugo Weaving) buried beneath the ocean and the allspark in a secured location, Earth is safe for the time being. The autobots, led by Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen), now fight alongside the American military (Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson included) combating remaining Decepticons hiding out on Earth. While cleaning up in Shanghai, Optimus is told by a dying Decpticon that the Fallen will rise again. It doesn't mean a whole lot, but its enough to put everyone on alert. Meanwhile, Sam (Shia LeBeouf) is heading to college, his hero status an annoyance to him now, as is his guardian Bumblebee. Then again his girlfriend is Mikaela (Megan Fox) so life ain't all bad. But as Optimus so nobley says, 'fate rarely calls upon us at a moment of our choosing.' Sam begins to see cyber code to the point where he has a mental breakdown. Mikaela comes to Sam's aid but what they don't know is that Megatron has been brought back to life and he is now reunited with his master, the Fallen (Tony Todd). They invade Earth, demanding that Sam surrender to them, for the code he sees will lead the Fallen to a machine that blows up the sun while renewing life on the Decepticon planet. Of course Sam, Mikaela, and the rest have to stop that from happening.Ehren Kruger joins screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman but I'd be hard pressed to tell you what he brings to the writing, the plotting being essentially the same, just swapping the allspark energy source for the machine. I doubt fans will mind. More to the point, the action is wall to wall, all-out mayhem and this time its not so hyperactive to the point where you can barely make out what's going on. Optimus and Bumblebee each get their moment to kick some major ass, lots of destruction (cities, fleet ships, pyramids, etc), and the guns blaze and robots rock'em-and-sock'em-each other with major intensity. While all this is good, I still contend that Bay could go bigger though, especially with these special effects at his disposal. A really well planned action set-piece (ala the car chase in 'The Matrix Reloaded' for example) could really elevate this series from good to grand. This hurts the finale especially, which is hectic and all-over-the place but offers nothing incredibly cool. The finale also suffers from battle overload, at this point the guns-blazing and robot fighting going on way too long. Cutting a half hour wouldn't have hurt this movie.What helps this time around though is more Megatron. He's a ferocious villain who rightfully deserves more screen time. However, one wonders why so little screen time for most of the other autobots. Other than Optimus and Bumblebee, the rest only have brief moments in battle scenes, except for the Twins, Mudflap and Skids, who sound like Katt Williams and are probably the most annoying comic relief since Jar Jar Binks. Most other robots are mainly used for exposition, a long-winded detailing of the machine is just one of many overly talky scenes. Just show us the special effects, which stand as some of the most technically superior I've ever seen. Slicker, bigger, and badder, just looking at these magnificent robots brings out the kid in me. It's here that the movie is really inspired, as different types of robots fill the screen. Cougars, sattelites, preying mantis, and one that looks very similar to the alien in 'Species.' From a design stand-point, this is awesome.Acting isn't a major priority here but the cast does it's job well enough. Shia is the new sorta nerdy, sorta brave techno hero. He also has good comic timing and gets some very good laughs. Megan Fox, introduced in a sexy pose leaning over a motorcycle, is probably the most incredible looking non-robot in the movie and there are even occasions where she comes through as a decent actress. Kevin Dunn and Julie White, as Sam's cheapskate father and naïve mother, get the bulk of the hilarious laughs, as does a loopy John Turturro reprising his role as the quirky Agent Simmons, this time working with Sam. The characters played by Jon Voight, Anthony Anderson, and Rachel Taylor have wisely been deleted and things move along a lot better now that its not so top heavy with extra characters who serve no purpose. The voice acting for the robots is well matched, especially from Hugo Weaving and Tony Todd, adding more dread to Megatron and the Fallen, and Peter Cullen giving authority to Optimus. There is also a nice ode to Joe Pesci in 'Goodfellas' that's pretty funny.'Revenge of the Fallen' is not without its flaws, but the good outweighs the bad and this is by far right behind 'Star Trek' as the blockbuster of the summer.For more reviews, check out Leesmovieinfo.com",4,6,14,23 June 2009
It Chapter Two," Better than expected
","Hiya GeorgieIt Chapter 2 is the thrilling conclusion to Stephen King's classic clown novel which finds the losers club needing to go back to Derry after 27 years cause they did not kill Pennywise like they thought they did.And first off let's just say that Pennywise has been a terrific villain through all this. Yes, clowns remind us all of serial killers anyway, there's not much Krusty can do about that, but if you also get one who knows your fears there really is no stoppage to the torments one could inflict.Bill Skarsgard has really dug in here, he's having fun, and i'm loving how over the top he allows the voice and mannerisms to get.The losers club comes back, this time as adults, in fine form.Sure guys like James McAvoy, who carries Bill's guilt over the loss of his brother Georgie perfectly, and Bill Hader, whose the wise-ass Richie of the group, stand out but everyone here is allowed their moment.And there are a lot of moments here. This is a lot of movie. Sometimes it's going for horror, sometimes it's comic, sometimes it's a coming of age drama, and in the case of the friend-zoned Ben and the only girl of the group, Beverly, there's a rootable romance here too.One of the criticisms that has been labeled against this is that it's not a scare on top of scare style movie but I think that's cause this movie is smarter and way more ambitious than that.This is a follow-up to the highest grossing horror flick of all time-why not going huge with it?The losers club themselves are still a great bunch of guys and lady and it'a a huge laugh seeing them pick up right where they left off- ribbing each other, bringing up old memories, regretting the fact that as life often goes, we do lose contact with even close friends.You also never see anyone of them with a cup of coffee- they're so high strung just by living in Derry that even tossing a red bull in the middle of them might result in explosion.Director Andy Muschietti throws in even more creatures this time around- heads walking on spiders legs, decomposing bodies, statues, things just come alive with big booming voices.Muscietti worked pretty well with these overgrown, gangly looking monsters in his first horror flick, Mama, but he has vastly improved the facial distortions, the creatures entrances, nearly every jump scare is part of a grander scene that just looks like nightmare fuel.Like that scene with the old lady from the trailer is 10 times more creepy in this movie and is just a masterclass of suspense.Yes at nearly 3 hours all of this can feel relentless but he moves these horrifying creatures around like a chessmaster and my heart pumped and my jaw dropped and that's no small feat.I was also someaht worried about the ending here- mostly cause part 2 of the miniseries ends with kind of dud oh, they look like they're fighting something from Honey I Shrunk the Kids.But Muscietti proves to completely understand psychological torment by movie's end and continuing to incorporate that in the final showdown is a smart move.Story-wise this also does a hell of a lot- adding in a Native American subplot, telekinesis, tokens, and some really brutal acts of homophobia and spousal abuse that ties in later with a message about bullying.I'm out of breath just trying to explain all this movie tries to do, so while it's not always scary and is definitely long winded,It wants to be a lot of things, most surprising of all is it makes you want to call up a close friend you haven't spoken to in a while..if you have one. That shows this isn't just about the scares but about the characters too. On both counts I was more than satisfied.If you liked this check out Craig James Review on Youtube for more",8,4,7,6 September 2019
Hancock," Less than super
","'Hancock' is the summer's dark horse. Early trailers made it seem like a superhero spoof, then it looked like a dark comedy, then an action extravaganza. It's hard to tell what this movie is and the news of all the directors and studios who left the project, the fact that the subject matter has been called controversial and an extreme contrast to your usual summer movie experience, and that the MPAA has 'R-ed' this movie twice before the studio finally went back and made major edits to get the PG-13 all come into question as this movie gets the coveted huge July 4 weekend audience all to itself. It's a major gamble, but having Will Smith in your movie is a good card to play.Smith stars as John Hancock, a boozing, vulgar, misunderstood superhero living a life of solitude in Los Angeles. He tries to do the right thing but usually every heroic save also creates some horrible damage that leaves him continually shunned by the public. Not that he cares. A life of being the only one of his kind has given him a tough demeanor and a thick skin, but then he saves the life of a PR man named Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman). Ray is eternally grateful and offers to take up Hancock as his client to the chagrin of Ray's wife (Charlize Theron), who believes Hancock can't be fixed.Every once in a while a movie comes along that I can only describe asÂ…nice. I wish it were better but I admired it for trying to do something new and felt there were some good scattered moments in a sadly unpleasing whole. The movie is at its most entertaining when Hancock is being an asshole, flying through the air with a whiskey bottle in hand, toying with a car full of criminals, or throwing a washed up whale back in the ocean or a little kid far into the air. It's funny stuff, as is a prison fight that ends with a guy's head up another guys ass.But the movie is really just a half-formed idea. Hancock's origin story is meager and forgettable and his vulnerabilities are lacking. There's no tension in anything that's happening because everything just seems like a cake walk to Hancock. He easily thwarts bank robberies and saves people in distress but that's really it. You want to see him go up against incredible odds or a super villain but the closest thing to is some one-dimensional thug bent on revenge. The screenplay, by Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan, seems so desperate to create real drama that it introduces a superhero wife for Hancock and then manufactures some lame excuse for why she is the worse thing for him. It all leads to an ending that turns depressingly talky, uninteresting, and just leaves a lot of loose ends.The special effects are serviceable. Hancock flies. Hancock throws people and things up in the air. He lands with a ground-breaking thud. Just where is the wow factor? This movie cost over $100 million dollars to make but there is nothing cool that stands out or shows any kind of ingenuity on the part of the filmmakers. I said it earlier but Will Smith is the best thing this movie has. He's a charismatic guy who knows how to make a surly, unlikable character seem like he has a soul under all the glum boozing. His performance reminded me of Robert Downey Jr.'s performance in 'Iron Man,' though the material was 100 times better with Downey. Bateman isn't given much to do here and even though it's good to see Theron playing sexy again for a change, she spends most of the movie giving off an iciness which is pretty off-putting.There is going to be speculation that all the edits to bring the movie down to a PG-13 is the reason behind 'Hancock's' flaws. It could very well be the reason why this movie feels more like an idea than an actual fleshed-out screenplay. It's tame when it should be super. And yet the movie sort of works when it's having fun with the character. So I was torn between recommending or not and all I can really say is.. it's nice.",6,4,10,4 July 2008
Sherlock Holmes," Downey and Law are on the case
","Do Guy Ritchie and Sherlock Holmes fit? Why, it's elementary my dear movie fan. This is one of the most entertaining thrillers of the year and the fantastic Downey Jr. and Law are a big part of the reason why. They take top honors as the years best bro-mance, arguing like an old married couple while deep down knowing that they'd be lost without each other. Downey is Holmes and Law is sidekick Dr. Watson, embroiled in a plot where the black-magic-practicing Lord Blackwood (a perfectly grave and menacing Mark Strong) has risen from the dead after being sentenced to hang. Rachel McAdams also shows up as Irene Adler, the only criminal who has ever gotten the best of Holmes.Downey Jr. brings quick-wit, cunning, and a scruffy toughness to a role long seen as stuffy and dry, while Law a distinguished charm that, at times, spills over into testy aggressiveness (which is funniest at Holmes most annoying). Both toss off the one-liners with ease. Ritchie's directorial style also comes through, from the dark, grimy Victorian- London production values to the violent boxing and martial arts matches. Holmes' mindset (such as the steps he takes to neutralize a suspect, interpret clues, follow the deceptive) also brings out Ritchie's ability to create an ultra-stylized flashback. There are also a few really thrilling action set-pieces involving a boat and an unfinished bridge. The plot, by three screenwriters, is a little on the convoluted side but it gets the job done with plot-twist on-top of plot twist. With all the brutal violence and style, you can be sure this isn't your Grandpa's Sherlock Holmes, but it will have you drooling for a sequel nonetheless.",8,267,395,22 December 2009
Iron Man," Pumping (up) Iron
","Na na na na na, na na na na na na na na na. Na na na na na, na na na na na na na na naaaaaaaaaaa.I am Iron Man! Not really, but I'm excited. It's the start of summer, which means beaches, swimming pools, girls in bikini tops and short shorts, and above all, sequels and comic book movies. One of the biggest is 'Iron Man', a movie that's been generating buzz it seems since last summer. This has been called a comic-book movie to rival 'Spider-Man' by people who haven't even seen it yet, and with talent like Jon Favreau directing and Robert Downey Jr. starring, you can understand the lofty expectations. And looking at the final product, they delivered above and beyond. Downey Jr. plays Tony Stark, a weapons designer unveiling his newest machine of destruction, 'The Jericho', to the United States Air Force stationed in Afghanistan. While traveling with the unit, he is attacked and captured by a terrorist group called the Ten Rings. The attack leaves a piece of shrapnel embedded near his heart and he is ordered by his captors to assemble a weapon in their workshop, but he instead turns the tables on them. Working with the aid of a fellow captive, Dr. Yinsen (Shaun Toub), he puts his creativity to use, putting together a bulletproof suit of armor, complete with flame-throwers and other gadgets in order to free himself. After seeing the destruction and death that his weapons cause, Stark leaves Afghanistan a changed man, even willing to cancel his company's weapon manufacturing for a more 'accountable' method of warfare. This is not good news for his business partner, Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges). Stark's newest project is the iron-man suit, updating it with flight, weaponry, sleekness, and even a nice color coating. Only while this is going on, Obadiah is secretly trying to overthrow Tony and take over the company, even getting his hands on the first 'suit' prototype. Less evil are Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), Tony's assistant and Jim Rhodes (Terrance Howard), the military liaison to Stark Industries, who help Tony along the way. 'Iron Man' is big, flashy summer fun but its greatness comes from director Jon Favreau and writers Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby never forgetting that this is the story about a weapon with a heart. They take that appealing premise and make it spectacular. The action is first rate, offering up explosions and an exciting chase scene between Iron Man and fighter jets. This is balanced perfectly with humor (Stark's time in the lab updating and working with the suit offers up some of the best visual gags of the year) and a warm feeling that comes from a seeing a weapons maker that cares. The suit is also one of the most amazing and beautiful looking things ever put on screen. This is also a cast that if you told me would be headlining a comic book movie, I probably wouldn't believe you. With the exception of Terrance Howard, who might as well be playing a hood ornament with the minimal role he's given, the cast brings so much to what is going on here. If Tobey Maguire made playing a super-hero a brilliant acting accomplishment, then Robert Downey Jr. elevates it to being Oscar-worthy. On the surface Tony revels in wisecracking cynicism and self-indulgence, basking in womanizing, booze, and money. But before you label him an anti-hero, Downey also brings a surprising amount of heart and redeemability as well. That Downey wears the flaws and somehow also manages to find the character's inner soul is a testament to his greatness as an actor. He also has great playful chemistry with Gwyneth Paltrow, who's fantastic at working around the little flirty moments between Pepper and Stark and the more serious ones where she is called upon to be the Robin to his Batman. And Jeff Bridges, sporting a nice beard and a shaved head, oozes a menacing love of power that makes Obadiah a devilishly entertaining villain. 'Iron Man' is so good at capturing the human element that it's a shame the ending comes down to a battle between two machines. It's fun and contains some really spectacular visuals but it's also kind of a letdown that the movie favored special effects over characters and a plot that were doing so well up to that point. This movie is summer on a grand scale though. I have no doubt it will be a huge hit and, if the scene with Samuel L. Jackson after the closing credits is any indication, sequels are coming. If they're anything like this, i'll be the first on line. 'Iron Man' starts the summer off right.",9,0,3,7 May 2008
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," Mediocre third flick
","A meltdown couldn't stop the 'Ice Age' crew the last time so now the filmmakers are upping the ante with dinosaurs. Does it make sense? No. If this third film in the series does as well as the first two, will Manny, Sid, and Diego next contend with aliens? I wouldn't put it past them. Heck, the only thing that's really supposed to make sense here is that these movies are trying to capitalize on a hit franchise. ('Dawn of the Dinosaurs' even more so as it rolls into theaters in not just 2-D but 3-D as well.) Just much like the third 'Shrek', this is a forgettable and hollow installment, fine for kids but sure to have older fans of the series checking their watches.The characters are all back. Manny Mammoth (Ray Romano) anxiously awaits the birth of his first child with Ellie (Queen Latifah). Diego the saber-tooth tiger (Denis Leary) sees his skills as a hunter being diminished and ponders leaving the herd. And Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo) feels like the odd man out and wishes for a family of his own. When he finds dinosaur eggs, Sid is determined to raise them as his own, not thinking that mama dinosaur is close by. She tracks Sid down and takes her eggs and him back to her underground valley habitat where dinosaurs and other animals live. One of them is a one-eyed, dinosaur-hunting weasel named Buck (Simon Pegg), who helps Manny, Diego, Ellie, and Ellie's possum brothers (Sean William Scott, Josh Peck) when they go looking for Sid.Scrat the squirrel stars too, still trying to obtain that acorn. Usually his slapstick segments are some of the best parts of the film but even he is little more than lightly amusing. Scratte, a female squirrel, hinders his efforts this time and also serves as romantic counterpart but since neither talk and both seem to like the acorn more than each other, who cares. The same goes for the rest of the movie. The physical comedy gags are too far between and all that's left is a lot of outlandish personalities, most of which are more annoying than funny.Plotting is limited, stretching the importance of family while at the same time doing nothing of any interest. Splitting the team up takes away from the fun, too many secondary characters only serve as a distraction, and the perils, which include plants, a large dino named Rudy, and floating lava will thrill the kids but be too dull for parents. This puts a damper on the 3-D animation as well, which has some nice snow and forest-filled landscapes but nothing that, figuratively, jumps off the screen about the characters or action.The vocal actors are still matched up well, just they get very few actual funny things to say. Leguizamo's slurring, goofy performance as Sid is the most fun. Romano is well matched with the cautious, nasally Manny, as is Leary to the vicious Diego. And Latifah is sassy as Ellie. Simon Pegg gives the movie some life as Buck, a nutty safari-hunter who loves the thrill of the chase.But we're a long way from the visual feast and energetic fun of 'Up'. I'm sure the kids won't seem to mind though. 'Dawn of the Dinosaurs' exists for them. It's just too bad parents are forced to shell out big bucks for something that would have been just as good for cheap had it gone directly to DVD.For more reviews, check out Leesmovieinfo.com",5,21,38,29 June 2009
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Anderson is in the hen house
","A fox has gotta stay true to being a fox. That's the point of director Wes Anderson's (The Royal Tennenbaums) simplistic, yet entertaining first foray into animation. With 'Coraline', 'Up', and now 'Fantastic Mr. Fox', that 'Best animated Feature' Oscar race is heating up. Based on the children's book by Roald Dahl, Fox (voice with sly charm by George Clooney) promises his wife (Meryl Streep) that he'll quit his thieving ways and settle down with a less dangerous job in order to support his fast-growing family. 2 years later (12 in fox years), Fox is a newspaper man living with his wife and young son named Ash (Jason Schwartzman), who is eager to please his father and jealous of his taller and much more talented visiting-cousin Kristofferson (Eric Anderson). Except something just isn't right. Fox needs that thrill of catching chickens and so along with his opossum buddy Kylie (Wally Wolodarsky), he sets out to steal from three of the meanest land-owners in the area, Boggis, Bunce, and the soon to be leader of the three who sets out to kill Fox, Bean (Michael Gambon). Soon Fox realizes that he's not only put the lives of his family at risk, but all the other animals as well. The stop motion animation is amazing; the bright-orangey scenery, fluidly quick character movements, and their outstanding creation are all marvelously done. Anderson has also found a good medium for his quirky sense of humor, especially in a hilarious description of a convoluted baseball/cricket-type game and an on-going gag about Kylie's eyes. George Clooney leads the way in voice casting but the all-star cast does nice work as well, Gambon playing a perfectly gruff antagonist, Schwartzman as the attention-seeking son, and Willem Dafoe very funny as a Louisiana rat. Streep, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, and Brian Cox also show up but have less to do. 'Fox' is a little less than fantastic, but it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half.",7,3,6,15 November 2009
Pineapple Express," Expected more from them
","Seth Rogen is on a roll (p.s I'm dismissing his Drillbit Taylor screenplay, as did most people). 'Knocked Up', last summers surprise hit, turned the doughy, curly headed actor into a surprise leading man and 'Superbad', a movie he wrote along with Evan Goldberg and co-starred in, was what I still believe to be the best film of last year. He has been in a number of supporting roles since, most recently in 'Step Brothers', but with 'Pineapple Express' he, along with partner Evan Goldberg, get to prove two more things. One is that Rogen can solidify himself as the next comedic breakout star and the other is that he and Goldberg are two of the best comedy writers working in movies today. And then on the other side of the camera you have director David Gordon Green, whose done most of his work in drama (Snow Angels) and even darker drama (Undertow) and making his first leap into mainstream comedy. So the questions are: Can Rogen be the next Will Ferrell? Can he and Goldberg write another great, hilarious movie or was 'Superbad' just a fluke? And finally, can Green make the jump to mainstream film and is he the right choice for comedy? Rogen playsDale, a process server dating a High School senior who spends most ofhis days getting high off the weed he gets from Saul (James Franco), a dealer who spends most of his days getting high and watching old sitcoms. When Dale witnesses a murder at the home of Ted Jones (Gary Cole), both he and Saul are forced to run for their lives. While theyare figuring out what they can do and who they can trust, as even the cops seem to be in on the hit, Ted Jones is preparing for drug war with an Asian crime family.This movie is a pretty minor entry in the summer season, so minor in fact that I really can't even muster much to say about it. I'm not saying it's a terrible movie nor am I saying that it doesn't make you laugh on occasion but it's a fairly minimal one-joke comedy that swaps clever humor for cheap laughs usually. At its center is a love for the Cheech and Chong bits, two ridiculously high guys trying to understand each through the haze of marijuana. Your love for this stuff will pretty much depend on how hilarious you think stoners are. Me? I thought it was amusing but kept hoping that the movie would sprout some clever ideas around the stoner jokes. Sadly, the rest of the movie is based around easy penis gags and four letter words but nothing all that hilarious or memorable. The few action scenes work a little better, with a car chase and a bloody ending shoot-out to liven things up a bit.Rogen and Franco are two likable guys in this movie but that's about all I can say for them. They seem to have a good grasp on the material but the movie isn't really trying and neither are they. The rest of the cast is also fairly undefinable, all playing their roles but being called upon to do very little. Danny McBride comes off the best as Saul's lying idiot of a best friend and its good to see Rosie Perez and Gary Cole in a movie, even though neither one can do much with this material.'Pineapple Express' isn't a bad movie and most likely it's the stoner movie most stoners want but I'm just saying from the people who made 'Superbad' and who seem to have a good grasp on what's funny, 'Express' is kind of a lazy and minor entry in the world of comedy. In other words, I expected better.",6,3,7,6 August 2008
The Cabin in the Woods," Haven'
","How much of a surprise is 'Cabin in the Woods'? Well even its fairly basic title masks a much more elaborate and smart horror film, one where writer-director Drew Goddard (writer of another awesome horror film 'Cloverfield) and his writing partner Joss Whedon (one of the great geek kings, both for creating 'Buffy' and currently directing 'The Avengers') have tweaked and twisted the genre to do as they please.It starts off predictably enough with college kids heading off to a relative's cabin for a weekend of fun. Smart-girl Dana (Kristen Connolly), her bland possible love-interest Holden (Jesse Williams), sex-pot friend Jules (Anne Hutchison), Jule's jock boyfriend Curt (Chris Hemsworth), and the lovable pothead friend Marty (Fran Kranz) all pile into the RV and on the way up meet the creepy old gas station attendant who warns them about the cabin. Fairly straight-forward horror so far, right? But why does there seem to be a force-field around the cabin? And who are these big brother scientists (played with both seriousness and harsh humor by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford) who seem to be watching them, modifying the things around them, pushing them to make choices? The desensitization toward violence and bloodlust of the scientists will remind you a lot of 'The Hunger Games' but 'Woods' is actually laying in wait to unleash a wild and crazy mash-up of horror clichés that pull the audience one way then another and, by God, I sat there with a smile on my face the whole time, waiting to see where Whedon and Goddard were willing to take me next. Plus it's sexy, it establishes a terrifying mood, it's eccentrically funny (Kranz is right there with Jenkins and Whitford in the laughs department), and the blood is here and then some. It has all the horror movie conventions, yet does something unique by subverting where you think the plot, the characters, and basically Whedon and Goddard are choosing to go.",8,3,10,14 April 2012
Moon," Weird, well-made psych drama
","Big Questions: Can director Duncan Jones, David Bowie's son, get out from behind his father's shadow with his own space oddity? Is 'Moon' the thought provoking, 2001-esque science fiction flick it's being billed as? Will Sam Rockwell, being the only person on screen for most of the time, be able to anchor a film all by himself? Rockwell plays Sam Bell, an astronaut working for Lunar Industries, a company responsible for 70% of the Earth's energy, which they harvest from the moon. After a good three years of sending parcels of energy back to Earth, Sam is just two weeks away from being able to see his wife (Dominique McElligott) and young daughter (Kaya Scodelario) again. The three years of isolation, and only having the ship's computer Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey) to talk to, have not done Sam's state of mind any good as he either talks to himself or starts seeing things at different points of his day, his wife included. Just a very weird thing happens after being bombarded by a storm of rock while on a mission at one of the mechanical harvesters. Injured, he is awakened later in the infirmary thinking that Gerty saved him. He's told that a rescue team is on the way and that he must stay inside until they arrive, but disobeying orders he heads back out to the harvester and finds another him, unconscious. He brings the other him back to the ship where a lot of questions lay in front of them both.Nathan Parker's screenplay is nothing mind blowing but if you're in the mood for a good psychological drama, this one more than fits the bill. It's slow moving but your head will be working a mile a minute trying to figure out the secrets that lay in store here. Which one of the Sams is the real Sam? Has all this isolation finally driven Sam loco? Could the company that Sam works for be playing with him, putting him into some kind of experimental test or something? Jones proves to be an expert in paranoia, creating a claustrophobic and weirdly surreal situation. It gets so crazy at one point that the two Sam's even start a fight with one another. The production design is really good too, the lunar rovers and the space shuttle, with its dirty white walls that somehow add to the suspense in their own way, are like throwbacks to old movies such as Alien and 2001: A Space Odyssey, and, in a way, the movie is kind of an ode to both.And Sam Rockwell is terrific here, taking on the dual roles with a level of quirky craziness and moving vulnerability that keeps Sam compelling. Kevin Spacey also gives a good robotic vocal.Moon will alienate some with it's slow-moving, overly-thinky subject matter but if your in the mood to give your brain a work-out and be prepared to talk about it afterwards, Jones' first directorial effort is a major success.",8,3,5,15 July 2009
The Proposal," Romance about green card that should have gotten a red card
","For anyone thinking we'd see an end to the long string of insufferable movies that make up much of the romantic comedy genre (like 'He's Just Not that Into You' and 'Ghosts of Girlfriends Past') I present 'The Proposal', two hours of stupid fluff directed, written, and performed without the slightest care toward making a watchable movie. 'Knocked Up' this is not. More like 'Knocked Senseless.' Sandra Bullock returns to being a romantic lead as Margaret Tate, an executive editor-in-chief of a book publishing company. She's tough as nails and because she's a strong woman in a high position, its only natural that every one think her Satan. Or so it goes in most stupid movies like this one. Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) is her long-suffering assistant. When Margaret's visa expires and she faces being sent back to Canada, Andrew and her hatch a deal to get married in order to keep her here. She gets to keep her job, and he finally gets promoted to editor. Just when the government starts investigating the relationship, Andrew must bring her home to meet the family in Alaska in order to sell the ruse. Sitcoms usually start in this way and considering that, its no wonder the sitcom is dying. The screenplay by Peter Chiarelli moves along in predictable fashion and actually finds a way to dumb down a genre that doesn't really need to try that hard in the first place. The couple bicker, then feel guilty, then somehow fall in love. Some family melodrama (involving dad, played by Craig T. Nelson, wanting Andrew to be apart of the family business) is tossed in for good measure. It's a good movie for anyone who find surprises distracting, think that a romance should work just because, and who get kicks out of weak one-joke premises, the joke being that the couple is reluctant toward being stuck in this fake relationship. It's a tiresome idea that, at best, leads to cheap laughs like a scene where the two mistakenly run into each other naked or weak payoffs like when Andrew feels emasculated during Margaret's telling of how he fake-proposed. And director Anne Fletcher hasn't met a desperate attempt at comedy that she can't force to the point of stark awfulness. A scene where Margaret is given a lap dance by an out of shape exotic dancer or when she must chant and dance around a camp fire with Andrew's grandma just come off as eye-rollingly tedious. I'll leave Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds alone here. They're both trying hard to make some of this funny and this relationship worth caring about but neither Bullock's turn as a career-oriented ice queen or Reynold's knack for sarcasm is enough to contend with this very paint by the numbers romance. Betty White, as the sort of movie-grandma who likes to poke around people's sex lives and divulge things about her own, gets a few little laughs here and there but for the most part 'The Proposal' is no marriage in movie heaven and might as well just be left standing at the altar.",3,14,27,16 June 2009
The Soloist," Contrived
","'The Soloist' proves once again that it's never a good sign when a movie suddenly gets pulled from the Oscar schedule. At the time Paramount said it had something to do with some new scheduling campaign. The truth comes out this weekend though and the final verdict is that it doesn't bode well for the Oscar chances of its two very talented leads or the movie itself this year either. The movie is based on a book by Steve Lopez about schizophrenic cellist Nathaniel Ayers Jr. I haven't read the book or watched any of the various news stories about the relationship between the two because I was hoping that the movie would capture whatever incredible true story happened here and I wanted to be surprised. Just unfortunately the screenplay by Susannah Grant (a talented dramatic writer responsible for 'Erin Brockovich' and 'In her Shoes') feels less like 'Shine' and more like blah.Robert Downey Jr. plays Steve Lopez, a reporter for the Los Angeles Times who while eating lunch notices a homeless man with nothing but a shopping cart full of crap and a violin with only two strings. He's playing it right in front of a statue of his hero, Beethoven. The man is Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx), who began as a young cello player. As a young boy his life became all about music, shutting out the world around him for the sweet sounds of Beethoven and his own dreams of becoming his equal. He attended Julliard School with hopes of becoming the best but instead he suffered a mental breakdown that sent him falling from grace and into playing music under bridges and on street corners. Lopez finds the story fascinating and writes a human-interest piece about him and soon he's trying to help Nathaniel get back on a right track again. But does Nathaniel even want to do that? Grant's screenplay likes to pat itself on the back for showing that a friendship such as this can exist. It's all very formulaic and slightly questionable. Is Lopez staying with Nathaniel out of care or because it would make for good continuing articles if Nathaniel becomes a success? Lopez, who's developed only up to the point of being an accident-prone divorcée, managed some notoriety out of this so it does smack of exploitation but I also have to imagine that the book and various stories on this subject did have more context to it, especially when it comes to the Los Angeles homeless, mental illness, and the subject of Ayer's redemption. The movie's best scenes show the despair of the Lamp Homeless shelter, the drug use and mental illness that plague society's cast-offs. These scenes are good because the people seem real, but once it switches back to Lopez and Ayers, its all phony uplift that doesn't really say much. It's crap, but it tries to trick you with beauty. During musical interludes, director Joe Wright follows seagulls as they soar through the air with the music and in the most blinding moment of the year so far, he stages a light show that's supposed to represent how Nathaniel sees the music in his head.Both actors do their best. Foxx is very good here, finding the humanity that the screenplay doesn't. He's a hurried, agitated rambler, a man with a natural love for music, and a tragic genius cut down by his own brain. He brings both a free spirit and pained sense of claustrophobic entrapment by his illness, and one thing he and Joe Wright do very well is displaying schizophrenia as a haunting illness if nothing else. Downey has less to do but he manages to be as cynical and funny as always. Catherine Keener is also in this movie, playing Lopez's ex-wife, but she's very much underused.'The Soloist' is the second movie in two weeks, after 'State of Play', to also bring up the fact that young people don't seem to be reading newspapers anymore. Human interest stories like this one are pretty solid ways to generate interest though and I'm sure at the time the articles were being written there was way more to the story of Steve and Nathaniel than this very Hollywood-ized treatment would have you believe.",5,6,14,24 April 2009
Up in the Air," One of the best movies of the year? It's up there
","If you think 'Up in the Air' is about laying people off, you're only half-right. It's really about learning how to connect with people and the even tougher goal of learning to care about people. It's a feel-good movie about dealing with feel-bad stuff, and not to mention a solid charmer with lots of laughs, heartbreaking poignancy, and terrific performances. George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, a hired gun for companies too spineless to fire their own employees. He enjoys his solitary life and considers planes and hotel rooms home, but a new business plan thought up by 20-something new-hire Natalie (Anna Kendrick) and meeting a fellow frequent flier, Alex (Vera Farmiga), both leave him putting his theories of life and love into question. Director-writer Jason Reitman offers unique ideas and funny lines about everything from the internet age, new view of feminism, the modern-day version of love, and traveling (one terrific scene has Clooney and Farmiga showing off gold-club cards). Clooney gives a smooth talking, confident, and comforting performance. He's also a romantic lead in the mold of a Cary Grant-type. If he doesn't get the Oscar, he should at least get some thank you notes from HR departments around the country. Farmiga has a very sexy chemistry with him (and not to mention a perfect ass) but sadly doesn't get much to do besides being the love interest. Still, this is many steps above 'Orphan.' And Kendrick's youthful innocence and naiveté is well played, proving to be a voice of reason and someone in-over-her-head at different points. Jason Bateman also shows up (as Clooney's boss) sporting a really horrible beard. It looks like someone smeared Nutella all over his face. Minor quibbles aside though, this is Reitman's best movie yet. It finds humor, heart, and inspiration when dealing with times of uncertainty, while always keeping it real with some nice twists. It's the best romantic comedy this year by far. So suck-it every other romantic comedy this year!",8,2,10,5 December 2009
