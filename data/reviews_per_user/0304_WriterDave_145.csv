The New World," Beautiful Marriage of Aural and Visual Meditations on Discovery
","'The New World' has an opening five minutes where Natives rush to the shore to get a view of the massive British ships that are about to land on what would become Jamestown that are every bit as fantastic as any of the scenes in Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey'. It's a perfect marriage of sound effects, music and visuals that literally paints itself onto the celluloid as a jaw dropping work of art. The nature of 'discovery' and the power of film is boldly on display in Terrence Malick's brave 'New World.' Some viewers will undoubtedly get lost in the visual and aural poetry, while others will be annoyed at the lack of a focused narrative and the sometimes sketchy character motives. This is a historical drama, and the amazing sets, costumes, and make-up attest to the wonderful attention to period detail, but there's also a dreamy surreal nature to the pacing that will lull some to sleep who were expecting a more traditional docudrama. This is more about the myth of Pocahantas and channeling ghosts than it is about the actual history behind the story. The dialog is as evasive and minimal as the visuals are overwhelming and painstaking. Plotting is secondary to the mood and meditations on love, discovery, curiosity, innocence, and the clashing of cultures.Malick does a great job at showing the civilized and barbaric sides of both the Natives and the British. It's a wonderful testament to that first realization that there is intelligent life outside of one's own world. Central to this discovery of the 'New World' is the romance between John Smith (a modest Colin Farrel) and Pocahantas (an amazing Q'Orianka Kilcher) which is displayed with just as much wide eyed-wonder and innocence as Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Christian Bale as John Rolfe and Christopher Plummer as Captain Newport are also very good when they are allowed to act amongst the lush scenery. Composer James Horner, who is probably second only to John Williams in creating unforgettable movie music, outdoes himself as his rousing symphony (coupled with divine music from Wagner) perfectly matches the reverence and awe with which Malick uses his visuals to paint the myth on screen.Some judicious editing may have benefited the middle portion of the film, which amounts to scene after beautiful scene of two people falling in love while worshiping nature, but there are two more series of scenes (one in the middle and one at the end) that are every bit as uplifting as the opening one and serve as a perfect synergy of visual and aural delights that completely transported this patient viewer to another realm. I'm not so sure that this is what it was really like to live in 1607, but I have no doubt this is what the people of that time dreamed about.",10,120,211,22 January 2006
Frost_Nixon," Mr. Nixon, It's Time for Your Close-up
","Ron Howard's competent film adaptation of Peter Morgan's play (who also scripted and co-produced here) dramatizes the famous Frost/Nixon interviews from 1977. At one point in the film, Kevin Bacon's character explains to Frank Langella's Nixon that a portion of the interview will focus on 'Nixon the man'. To which Nixon retorted, 'As opposed to what? Nixon the horse?' Of course what was on everyone's mind at the time was Watergate and how American was never able to give Nixon the trial they so desperately wanted. Through the unlikely Frost interviews, the American people finally heard the truth behind the scandal--straight from the horse's mouth.Morgan's source material translates smoothly onto film. Much as he did with 'The Queen', he mixes a behind the scenes look at the immediate time period leading up to the historical event and closes with an almost word-for-word dramatization of said event. Also, like 'The Queen', we have the excellent Michael Sheen on board, who after playing Tony Blair now takes on the mannerisms of the legendary British talk-show host and man-about-town David Frost. Director Ron Howard nicely interweaves archival news footage, faux-post interviews with the secondary players, and the dramatic reenactments of the actual Frost/Nixon interviews. Howard's studied but pedestrian style of direction lends itself well to this type of docudrama as he allows the actual events to speak for themselves and the fine performances to shine on their own. Though it takes quite awhile to get where it's going, the final interview where Frost takes Nixon head-on about the Watergate cover-up is a payoff well worth the wait.Of course the most fascinating aspect of the film is Frank Langella's portrayal of a shamed and swollen Richard Nixon. He plays him as a fallen man desperate for an act of contrition but still in too deep with his old trickery and slick ways. His performance, and the way it connects with the audience, is wonderfully layered. On one level, we have an aged actor thought to be well past his prime firing back on all cylinders in a renaissance role that will likely lead to a showering of award nominations. The way the film reduces his performance to that one lingering close-up after being steamrolled by Frost on the last day of the interview leaves a lasting impression. But it also works on another level as it is meant to represent the reduction of Nixon's political life to that one lingering close-up on the television monitor when he realized it's all over for him. The audience members who remember watching the interviews and can picture the actual close-up they saw on their TV screens are now allowed to share a communion with the audience members who weren't even born yet and now only have a memory of Langella's face on the silver screen. In that sense, Langella truly became Nixon, and his performance will not soon be forgotten.",8,66,86,18 December 2008
Walk the Line," They're Going Down, Down, Down in a Burning Ring of Oscars
","'Walk the Line' is every bit as compelling and well made as last year's 'Ray.' Like that film it avoids the typical biopic trappings with straightforward direction and a lead player, in this case Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash, who totally immerses himself in the role to give a truly authentic and moving performance. This film also benefits greatly from Reese Witherspoon, who turns in a fiercely real and powerful performance as June Carter. She's even more of a surprise and delight than Phoenix, as the casual movie-goer would've never suspected such a raw and endearing performance like this for Ms. Witherspoon, who's usually regulated to throwaway rom-com roles. These two kids are without a doubt the Oscar front-runners for best actor and actress.The central storyline of this film, which uses flashbacks and stage scenes judiciously, is the slow, long, and genuine love affair that developed between Cash and Carter. The chemistry between Phoenix and Witherspoon is electric, and they make it easy to see how these two consummate performers were able to make their greatest music together. There's also great fun to be had in the revelation of the real stories that inspired the amazing lyrics and songs that millions of people came to love. Like all good biopics it shows us the good times and the bad, Cash's troubled childhood to his redemption at Folsom prison, and it makes you want to go out and buy every bit of Johnny Cash's and June Carter's recordings. With the great performances and amazing music, you can't really ask for more from a flick like this.",8,4,6,27 November 2005
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Success. Yes. It Nice.
","Those who have called 'Borat' a 'Jackass' with a higher IQ pretty much have hit the nail on the head. This is low-brow humor for the high-brow set with enough offensive posturing and crudeness to appeal to a broad audience. Those claiming it's one of the funniest movies ever made and a brilliant satire are grotesquely overstating the appeal of Sascha Baron Cohen's creation. On many levels, as a mockumentary, it succeeds in making people laugh out loud (especially in the opening moments in his hometown), but to call this satire is an insult to pure satires like 'Dr. Strangelove' and 'Network.' The extended nude wrestling/chase scene in the hotel that people have hailed as a film classic was far from it in my mind. The funniest bits I found were instead the not so obvious subtexts (like the fact he spoke Hebrew in many of the Jew bashing scenes) and throw away moments like when he threw down his bag in despair and the chicken was still inside. Still, a subversively clever movie that seemingly exists to only push the envelope certainly has its place in this increasingly sensitive, politically correct, and censored society, which is why I feel this has become a cultural phenomenon. For Cohen and his alter ego, success, yes, it nice. Very nice. We like.",7,5,13,7 November 2006
3:10 to Yuma," The Train Has Left the Station
","A down-on-his-luck rancher (Christian Bale) attempts to restore some honor to his name, regain the respect of his young sons, and put some money in his pocket by escorting a murderous criminal (Russell Crowe) to the 3:10 train to Yuma prison in James Mangold's update of the 1950's Western of the same name based on a short story by Elmore Leonard.Westerns are a hard sell these days. Unless taking the radical deconstructionist route like the neoclassic 'Unforgiven' or the bold avante-garde take of last year's vastly underrated 'The Proposition,' the genre often comes across as stale and unwelcome. The only other film to play it straight recently was Kevin Costner's 'Open Range' in 2003, and that movie was only a moderate success. '3:10 to Yuma' lacks the reverent and epic scope of Costner's piece, but makes up for it in grittiness and a valiant attempt at psychological complexity.Unfortunately '3:10 to Yuma' is awash in genre clich√©s from the robbing of a stagecoach, to the stoic wife/mother at the homestead (Gretchen Mol), to the depiction of Native Americans as mythical phantom threats ready to scalp and kill anyone in their path. Also distracting are the 'cameos' that range from a welcome Peter Fonda as a morally questionable bounty hunter to an unwelcome Luke Wilson complete with green teeth as an unnecessary mining posse leader. Likewise the supporting cast is hit or miss with Logan Lerman showing some decent range as Bale's eldest son while Ben Foster fails miserably at being method as the insane sharp-shooter hellbent on rescuing Crowe from the gallows.The film's saving graces are director Mangold's traditionalist leanings in pacing and Western iconography and the lead performances from Bale and Crowe--two great actors who sometimes resort to scenery-chewing and are shockingly subdued and nuanced here in their multiple physical and mental face-offs. '3:10 to Yuma' culminates in a fantastic finale at the train station that is entertaining enough to forgive the cattle cars of clich√©s, buy not enough to make the audience wish they would resurrect the genre more often.",7,6,13,9 September 2007
Marie Antoinette," More than a Trifle...
","From its beguiling star Kirsten Dunst to the maddeningly beautiful locales to the visual sumptuousness and 'taste' (you almost feel as if you could eat some of the scenery and clothes) of the costumes and art design, Sofia Coppola's 'Marie Antoinette' is an entrancing and lavish period piece of the highest order.Many of the early scenes of the Austrian and French woodlands and the palatial splendor of Versailles are cloaked in an almost 'otherworldly' austerity, evoking the spirit of Stanley Kubrick's ultimate costume-drama, 'Barry Lyndon.' Later, when our heroine finds some inner piece at the countryside estate she is given as a gift after the birth of her first child, Coppola immerses the viewer in the transcendent splendor of natural sounds and beautiful images that channels the fluid mise-en-scene composition of the best work of Terrence Malick. All of this is tied together by Coppola's now signature dreamily listless camera play that makes her unlike any other director working today.In the lead role, Kristen Dunst is mesmerizing. She's always been a better actress than she's been given credit for. She's only previously been allowed to really stretch her acting muscle when she took on the role of Marion Davies in the excellent 'Cat's Meow' and as the emotionally unstable teen in the misguided 'Crazy/Beautiful.' Here, without much dialouge, and present in just about every scene, she speaks volumes with her eyes and body language. Coppola only briefly channeled into Dunst's innate talents in 'The Virgin Suicides' and wonderfully fulfills the promise of a fruitful director/actor collaboration that those with a keen eye could divine from their first experiment together.Of course, those who measure a biopic by its historical accuracies will cry blasphemy at some of the treatment here, most notably the use of new-wave pop music in equal measure with a classical score. Also, the drama of the French Revolution is glossed over spare for the final ten minutes, almost as it it were a side-note in history. The vapidness and decadence of the French Court is Coppola's focus, as is the alienation of a people from their government, family members from each other, and most importantly a young woman from herself. Though this classic theme of alienation (which permeates many of the great films from Coppola's father's contemporaries) seems to be treated here with a softer touch that on the surface paints it as a trifle...the haunting closing scenes of Dunst leaving Versailles behind forever are not without their emotional resonance.If Coppola delivers us a big hit with her next project, or not too far thereafter...then I suspect in about ten or fifteen years, 'Marie Antoinette' will be looked upon far more fondly than it has been thus far. Rightfully its costume design took home an Oscar. If the movie gods smile down upon us, Coppola will have a long fruitful career, and this film will surely be more than just a foot note of her early days.",8,3,5,27 February 2007
The Ring," As far as modern horror thrillers go, this one is pretty damn good...
","For a schlocky Hollywoodized piece of mass marketed horror, 'The Ring' is shockingly competent, effective, and artistic. The director, Gore Verbinski (of 'Mouse Hunt' fame) is by all means a hack, but a pretty astute and artistic hack who lays on plenty of stunning and haunting imagery that makes the film seem more important and artistic than it really is. The star, Naomi Watts, anchors the film with a performance that gets better as the film moves along (in fact, the whole film seems to get better as it moves along and almost entirely hinges on her performance) and shows that her award-winning turn in 'Mulholland Drive' was no fluke. If the film is a hit, this should catapult her into the A-list of fine actresses.The first fifteen minutes of the film play like a 'Scream' knock-off, but don't let that discourage you. That is merely a savvy ploy (great marketing but bad film-making) to lure in the teen-age crowd that grew up with Wes Craven's craptacular 'Scream' films as their main reference for great horror. Judging by the shrieks I heard from the teeny-boppers in the audience, this film should get a lot of repeat business from them and I suspect could become this generation's 'Poltergeist.' Rest assured, that mature audience who grew up with 'The Exorcist,' 'Rosemary's Baby,' and 'The Changeling,' will be rewarded in the end with a highly competent horror/mystery film that is much closer in relation to those great 1970's horror films than anything Wes Craven ever made us suffer through. I also appreciate how in the end, the movie could've easily turned into a melodramatic knock-off of the 'Sixth-Sense,' but proudly stuck to it's genre guns and creeped us out with one last blast.Granted, many of the artistic shots are taken straight from 'The Shining' (with rain replacing the snow), and there are many other 'homages' to be found...everything from 'Psycho' to 'The Blair Witch Project.' This could make the film fun for some film buffs (I especially like the cursed videotape that played like a German expressionist film) while infuriating others. Take this review then with a grain of salt, for I have not seen the Japanese original, and I am also one who thought Neil Jordan's poorly received 'In Dreams' was a great horror thriller.",8,0,0,19 October 2002
Casablanca," I'd Like to Think You Killed a Man, It's the Romantic in Me
","It's that kind of cynicism that makes this old-time classic endearing to a modern day audience.  'Casablanca' is a noirish melodrama set against the back-drop of WWII and Europeans fleeing to America by way of French Morocco. What's so refreshing about it, in spite of its classical love triangle theatrics, is that is never places romantic love on a pedestal.  It realizes that in a world of uncertainty where neutrality is the biggest crime, there are more noble things than love.  This movie is sited by many critics and viewers alike as one of the top three greatest films ever made.  It's easy to see why.  It contains probably the greatest dialogue ever written for the screen. It stars two screen icons in their greatest roles and a superb supporting cast.  It's directed by Curtiz with a complete lack of pretension.  There's nothing overtly artistic about it, or any sign that anybody involved was trying too hard. Essentially this was a gathering of classy professionals who set out to accomplish one thing: make an entertaining film.  In the process, they might have made the greatest.  Unlike so many of the other classics of this period, you never have to view it 'in context' to appreciate and enjoy it. Rock solid entertainment anchored by smart writing cleverly cast and competently directed translates well in any day and age.  Play it again, Sam, and it gets even better As Time Goes By.",10,5,8,16 August 2003
Minority Report," Just might restore one's faith in the Hollywood machine...
","Sparked to go see this one out of sheer morbid curiosity after the 'A.I.' debacle (a year old movie I still have yet to decide whether I liked or not) and by some very positive reviews from critics, this is one of those rare Hollywood films (like last month's 'Insomnia)' that I was literally shocked by how good it was and how much I liked it. Spielberg's first attempt at film noir is quite the doozy, and it's always a treat to see an actor like Tom Cruise actually try to act and inhabit a character instead of just projecting his ego on screen and playing what is essentially himself (much the same way Pacino delivered an Oscar-worthy performance in 'Insomnia'). What is so pleasing about this film is the way it follows all of the traditional film noir rules (betrayals, mysteries, and plot twists galore, memorable dialogue, philosophizing, great chase scenes, intricate detail into crime and detection) while at the same time giving us one of the most well thought out, beautifully designed, and utterly captivating views of the near future ever brought to screen that falls somewhere between over the top Verhoueven satire ('Total Recall'/'Starship Troopers') and Kubrickian dystopia ('2001', 'Clockwork Orange'). Unlike 'A.I.', this film also benefits from some much needed sense of humor to offset the often disturbing imagery, and also isn't afraid to utilize a nice tidy ending and many genre clich√É¬©s (stunning action sequences, predictable but still powerful plot twists) to propel the story. I for one have become a huge fan of this latter day Spielberg, the more mature, darker, and clearly Kubrick inspired auteur. In the end, Minority Report may up come a few straws short of a pure classic, but when so much of what Hollywood puts out there for mass consumers is pure drivel, it is nice to see that some people in La-La land are still making one hell of an effort to truly entertain.",9,0,0,25 June 2002
Finding Neverland," Never Say Never
","The whole idea of Peter Pan always annoyed me as a kid, and even more so lately thanks to the real life plight of Wacko Jacko and his Neverland ranch. As such, I had great reservations about 'Finding Neverland.' The whole 'unlock your imagination' and 'inspired by a true story' nature of the plot seemed trite, and from the earliest previews it was obvious Kate Winslet's character was going to die. But even so, thanks to solid direction from the up-and-coming Marc Forster, and engaging performances from the entire cast (most notably of course Johnny Depp sporting an excellent accent and Kate Winslet fantastic as always) this wishy-washy tear jerker was kept afloat in spite of itself. In the end we are charmed by a nice period piece showing us how J. M. Barrie found inspiration for his most famous work after befriending a widow and her young sons. It's a crowd pleaser, even though this sappy pseudo-factual stuff is not normally my cup of tea.",7,0,0,14 February 2005
In Bruges," 'They're Filming Midgets...'
","...in Bruges. Two Irish hit men (Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell) are sent into hiding by their British boss (Ralph Fiennes) in Bruges, Belgium after a botched job only to learn that the most damning job awaits one of them just around the corner. Bruges is a picturesque tourist trap built around the oldest and best maintained medieval city in Belgium. Director and screenwriter Martin McDonagh bleeds the setting and the material for all its worth and makes his feature film debut in superb style.The dark comedy built around the existential quandaries of hit men has been done to death over the years. If last summer's 'You Kill Me' was the relentlessly dark and relentlessly sitcom-y take on the genre, then 'In Bruges' is the hipster art film take on the theme. McDonagh deserves all the credit in the world for breathing life into the stale story by texturing the tonal shifts with crisp digital camera-work (that is surprisingly haunting), deep character development, and by creating a wonderful sense of place. Imagine a Graham Greene novel ('Brighton Rock' specifically comes to mind) modernized by David Mamet. The dialog is super smart and wickedly un-PC while the comedy parts are as gut-busting as the crime thriller parts are suspenseful.McDonagh has also brought together an outstanding cast who thrive in the material. Farrell defies all odds and manages to be as sympathetic in the dramatic parts as he is charmingly sarcastic in the comedic parts. Brendan Gleeson gives a fantastically nuanced portrayal as Farrell's mentor and friend. Meanwhile, Ralph Fiennes channels the scary-as-hell energy he's used previously in 'Schindler's List' and the recent 'Harry Potter' films in a limber subversion that is a frighteningly fun to watch. The supporting cast is to die for, with Jordan Prentice spot-on as a coked-up dwarf actor shooting an abhorrent art film on the streets of Bruges, and Clemence Poesy coyly seductive and unforgettable as Farrell's unlikely local love interest.Ultimately 'In Bruges' meanders down too many cobblestone paths, and one scene near the end involving a bell tower stretches credibility but adds necessary dramatic effect. Certain plot elements will turn off a large segment of the viewing audience. However, those with the right mindset will be greatly rewarded. 'In Bruges' is hilarious, contemplative, sometimes scathing, often nihilistic, but marked by a shockingly hopeful undercurrent while tones shift and the colors of the human condition undulate in McDonagh's insightful light. The arrival of a commanding talent has been heralded...in Bruges.",9,399,501,16 February 2008
Chinatown," It's as Good as You've Heard (or Studied)
","Not just for fans of Jack Nicholson, Roman Polanski's expertly crafted mid-70's riff on mid-40's film noir that takes place in Los Angeles circa the mid 30's is everything it's cracked up to be.  On one hand, it's simply a rock-solid mystery thriller chock full of quotable dialogue (my favorite line is Gettis to a police officer, 'Nevermind, you're dumber than you think I thought you were.'), political intrigue, snazzy private eyes, troublesome dames, grizzled henchmen, and excellent plot twists that service the story and aren't just there for the sake of surprise.  The scene where Gettis is slapping around Faye Dunaway's character in an attempt to get to the truth about the mystery girl is probably the best executed and most brilliantly conceived way to reveal a shocking plot twist in a movie that I have ever seen.  That alone would make it a damn fine film, but helmed by Polanksi, it's also a great work of art in terms of lighting, set design, pacing, and all those wonderful details.Any time you think you spot a cliche or a genre cop-out, just remember this film probably did it first or was weaving and executing it in such a brilliant way as to make the term cliche moot.  The only traditional film noir to even come close to this level of brilliance since is Curtis Hanson's much thicker and twistier 'LA Confidential' and that was over twenty years later.",10,1,3,1 March 2003
Star Trek," Damn it, Jim, I'm a TV Producer not a Film Director!
","TV guru extraordinaire J. J. Abrams beams up as producer and director of this zippy and serviceable relaunch of the moribund 'Star Trek' film series, itself a spin-off Gene Roddenberry's iconic 1960's sci-fi drama. There's plenty of circularity in concept and execution as Abrams does an adequate job of paying homage to the original TV series while giving everything a big epic, slick, modern film veneer. Abrams displays his usual flippant emo-sensibilities (lest we not forget his first claim to fame was the insufferable TV show 'Felicity') in creating a colorful back-story to familiar characters, but he wisely focuses on action for the better parts of the film and keeps the pacing at warp speed even though we really know he just wants to play with Trekkies' emotions, much in the same way a swaggering Kirk antagonizes the desperately logical Spock.Though Zachary Quinto is fairly lifeless as Spock, the rest of the cast is up to task doing fine impersonations of the senior Trek crew. Simon Pegg gets plenty of laughs as Scotty, and Karl Urban is mockingly masterful in his delivery of all the classic Doc McCoy witticisms. As the young Kirk, Chris Pine puts an entertaining spin on the role as he seems to be channeling both Christian Slater doing Jack Nicholson and, well, Chris Pine doing William Shatner. But it's only the dashingly smart and sexy Zoe Saldana who takes things to a new level giving Uhura a personality and vibrancy that was never apparent in the original film series.Comparing the film to others in the series, it probably ranks somewhere in the middle. By far it displays the best production values and special effects of any Trek before it on the big or small screen. Always crucial to the film series, the villain in this one (a tattooed Romulan named Nero played by Eric Bana) is clearly no match for the mythic-sized Khan of said 'Wrath of' or the unstoppable Borg Queen of the Next Generation's 'First Contact'. And while the early years of Kirk, Spock and the U. S. Enterprise are fairly well played here, the main storyline is where the film really suffers as it mashes up a big old mess of a plot involving black holes, time travel and planetary annihilation.While I grew up watching the 'Next Generation' on TV and enjoyed the original film series, I'm by no means a Trek purist. I am, however, a stickler for good storytelling. By playing with all this time-travel mumbo-jumbo, the screenwriters have essentially wiped the slate clean and negated the entire original series. The same old characters are now free to roam outer space on brand new missions, which is a brilliant business building ploy but lazy writing and a big cop-out. By going backwards in the serial mythos instead of forging ahead further into the future, the filmmakers have backed themselves into a corner. Just how many of these new adventures can the old crew have? And will it all lead to the inevitable...Picard's Academy Days or the origins of Data? While this new film was modestly entertaining and better than your average sci-fi flick, it didn't really leave me clamoring for more. Will the filmmakers eventually 'make it so'? Quite frankly, I'm indifferent, though Abrams probably 'gave it all she's got'.",7,7,18,10 May 2009
Fight Club," Eerily Prophetic
","This is one of those in your face controversial movies that has a lot of high minded and loud things to say about the state of society and gender roles and violence in the media and escapism and capitalism, starred hot to trot actors of the moment (Brad Pitt and the wonderfully droll Edward Norton), featured a change of pace role for the exquisite Helene Bonham Carter, was directed by a man almost too stylish and too smart for his own good (David Fincher), and was adapted from an equally warped book. Darkly funny, ultra-violent, and sometimes scary, this is for people with strong stomachs and hungry minds.(POTENTIAL SPOILER) If you don't think this movie is as relevant in the post 9/11 era as it was when it first bombarded movie theaters, just take take a look at the closing scene before the credits where skyscrapers come tumbling down thanks to some terrorist bombs. It was gut dropping then, and seems eerily prophetic and on-target now.",9,0,1,4 March 2003
Citizen Kane," All That Ballyhoo!
","On the Criterion Collection DVD of Orson Welles' classic 'Citizen Kane' there is an original theatrical trailer where Welles cleverly advertises the film by introducing us to the cast including the chorus girls, whom he refers to as some nice ballyhoo. That pretty much sums up my opinion of the often over analyzed film that always shows up at the top of the list of greatest films ever made. Even though this was the first time I sat down to watch the film as a whole, I knew everything about it from studying it in film class and from the countless number of essays, homages, and parodies that have come down the pike over the years. It seems impossible now to judge the film against a blank slate, but with great ballyhoo comes great scrutiny.Released in 1941 by RKO as a Mercury Theater Production, 'Citizen Kane' is the tale of an influential and shockingly wealthy newspaper tycoon (Welles) inspired by the life of William Randolph Hearst. The story follows the investigation into the origins of 'Rosebud'-the mysterious word Kane utters on his deathbed. Following newsreel footage announcing Kane's death, we are then thrust into a series of flashbacks through interviews with various people who knew Kane that reveal the nature of his character.From a technical standpoint, Welles' film is as innovative and engrossing today as it was yesterday. Every single piece of cinematic trickery, every dissolve, every long tracking shot, every seamless edit, every play with chronology, every special effect is perfect. Welles was audacious and inventive with his art, and it is for these technical aspects that 'Citizen Kane' will always stand the test of time.However, the story of 'Citizen Kane' remains cold and distant. I didn't instantly connect with the characters and the plot the way I did with other classics from the period like 'Casablanca' or 'The Third Man' or even more recently, 'There Will Be Blood.' Often, the supporting players over-act, and the flashbacks are tedious (especially the one detailing Kane's second marriage) or emotionless (like the scene showing Kane's snow covered childhood). There's a certain smug arrogance to the whole production that makes it seem like perhaps Welles was secretly making a comedy. It leaves one wondering how it would've come across had Welles actually been allowed to do a straight up biopic of Hearst.Is it any wonder that so many critics today hail this as THE all time great? Much of today's cinema is geared towards style and technique over substance, and way back in 1941, Welles was the first to author this very modern brand of cinema where the art is not in the story but how it is told and shown to the audience. His 'Citizen Kane' is technically rich, layered, and enthralling but narratively vapid. Did I ever really care about Kane or Rosebud? No, but it was fascinating to watch. It's some very nice ballyhoo indeed.",8,39,55,5 May 2008
Memento," A Perfect Movie to Usher in the New Millennium
","'Memento' is one of those rare gimmick movies (it's shown backwards, folks!) where the gimmick actually pays off.  Highly astute director Christopher Nolan simultaneously deconstructs the film noir genre while at the same time gives the audience the feeling that they are suffering from the same malady as the protagonist searching for his wife's killer.  The brilliant structure actually gave me short-term memory loss when I first watched it.  When was the last time a movie actually made you feel what it was portraying so acutely?  Guy Pierce, Carrie Anne Moss, and good ole' Joey Pants give electrifying performances as we the audience slowly learn that no one has a clear motive and you can't even trust your own memory.  This is the kind of revolutionary movie we need more of in this new Millennium.",10,1,3,4 March 2003

Au Revoir les Enfants," A Masterpiece
","There once was a small class of master filmmakers well studied in the now seemingly lost art of cinematic subtlety. Louis Malle was their king. Lovingly and desperately inspired by his own childhood attending a French Catholic boarding school where a handful of Jewish children were being hidden, 'Au Revoir, Les Efants' is a film of small moments leading to one of the most heartbreaking finales you will ever see. What makes it so tragic and resonant is the subtle build-up. Malle's on-screen alter ego Julien is a spoiled kid who reluctantly befriends one of the new kids who he later discovers is Jewish. The progression of their friendship and the day-to-day activities at the school are done without one bit of pretense and so laize-faire, that when the accidental betrayal occurs with a simple glance in the classroom witnessed by the Gestapo, it happens so casually and naturally that neither we, nor Julien, can even begin to process it until long after the film has ended. That's subtle film-making at its best.Louise Malle crafted a masterpiece showing both the innocent child's view of WWII and the almost insane passivity adopted not only by the French (who didn't seem to mind being occupied as long as they could drink their wine and smoke their cigarettes) but by a greater portion of the world that was asleep at the wheel and allowed the Holocaust to happen. With nary a scene of violence or warfare to be found on the screen, 'Au Revoir, Les Efants' is probably the most low-key film you will ever find on the topic, and long after it's over, its universal themes and quiet tragedies will haunt you.",10,7,10,8 June 2006
The Impossible," A Near Perfect Tear-Jerk Thriller
","The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami is brought to shockingly realistic life in J. A. Bayona's ten minute sequence near the beginning of the harrowing true-life survival tale, 'The Impossible.' With little to no CGI and using mostly scale models and a giant water tank, Bayona throws the viewers into the wave along with stars Naomi Watts (astonishing) and young Tom Holland (revelatory as Watts' son). Told from the point of view of a family on holiday in Thailand, the story makes for a riveting family-centered emotional drama. The rest of the cast is outstanding as well, and there's a strong humanist approach applied to depicting this wide-spread multi-national disaster.It might pull on the heartstrings a bit 'too much' in some sequences, but the manipulation is apt in telling this real-life drama.Overall - an unforgettable, draining but uplifting film experience.Check out full reviews at theschleicherspin.com",9,63,100,31 December 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Top Notch Sequel
","'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' builds upon the good will of its fun natured predecessor with the typical 'bigger, better, more' attitude of the standard blockbuster sequel. What's so refreshing, is that it actually delivers on the motto and gives audiences exactly what they want.Unlike the first film, which benefited from originality and lengthy exposition to set up the action and humor, 'Dead Man's Chest' gets off to a clunky start with the reintroduction of just about every character and theme both major and minor from 'Curse of the Black Pearl.' It makes for a somewhat confusing first hour, as I honestly hadn't watched the original since its theatrical run three years ago and didn't quite remember who everyone was and why they were in their current convoluted predicaments. Once the action gets going, and you settle into the preposterous plot that involves plenty of double-crossing, pillaging, tall tales from the sea, and some sort of hocus-pocus involving the mythical Kracken, the audience is treated to a visually stunning ride full of healthy doses of action, humor, and spookiness.Once again, what makes the film stand out from the rest (aside from Johnny Depp's now iconic Jack Sparrow role) is how director Gore Verbinski handles the material and stages the freak show. He's probably the only commercially trained for-hire director who knows how to sustain a beautiful shot. It's also nice to see him get a little more artistic with his direction, as anyone who has seen 'The Ring' or even odder his more recent 'Weather Man,' will pick up on concurrent themes in his breathtaking visuals. More developed in this film is his classical take on dissolves and dolly shots that are nothing short of fantastic. With a bigger budget (upwards of $200 million) he's also one of the few big time blockbuster directors who makes sure every penny is seen on screen. The special effects were shockingly detailed and crystal clear, especially the insanely creative and unique look of the Davey Jones Crew and the aforementioned Kracken. The visual effects team has taken computerized images to new heights beyond even the superb work done with Gollum in the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. The amazing effects dance across the screen hand in hand with sweeping natural vistas, brilliantly staged action sequences and elaborate sight gags (witness the human shish-ka-bob scene) that seem as equally inspired by old time Serials and the 'Indiana Jones' trilogy as they do by Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and other silent film classics. Despite sometimes the humor falling flat, this infectious combination of old-style film-making with new fangled state-of-the-art technology translates wonderfully into audience satisfaction and perfectly calculated box-office gold.",8,4,8,16 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A Refreshing Piece of Old Fashioned Swashbucklery
","It's not going to be the best film you see this year, maybe not even this month or this week...but it's refreshing and entertaining all the way through thanks to some smart direction, a clever script, and a delightfully off-kilter performance from the master of such turns, Johnny Depp. Here's the reasons I liked this movie so much:1. Johnny Depp is a hoot. Jack Sparrow is by far one of the strangest yet most endearing anti-heroes ever to grace the screen. You never know if he is drunk, crazy, or cleverer than you. All of Depp's quirks and mannerisms and line readings keep you constantly off guard and entertained.2. Jerry Bruckheimer, the producer of some of the biggest film travesties ever ('Armageddon,' 'Pearl Harbor') actually hired a director who can sustain a shot, control epic scenes, pace a film, and set atmosphere without tricky camera movements or overused special effects (finally a summer movie where the effects aren't wall to wall CGI and actually seem special). By delivering this after 'The Ring' Gore Verbinksi proves he is the best for-hire/hack director working in Hollywood. He's into the old-fashioned razzle-dazzle type of film-making, you know the kind that doesn't give you a headache and has some scope and where you can actually tell what is going on in big action set pieces. He can do family films ('Mouse Hunt'), horror thrillers ('The Ring'), and now big-budget action adventures. Though he shows no signs of being an auteur or having any kind of grander scheme to his work, I can't wait to see what he tackles next.3. The film has a bloated run-time (almost two and a half hours) but it's not because it takes itself too seriously or knocks you out with set piece after set piece. You see, for the first thirty to forty minutes this film actually provides exposition and develops characters. What a novel idea! I had almost thought Hollywood forgot how to do that.4. Last, but certainly not least, Kiera Knightly. She's got spunk, she's hot, has a British accent, and some of the most natural acting chops of any young actress working today.It made me forget that it was based on a Disney theme park ride and that Big Jerry B bankrolled the whole shebang. All in all a heck of a good time.",9,2,4,30 July 2003
The English Patient," Despite the backlash...still one of the best films of the 1990's
","Imagine if you will that Bernardo Bertoluci and David Lean somehow had a love child, and he went on to make movies.  His name is Anthony Minghella. Yes, they do still make them like they used to, and this is what they look like.  Undeniably beautiful to look at, this eliptical story of a tragic love triangle set amidst the deserts of Africa in WWII, sucked in viewers and critics alike, and swept us away into a wonderful world where romantic epics were literary, smart, and everybody spoke with an accent.  Even if you find the central love story between Fiennes and Thomas and bit too 'British,' you can't help but be compelled by Binoche's lovesick nurse who becomes determined to get to the heart of the mystery surrounding her dying patient.  Oh, and there are so many great scenes...the opening shot of the plane flying over the dunes, Binoche playing the piano in the bombed out building, the trapped in the jeep during the sandstorm scenario, the discovery of the cave drawings.  Yes, there will be some people who just don't like this.  But I don't care.  This is still one of the greatest films of the decade.",10,2,5,25 February 2003
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Talking Beavers, Lions, Satyrs, and Precocious British Children, Oh My!
","Adam Adamson's film adaptation of C. S. Lewis' first entry in his classic Narnia Series starts off awkwardly like a combination of the 'Wizard of Oz' and 'Lord of the Rings.' The filmmakers spend too much time early on trying to be cute and Disney-fy the product while clumsily presenting scenes composed of live-action actors and not-so-great computer effects. The result, not surprisingly is like an animated film with some flesh-and-blood actors spliced in. However, once you get used to the film stylistically, all is mostly forgiven.The filmmakers finally find solid ground when they really start to dig deeply into the story and reveal the blending of nature-based neo-paganism with medieval Christian mythology and wrap it up nicely into a children's fairytale. It's when you start to realize the white witch (played effectively by the always somewhat creepy Tilda Swinton) represents the old pre-Abraham polytheism demanding animal and human sacrifice for appeasing the pantheon of gods/goddesses and the lion king, Aslan, represents the Christian view of one self-sacrificing god that you remember the brilliance of Lewis' source material. And while it isn't terribly well executed, the epic 'Battle-Beast' style showdown at the end is pretty entertaining from a visual and imaginative standpoint.",7,4,5,10 May 2006
Public Enemies," Handsome Depp Gangster Flick Lacks Depth
","Johnny Depp (in a subdued cool swagger) is Public Enemy #1, John Dillinger, in director Michael Mann's handsomely mounted but curiously distant riff on Depression Era Gangster Shenanigans. Christian Bale is Melvin Purvis, the G-man hunting down Dillinger's gang, but the cat-and-mouse game never reaches the boiling point some viewers will desire, resulting in a tepid film designed to make you think you have to admire it.Lifting material from the true crime book by Bryan Burrough, the workmen-like script from Mann, Ronan Bennett and Ann Biderman tries clumsily to weave in too many secondary characters while staying on point with the historical events. There are some decent attempts to anchor the film with a love story between Dillinger and Billie Frechette (played by the French actress Marion Cotillard, who is wisely striking while the iron is hot in her first stateside role since her Oscar win), but there's not much else in the realm of character development, and no one is given any backstory. The writers start 'in media res' to give it that classical epic structure, but it doesn't work when you can't even identify the peripheral characters from each other. What results is a cavalcade of apparently great supporting turns from a large professional cast, everyone spot on with their period cadence and mannerisms but no one leaving any kind of lasting impression in the wake of the great turns from Depp and Cotillard, the only two in the cast given anything to work with. There are also some missed opportunities to explore Dillinger's Robin Hood mentality and the public infatuation with his 'celebrity' -- just two of the potentially great subtexts that are only given brief surface level treatments by the screenplay.From a technical standpoint, there's plenty to chew on here for thoughtful audiences. Mann's use of HD video to shoot the film gives the period-piece gangster film an interesting texture. I found it refreshing to watch a Depression Era film not washed out in sepia tones and instead look crisp and fresh, with the nighttime shots especially compelling from a composition standpoint. However, there are times when in tight quarters that the digital camera-work gives the film a 'home movie' aesthetic, and whether shooting on film or in digital, the shaky hand-held work during action scenes is always a mistake in my book. Mann also attempts to do some throwback Fritz Lang 'M'-style work on the sound design, which works well in some of the 'silent' scenes but often results in dialogue that is hard to hear and gunshots that are clamoring. These artistic choices are highly debatable, but I admire Mann's vision to do something different with a generic story. Whether you think Mann's manipulations work or not will be left to a matter of personal taste.'Public Enemies' is a film composed of many handsome elements from the costuming to the finely detailed set designs to the soundtrack, which most notably creates a recurring theme with 'Bye, Bye, Blackbird.' There are also some good standalone scenes including a well shot rain-soaked police escorted airplane landing in Indiana, some charming movie theater moments, a thrilling nighttime shootout in the woods, and a killer Cotillard-focused coda that would've packed more of a wallop had the rest of the film added up to the sum of its parts. While it's easy to admire the work of Depp and Cotillard, Bale is off key in his attempt to add subtlety and nuance to his hollowly scripted character. Sadly, Mann's film is a good-looking but shallow exercise in self-seriousness largely due to a faulty script that never successfully identifies the heart of the story. Watching that tear run down Cotillard's cheek before the credits roll, though, you might swear you had just watched something better.",6,14,34,2 July 2009
Elizabeth," Brilliant Historical Film
","A truly engaging historical film that not only teaches you about this period of English history, but also serves up some extremely juicy drama. Galvanized by a star-making performance from Cate Blanchett as the young Queen, and interesting direction from Kapur, who seems to be channeling 'The Godfather' trilogy more so than any Masterpiece Theater or Merchant-Ivory production. Elizabeth's transformation from naive princess to threatened and inexperienced monarch to absolute power is exquisitely handled by Blanchett. The only story arch that falls flat is the love story between Blanchett's 'Elizabeth' and Joseph Fiennes' weaselly nobleman. The ending sequence of Blanchett commanding the throne and taking her vow of virginity and marriage to England itself in full Elizabethean regalia is one of the most classic scenes of recent times. A terrific production all around (it won an Oscar for costume design).",9,0,1,6 March 2003
Oldboy," Savage Plot Saved by Imagery and Sound
","'Oldboy' is best viewed on a clean slate. I knew nothing about it before watching it, only that a friend recommend it. Similar in fashion to 'Donnie Darko' or 'Fight Club' this is a film that once you know the twist and how it ends (and this has a climax ripped right from the bleeding heart of a Greek tragedy) it probably won't hold up on repeat viewing all that well. As such, I will probably avoid watching it again, as it was oddly endearing and I would rather remember it well than think about it too much and ruin the experience.A simplistic and twisted revenge plot gets shrouded in claustrophobic mystery and visual chutzpah (the camera work and color scheming are intense and satisfying, a stunning blend of Scorsese and Zhang Zimou) that tricks the unsuspecting viewer into thinking they are watching something more special than it really is. There's also a fantastic music score blending classical pieces with techno music. The music and the imagery last in the viewer's mind long after the film ends. Unfortunately the story line and characters do not. I suppose on a simple motion picture level (where one views film-making as a purely visual and sound art form) the film is a rousing success. However, if you wish to view film as a story telling art form, this repetitive and contrived motion picture fails miserably. Already pegged for a Hollywood remake that will no doubt pummel the style over substance nature of the film into the ground.",7,28,91,13 February 2005
Black Book," A Triumph of the 'Performance' over the 'Act.'
","Paul Verhoeven is a strange breed. He's responsible for three of the most gleefully violent, fascist, and wildly imaginative sci-fi thrillers of a now bygone era ('Robocop,' 'Total Recall,' and 'Starship Troopers'). He's also directed the only commercially successful erotic thriller of the past twenty years ('Basic Instinct') and what is arguably one of the worst films ever made (the highly un-erotic and campy 'Showgirls'). With 'Black Book' he digs back into his Dutch roots and delivers a thrilling, though flawed, WWII flick anchored by an amazing lead performance from Carice Van Houten.The first thirty minutes play like a crackerjack version of a 'surviving the Holocaust' epic. Imagine what Hitchcock might have done had he ever tackled the genre and you'll get an idea of just how splendidly Verhoeven starts the film. He begins with the plucky and beguiling Jewish singer Rachel Stein (Carice Van Houten) hiding out in the Netherlands from the Nazis, traversing tragedy after tragedy and escaping by the skin of her teeth due to her own innate will to survive until she becomes embroiled with a terrorist Dutch resistance group plotting against the German occupation. The first third of the film is full of suggestive dark humor, crisply shot action set pieces, and a luminous Van Houten who throws her whole body into her acting and could melt (or kill) a man with her smile.The middle portion where Rachel Stein becomes Ellis de Vries and infiltrates the Nazi regime is a stark contrast to its excellent build up. All suggestion is thrown out the door for a crass, misogynistic take on the spy genre. It's fun to watch, but leaves a bad taste in your mouth. It's also the type of crude sadism that is likely to offend the typical audience for this type of historical drama. Van Houten once again throws her whole body into the role, and it's often naked and glowing in this portion of the film. She's immensely watchable as she becomes a pawn in the games of these fascist men hell bent on mutual annihilation. Once driven by her own wits, she now must be rescued time and again by the amoral men who have fallen under her spell.All changes when the Allied Forces march into the Netherlands triumphant, returning sovereign rule to the bitter Dutch, and striking up deals with the crumbling Nazi infrastructure. The fall out from the multiple double-crossings in the middle portion of the film turn the last third into a pulsating and memorable revenge saga.Ultimately, justice is in the eye of the beholder, and Verhoeven seems to be saying that all men are capable of evil deeds when their freedom has been taken away and their lives threatened. In his view of war there are no heroes. The only character with any virtue and good sense is a woman, and her inherent 'weakness' often leads to pain, tragedy, and humiliation. It's a troublesome and often fractured view of the world (which leads to the film's fracturing into three distinct parts), but it's miraculously held together by Carice Van Houten's galvanizing performance that emotionally and physically upstages the worst of what Verhoeven can deliver thematically and visually on any given day.",8,16,24,23 April 2007
127 Hours," Harrowing True Life Tale of Survival
","Academy-Award winning director Danny Boyle has always been a fan of survival stories. With this reality based tale about Aron Ralston getting literally trapped between a rock and a hard place on a mountain climbing trip in Utah gone horribly wrong, Boyle has finally found a near perfect story to match his over-the-top directorial style.Apart from the head jarring opening minutes, most of Boyle's usual tricks work very well here. It also helps that James Franco willingly goes gonzo in the lead role. There's real emotion and a zest for life on display...and as gut churning as the end result is...you'll be hard-pressed not to feel uplifted.Check out full reviews and more at theschleicherspin.com",8,2,7,20 November 2010
Alexander," Welcome to Bizarro-World
","The world is a confusing, chaotic mess, and in mankind's futile attempt to make sense of it he mythologizes those that came before in hopes of forgiving the transgressions of his forefathers and providing a sense of optimism for the uncertain future. It's this type of mixed message where leaders can turn from visionary hero to over-indulgent tyrant in the blink of an eye, combined with grotesque parallels to current geopolitics (care to take a look at Afghanistan and Iraq anyone?), and a discouraging moral relativism marked most prominently by the rampant bisexuality of these ancient marauders that has sent those critics and viewers who get scared by the gray areas of life all a flutter. Oliver Stone's 'Alexander' is a big, audacious, confusing, bloody mess of a film. During its entire three hour run time I was on edge, never knowing what type of over the top directorial flourish (witness the climactic infrared elephant battle royale), weird psychosexual subtext, or insane acting performance was awaiting us in the next frame.For all it triumphs (the creatively staged battle scenes, the opulent Babylon, the subtexts and symbolism, the passionate performances), there were a few damning distractions. The love story between Alexander and Hapheastion was as cheesy as the type of heterosexual romance you would find in a 'Titanic' or 'Pearl Harbor.' Also, while Angelina Jolie's other-worldly accent whose origins can only be known to her dialect coach adds yet another fascinating layer to her fine art of scenery chewing, the Irish and Scottish accents of the Macedonians and Greeks are ridiculous and lift you right out of the alien world Stone has placed you in. Still, I would take this all instead of the over-ripe dullness of this year's earlier and only mildly entertaining Greek epic 'Troy.' You see, in the bizarro-world of Hollywood, a monumental failure from the likes of an Oliver Stone still towers over the greatest works of a lesser director.",7,0,2,1 December 2004
Troy," Would Make a Great Silent Film
","Cheesy dialogue and horrible music score aside, Wolfgang Peterson's grand adaptation of the age-old Greek legend is a very entertaining spectacle in that old-fashioned sword and sandals Hollywood epic kind of way. As with all good big-budget, star-studded, action-packed overwrought quasi-historical epics, 'Troy' is as memorable for its follies (the horribly miscast Pitt as Achilles, the uninspiring Diana Kruger as Helen, the annoying as hell Orlando Bloom as Paris, the pretty-boy homo-erotic nature of it all) as it is for its triumphs (the massive sets and fantastically choreographed battle scenes, the scene-stealing performance from Peter O'toole as King Priam, the deliciously vile Brian Cox as the ruthless Agamemnon, and the star-making turn from Eric Bana as Hector). Thankfully Peterson is an old-school director, so despite Pitt's posturing and male model stares that reminded me of Ben Stiller's hilarious 'blue steel' look from 'Zoolander' and a painfully stale script that doesn't allow the viewer to root for anyone, he avoids all flash and music-video style editing to give the film its refreshingly old-fashioned look and its 'this is an epic from another era' pace. Both of these welcome throwbacks to the heyday of Cecil B. DeMille make the film itself more endearing (albeit in a very dull way) than any of the wishy-washy characters parading in togas across the movie screen. In the end, with nary an authentic Greek to be seen in the cast of thousands, varying degrees of wavering British accents and the reduction of a richly layered and complex centuries old legend into a single two and half hour Hollywood movie, Homer is probably rolling over in his ferry on the river Styx, but I still enjoyed my popcorn and passed a few hours of my time.",6,0,1,16 May 2004
Brokeback Mountain," It Is What it Is....
","Postcard perfect cinematography and impeccable direction (Ang Lee deservedly won his Academy 'Reward' for this film, as it sits nicely alongside his more potent 'Ice Storm' and 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' to put him near the top of the cream of the crop of modern directors) highlight this film about gay cowboy romance in 1960's Wyoming.Plotting and character development are glacially paced to the point of banality in the early portion of the film as the melodrama slowly unfolds into a sappy star-crossed romance amidst gorgeous mountain scenery. The drama really heats up in the middle portions of the film as our two lovers (a very good Heath Ledger as Ennis and a slightly annoying Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack) try to hide their true feelings and lead normal lives with wives and children. It's interesting to watch how the repression manifests itself differently in the characters' lives, as Jack's pent up frustration allows him to finally stand up to an oppressive father-in-law while meeting with other men on the side keeping both his wife and Ennis completely blind, while Ennis' repression leads to a complete disintegration of his life highlighted in powerful scenes with Michelle Williams as his all too-knowing wife as she delivers a shockingly raw and emotive performance.The film lurches on into its strained later portions as it becomes painfully clear to even the most patient viewer that this was based on a short story. The flawless direction of Lee and some delightful cameos (with Linda Cardellini very effective as Ennis' later-day waitress girlfriend and Anna Farris serving some comic relief as a loquacious ranching high society Texan) keep the film engaging. However, it eventually deteriorates into the art-house equivalent of a Nicholas Sparks' adaptation complete with dialogue more memorable for its unintended comedy than for any deeply moving undercurrent, which is why I suspect the film succeeded so well with mainstream female audiences. Unfortunately it left this movie lover wishing for something a bit more meaningful.",7,6,29,8 May 2006
Insomnia," Best film of 2002 (thus far)
","'Insomnia' exceeded all my wildest expectations. It displays visual techniques and common themes similar to 'Memento' that show director Nolan is a stone cold auteur with lofty ambitions and talent to spare. Some say he sold out to Hollywood with this, but how can one complain when he brings out the best performance from Pacino in years. Pacino is normally playing himself and all his ticks, but here he actually inhabits a fully fleshed out and complex character and brings him to life. Nolan also brings out an effectively creepy performance from Robin Williams, who is more entertaining here than in 'One Hour Photo', but perhaps not as studied. If Nolan keeps 'selling out' like this, then hooray for Hollywood...we have our next Hitchcock. This is cat and mouse and psychological rambling at its best and most satisfying. Swank and Maura Tierney (an underused actress of much talent) are also fabulous in their non-showy roles. I can't recommend this film more highly. As of late September 2002, it's the best film of the year.",9,0,0,26 September 2002
Juno," For Realz
","Ellen Page (in a star-making performance) plays an accidentally pregnant smart-alleck 16 year-old named Juno (named after the Roman goddess, not the town in Alaska) in the latest hyper-smart comedy from Jason Reitman (director of 'Thank You for Smoking'). 'Juno' follows the latest Hollywood trend of quirky comedies that actually deal with some heavy issues. Unlike most of those films, 'Juno' manages to stay funny even as it gets serious and treats its characters and audience with respect by keeping the jokes coming even as it gets cutesy or plays for tears.Screenwriter Diablo Cody (a pen-name destined for greatness) has a knack for writing hipster dialog that doesn't wear thin or get annoying. She manufactures big laughs from both quasi-goofy pop culture references and nervous situations inherent to adolescence. She keeps things fresh even when the film starts showing its sweet side. Think of her as Judd Apatow without as much of the raunchy humor. Director Reitman gives the film the appropriate indie-feel and populates the movie with a great soundtrack of songs whose lyrics perfectly match Cody's storyline and dialog.Ellen Page is eternally likable in the lead role, and the decision Juno makes in the end feels totally organic and true to her character, giving the film a ring of truth instead of feeling manufactured to make the audience feel good. Michael Cera proves again to be one of the most amiable and subtly funny young actors working today. His performance is a perfect companion piece to his more overtly hilarious work in the riotous 'Superbad'. The rest of the supporting cast is equally likable, and even Jennifer Garner, and actress who always seems to try so hard, seems perfectly cast here as an adoptive mother-to-be who tries way too hard.Though not as laugh-out-loud funny as most of Apatow's films, 'Juno' swings as one of the best of the quirky indie-comedies of the past five years. It's funny and has a heart, but it doesn't beat you over the head with it like 'Little Miss Sunshine' did, and instead, thanks to Ellen Page and Diablo Cody, feels like the real deal.",8,8,18,17 December 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," A Pirate's Life for Me
","Who would've thought that a Jerry Bruckheimer film production of a Walt Disney theme park ride would end up being the most consistently entertaining and subversive film franchise of recent memory? Director Gore Verbinski and the bloated cast headed up by a hilarious Johnny Depp are all back for the rollicking 'closing' of the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' trilogy.Following the mantra of its predecessor (bigger, better, more), everything here attempts to one-up what has been seen before. With the exception of the sight gags (which are smaller and more plentiful in 'At World's End' but nothing like the mind-boggling giant wheel or log-rolling scenes from 'Dead Man's Chest'), everything else is more, more, more. There's more characters (most notably Chow Yun Fat as the leader of a Singapore pirate gang), more plot (the double-crossings are so numerous as to make your head spin), more elaborate and wildly imaginative action set pieces and special effects (the boat flipping scene is especially good), more monkey and midget action, more jokes, more cameos (witness a seemingly un-made-up Keith Richards as Captain Teague), and most thankfully more macabre gallows humor and absurdity.Gore Verbinski has become a master of the modern action-adventure movie, finely tuning his skills here to rival an early era Steven Spielberg in his sense of visual scope. With these three films he is now an expert in the cadence of integrating computer effects with massive live stunts across sprawling set pieces. He truly deserves accolades for managing to get every character in on the action in the dazzling climactic battle between the Black Pearl and the Flying Dutchman in the middle of a giant maelstrom. There's also one amazing scene of the British Captain going down with his ship as it is cannon-balled into oblivion that in a more serious film would seem quite epic, but in the refreshing silliness of this series is just one more over-the-top element subverting the traditional tone of the Hollywood spectacle.'At World's End' provides more fun bang for your buck than any 'third' in a series since 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.' It made me feel like a kid again, but being so insanely indebted to the concept of 'MORE' imagining the series continuing into a fourth installment would be truly gluttonous.",8,8,12,4 June 2007
Match Point," 'I Don't Care if He's Great, I Just Hope He's Lucky...'
","...and what a great stroke of luck it is to have sat through Woody Allen's latest, 'Match Point.' Fans of Woody could sense his comeback in the tragedy half of his last effort, 'Melinda and Melinda.' It was far more compelling than the comedy half, and the philosophical ideas it brought up were the best Woody Allen had given us in a long while. Here with 'Match Point' he explores the notion of luck and gives us his best film since....well, since I don't know when. He proves here that when he leaves himself out of the cast, and changes locations (the transition from New York City to London is as flawless as it is invigorating), he can deliver the goods. This film, free of all the typical Allen shtick, and full of noirish twists and surprises, is every bit as good as Robert Altman's 'The Player' or 'Gosford Park,' and like those two films, it's the best kind of return to form you could hope for from a past master.Chris Wilton (played moderately well by Johnathan Rhys Myers, who comes across as a more handsome Joquin Phoenix) is a failed tennis pro from Ireland who gets a plum job at a snobbish country club in London where he meets up with Tom (an appropriately British Matthew Goode), woos his sister, Chloe (an adorable Emily Mortimer), and has an affair with Tom's flighty fianc√©e, a struggling American actress named Nola (a ravishing Scarlett Johansson). The film starts off like a more refined version of last year's tawdry affair, 'Closer,' with Allen exploring the love lives of semi-bored, over-educated filthy rich Brits who when not hopping in and out of each other's beds are hob-nobbing at the opera, the latest art exhibit, or lounging around their lavish estates reading and drinking. There's also a hint of 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' in its exploration of the class system and Chris' obsession with infiltrating this exclusive and beguiling society. Thankfully, we're spared all of the weirdness of an atrocity like 'Ripley,' as Allen keeps it all very clean, sheen, clever and classy.The film takes some dark turns and has some operatic overtures, spiced with some Dostoevsky references and plenty of pondering on luck. Allen here doesn't seem to be writing off the need for hard work completely, but to achieve a truly privileged life, where one can get away with just about anything, you better have a lot of luck.",9,173,246,9 January 2006
Midnight in Paris," Meandering Woody Allen in Paris
","Charming latter-day Woody Allen film is crafted as a love letter to Paris and nostalgia. Though Owen Wilson (not as bad as he could've been) and Rachel McAdams (lovely but terrible as usual) are miscast, Marion Cotillard is perfect again as a dreamy muse for a writer who wishes he was living in the 1920's.Though beautifully photographed and with a great soundtrack, this isn't as strong an entry as 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona', but should please Woody Allen fans and anyone who has dreamed of going back in time to more romantic and inspiring days - and nights.Check out full reviews at theschleicherspin.com",8,2,5,6 June 2011
Zodiac," Effectively Creepy and Engrossing True Crime Tale
","David Fincher has taken nearly five years off between films, and he has returned a more mature and accomplished director with his fascinating 'Zodiac.' It may not reach the cult status of his 'Seven' or 'Fight Club' or find the box office success of 'Panic Room,' but by many measures it may be his most carefully crafted film. More in line with the crime epics of directors like Michael Mann than with the typical serial-killer thriller, 'Zodiac' is propelled by inventive direction, a great cast, engaging attention to detail, and a killer soundtrack of classic songs from the late 1960's and 1970's.Based on the book by Robert Graysmith (played effectively here by Jake Gyllenhaal), 'Zodiac' is meticulous in its details (both in dialogue and Fincher's finely painted visuals) and sprawling in plot and its parade of intriguing characters. Mark Ruffalo is especially compelling playing the lead detective who becomes obsessed with the case, and Robert Downey Jr. does his best macabre comic relief job as the boozing and drugging reporter Paul Avery who was targeted for a brief time by the infamous killer. There's also a fine supporting cast featuring Brian Cox, Chloe Sevigny, and John Caroll Lynch among many others, all doing top notch work.Fincher's digital VIPER camera lends itself surprising well to the period detail and look of the 1970's. Though some of the more brightly lit shots aren't as clear and in focus as you would like, this is the first movie I can think of shot on all digital where some of the cinematography could actually be called beautiful (check out any of the skyline shots and the great overhead of the Golden Gate Bridge). Fincher crafts some truly creepy moments using simple lighting techniques featuring characters hopping into strange cars on deserted highways, traipsing through dimly lit homes, or nervously making their way down a dark creaky staircase into a fathomless basement. There's also some nice freak-out moments in the classy and sharply filmed murder scenes and when characters receive eerie phone-calls from the so-called killer or his equally sick copycats. I didn't realize how effective Fincher's technique was until I went home alone to my dark apartment and felt a sudden lump in my throat when a friend made an unexpected late night call.There are times when the film becomes bogged down with police procedural aspects, and its epic runtime is apparent, though most of the slow parts still remain engrossing. Graysmith makes it clear who he thinks the killer was, though the case was officially unsolved. When all the pieces finally fit together, the audience feels the same sickening giddiness as Graysmith and the detectives long plagued by the cryptic case that held much of San Franciso hostage knowing that the prime suspect will never be convicted on so much circumstantial evidence. In the end, Fincher leaves you with some haunting feelings, and if anything is certain, it's that Donovan's 'Hurdy Gurdy Man' will never be listened to the same again.",8,5,11,6 March 2007
The Prestige," For the look on their faces...to make them Wonder, just for even a moment...
","Brilliantly using the role of a magician as an allegory for not just the 'magic' of film-making, but for the dark, psychologically complex motives of the auteur filmmaker, director Christopher Nolan has dispelled his critics who claim he's just another hack and treated his fans to a twisty delight with 'The Prestige.' This is only his fourth major film (following the neoclassic 'Memento,' the haunting 'Insomnia,' and the refreshingly dark 'Batman Begins'), but Christopher Nolan has developed clear visual stamps (i.e. panning crane shots of cold, snow covered locales and close-ups of the protagonist working with his hands), complex thematic elements (getting revenge through acts of showmanship or becoming someone/something else, protagonists riddled with guilt over horrible things beyond their control), and delicate and intricate handling of plot/scripting (folding in on time, multiple points of view, and disjointed chronology) that make him one of the most compelling up-and-coming auteurs working in film today.'The Prestige' is almost impossible to critique without giving away a major plot twist, as the actual twists make the film so fascinatingly rich in that deep down spooky kind of way. The story of dueling magicians (a fairly good Hugh Jackman and a typically brilliant Christian Bale) gets off to a prodding start after we're told from the opening shot by Bale's eerie voice-over narration to 'watch closely.' Slowly, and inevitably, the tale of one-upmanship and revenge gets under your skin as you try to figure out what the biggest trick is going to be.Where this year's similarly themed 'Illusionist' was lush and romantic, 'The Prestige' is brooding and riddled with psychosis. Focusing on one trick and fueled by love, 'The Illusionist' sucked in viewers. Focusing on the twisting of time and narration and multiple tricks fueled by competition and hatred, 'The Prestige' transfixes viewers into a slow-burning flicker of mesmerized menace. Like Nolan's other films, the blood really starts to pump in the second half as the actors are allowed to truly emote and chew the scenery (think of Carrie-Ann Moss's turn of character in the later part of 'Memento' and you'll get an idea of the level Jackman and a superb Rebecca Hall as Bale's wife reach when performing 'the turns'), while the plot mechanizations begin to carefully fall into place and their character arcs intertwine in fantastically tragic ways.Michael Caine (always reliable in these type of mentor roles), Scarlett Johansson (a bit over-exposed this year through no fault of her own by multiple releases but doing a decent British accent here and looking smashing as always), Andy Serkis (a crafty trickster of an actor), and David Bowie (as Tesla) provide fine acting support. Meanwhile, Nolan turns the screws of his mind games tighter than any other bankable director working today and painted a look on my face...that for more than a fleeting moment, but for the entire two-hour runtime and many hours more after, made me Wonder. 'The Prestige' is pure movie magic.",9,4,7,24 October 2006
Cloverfield," Pretty Close to Something Terrible...
","At one point during the mayhem of 'Cloverfield' our jerky-jokey cameraman Hud (an annoying T. J. Miller) remarks that the monster ravaging New York City is 'something terrible.' Well, 'Cloverfield' is pretty close to something terrible, but it's also laugh-out-loud funny and loads of fun.Taking cues from 'The Blair Witch Project', 'Godzilla', and our current YouTube/MySpace crazed youth oriented culture that believes everyone's point of view deserves to be recorded, producer J. J. Abrams' opportunistic 'Cloverfield' operates at a mercifully quick clip to maximize entertainment value with a minimum of effort (and budget) while showing us allegedly top-secret video footage recovered after a massive monster attack on NYC.Though barely ninety minutes long, we still have to suffer through an excruciatingly banal opening twenty minutes of vapid, spoiled twenty-somethings partying the night away before the monster strikes. There was a moment somewhere during this that I actually zoned out completely and found myself staring at the dark theater wall. The cast of unknowns thankfully contains a few people who might be able to act if given the chance in a normal film. Standouts include the painfully lovely Jessica Lucas as the feisty Lily and Zooey Deschanel look-a-like Lizzy Caplan as the sarcastic Marlena. These two young actresses acquitted themselves nicely while a group of anonymous and interchangeable actors playing stupid characters making bad decision after bad decision whirled around them. It made for one of those odd movie-going experiences where you actually start routing for certain characters to die in horrible ways while you hope the pretty girls make it out alive because, well, they're cute.As a gimmick film, 'Cloverfield' is as shallow as they come. It's also too silly and too much fun to end up mad about it. At least the idiot hand-held cameraman/character wants to see the monster and the destruction as much as we do. This leads to some great money-shots of the creature and its tour of terror through midtown Manhattan. It would've been more thrilling had I not seen very similarly designed creature effects in last fall's 'The Mist'. Like that film, 'Cloverfield' certainly has its moments of giddy monster oriented fun, but it ultimately implodes and leaves behind a wreck of a movie that is pretty close to something terrible.",6,9,20,21 January 2008
Hotel Rwanda," Great Performances Bring True Story to Life
","When the world (specifically the UN) turned its back on the genocidal tribal warfare in Rwanda in the early 1990's, a true story emerged of a hotel manager who risked his life and his family to help refugees survive the massacre and escape to safety. The straightforward and by-the-numbers direction of Terry George service this tale very well, as it allows the fact based and ultimately uplifting story to speak for itself and allows the actors (most notably Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo-both rightfully honored with Oscar nods) to shine. There's a lot of heartbreaking stuff here both of a personal and political nature. It's a sobering and timely tale that highlights the grotesque flaws of current geopolitics while reminding us that even in the most dire of situations the human will to survive and help others survive will emerge triumphant.",8,1,1,14 February 2005
Crash," Bold and Compelling Treatise on Racism in Modern Society
","Take the pop-cultured infused socio-political discourse of a Spike Lee movie, the glossy grit of a Michael Mann LA crime story, and the compelling mosaic story-telling technique of a Paul Thomas Anderson film, and you'll get the 'feel' for Paul Haggis' stunning directorial debut. To boil a film like 'Crash' down to such terms, however, would do it severe injustice. Powerful and thought provoking, this is the most accomplished and compelling film since '21 Grams' premiered back at the end of 2003.'Crash' brilliantly shows through intertwining vignettes, that are often blazingly funny in their brutal honesty and fascinatingly gut-wrenching in their melodrama, how subtle racism (often guised in nervous humor) and overt prejudice (often exasperated by sudden irrational violence and an overabundance of readily available firearms) completely permeate our culture and everyday interactions within society. A hyper intelligent script showcases not characters, but brilliant representations of real people, people we know and pass in the street every day, people not unlike us. People who at first seem to be lost causes in the war against racism (witnessed in Matt Dillon's harried beat cop and Sandra Bulluck's spoiled District Attorney's wife) can often become the most unlikely solutions to the problem, while people who ride in on their high horse (witnessed in Ryan Phillipe's noble young police officer) can turn against the tide in the blink of an eye. No one is immune to it no matter how hard they try to rise above it (witnessed in Don Cheadle's quietly tragic detective).In the end, everyone is flawed, the racism is inescapable, and the audience feels a twinge of sympathy for just about everyone. Perhaps that is what Haggis is hinting at to be our answer. Showing empathy and being able to relate even on the most remote level to every human being out there is the first step to that true brotherhood of man. Because the film offers no real solution, the discussion and discourse it creates in the minds of the viewers is the first step in solving society's ills. We can't tackle everything at once, but we can open a dialogue, and hopefully, one person conversing with another will be the first step to our salvation. It takes a bold film to raise such questions, and an even greater one to compel an audience to talk about the potential answers, and that is exactly what 'Crash' accomplishes.",9,427,737,7 May 2005
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," You Can't Fight in Here! This is the War Room!
","Just about everything in this brilliant satire of Cold War politics is perfect. Kubrick created his first template masterpiece with this hilarious comedy that sees military bureaucracy as a comedy of errors and a hot-line conversation between the President of the US and the Premier of the USSR as a snippy fit between quasi-lovers. You have everything you could ever want here: great dialogue, fantastic acting, flawless directing, cool sets, and timely political farce (that could still ring true today in this age of Bush America, Institutionalized Fear, and the War on Terror).Everyone deservedly raves about Peter Sellers in his multiple roles (as Mandrake, the President, and Dr. Strangelove), but I dare you to find a funnier performance than that of George C. Scott as the slapdash over-zealous General 'Buck' Turgidson, especially when he falls over backwards in the War Room and gets up and continues his speech without missing a beat. Also of note is Sterling Hayden as Jack D. Ripper. His riffs on the purity of essence, bodily fluids, and Communist infiltration through fluoridation are laugh-out-loud funny. With characters like Colonel 'Bat' Guano, and Slim Pickens' Major Kong, great scenes naturally flow forth, and Kubrick's one take on pure comedy is simply genius. He was wise never to touch the genre again fully (although 'A Clockwork Orange' will always be a comedy in my book), as he made the perfect example of the form here.",10,9,19,29 December 2005
Pan's Labyrinth," Beautiful Decay
","Guillermo Del Toro's 'Pan's Labyrinth' begins with a transfixing opening shot that completely transports you into a dark and mysterious world. The film has the look and tone of Del Toro's near-masterpiece 'The Devil's Backbone.' Whereas 'The Devil's Backbone' was a ripping good yarn and old-fashioned ghost story where the haunting served as a metaphor for the fractured relationships of the people living in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War, 'Pan's Labyrinth' uses the same historical context to present a simplistic and damning Passion Play.Much like the similarly well made but questionable 'Children of Men' this film presents us with an array of characters who are nothing more than archetypes pulled out of the decaying mythology of both Paganism and Christianity. Del Toro attempts some character development by assigning each person a single detail to give them depth (i.e. the Captain's father's watch, Mercedes' hiding of the knife in her apron, or Ofelia's love of books).Despite the lack of substance in the storyline, the film is not without its suspenseful and magical moments. Ofelia's escape from the horrifying 'baby-eater' and Mercedes' escape from the Captain provide cracker-jack thrills and are expertly staged by the director. Del Toro masterfully handles the complex special effects, elaborate make-up and set designs, creating a hauntingly beautiful mise-en-scene that gives the viewer plenty of eye-candy without being overwhelming or reeking of hollow CGI design.Unfortunately the film, saturated in Catholic overtones, becomes rather predictable once Ofelia's imaginary friend Pan reveals a sinister nature behind his tasks for the young girl. Ironically, this film will probably appeal to the same people who found great comfort in Mel Gibson's odious 'Passion of the Christ.' Those who believe in redemption through torture and self-sacrifice will heavily identify with the archetypes on display here. Ultimately the film presents a sadistic task-master 'god' whose sole design is to trick an innocent into sacrificing themselves for the 'future' and gives us a notion of 'heaven' that may only exist in the mind of a wildly imaginative young girl. A film (like Roman Polanski's 'The Pianist') that presents the horrors of the real world as something for a person to survive and overcome speaks truer to the human condition than a film like 'Pan's Labyrinth' that cloaks the real horrors of life in fantasy and myth and celebrates martyrdom over the innate will to survive. Del Toro dresses his falsity in beautiful garb, but the morality lurking beneath is rotten to the core.",7,14,28,22 January 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Grim Musical OJ's the Audience
","Tim Burton's gleefully macabre adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's musical smash hit 'Sweeney Todd' is the strangest holiday season Oscar bait to come out of Hollywood...well, ever. I'll be the first to admit I am not a fan of film musicals as they are inherently loud and full of paper-thin characters singing and dancing their way through horribly obvious and clich√©d plots. However, every so often one comes along that I thoroughly enjoy, like 'Chicago' with its hot-blooded dames committing cold-blooded murder during the roaring '20's. Here, bloody revenge is the topic, and Victorian London the setting. The stage was set for a bizarre juxtaposition of seemingly disparate genres: the over-the-top operetta and the over-the-top horror film. On both levels, 'Sweeney Todd' delights and horrifies in equal measure.The film starts awkwardly with foggy CGI set designs and off-key singing covering a clunky exposition about a barber wrongly imprisoned (for, well, I never caught why) and looking for revenge against the judge who drove his wife to suicide (allegedly) and kidnapped his daughter. The film moves slowly until Sacha Baron Cohen ('Borat') shows up with a gin-swilling moppet in tow (Ed Sanders as Toby, the best singing orphan this side of 'Oliver!') adding a sense of color, humor, and heart to the film's bleeding core. Once the killings start, the set designs and gore seem to take on a life of their own as Burton paints his vision on screen with the rare wanton abandon of an auteur with final cut.It would be unfair for me to judge the music and the songs (they were adequately lively in my humble opinion), but the acting was far better than I expected. Johnny Depp was perfectly off-kilter in the lead role. His lack of expression during the 'By the Sea' fantasy sequence was priceless. Meanwhile, Helena Bonham Carter performed her third successful evolution as an actress. She was once the darling of the Merchant/Ivory costume drama, then the cult star of 'Fight Club', and now the Cockney-accented comic relief in the darkest movie musical ever made. I thought her facial expressions and timing where especially spot-on. I can't think of another actress who has such distinct groups of rabid fans. Alan Rickman is effectively creepy in the villain role, while the two young stars playing the whatever-the-heck-his-name-is-pretty-boy and Johanna were appropriately annoying and dewy-eyed.While the film goes through the requisite motions of an operetta, it succumbs to a fantastically grim and fitting conclusion that ultimately won over the audience. With more dark psychologically rich subtexts and better acting then you come to expect from a film musical, 'Sweeney Todd' OJ's its audience with cartoonish gore and spirited song and dance. It's no masterpiece, but it's bloody good fun.",7,6,12,22 December 2007
Taxi Driver," The Cinema of Alienation
","Working for the first time with misanthropic screenwriter Paul Schrader, and using Alfred Hitchcock's music score maker extraordinaire Bernard Hermann, Martin Scorsese crafted one of the bleakest and most memorable films about alienation with 1976's 'Taxi Driver'. Here we have the lonely cab driver Travis Bickle cruising the sleaziest streets in New York City, looking for love in all the wrong places, plotting his way to leave his mark with violence, and looking for redemption in the rescue of a child prostitute named Iris (a very young Jodie Foster).Like the finest films from its decade, 'Taxi Driver' is a intimate character-driven film haunted by the ghosts of Vietnam and Nixon-era politics that stained the psyche of the American people, especially those disenfranchised in the urban sectors. It's also a classic Scorsese story, nihilistic to the extreme, and containing what is still one of the most graphic and shocking bloodbaths when Travis Bickle finally goes on his rampage. The end result is quite ironic, and leaves a bitter halo imprinted on the viewer's mind.By all accounts, this is a landmark film: one that heralded the first masterpiece from a director who would go on to a long and fruitful career, presented Robert DeNiro as a formidable headliner, and proclaimed Jodie Foster a serious actress. It's also one of the most controversial movies ever made, as it is the only film that can claim to have inspired an attempted presidential assassination when John Hinkle tried to shoot Ronald Reagan to impress Jodie Foster whom he became obsessed with after seeing this film, which is not too far removed from Travis Bickle's aborted attempt to kill a Senator to impress Cybil Shepherd's character. All of this makes 'Taxi Driver' a film classic, albeit a very dark one that will always have many people crying foul.",9,3,5,2 January 2007
Capote," Like the Real Capote...Always Compelling but Seriously Flawed
","First off, let's get this out of the way. Philip Seymour Hoffman has received universal praise for his conjuring of Capote on screen, and it is all well deserved. For me, much like Jamie Foxx in last year's 'Ray,', Hoffman becomes the title character. All the award nominations that are to follow are no joke.Now, onto the film. The director takes a stark, low-key approach that is supposed to give the film a haunting quality. It works well in the early scenes where Capote and best friend Harper Lee are doing their research, but lacks gravitas in the end with the closing scenes at the gallows.What the film does well is expertly show the distasteful charm Capote had that made him one of the main stars of the 'Jet Set' crowd, and he was clearly the life of the party as long as you were sucking up to him. He was extremely self absorbed and unlikable at times, which is why it's hard to reconcile that with his interactions with the killers in doing his research for 'In Cold Blood.' He seems to befriend death-row bound Percy way too easily, and then lies to him to keep the friendship going. On one hand the film shows well Capote's obsession with the true crime that was to become the basis of his seminal work, but it seems to gloss over the relationship he had with the subjects and characters that latter inhabited that book.In the end I'm not sure what the point of the film is supposed to be. You felt little sympathy for Capote or his subjects, but are left with a good idea of what happens when a talented individual becomes so absorbed with themselves and the idea of their great work, that they barely work again and die wallowing in their own self-pity ('In Cold Blood' was Capote's last completed book and he died in 1984 from complications from alcoholism).The film does deserve some credit, though, as it made me want to seek out Capote's works, and in an even odder way made me wonder what the heck happened to the enigmatic Harper Lee (whose character is underused in the film and portrayed wonderfully by the always amazing Catherine Keener)? Her relationship alone with Capote (stemming from childhood) might have made a better film, and the film reminds us that her one and only work, 'To Kill a Mockingbird' (which she was polishing up while helping Capote research his book) became more revered and well-known (every high school student in America reads it and for good reason) than anything Capote did. There's your real story.",7,4,8,25 October 2005
Lost in Translation," Sofia Knows Movies and this one is Simply Amazing
","It's so rare to see a movie like this (a simple two lost souls meeting in an alien land flick) work on so many levels, and it possesses a rare trifecta of surprises.  First, there is Bill Murray's performance, a most subtlety hilarious and heartbreakingly real portrayal of an over-the-hill actor named Bob still searching for identify and a way to connect to others.  Second, there is Sofia Coppola's direction.  It's both lovely and amazing to see her use the same dreamy fluidity in storytelling that she used in her directorial debut, 'The Virgin Suicides.'  There we were spellbound by her depiction of 1970's suburbia.  Here we are spellbound by her portrait of present day media-saturated Tokyo.  In both films, we revel in the characters lost in these mosaics.  The underlying continuity of themes in both films (which are very different stories surface wise) shows Coppola is a true auteur and could have just as compelling a career ahead of her as her father.  Thirdly and perhaps most surprisingly is the performance from Scarlett Johansson.  It's so nuanced, natural, and utterly compelling (those lips, those hips, that smile) that you can hardly believe such a mature performance could come from such a young woman.  Just as Sofia made me fall in love with Kirsten Dunst in 'The Virgin Suicides' so I fell head over heals for Scarlett's lonely newlywed Charlotte and for Miss Johansson herself.There's a delightful array of small details and subplots to rejoice in here. The look at Japanese culture and their treatment of American tourists and celebrities is as entertaining as it is astute.  The little chats accompanying the slow progression of Charlotte and Bob's friendship ring true and are both funny and touching.  The silent moments in the film carry just as much weight as the ones filled with the wonderful soundtrack and dialogue.  And Anna Farris' hilarious send-up of Cameron Diaz comes across as frightfully truthful without ever seeming mean-spirited.  As of mid-October this is probably the best film of the year, and I suspect like Sofia's first film, it will age very well thanks to the rich details and truthful look at loneliness and the desire to be found.",10,0,0,7 October 2003
Barry Lyndon," Beyond Superb
","Two films from this past year prompted me to revisit Kubrick's ultimate costume drama, 'Barry Lyndon,' both of them staring the opulent Nicole Kidman--Von Trier's 'Dogville' for its languid pacing and literary narration, and the much maligned 'Birth' for its classical music score and long, wide camera shots. What I discovered while watching for the first time uninterrupted the digitally remastered DVD of Kubrick's period piece is that the film was paradoxically way ahead of its time while at the same time over-indulgently a time warp of a film that much like a great sci-fi flick, took the viewer completely into another world, this one just happened to be late 18th century Britian and Europe.Kubrick's attention to visual and sound detail (the music, the sounds of birds and trees rustling, the cold echos of a Lord's castle) is mind boggling. All the outdoor shots were filmed in the pure natural light of day, while all the interior shots were done by candle-light. The result is amazing. His attention to character, as usual is austere (only in the death scene of Barry's young son does the viewer feel any sympathy), but fittingly so given the grotesque formalities that surrounded everyday life in the era in which these characters lived and died. The themes are epic (duels, dastardly deeds by state and individual, wars at home and abroad, betrayal, greed, lust) as is the scope of the camera's eye. The visual sumptuousness of the entire endeavor almost pummels the viewer into submission and left me in an altered state almost as wondrous and weird as the one Kubrick created in '2001' where I actually felt like I was part of this strange world of 18th century Britian. For the film buff, this is a work of art, and for fans of period pieces this is the pinnacle of the genre.",10,18,28,28 December 2004
Full Metal Jacket," In a World of S**T, they are not Afraid....
","Kubrick's films are generally more accessible and mainstream than he is often given credit for. As gritty and unflinching as his take on the Vietnam War is, this is for my money his most mainstream work. Kubrick gives us a 'grunts-eye-view' of military training and combat in a war that was particularly unpopular and well documented. This was the first war to be fully televised on TV, and Kubrick pokes fun at the soldier's awareness of this, and of the dubious nature of the propaganda put out by the military's own front-line reporting. Here we get a world-wind tour speckled with dark humor (but never too much politics, a similar stance that benefited the recent 'Jarhead,' which owes a world of debt to this film), excellent use of pop music (who thought Kubrick could go all Scorcese on us), and brutal sequences of hard-edged violence.My one complaint is that Matthew Modine is extremely underwhelming in the lead role, but the rest of the ensemble is top notch. Lee Ermey is perfect as the sadistic but oddly sympathetic drill instructor who turns maggots into killing machines in boot camp, and Arliss Howard is especially good as the underwritten 'Cowboy.' Kubrick, always the master of his art, leaves us with some lasting images, most notably D'Onofrio's stare-down before blowing his brains out, which is mirrored later on by a young female Vietnamese sniper begging to be put out of her misery after being fatally wounded. Kubrick also closes the film with something he doesn't often do, a wink to the audience, as our grunts, now combat weary and barely alive, march to the theme of the 'Mickey Mouse Club' showing that indoctrination started long before they were dehumanized in boot camp and rebuilt as 'The Core.' Semper Fi, indeed.",9,30,42,3 January 2006
The Passion of Joan of Arc," Dreyer's 'Realized Mysticism'
","*Note: This a review of the Criterion Edition DVD with the 'Voices of Light' accompaniment. Over the decades Dreyer's film was a victim of religious and politic censors, two fires that destroyed valuable prints, unauthorized cuts, and zealous editors working against his wishes to modernize the film. An original, uncensored cut was found miraculously in a Norwegian hospital for the mentally ill (ironic?) in 1981 and fully restored for the Criterion Collection. Famed composer Richard Einhorn created his libretto, 'Voices of Light', in response to his own experiences viewing the film and researching the history of Joan of Arc. The film can be viewed with or without the accompaniment, though I can't imagine Dreyer would've objected as Einhorn with great care honored the spirit of the film and arguably of Saint Joan with his compositions.Carl Dreyer's silent film, 'The Passion of Joan of Arc', is a shocking example of the potential of film as art. No amount of scholarly critique can account for the raw power in viewing the film. It's one of those rare experiences that can only be seen to be understood. Dreyer's meticulously crafted aesthetics (the film is almost entirely composed of close-ups of the actors' faces) are perfectly married to the gut wrenching performance of Maria Falconetti (a theater star who never acted in another film) in the lead role. I think Dreyer was most accurate in describing her performance as nothing short of 'the martyr's reincarnation.' One need not be religious to understand what is meant or to feel for Joan as portrayed so humanely and exquisitely by Falconetti. Her face is beyond the realm of haunting, and Dreyer seers it into the audience's memory along with other stunning imagery like a window frame's shadow turning into a cross on the floor, worms crawling through a skull unearthed from a freshly dug grave, or a bored executioner barely able to hold up his head in the company of his torture devices. And then there's the burning at the stake and the brutal suppression of the peasant riot--unimaginable horrors rendered so beautifully and hyper realized onto a series of moving images projected onto a blank screen.The genius of Dreyer's visuals and Falconetti's performance is that they create a deep psychological complexity that can engage a modern viewer on multiple levels. In their bold suggestions and through the artistic integrity of their respective crafts, Dreyer and Falconetti leave it to their audience (weather it be a French nation still celebrating and mythologizing their 15th century hero Joan a mere eight years after her canonization in 1920 or a more skeptical 21st scholar studying the history of film) to decide the veracity of Joan's convictions. Was Joan truly a mystic, a martyr, a saint? Or was she simply mad and the unfortunate victim of the time period in which she lived and died? Either way, she is presented here as human. And in relating to her, one thing is for sure: the mysticism of film was realized by the Dane Carl Dreyer and Maria Falconetti in the year 1928 with 'The Passion of Joan of Arc.'",10,9,12,7 June 2008
Gone Baby Gone," Masterfully Crafted Descent into White Trash Hell
","In some ways, 'Gone Baby Gone' plays like a horror film. It depicts a seedy world full of drug dealers, murderers, corrupt cops, pedophiles, child killers, and down-on-their-luck Bostonians trapped in an urbanized 'white trash' hell where the two African-American characters, a Haitian drug lord and a noble police chief (Morgan Freeman), wield the most power from opposite sides of the law. Director Affleck showers his hometown with humanistic shots of everyday people milling about, seemingly minding their own business, while their world decays and rots around them. The socio-political subtexts of 'Gone Baby Gone' tick quietly like a time-bomb underneath the surface of an otherwise rote crime flick about the race to find a missing four year-old girl. I imagine this deep, dark, and morally questionable under-pinning is what has kept mainstream audiences from connecting with the film while critics have hailed it as a masterpiece.Adapted from a Dennis Lehane novel (author of the similarly themed and depressing 'Mystic River'), 'Gone Baby Gone' is masterfully crafted from the opening shot to the closing scene. Ben Affleck proves to be a far better talent behind the screen than in front of it, and while the casting of his younger brother in the lead role may seem like nepotism, Casey Affleck gives a richly complex performance as the private eye who uncovers the truth behind the kidnapping of the little girl. The dialog, strung poetically with grim and vulgar Bostonian street-talk, reminded me of 'Good Will Hunting.' With Ben Affleck credited as a co-screenwriter here, this film disproves the popular myth that Matt Damon (or an unnamed third party) was the primary force behind their Oscar-winning screenplay for 'Good Will Hunting.' Like the best of the actors-turned-directors (Robert Redford, or 'Mystic River' maestro Clint Eastwood), Ben Affleck is able to get his cast to deliver amazingly rich performances oozing with pathos. Ed Harris, who sometimes over-acts in one-note fashion, is a powerhouse as the lead officer on the case and delivers quite possibly the best performance of his career; his character's seething rage and fractured view of justice will leave you literally shaking. Amy Ryan, as the strung-out mother of the girl, delivers the type of pitch-perfect portrayal that the Supporting Actress Oscar was tailor made for. Casey Affleck, following his great turn in 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford' shows that he is an actor to be reckoned with, raw and emotive, and equal or superior in many ways to contemporaries like Ryan Gosling. Older brother Ben is such an actor's director, he even manages to deliver a heartbreaking scene towards the end where Michelle Monaghan (in the otherwise thankless role of girlfriend and partner to the male lead) displays a range you didn't see coming.For the acting, for the dialog, for the intricately complex and devastating crime drama that unfolds, and yes, for the directing, 'Gone Baby Gone,' as depressing a piece of subversion as it is, ranks as one of the year's very best.",9,4,9,29 October 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," Bourne Again Fan
","'The Bourne Ultimatum' begins recklessly mid-chase and in pulse-pounding fashion explodes from there as Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, absolutely superb) tracks down the masterminds behind the CIA black-ops that turned him into the perfect killer in a final attempt to learn his true identity. A devastatingly icy David Strathairn as the 'man behind the curtain' is added to the returning cast of regulars including Joan Allen (excellent) and Julia Stiles (non-existent).Like the second entry in the series, I wished Paul Greengrass' shaky hand-held camera would go static at least for the few minutes of downtime. However, that being said, it's a perfect way to capture the tense, claustrophobic feel of the intimate hand-to-hand-combat scenes and works equally well in the chase scenes which are mostly on foot and across rooftops with the occasional big car pile-up. Part of the fun of the Bourne series is the constant globe-hopping and manipulation of technology and communications that seem to defy the laws of physics and current capabilities. The Bourne films seem to exist in some sort of gritty hyper-reality that is full of technological-based magic. It makes no sense that everyone seems to be just in the right place at the right time, but I'll be damned if it isn't a blast to watch them get there.With the absence of the emotive and involving Franka Potente, the writers attempt to create some emotional connection between Damon and Stiles, but she is so blank-faced an actress it never really leads to anything. Still, this can be forgiven, for unlike the 'Identity' and the 'Supremacy', this 'Ultimatum' reveals all and we finally learn the truth about Bourne's past. It's an entertaining and satisfying conclusion to the series, and if they have any good sense, and Damon gets his wish, this will be the perfect end to it.",8,144,208,7 August 2007
Fargo," The Ultimate Coen Brothers' Movie and one of the Best Films Period
","Here's the brilliant duality of 'Fargo.' You can watch it as so many claim it is to be intended, as a comedy, and thoroughly enjoy yourself (I especially love when Marge is interrogating the girls from the bar). However, was this really how the film was intended to be viewed? This is an inherent problem with many Coen brothers' films. Their movies are always so lovingly filmed, meticulously crafted, and beautifully photographed, that you are often shocked that they seem to treat their characters and stories with such a light handed and often mocking touch. 'Blood Simple' and 'Miller's Crossings' were the dramatic exceptions (no doubt, these are not comedies) and 'Raising Arizona,' 'The Big Lebowski,' and 'Oh, Brother Where Art Thou?' operate at the other end of the spectrum (these are all great comedies). All of their other films fall oddly in between. This 'Fargo' is probably the strangest as it claims to be inspired by true events and follows many of the same dramatic twists as 'Blood Simple.' Yes, I think we are supposed to laugh at the accents, and Jerry Lundegard (as played so brilliantly by William H. Macy) is so inept at everything and such a weaselly prick you can't help but laugh. But 'Fargo' is also operating on some higher level as an archetypal battle between good and evil (law abiding citizens making an honest living and criminals killing for money). I have no doubt that Marge Gunderson (the pitch perfect Frances McDormand) is supposed to be viewed as a heroine of the most noble order. In the end there is justice, and Marge dispenses to our captured killer the moral of it all while taking him away in the police car. 'There's more to life than that (referring to money).' Dontchya know? And isn't that the moral we all need to be reminded of in this capitalist society? Dontchya know indeed.",10,0,0,4 March 2003
The Aviator," An Interesting Muddle
","'The Aviator'--a biopic of Howard Hughes-- is clearly one of Scorsese's lesser works. Still, a lesser work from Scorsese is far superior to the greatest work of your average director. Here's the rundown:The first quarter of the film is a total triumph, showing the young Hughes' bold endeavors in film when he produced what was at the time the most expensive and lavish film ever made. Scorsese tipping his hat to old Hollywood is the most fun he has had since 'Goodfellas.' The costumes, set designs, and pacing of this portion of the film are stunning and suck the viewer in.The rest of the film, despite Scorsese's amazing and vivid attention to detail, is a muddled mess, giving us glimpses into Hughes' obsessive (and compulsive) ways, his womanizing, his ambitious foray into aviation and the early days of commercial flight, his fight against Congress at the end of WWII, and the notorious plight and ultimately single flight of his infamous 'Spruce Goose.' It's all semi-educational and semi-entertaining, but in the end I think the complicated life of Hughes remains a mystery.As for the performances, they are amazing (thanks in most part to Scorsese, the ultimate actor's director). Leonardo Dicaprio in the title role gives yet another performance that goes against my natural loathing of him, and although he seems a bit too boyish playing Hughes in the latter years (and the film really suffers for it), he's impeccable for the better part of the film. Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn is simply stunning and steals every moment she is on screen. Her look, her mannerisms, and her speech perfectly match the screen legend to a haunting degree. Alan Alda and Alec Baldwin in supporting quasi-villain roles are methodically perfect. And the nicest surprise was Kate Beckinsale, a normally flaccid actress, playing Ava Gardner. She came across as gorgeous, intelligent, and maximized her minimal screen time without ever overtly stealing her scenes. Like Sharon Stone in 'Casino' and Cameron Diaz in 'Gangs of New York' Scorsese once again coaxes a great performance out of an otherwise unremarkable pretty face. In the end, 'The Aviator' flies high thanks to Scorsese and the acting, even if the real person it depicts remains lost in a muddle of half truths and speculation.",8,96,142,22 January 2005
Burn After Reading," The Coens Take a Hatchet to their League of Morons
","The Coen Brothers' 'Burn After Reading' is one of those movies with a farcical and convoluted plot involving idiotic one-up-manship that is essentially an excuse for the filmmakers to poke fun and for their stars to have a great time doing silly bits. Here our zany Brothers return to one of their favorite themes: what happens when simpletons get in way over their heads with a cynical league of morons. Clooney, McDormand, Malcovich, Swinton, and especially Pitt, all whip out their best comedic timing and smarmy facial expressions in this tale of misguided blackmail and bumbling counter-intelligence. Unlike their last two comedic travesties (the barely there 'Intolerable Cruelty' and the wacko 'Ladykillers'), the Coens' focus is sharper and crueler in this 'Reading' and pointed directly at the government, society, themselves and their audience.I've seen four out of the last five Coen Brothers' films in crowded theaters where their faithful often laugh out of turn at some of the most unfunny of moments. 'Burn After Reading' has plenty of those moments, as well as some truly funny ones, but one has to wonder why such a talented pair would shoot so low as to desire the elicitation of that 'solo' laughter from the loons in the audience that constitute the filmmakers' personal league of morons. When Clooney's hardwood floor-loving womanizer unveils his 'special project' to McDormand's plastic-surgery obsessed internet speed dater, it's a hilarious anti-climax to what had been a long build-up in previous scenes that had the whole crowd groaning and giggling. But isn't Clooney's rear-entry sexual-aid device a bit emblematic of how the Coens' have been treating their audience lately? Later, when Malcovich's alcoholic ex-CIA analyst literally takes a hatchet to another character, it again elicits uproars, but I couldn't help but think the Coens' were symbolically taking out their frustration on the faithful who have been befuddled by their recent offerings. We're a cynical bunch, and so are the Coens, and whether they see themselves as the simpletons in over their heads and their audience as the league of morons, or vice versa, is never clear.At least with this slow 'Burn' we don't have to deal with the pretentious philosophical ruminations of their literary bound and insanely overrated Oscar-winner, 'No Country for Old Men'. While this might not recapture the pure joy of their original dark comedy, 'Raising Arizona', this star-studded and occasionally hilarious 'Burn After Reading' is the Coen Brothers' most entertaining film in years, even if we're all a little more bruised from the wear.",7,7,13,14 September 2008
The Orphanage," Beautifully Sad Catholic Fairy Tale
","Laura (Belen Rueda) returns to the orphanage she spent time in as a child with her husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) and little boy Simon (Roger Princep) in hopes of re-establishing it as seaside retreat for children with disabilities only to find there may be some former residents who never left. In Juan Antonio Bayona's tightly wound 'The Orphanage' nothing is as it seems and child's play takes on sinister overtones.Bayona belongs to this new wave of Spanish-language directors (most notably Del Torro and Amenabar) who excel when it comes to creating moody atmospheric tales of the supernatural with Catholic overtones. Whereas 'Pan's Labyrinth' took a dark fantasy approach to a Passion Play, 'The Orphanage' is closer to the classic haunted house themes of 'The Others' as it attempts to give a sentimental view of life after death. Be warned, 'The Orphanage' is often more sad than scary, and those not familiar with Catholic mysticism might find things a bit hard to believe. As goes the film's mantra...Believe, Then You Will See. Those with the patience and the heart will be greatly rewarded as the audience doesn't necessarily have to Believe to relate to the characters who do.Working from refined 'less is more' psychological horror templates, Bayona delivers the formulaic goods. There will be a simplistic but heartfelt exploration of grief. There will be allusions to classic literature (in this case a very nicely done 'Peter Pan' as Catholic allegory motif). There will be uncovering dark secrets from the past. There will be precocious children with spooky imaginary friends. There will be creaking set designs and manipulative sound effects to create 'gotcha!' moments. There will be a creepy medium (an excellent Geraldine Chaplin) brought in for a s√©ance. And there will be a twist at the end.Thankfully, there is also a great performance from Belen Rueda as Laura. She gives a compelling portrayal of a woman devoured by her loss and achingly desperate for the truth no matter how horrific that truth might be. One must have a cold heart not to find sympathy with her, and even the most hardened audience member will find it hard not to feel that stray tear form in the corner of their trembling eye when all is revealed. 'The Orphanage' offers nothing terribly new, but sometimes the same old ghost story presented in a beautiful way makes for the best type of cold-rainy-day entertainment.",8,108,145,14 January 2008
The Shining," Kubrick Lite still Makes for One of the Best Horror Movies Ever
","When you compare this film adaptation of King's hack novel to other films from Kubrick ('2001' or 'Clockwork Orange'), there really isn't much depth here.  The stuff is pretty straight forward.  Family shacks up at haunted hotel and dad goes nuts and tries to ax everyone.  Still it's pretty damn scary because Kubrick films it like a work of art (the aerial shots of mountains and the Overlook are haunting to say the least, as are the creepy interior shots of the hotel), and he sets the mood so well (there's an underlying sense of doom sleeping beneath the slow pace and cold feel to the film).  This film has aged very well, and is often sighted by fans and critics alike as one of the best horror movies ever made (even if it is Kubrick's slightest film).  The reason I think it has held up so well over time is because it can be watched on two levels.  You can take it all very seriously and creep yourself out big time, or you can enjoy it tongue-in-cheek and howl over Nicholson's over the top performance, Shelley Duval's incompetent whining, and the flat out weirdness of it all (dead old naked lady laughing in bathtub, blood flooding out of elevators, a little boy driving a Big Wheel down the haunted halls of the Overlook).  Let it give you nightmares, and then get your revenge by playing a drinking game to it the next time you watch it.",10,1,3,26 July 2003
American Beauty," Smart, Subversive, Contrived, and Forever Open for Debate
","'American Beauty' is one of those rare and audacious films that begs the question, 'what defines art?'  I don't think there is a film that received better pre-release hype, more overwhelming praise when it was released, and more cries of 'FINALLY!' when it swept the Oscars.  Yet it has spawned some of the most heated backlash of any film in recent memory.  Does the fact that it has created so much debate make it art?  Maybe. 
This is a film that subverts the traditional American ideal of suburban life.  The moments of 'conversation' at the dinner table are both the most horrific and funniest moments ever put to film.  They resonate at both ends of the spectrum because they ring so true.  Who hasn't been a part of or witnessed such tantrums at the dinner table, a place where families are supposed to connect and rejoice in their everyday life?  Does this type of subversion define art?  Maybe.This is a film that was very deliberate in its direction.  Plastic bags and rose petals have never been more beautifully shot, or more pretentious. Suburban streets have never looked this good, and white picket fences never whiter.  But again, there's something crackling under the veneer, both of this film, and of the life it depicts.  Is this what art is supposed to do? I think so.The performances are phenomenal from Spacey and Benning.  The script is ultra smart and ultra clever, but in the end probably too contrived.  Was the message of the film that our 'American dream' is also too contrived, just like this movie?  Or was the message that even suburban schmucks like Lester Burnham deserve a chance to live out an authentic life of their own choosing?  We may never know.  I actually think that twenty or thirty years from now this movie will be looked upon as one of the all time greats by critics, with the then modern-day audiences perplexed and asking, 'why?' That, my friends, is art.",10,0,0,6 March 2003
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," The Wrong Movie Bombed
","When young Dewey Cox accidentally cuts his brother in half with a machete, it sets him on a long, hard, and winding road that traverses the most profoundly important moments in modern music history spanning the 1950's to today. 'Walk Hard' was erroneously advertised as yet another comedic romp from Judd Apatow. While as the co-screenwriter here many of Apatow's trademarks can be found including the usual sophomoric sexual humor and ironic pop-culture references, 'The Dewey Cox Story' is actually closer in spirit to the mocumentaries of Christopher Guest ('This is Spinal Tap!' and 'Best in Show') as channeled through the spastic colon of the 'Naked Gun' films.This is a parody played hilariously straight. The target of its mockery is so succinct and sharply pointed--the recent Oscar-winning musical biopics 'Ray' and 'Walk the Line'--that the film's true comedic genius may be lost on people who didn't really pay attention to those films or thought this would just be another 'Superbad.' The film's mimesis of its source materials is so spot-on, that it even follows their same cadence and nearly falls apart midway as it glosses over many points in history and aspects of the musician's life while covering every clich√© possible from the temptations of life on the road with drugs and groupies to bouts in rehab and bitter divorces to long dry periods that suddenly make way for life-altering inspiration.At the center of 'Walk Hard' is John C. Reilly who sings and acts his heart out to hilarious effect. A former Oscar nominee for 'Chicago', Reilly has since cut a niche for himself as the second banana to bigger comedy stars like Will Ferrell in 'Talladega Nights' and for the first time gets a film to call his own. Tim Meadows is shockingly funny as the friend who ushers in Cox's decent into drug use (his overly accentuated but still deadpan line deliveries are priceless), while Jenna Fishcher is sprite and lovely as the June Carter cutie to Cox's Johnny Cash wannabee. Other SNL players including Kristin Wiig and Chris Parnell and Apatow alumni like Paul Rudd (as John Lennon!) and Jonah Hill pop in and out of the film amidst an onslaught of funny sight-gags and one-liners. Also in on the fun is a cavalcade of current music stars including the lead singer of the White Stipes as Elvis and Eddie Vedder as himself doing a nonsensical quasi-spiritual riff on Cox's legacy while presenting a Lifetime Achievement Award.The heart of 'Walk Hard' is in the music. If you were to not listen so closely, you might be fooled into thinking these were actual hit songs from their respective time periods. Of course, listening to the lyrics is part of the fun. The ridiculously silly double-entendres in Cox's duet with his honey-to-be Darlene are especially funny, while I personally found their spoof of a Bob Dylan song to be downright brilliant. Since the writers took the time to be so verbose and intricate with their nonsensical free-form versing, they allowed the bit to work on multiple levels as both an homage and a biting jab at Dylan's alleged lyrical genius.Utimately 'Walk Hard', in ways both monumentally stupid and unfathomably smart, proves to be almost too clever for its own good. It may have bombed in it's first-run at the box office, but I would imagine it will eventually find its audience. In one pivotal early scene Cox begs his wife to believe in him and his dreams of becoming a successful singer. She replies something to the effect of, 'Oh, baby, I do. I just believe you're gonna fail.' I couldn't have said it better myself, and it still has me laughing.",8,110,131,28 December 2007
Van Helsing," Jane Austen's 'Destroy All Monsters!'
","This film is a brilliant and psychologically complex treatise on Victorian era social mores as seen through the eyes of Van Helsing, a rapscallion character who overcomes his impoverished beginnings to climb the social ladder and eventually reach the pinnacle of high society. It's his cockeyed optimism that allows him to go from rags to riches with an almost Dickensian charm, but in classic irony normally suited for Shakespearan tragedy it is also that very trait the leads him on a path to danger and horror. There's also brilliant social satire as seen through the colorful characters from Transylvania, who bring both shock and scathing black humor in their representation of the nomadic, exotic outsiders than so many proper Victorians feared would infiltrate and poison their gilded society.Just kidding, of course. 'Van Helsing' is wall to wall special effects and hammy acting dancing across poorly lit set designs. Classic movie buffs are turned off in the first few minutes with the over-the-top alleged 'homage' to the black and white Universal horror flicks. The plot is arbitrary and pointless, though with so much going on and Kate Beckinsale in tight corsets, I suppose this does have some entertainment value for ten year-old boys. I watched this one rainy Saturday afternoon and left twice to clean my bathroom and mop my kitchen floor, and I didn't miss a thing.",2,41,78,22 October 2005
Being John Malkovich," One of a Kind
","This is quite possible the most blissfully unique and weird film ever made this side of the Atlantic ocean. Even if this head trip ultimately leaves you confused and bewildered how can you not have been entertained by a movie where the main character is a neurotic puppeteer, people work at an office on the 7th 1/2 floor (the ceilings and overhead are really low!), people who travel through John Malcovich's head are unceremoniously dropped on the side of the New Jersey turnpike, we meet a chimp with post traumatic stress disorder, and a woman with a PhD in psycholinguistics who can't understand a word anybody says? This film also gets kudos for the most creative use of a quasi-lesbian subplot ever conceived for film. And don't worry, this isn't just weird for weirdness' sake (and neither is the other Jones/Kaufman collaboration, 'Adaptation' a far more serious look at the horrors of imagination, the creative process, and the Hollywood studio system). Fun, smart, clever, weird, and thought provoking, pseudo-absurdest-comedy/dramas don't get any better than this.",9,1,2,4 March 2003
Jarhead," 'We are still in the Desert...'
","It's that haunting final line of 'Jarhead' that pierces the viewer most. Sam Mendes' superb adaptation of Anthony Swofford's novel is the best and most artistically astute 'grunts-eye-view' of modern warfare since Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket.' Mendes successfully does for Desert Storm what Kubrick did for Vietnam.We are provided here with a full array of the varied types of men (the bored, those looking for a way out, the slightly crazy thrilled at the chance to blow things up and kill people, those with some vague sense of the honor serving one's country has brought to generations past) who go to war, and how in the end 'All wars are different, but all wars are the same.' Expertly displayed here is the utter futility of our modern wars in the Middle East. Most of the film's runtime is dedicated to the boredom the Marines experience as they train endlessly in the desert to fight some distant enemy that never really shows his face. The war is quick and the men are sent home without ever firing a shot at the enemy, yet, as it is so beautifully noted, 'We are still in the desert' and men and women are still being sent to fight a war for what....oil? Oh, and the oil is beautifully on display here, lit up at night across the desert sands and raining down on soldiers and corpses alike with wanton abandon. Cinematographer Roger Deakins takes over nicely for the late Conrad Hall as Sam Mendes cohort in capturing jaw-droppingly beautiful cinematic compositions and painting them on the big screen.Some have complained that 'Jarhead' lacks an emotional core, but I dare you to find more emotional scenes than Jake Gyllenhaal coughing up a mountain of sand in a frenzied nightmare, Peter Sarsgaard cowering in the tower in the midst of a psychological breakdown after not being allowed to take the sniper shot he has been training endlessly to take, or one of the final scenes where a nameless Vietnam vet hops aboard the bus as the Marines come home to cheers and a parade in a sad and haunted attempt to experience the hero's welcome he never received for his war.All war movies are not the same, and this one is a bitter cut above the rest.",8,20,33,8 November 2005
Collateral," Near Perfect L.A. Crime Story
","Watching Michael Mann's 'Collateral' gave me some of the same feelings I had when first watching David Lynch's 'Mullholand Drive.'  Yes, Mann may go astray and deliver us a 'Last of the Mohicans' or 'Ali' every once in awhile (just as Lynch gives us the rare 'Elephant Man' or 'Straight Story') but let's face it, he's a niche director, and Mann's niche is crime stories, particularly ones taking place in Los Angeles.  David Lynch is best at directing David Lynch movies and Michael Mann is best at directing crime thrillers in the city of angels.So, here we have a director basking in the glory of what he does best (I loved the lighting, the cityscapes, the eclectic music choices, the camera angles, and even the digital photography which for the first time in my book was put to appropriate and artistic use here).  We also have the biggest movie star on the planet, Tom Cruise, relishing in a chance to go against type and play a ruthless, yet somehow endearing hit-man.  And thirdly we have a star-making turn from Jamie Foxx as the not so hapless cabbie who has the misfortune of picking up Cruise's fare, also going against type and excelling in a dramatic performance when so many people know him only from his comedic turns.  It's so rare to get such a trifecta out of a movie, and to top it off we have Jada Pinkett-Smith as a lawyer looking more stunning and beautiful than she ever has and sparking some genuine chemistry with Foxx.  Yes, it gets a bit predictable in the end, and it might not be the epic that Mann's 'Heat' was, but along the way we get treated to the best choreographed shoot-out in recent memory, some genuine chemistry amongst big stars, thoughtful dialogue, and classy suspense.  All in all, it was the best time I had at the movies this summer.",9,0,0,25 August 2004
The Machinist," A Holocaust of the Mind
","From the camera angles and cinematography to the Bernard Hermann inspired score, this is clearly an ode to Hitchcock, and a damn good one at that. Christian Bale plays a lonely factory worker whose life is slowly unraveling due to lack of sleep. In his disoriented state of half waking/half sleep, nightmarish paranoia and a creepy mystery lead our protagonist careening down a highway to damnation...or perhaps salvation.There's lots of clever little nods to things both literary and Hollywood. Shades of 'Memento,' 'Fight Club,' and David Lynch abound, but what helps this film rise above a simple amalgamation of previous efforts in the genre is the go-for-broke performance from Bale. He literally made himself look like a Holocaust victim for the sake of the art. 'If you were any thinner you wouldn't exist,' people keep telling him. Physically, emotionally, and mentally, a man riddled by guilt has never before been more blazingly presented on screen.",8,8,13,6 August 2005
Quantum of Solace," Bond Back in Action
","As one of the few people who thought that 'Casino Royale' was just okay, I found its action-packed sequel 'Quantum of Solace' to be genuinely entertaining. The film picks up exactly where the last one left off, but thankfully leaves its predecessor's bloated sense of self-importance and run-time behind. Thanks to the tone set previously by Daniel Craig, this Bond maintains the darker hard edge. Directed with appropriate kinetic zeal by Marc Forster, the film never lets up and takes Bond away from that all that silly deep introspection and returns him to pure action while still playing a strong hand with its 'this time its personal' theme.There's really not much more to say about such an indomitable franchise. Of course, in an attempt to appeal to audiences who have preferred Jason Bourne over James Bond in recent years, some of the action has a slap-dash over-edited feel, but never in a Bourne film would you find exploding planes and death-defying stunts involving every mode of transportation except by train. 'Quantum of Solace' also suffers from one of the worst Bond themes and opening credit sequences ever, but really, who cares about that? The bottom line: Craig is as cold as ice and the action and the women are smoldering hot. 'Quantum of Solace' successfully serves up a healthy dose of Bond-fueled entertainment that will leave you shaken but not stirred.",7,5,10,15 November 2008
Gone with the Wind," Not a history lesson in the Civil War...but a history lesson in Film
","It's almost impossible to write a review for what is arguably the best known (if not greatest) and most watched, reviewed, critiqued, and studied film in the history of Hollywood.  Without comparing it to any other of the landmark films in studio history, which like this one, almost always seem to be gloriously overblown quasi-historical romantic melodramatic epics (i.e. 'Birth of a Nation' or eckkkk 'Titanic'), as it is, this is a monstrously schizophrenic mess of a movie (which I suspect has to do with switching directors in mid-production).  Everything is over the top and over reaching and over long, but I'll be damned if it isn't entertaining every bit of the way throughout its engaging four hours.  This is the ultimate example of how powerful the studio machine was in the heyday of Hollywood, in that it could turn an overblown, overbudget heap of celluloid into an 'event' that still stands the test of time as a testament to possibilities of movies as an art form.",10,1,2,24 February 2003
No Country for Old Men," Blood, not so Simple
","A Vietnam vet (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon a drug deal gone wrong and casually takes off with two million dollars that a psychopathic bounty hunter (Javier Bardem) will do anything to get back. Meanwhile, a Sheriff nearing retirement (Tommy Lee Jones) strolls behind the mayhem always a few steps behind. Set in Texas in 1980, 'No Country for Old Men' is a meticulously crafted misfire from the Coen Brothers and adapted for the screen from the Cormac McCarthy novel.Roger Deakin's stark cinematography matches perfectly the brilliant mise-en-scene and signature Coen Brothers' pacing. The audience is also treated to a revolving door of quirky side characters and dark deadpan humor in the dialog that have become the trademarks of a Coen Brothers' dramatic production. It would seem to be a return to form, but there's a wandering coldness to the film that leads to grave dissatisfaction.The most disappointing aspect is that there's a near perfect forty-five minute 'mini film' riddled with white knuckle suspense involving the cat-and-mouse shoot-em-up between Bardem and Brolin that is lost inside yet another dour opus where Tommy Lee Jones plays a grizzled but good-hearted authority figure philosophizing about the sad state of the world for the umpteenth time. While Bardem and Brolin are sensational, Tommy Lee Jones seems to be playing an on-screen persona that has trumped his ability to show any type of range. He's typecast, and his character is made moot. Meanwhile Bardem gives a career-defining performance as the psychopath working with his own warped sense of morals. In what may prove to be ironic in the future, it's exactly the type of portrayal that risks making Bardem typecast in the same vein Anthony Hopkins was after his Hannibal Lecter character was born.The brooding tension built around Bardem's unforgettable villain and the inevitable showdown with Brolin's wayward cowboy is completely wasted in anti-climactic fashion with no resolution that leaves the film to meander in philosophies that ultimately signify nothing. Coming off three straight comedies (the last two of which, 'Intolerable Cruelty' and 'The Ladykillers', were abysmal) the Coen Brothers have clearly lost their footing in trying to get back to their roots. 'No Country for Old Men' boasts many of their popular hallmarks and an instantly classic turn from Javier Bardem, but it lacks the moral fiber of 'Fargo' and the dramatic climax of 'Blood Simple'. Coming home, it seems, isn't as easy as it looks when the roads are dusty and lead you nowhere.",6,20,38,12 November 2007
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," The Expectation of Applause
","'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford' is a handsomely mounted, film-school like study of the last days of the infamous James' Gang by director Andrew Dominik. Growing up in awe of Jesse James (Brad Pitt), Robert Ford (Casey Affleck) finally gets to live out his dream of living side by side with his idol when his brother, Charles (Sam Rockwell) joins the gang. Young Robert quickly learns that the exploits of the murderous train-robbers are far from the exciting flights of fancy he grew up reading about in newspapers and dime-store novels. A series of cowardly acts in the wake of double-crossings and humiliations ultimately lead to the titular event.The style of the film is often visually arresting and downright disturbing, especially in the acts of violence, which leave the most gruesome parts slightly off camera, but are frequently shot and framed in such a way as to maximize shock value and leave an uncomfortable feeling of tension in the theater seats. Dominik sometimes relies too heavily on voice-over narration torn straight from the book upon which the film is based leaving us to assume that aside from dreadfully beautiful photography of passing clouds and desolate Midwestern landscapes, he wasn't always sure how he visually wanted to tell the story. This leads to a sometimes snails' pace as the plot unfolds, though the haunting Oscar-worthy cinematography from Roger Deakins and mesmerizing music score from Nick Cave and Warren Ellis eventually get under your skin even as the hands of the clock seem to move slower as if stuck in a pretty photograph of a nightmare.The acting in the film is superb from all involved. However, the performances often blur the line between caricatured scenery-chewing and emotional nuance (especially from Pitt and Rockwell). While there is some entertainment to be found in the lighter scenes of camaraderie amongst the gang members, the audience never really feels anything for the characters aside from sharing their sense of paranoia and fear knowing that around any corner someone will be betrayed and shot. The film also suffers from some scene stealing cameos from James Carville as the governor hell-bent on catching Jesse and the otherwise lovely Zooey Deschanel, who appears out of nowhere for a few moments about ten minutes after the film should have rightfully ended.When the credits finally rolled, I wasn't sure what to make of the film. There's some unforgettable imagery (my personal favorite being the almost surreal depiction of the cloth-masked robbers waiting in the dark woods as the train comes roaring down the tracks), and many commendable artistic elements to be found in the film. If the idea was to leave the audience feeling the era showcased was a tension-riddled and violently lonely existence, then the film succeeded wonderfully. Those seeking a more pure entertainment will most assuredly be left stressed and stretched to their limits.",7,133,230,6 October 2007
Batman Begins," Dark Knight Rising
","I've been wondering how director Christopher Nolan would handle a huge budget on a Hollywood film designed as a revisionist franchise launcher of a previously lucrative and iconic brand name. It had disaster written all over it. I'm overjoyed to announce, the young director has stuck to his auteur guns and delivered not another ho-hum comic book extravaganza, but a deep, dark, psychologically complex thriller. Nolan and his very capable team of writers hired by Warner Bros. have taken the simplistic and tired story from comic book land (your archetypal crime-fighting costume wearing hero) and through luxurious exposition and compelling character development, deliver a taut and suspenseful drama for mature adult audiences to savor.In the lead role of Bruce Wayne, Christian Bale finally delivers on the promise of his compelling indie roles and has taken his cult status to mainstream audiences with a confident swagger that has 'great actor/huge star' written all over it. Bravo to the studio execs in their risky casting. He works this role on every level, and the audience is rewarded at every turn under the skilled director's hand of Nolan. The rest of the supporting cast is fantastic. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Tom Wilkinson, Cillian Murphy, and an unrecognizable Gary Oldman as Gordon (what a great piece of stunt casting) are all perfect. The only complaint is the otherwise lovely Katie Holmes, who is as distracting on screen with her lack of acting chops as she has been off screen with her shenanigans as the new Mrs. Tom Cruise.The only other distraction is some of the choppy editing in a few of the actions scenes. Early on, they are so darkly lit and badly edited that it's hard to tell what is happening. This is all forgiven though with the white knuckle Batmobile chase sequence and the edge-of-your seat careening train car finale. As far as I'm concerned, I don't care if Nolan didn't focus on making the action scenes more perfect. He's clearly a man more interested in setting a mood to highlight character development and ratchet up the drama. He's quickly developing into a master of psychologically driven suspense. He just might be able to inject life into some other stale genres in the future.When all is said and done, the greatest achievement of 'Batman Begins' is that it makes you forget the weird dystopia of Tim Burton's iconic original from 1989, and totally wipes from your memory the abhorrent Joel Schumacher directed sequels that sank the series in the late 1990's. Thanks to Nolan, the writers, and Bale, this film stands tall on its own, and should weather the test of time as inevitable sequels will come to pass.",9,6,9,16 June 2005
The Pianist," Haunting, Timeless, Unforgettable, Uplifting...One for the Ages
","Although not nearly as epic and emotionally devastating as 'Schindler's List', Roman Polanski's deeply personal 'Pianist' is by many measures a greater film and a work of true cinematic art. Haunting, cold, and austere where other films are sentimental and clich√©d; true to the horrors of human existence where other films play for shock and gore; poignantly quiet where other films are overwhelmed by a swelling music score; darkly comic where other films don't even dare speak a word; and universally compelling where other films are specific and preachy (though a fact based Holocaust tale, this could have been anyone's tale of triumph over the horrors of man's brutality towards each other and could speak to a tribal warrior in Somalia or Palestinian separatist just as much as it does to a Jew from Poland). This is a film deeply rooted in the ethereal realm of the timeless artistic representation of man's struggle against adversity and our innate will to survive.I can't remember the last time I watched a film and was so transported into the world the director created (I think only 'Mulholland Drive' has done this for me in recent years) and yet was so aware of the artistic nature of it all. I don't think I've ever sat through a film before and thought during so many scenes 'this is one for the ages.' My personal favorite scenes are the shot of the snow covered street running through a bombed out post-apocalyptic Warsaw and the eerily poetic shot of the German officer standing by the car on that very street at night underneath the full moon while the sounds of the piano playing from a bombed out building break the serene silence. The seamless editing and style of direction are purely European old school, and work wonderfully to keep the viewer entranced and spellbound by the state of Poland during WWII and the state of man's soul during times of tribulation. Polanski, working possibly from his own memories of his childhood in Poland during the Holocaust as well as by the actual accounts of his protagonist, gives this powerful tale its heart through the details (i.e. the family sharing the caramel while waiting to be taken away to the death camps). I can imagine sitting through this film a dozen times and still not catching everything. Half of the time I wasn't even sure what some of the details meant (like when he was playing piano at the ghetto club and one of the patrons asked him to stop playing so he could hear the sounds some coins made when he flipped them on the tabletop). Polanski clearly respects his audience as well as his characters and story. Sometimes we have to figure it out for ourselves what was the purpose of a certain scene or certain piece of dialogue (like when the German officer remarks that Szpilman, which only people with knowledge of foreign languages would know means 'player,' is a very appropriate name for a pianist). It's this kind of attention to detail and respect for characters, setting, and audience alike that separate the good films from the great ones, and the movies from the works of art. This is a great work of art, and one of the greatest films of all time.",10,0,1,23 February 2003
Revolutionary Road," They'll Never Have Paris
","In one of the classiest pieces of stunt casting in recent years, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes reunites his wife, Kate Winslet, with her 'Titanic' shipmate Leonardo DiCaprio to play the Wheelers in his screen adaptation of Richard Yates' novel 'Revolutionary Road.' It adds an appealing accessibility to an otherwise depressing tale.The film opens boldly enough, spending just a few fleeting moments showing us how the Wheelers met before throwing us head first into their disaster of a marriage. April (Winslet) always had dreams of being an actress and Frank (DiCaprio), well, Frank always had some vague idea of living in Paris. The film chronicles their sad story. The Wheelers are meant to represent the post WWII generation who during the prosperous 1950's created suffocating lives due to dreams deferred in exchange for chasing the so-called 'American Dream' that they never really believed in. Everyone else in the film is in some sort of love with the Wheelers and their picture perfect lives, but the Wheelers hate themselves, each other, their neighbors, and what they have become. It's a damning little portrait that has been painted before in literature and film, but never quite so acutely.I haven't read Richard Yates' novel, but I am currently reading his collection of short stories which address many of the same themes and bear his hallmarks present here: cutting dialog, keen insights into the psyche of his sometimes despicable or just plain sad characters, and obsessive attention to details of time and place. In terms of the tone of Yates' writing, Mendes is successful in his translation. However, that tone that worked so well on the page doesn't always work on screen. We're never sure if we're meant to sympathize with the Wheelers or if Mendes wants us to view it as a dark comedy where we watch in sick delight as the popular kids who always thought they were more interesting than everyone else grow up to be horribly dysfunctional and cripplingly normal. Much of the audience I saw the film with laughed to break the tension during some of Mendes' trademarked 'uncomfortable dinner table scenes', but we all watched in horror as the film spun out of control into its downer of a climax.Ultimately one sits through a film like this for the acting, and it doesn't disappoint on that level. Taking a line from the film, DiCaprio is a 'cracker jack' playing for the first time a husband, a father, and a hopelessly average Joe. Winslet is on more familiar ground, but never has she been given so much range to roam, and her director husband lets her run wild and free. It's a neurotic, brave, and sometimes questionable performance that is a rare sight to behold. At times it seems as if Mendes is directing a stage-play rather than a film, and he lets the whole cast scream and holler against his finely detailed period backdrops, but it's still entertaining for those who enjoy watching polished professionals (including Michael Shannon portraying a man on leave from an insane asylum in a perfect pitch) stretch their acting muscles.One watches the grim dissolution of this marriage wondering if there isn't some subtext to explore with regards to Winslet and Mendes' own seemingly perfect Hollywood marriage. And as unlikable as they are at times, and no matter how much we would rather laugh at then relate to another human being, one can't escape the sickening feeling that there might be a little bit of Frank and April Wheeler in all of us.",8,5,10,3 January 2009
28 Days Later...," Brilliantly Conceived Zombie Holocaust Flick
","People......people who eat people.....are the luckiest people.....So what would happen if they crossed 'Night of the Living Dead' with 'Twelve Monkeys' and 'The Pianist' (yes! 'The Pianist!')? Well, here's your answer, and as you might expect, it ain't for everyone. Still, it's pretty f***ing brilliant no matter which way you cut it. The nifty little thing about Boyle, is that he really didn't make a zombie film. He's made a casualties of war survival film. Sure there's plenty of zombie gore to please the hardcore genre fans, and it comes early and in the bucket-loads. Also, to the film's advantage, all the gore is the old fashioned kind, i.e. there ain't no CGI here, folks (something that really hampered a film like 'Resident Evil').But real film fans will enjoy the emotional complexity, surprisingly engaging character development (which is way deeper than any horror film has the right to be) and the shocking 'survival at any costs' theme that undercuts the entire film. You'll be hard pressed to find a horror movie with more endearing or 'real' characters. Another refreshing aspect is that all of the humor (something every good horror movie needs in moderate doses) arises from realistic interactions amongst the characters. Nothing here is an 'in joke' or overtly self-aware (like 'Scream' and all its knockoffs). The film takes itself pretty seriously, and has some serious things to say about human nature and survival. When it gets down to it, how far would you go to survive? To protect your loved ones? To find hope? You had no right to expect a horror flick to be this deep or emotionally devastating....until now. Will horror films ever be the same? It's hard to tell so soon, and especially since the apocalyptic zombie stuff is so derivative (that will make it easy for detractors to dismiss the film). And while the herky-jerky digital camera work is used effectively here, it's another trend that most find annoying in films, and that could hurt how folks regard this movie in the future. I think it's got the long clean lines of a classic...but only time will tell...and as long as the zombies don't get us first.",8,0,0,30 June 2003
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," The Rise of Rupert Wyatt
","In only his second film, director Rupert Wyatt (in tandem with smarter than your average producers and the great Weta Digital Effects team) teaches a master course on how to do a reboot/origin story in a way only Christopher Nolan has previously been able to achieve.Skilled direction, a great performance by Andy Serkis as Caesar, emotionally involving character development, and a clever subversion of expectations help this Apes flick rise above the rest.Watch out for some plot holes, leaps of logic, a goofy James Franco, and a vacant Freida Pinto...but don't worry, you'll still enjoy the ride.Check out full reviews at theschleicherspin.com",9,7,14,9 August 2011
City of God," Required Viewing for any Film Enthusiast
","'City of God' is clearly one of the most aesthetically complex and viscerally charged motion pictures ever made. There are many scenes here for students of film to take great joy in simply in terms of aesthetics. The cinematography, editing, and pacing is inventive, mind-blowing and lovingly inspired by the best work of Scorsese. I could go on and on about the opening 'chicken run' sequence, 'Shaggy's' death scene, the disco shoot-out, or any number of other 'WOW' scenes of pure cinematic adrenaline.It's this kind of movie magic that breathes life into the myth of the 'greatest film of all time.'But be warned, as much as this film can be 'enjoyed', it is clearly far from the myth it jolts to life with its 'look, mom, no hands' style of film-making. It's also highly disturbing, more so than anything Scorsese has done. One sequence involving a child who couldn't be older than ten having to shoot another child who looks to be half his age as some sort of gang initiation is so slickly done I felt like I was watching a snuff film. Based on a true story about Brazilian slum dwellers and the crime waves overtaking the town, 'City of God' is an extremely hard pill to swallow as it wallows in violence, offers up a hearty dose of moral ambiguity, an almost pornographic take on the criminals it depicts, and leaves the viewer with no real solution or any sign of hope that this cycle can ever conceivably come to an end. The film seems to be saying that the only way to over-come such poverty and crime is to document it (witness our supposed hero who becomes a photographer). With its ultra-slick and highly addictive presentation, the film dupes unsuspecting viewers into witnessing all the depravity as well.",8,1,3,24 June 2004
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Amazing beyond words
","This is one of those films so awe-inspiring and amazing, that no rave review could do it justice.  Encased by a classically mythical story of warriors and heros and lovers and witches in ancient China, Ang Lee gives us the most beautifully choreographed fight scenes ever put to film.  This film has a lot to say about love and destiny and courage.  It has a quiet and ambiguous ending, and rightfully so.  You never thought action and fighting could be so artistic, you never thought myth could be so powerful in film form, and in the end I thought people could fly.  Bravo.",10,1,2,25 February 2003
The Lives of Others," To Know Everything...
","Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's 'The Lives of Others' is a searing portrait of East Germany in the early 1980's before the fall of the Berlin Wall. The era of paranoia, suppression of free speech, and total state control of everything and everyone is masterfully displayed here in the intertwining stories of the Stasi police officer, his morally questionable superiors, and the actress and playwright they are spying on. Once again, the German people's love affair with authoritarianism and meticulously detailed records is featured here as the most intimate details of these people's lives are examined and we see the quiet tragedies of their everyday life stemming from their bizarrely married desires for freedom and attempts to rationalize their place and survive in the State and the Socialist movement. Superb acting, an excellent music score, and no-frills direction keep the film taut, sparse, and utterly transfixing in its evolving melodrama.On an obvious surface level, 'The Lives of Others' is the most psychologically astute look at voyeurism since Hitchcock's 'Rear Window.' What makes the film compelling in its slow build up of tension and suspense, is that it is working on so many other levels. It can also be viewed as an allegory for the art of film making (or stage directing and writing) and the craft of acting, as we see the fractured psyche of the Stasi police officer--much like the blacklisted director character who commits suicide-- who so desperately wants to intervene and direct the troubling lives of those he surveys (the writer and actress--both wrestling with their own internal demons as their lives soon become not their own). So while it serves well as a timeless psychological case study into such minds, desires, and paranoia, it also functions as a very timely discussion about how much interference a government has the right to run into the lives of ordinary citizens.'The Lives of Others' suffers from one major flaw, which will not be discussed at length for fear of giving away some of its intricate plot twists and theatrical climaxes. In the end, the film misses the final beat as it runs about ten or fifteen minutes too long past what would've been two serviceable and profound endings to arrive at a series of closing scenes that are all too pat. The first two hours were so rife with dramatic irony and subtle tension, that it's a shame the film rolls on beyond what would've been a sublimely ironic and stark conclusion (that arrives at a most pivotal moment in world history). Still, there was so much multi-layered and engrossing minutiae in those first two hours that the film's ultimate brilliance can not be denied because of one false note.",8,11,19,26 February 2007
The Mist," Misanthropes in the Mist
","It's official: Stephen King and Frank Darabont hate humanity. It's almost impossible to fathom that these two were responsible for the life-affirming 'Shawshank Redemption' when you consider their last two collaborations: the covertly vile and morally misguided 'Green Mile' and now this bleak and hazy endeavor. Here they go back to King's roots in this horror tale of a mysterious mist that falls on a small town and the group of people trapped in a grocery store who must survive the monsters lurking in the fog. Leading the cast are Thomas Jane as the artistic everyman (a stock King character), Laurie Holden as the pretty school teacher, and Nathan Gamble as Jane's emotionally distraught little boy (another King archetype). Also along for the ride are Toby Jones as a spry and sensible grocery clerk, and Andre Braugher as an irate out-of-town lawyer.Darabont is a director of considerable skill, and it's pretty amazing what he is able to do with a small budget in his depiction of some truly horrifying monsters and well orchestrated bouts of gore. He builds suspense, creates likable characters to root for, and crafts a fun, scary ride for the better portion of the film. Like in all the best horror films, the creatures are symbolic for modern society's ills. Here the filmmakers explore the current 'culture of fear' that has been created in the wake of 9/11 by politicians and religious zealots. Like most of King's works, humans are even scarier than the creatures as seen in the character portrayed in great over-the-top style by Oscar winner Marcia Gay Harden. Her fire and brimstone preaching quickly divides those trapped in the grocery store down the lines of those who will be paralyzed by fear and turn to barbaric ways disguised as religion, and those who will do anything to fight for the right to survive. For the first one hour and forty-five minutes, the audience is treated to a well crafted, allegorical little monster flick, a throwback to those great creature features of the 1950's.*SPOILER ALERT!!!!! DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU PLAN TO SEE THE FILM WITH AN OPEN MIND!!!!!* With less than ten minutes to the credits rolling, Darabont decides to bash his political message into the back of our skulls with all the subtlety of the blunt side of an ax. 'The Mist' is impossible to talk about without talking about the ending. After keeping the nut-jobs at bay and effectively escaping the grocery story, five of the characters travel in relative safety inside a car to see how far the mist has conquered and if anyone else survived. With the mist still all enveloping, the car runs out of gas. Nothing Thomas Jane's character says or does (with the exception of promising his young son that he will never let the monsters get him) lead the audience to believe he would do what he does when it seems that all is lost. All throughout the movie he fights and overcomes his fear, yet at the last minute, without even a second-thought, he does the unthinkable with a gun, four bullets, and five people, and is left to wallow in his own misery. His character, and those other people in the car, didn't deserve that. Had he stayed true to his character, before agreeing to shoot everyone in the car after it ran out of gas lest the monsters savagely eat them, he would've stepped out of the vehicle to check things out one last time before giving up. Then he would've seen that the mist was now harmless and heard the army trucks coming. Or had the monsters come and eaten him, as they all feared, then there would still be the four bullets for the four left in the car. Instead we have to suffer through this complete betrayal and are left with images of the writer and director shaking their fingers at us, 'See, you idiots! This is what could happen if you buy into this culture of fear. You become the monsters!' Well, I don't buy it. Next time, boys, don't try to be so profound and just deliver us a good monster movie. We know you can you do it. You were so close here. You're really good at writing horror stories, Stephen, and you're an ace behind the camera, Frank, but sadly through 'The Mist' your disdain for mankind shines brighter than your collective talents.",6,8,20,27 November 2007
The Elephant Man," Stunning Artistic Depiction of One Man's True Life Story
","One of the rare times director David Lynch was a hired hand was for this beautiful true tale of John Merrick.  With its stunning black and white photography, great attention to detail, bleak but beautiful look at Victorian squalor, amazing make-up work, and wonderful performances from John Hurt as the titular victim of society and Hopkins as the doctor who eventually helps him, this is Lynch at the top of his game.  All the pieces come together here for one of the most bittersweet true stories ever put to film.  Anybody who thinks Lynch can't make a coherent and meaningful film need only look at this.  Horror and beauty are beautifully contrasted here and Lynch gets to the roots of our humanity.  One of the view films that made me cry.  A masterpiece.",10,2,2,18 March 2003
I Am Legend," I Am Overrated
","'I Am Legend,' an inexplicable remake of the Charlton Heston minor classic 'The Omega Man', posits itself as another mass-marketed star vehicle for the always likable Will Smith. Here the mega-star who can do no wrong plays the last man on earth (SPOILER: HE'S NOT!) after a nasty virus wipes out the world population and leaves behind some infected sourpusses in the vein of '28 Days Later'. This movie has all the key ingredients for a Will Smith box office behemoth (which no doubt it will be), but fails to engage on any higher level. Here's the recipe:1. Will Smith playing Will Smith: No other movie star can be such an egotistical show-off and get away with it as well as Will Smith does. No matter how many times we see him do his funny little bits, show off his buff bod, or watch him stretch his acting muscle with an unnecessary emotional breakdown scene, the audience still loves him. He carries 'I Am Legend' and makes it watchable even when he starts doing a 'Shrek' impersonation (don't ask) or carries on conversations with mannequins (think Tom Hanks and Wilson the volleyball from 'Cast Away').2. A futuristic setting: The set designers do a fantastic job here with a post-apocalyptic New York tableau that is expansive and eerie and will leave you wondering, 'How in blue blazes did they film that?' Sadly, the special effects team and creature designers didn't do a complimentary job. The zombie/vampire/whatever-the-heck-they-are monsters look like something from a second rate video game circa 1999. Given the PG-13 rating, they are only allowed a moderate amount of fun. Gore hounds and horror buffs will be greatly disappointed. Sci-fi fans will also be angered that after a decent set-up, the film devolves into a preachy messianic family-friendly death-fetish film.3. A kick-ass dog: Remember how everyone rooted for that dog from 'Independence Day?' Well, this German Sheperd named Sam puts that dog to shame. However, you know there's a problem when the dog becomes the most dynamic and sympathetic character in a film. I won't carelessly give away what happens to Sam in any explicit detail, but suffice it to say, when two non-characters named Anna and Ethan show up in the film's final moments, you'll be wishing Sam was there to keep it real.'I Am Legend' offers nothing new but is diverting enough as a matin√©e. In its depiction of a man and a dog in a post-apocalyptic city, it scores as populist entertainment. As a monster movie, it's a joke. As some sort of end-of-the-world message film, it's abhorrent. But with Will Smith headlining, expect it to be the biggest hit of the holiday season.",5,84,127,15 December 2007
Hero," A Feast for the Eyes
","I was never a fan of martial arts films until Ang Lee turned the action sequences into art with 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.' Here, with Yimou Zhang's epic 'Hero' we get the idea of action as art taken to a whole new level. The film has an interesting 'Roshomon' style of storytelling in weaving its tale of three proud warriors plotting to assassinate a tyrant, and it's more historical and epic where 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' was mythic and intimate. The visual palate is astounding. The use of colors is nothing short of amazing. The film's plot may not speak to your core, but there are lasting impressions here ingrained in the memory of your eyes: women in red sword fighting amongst swirling golden leaves, two men dancing across a crystal clear lake painting their sorrow with drops of water from their swords, rich tapestries falling to the palace floor as two fighters dart to and fro. The sumptuousness of the visuals are painstaking and almost make the viewer ache. The music, cinematography, and acting are all perfectly intertwined. Those who missed the film on the big screen may have missed out on a once in a lifetime experience. As good as the DVD transfer is, it just isn't the same overwhelming experience as seeing it where it was intended to be seen. Truly the kind of grand spectacle the movie gods had imagined when first creating the art form.",9,1,1,28 December 2004
The Hurt Locker," Bigelow Detonates All the Right Marks
","Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner) is the 'wild man' team leader who has defused more than eight hundred bombs and has built his reputation on being an adrenaline junkie in order to mask his inability to cope with the emotional connections he feebly tries to make at home and on the job. Sergeant JT Sandborn (Anthony Mackie) approaches his work with a by-the-book stoicism that can't comprehend the recklessness of James. Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) is highly trained but still feels overwhelmed by his morbid thoughts on war and his role in it. These are the members of the EOD Army bomb squad stationed in Baghdad in 2004, and 'The Hurt Locker' is their story.After failing to do so with the depressingly somber and serious 'In The Valley of Elah', screenwriter Mark Boal wisely places politics and moralizing aside this time to give us an intimate look into one squad with a highly specialized job to do. Hollywood has always loved to play with the grunt's-eye-view-of-war-as-hell theme, but 'The Hurt Locker' spins that volatile cocktail on its head and blows it up all over the screen by focusing on an elite team and proposes the notion that maybe war is a drug...for some.Director Kathryn Bigelow hits all the right detonators with her fascinating presentation of modern warfare in the Middle East. Bigelow hasn't really made anything memorable since her 1987 breakthrough, the cult vampire/western 'Near Dark', but she has always managed to make interesting failures-- just take a look at her attempt to do a literary adaptation with the superficially obtuse 'The Weight of Water'. Often living under the shadow of ex-husband James Cameron or having to share the title of 'that female action director' with Mimi Leder (until Mimi murdered her film career with the abominable 'Pay it Forward') Bigelow, determined to finally leave her mark, displays an astounding technical prowess with 'The Hurt Locker' that can only come from the wisdom of experience. Close-ups, slow-mo's, quick cuts and inventive plays with the camera's point-of-view are used sparingly and with pin-point precision to heighten tension. Here she shows the 'good ol' boys' she once emulated but has now trounced that style can be used for dramatic effect but need not be excessive. Her sense of space allows us to be right there with the bomb squad as they are faced with unimaginable danger. We always know where each character is positioned in relation to the bomb, and we always find in turn our stomachs have hit the floor. Her technique is brilliant and delivers a picture that is so taut it might be the most intense experience this side of Clouzot's 'Wages of Fear'. Now knowing all the moves, however, I wonder how the film will hold up on return viewing.'The Hurt Locker' is not for those seeking generic thrills or anyone currently on medication for emotional problems. It gets deep down into the gritty nature of bomb defusing by offering us lessons on suicide bombers, IED's and body-bombs that will make your gut churn. There's also some fantastically rendered sniper scenarios that are used not just for a visceral jolt, but also as a way to explore character development. Soldiers are not only put in precarious situations during combat but also in their day-to-day life dealing with their own conflicted emotions on top of a moody Iraqi populace that includes people treating them as tourists and looking to make a quick buck, people looking at the carnage as a spectator sport, people suffering as innocent bystanders, and people who wish to kill the soldiers and any one else in any way possible.While there are a few details one could quibble with (for instance, the title is never explained), 'The Hurt Locker' is impossible to dismiss and sometimes hard to digest. It paints a picture of war that shows there are no politics when it comes to the daily experiences of soldiers in the field. Their everyday heroism is painted in varying shades of moral ambiguity, while their internal struggles are shown to receive no emotional closure. As in real life, the story arcs of the fictional characters seen here are left open-ended, and the possibility of redeployment looms not just as an act of cruel fate but as a conscious and determined choice.",9,44,69,28 July 2009
The Illusionist," This is not a Review. This is only an Illusion.
","'The Illusionist' is a unique film that combines two often stale genres into something fresh: the lush romantic period piece and the 'AHA!' mystery thriller (a genre M. Night Shamalyan has single-handedly run into the ground recently). Helmed by a first time director (Neil Burger), based on a short story, and featuring an eclectic cast, 'The Illusionist' had the perfect set-up to be a monumental disaster. With a graceful slight-of-hand, it ends up being something very good.As with any run-of-the-mill period piece, there's a lavish attention to the set designs and costumes, here representing late nineteenth century Vienna. Director Burger puts a nice spin on the same-old, same-old with an acute attention to lighting (especially in the dreamily over-exposed flashbacks) and old fashioned camera techniques (witness the circular camera's eye closing to transition from scenes) to give the film the feel of being a fond memory of a classic movie from a bygone era.The central romance where Edward Norton's title character and Jessica Biel's Dutchess are star-crossed lovers kept apart because of class and society, had all the makings of a snore-inducing cheese-athon. Executed in an understated manner that services the greater plot, it ends up being anything but. Norton's performance, especially in the second half of the film when he turns into a man of very few words, had the potential to be one-note. As an actor, he speaks volumes with his eyes. Biel, a former teen idol and TV star, seemed a horrific choice for this role. She pulls of the nifty trick of being quite good. Even better are Rufus Sewell as the tyrannical crown-prince and Paul Giamatti as the chief inspector. Using a short story as the source material, characterizations had the potential to be paper-thin, but these seasoned veterans make the most of their lines and scenes adding terror, humor, and gravitas through their vocal and physical deliveries where lesser actors would've been wooden and cold. The entire cast also worked together very well utilizing their odd, vaguely European and aristorcatic accent. Everyone used it so consistently and earnestly, it didn't seem to matter after awhile that the accent was unnecessary.A more over-eager or pretentious director may have completely sabotaged the fantastic ending to 'The Illusionist' and cheated the audience. Handled deftly by Burger, the grande finale where 'all is revealed' is a wholly organic and satisfying conclusion that rewards the patient viewer and fulfills the lofty promises of the themes presented throughout the work.'The Illusionist' boasts an excellent music score from minimalist composer Phillip Glass that easily rivals his great work done in 'Candyman' and 'The Hours.' Norton and Giamatti treat us to some of the best 'staring' since the days of silent films. The look on Giamatti's face and the positioning of his raised eyebrows as he watches Norton perform his illusions coupled with Norton's eyes as he pulls off his tricks are priceless.",8,361,431,21 August 2006
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Nothing Lasts Forever
","On a cold night on the eve of WWII in Russia, a diplomat's wife (Tilda Swinton) shares tea with a most peculiar tugboat man named Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt). When she asks him where is he from, Benjamin replies, 'New Orleans...Louisiana.' Swinton's character replies, 'I didn't think there was any other.' This moment comes about forty minutes into the film which has been established on the grounds of a woman (Julia Ormond) reading to her dying mother (Cate Blanchett) from the diary of Benjamin Button as Hurricane Katrina sweeps over New Orleans. The ghost of a New Orleans now lost haunts David Fincher's lyrical adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story about a man who ages backwards. There's no denying this film couldn't have been made five years ago, not only because the technology wasn't there to make the process of aging backwards look real, but it would've also been a completely different movie as screenwriter Eric Roth wouldn't have been able to bookend the film with Blanchett on her deathbed as Hurricane Katrina comes to literally wipe away her life. The story is hung on a gimmick, and the film told as a fable, but there's grounding in the reality of life's greater mysteries that speaks volumes about not just the death of a man or a woman, but the death of a city and the death of a way of life.A big part of making the audience believe in the story falls on the film's technical aspects: the make-up, the CGI, the period-piece details of the film's set designs and costumes. If you look close enough, you can find things to nitpick, like the distracting disembodied voice of Cate Blanchett distorted onto a little girl, but for the most part Fincher constructs it all seamlessly. In terms of scope and sentiment, 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' seems a complete departure for a director usually obsessed with darker more violent tales, but Fincher has always liked his plots to begin (think 'Seven' or 'Panic Room') or end (think 'The Game' or 'Fight Club') with a gimmick, and he's always been a filmmaker obsessed with cutting-edge technology (think of the VIPER camera used to film 'Zodiac'). Fincher does a superb job with his meticulous construction of these elements (complimented nicely by Alexandre Desplat's subdued score), and he really wins the audience over with his flashbacks within flashbacks that are done in a charmingly stylized manner that remind us we're watching a movie that's meant to be enjoyed above any other pretense.By shifting the central location of the story from the original setting of Baltimore to New Orleans, Roth opens the film up to a new layer of interpretation. Though the episodic tale of Pitt's Benjamin growing younger while Blanchett's Daisy grows older spans the globe from Manhattan to Russia to Paris, the characters' hearts remain united in New Orleans. Roth, who also penned the thematically similar 'Forrest Gump' peppers his screenplay with many momentous events from the 20th Century, but those moments ebb and flow through Benjamin's life just as the other characters do showing us that life is made only of moments. None of them last forever.The supporting players (including a gutsy performance from Taraji P. Henson as Benjamin's adoptive mother who runs a nursing home) are wonderful and allow Pitt and Blanchett to shine as the movie stars that they are. Sure, these two have probably given better performances elsewhere, but here they have been given roles for which they might be best remembered long after their star-power has dimmed.In a year when the films with the most impact (like 'The Dark Knight') have been those that have tapped into the fears and mindset of the times we live in, it's rather fitting that a movie like 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' comes along at the end of the year. It should be one of those movies that hold audiences rapt in hushed silence, but it's also the type of movie that usually receives instant backlash. I wonder how it will stand up over time. On the surface it attempts to tell a timeless tale, but in a bittersweet way proves the opposite. Movies stars like Pitt and Blanchett, movies like this, stories, fables, dreams, cities like New Orleans...none of these things are timeless. Timelessness is just a flight of the imagination...like the idea of a man aging backwards. But what a wonderful flight it is.",9,12,20,28 December 2008
Children of Men," Interesting but Overcooked Speculative Drama
","Alfonso Cuaron (most well known for directing the overrated and raunchy coming-of-age story 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' and the third--and the best--of the 'Harry Potter' series) does a nice job of setting the mood with his gritty and eclectic take on a dystopian future where women have become infertile and Britian is a volatile police state where the biggest crime is being an illegal immigrant. This central conceit is mildly interesting, but the screenwriters populate the allegorical fiction with stock characters: people and ideas painted with broad strokes and little development, and peppered with quirky side-stories and characters who are often more interesting than the overly symbolic main plot line.What emerges is quasi-entertaining movie bubbling over with overcooked details and a few good scenes. Though dropping the ball in the intimate interludes that are supposed to add dramatic weight (the screaming match on the bus between Clive Owen and Julianne Moore about grief seemed especially staged and unreal), Cuaron directs the suspense and action scenes with appropriate zeal. Sadly, everyone in the film constantly looks tired (Owen taking a nap in a car and Moore actually yawning in one pivotal scene), so between the good stuff I often felt the same. There are three really well constructed sequences that on their own are very thrilling: a reverse vehicular escape from a an angry mob that ends tragically, another vehicular escape at dawn down a dirt farm road where the car just doesn't want to start, and one of the closing scenes of a lonely rowboat in a choppy bay surrounded by fog. The rest is haphazard filler that had me distracted most of the time. 'Children of Men' eventually became of movie of frustrating details. For instance, the title makes no sense when you think about it. Unless sprung from immaculate conception, we are currently all children of men, so this would only be an appropriate title if all the women in the world were dead and men started having babies. The movie cost over $80 million dollars to make (and it looks great) but why couldn't they fork out the extra cash to pay for the real Rolling Stones' version of 'Ruby Tuesday' instead of a lousy cover? The song plays a crucial part yet becomes aggravating to hear. Finally, instead of caring about what happens to the two lead characters during the excellently filmed siege of the refugee camp, I cared more about what was going to happen to some poor gypsy woman and her little dog.Though it has plenty of interesting minutae to keep things entertaining, the film never coalesces as a whole. Despite three really good scenes, 'Children of Men' unfortunately solidifies Cuaron's status as the best director yet to make a great film.",7,27,47,9 January 2007
Million Dollar Baby," Against All Odds...
","It took me awhile to get into 'Million Dollar Baby.' Like all of Eastwood's latter day helmed films, it's snail-paced, darkly lit to the point of annoyance, and at times deafeningly quiet. I thought I had paid to see an underdog triumphs story, a rote boxing pic about an old dog of a trainer (Eastwood) reluctantly teaching a down-and-out youngster (Hillary Swank-amazing here and finally delivering on the promise of her breakthrough performance in 'Boys Don't Cry'). The intimate details of boxing and using the sport as life metaphor are done well here, but nothing special.Then, about three quarters of the way through the film, it takes a turn I was not aware it would take, and I was blindsided, and then treated to a bearing of Eastwood's soul as an actor and a director, as a man and an artist...an honest and unflinching tribute to the life and philosophies of the noble outsider, the person living by their own set of morals and values, the person who does what is right even when it flies in the face of standard practices and laws. In the shadows of the tragedy that the last quarter of the film depicts, we get treated to Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Swank bearing all, and giving heartbreaking and devastating performances that haunted me long afterwords. Say what you will about Eastwood as a director (he's usually overrated) and as an actor (he usually plays himself), but he gives us a blazing look here into his perspective of the world, and it is both tragic and beautiful to watch in 'Million Dollar Baby.'",9,5,7,22 January 2005
Garden State," Mildly Entertaining, Shallow and Self Ingulgent
","'Garden State' is yet another one of those so-called 'quirky slice-of-life' comedies that is in actuality a depressing piece of misguided melodrama. What makes this type of film work is when the oddball characters ring true in some way (as they did in the far better 'Sideways' or 'The Station Agent'). The problem with Zach Braff's film is that none of the characters seem real and all their quirks are there for no reason other than their own quirkiness (for instance, the listless druggie who makes millions off inventing silent Velcro or the moron who wears his knight costume to breakfast before going to work at a 'Midieval Times' restaurant).The film isn't totally without its charms. Natalie Portman is delightful and adorable. This is a perfect transition role for her as she matures from precocious child actress to leading lady. She does the most with her overwritten role as an epileptic ex-ice skater with a plethora of pets and an 'adopted brother' from one of those Sally Struther's 'save the children' campaigns. She comes across as endearing and genuine and is the only one of this motley 'Garden State' lot I would want to spend some time with in the real world.Writer/director Zach Braff, on the other hand, seems to be playing a pill-popping emotionless minor TV star whose mother just died for no other reason than the fact that he is an emotionless actor who can't pull off any other type of role. His performance is hollow, and only in his scenes with Portman is he acquitted of his obvious and egregious self-indulgence.There's a few mildly entertaining sidebars along the misguided coming-of-age trail (the underground 'Grand Canyon' or the dope at the hardware store trying to sell his pals on a pyramid-scheme), and every scene Portman is in is better for it, but when you tack on an annoying folksy-alterna-emo soundtrack and a horrible and safe 'Hollywood' style ending, I couldn't help but feel cheated.",6,1,2,7 November 2005
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," A Timely Call for Responsible Journalism
","In this day and age of terror alerts, alleged torturing of prisoners, corporate run news programs, and the potential erosion of civil liberties, 'Good Night, and Good Luck' couldn't be more timely. George Clooney has crafted a near perfect docu-drama about CBS News (and in particular Edward R. Murrow-played spot on by David Strathairn) in the early 1950's when they dared to take on Senator Joe McCarthy's misbegotten hunting down of American Communist sympathizers.Clooney makes three great directorial decisions here that really help the film stand out. First, it is shot in black and white and looks like a crisper cleaner version of the TV news programs of that era. Second, there is no music score save for some perfectly timed jazz numbers (almost done as commercial breaks dispersed after key moments in the film, and always with relevant lyrics). Third, and most effectively, he uses only real archival footage of McCarthy. It keeps the 'villian' at a comfortable distance while at the same time being alarmingly true to the actual nature of McCarthy's devious ways.The set designs, cinematography, and supporting cast (Frank Langella, Patricia Clarkson, Robert Downy Jr., and Ray Wise) are all fantastic. At the end we are left with a plethora of great quotes that are very meaningful today from Murrow and an earnest call for journalists to rise up and bring the real stories to the public. The film seems to be saying that there is no way to have truly unbiased reporting. What is important is that everything is reported on (and that intimidation or fear of being unpopular or losing your job should not effect the news that is reported), and that if opinions are to be had either way concerning important topics, they need to be heard. Everyone in America deserves to have their forum, even Joe McCarthy, and that is what makes this country great.",9,7,14,17 October 2005
Mulholland Drive," The Pinnacle of a Career of a Genius
","Mulholland Drive-10/10-What can be said about a film that is arguably the crowning achievement of the career of a genius? What is so amazing about this puzzle box of a movie is how easily it can be explained. The wicked kicker is how many possible viable explanations there may be. Like Memento you may lose sleep over it, and it had me and the three people I saw it with arguing the entire thirty minute ride home from the theater over just what exactly it all meant. As a true testament to its power, we all wanted to see it again immediately for closer inspection of finer plot points, which may make our break our compeating theories. If you are a die-hard Lynch fan and need a gauger of just where this one falls in his opus, it is by far his greatest puzzle-box movie easily surpassing Lost Highway, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, and Wild at Heart. This may be his zenith, and overall it makes his top three best films period, hovering right there with Blue Velvet and The Elephant Man.Essentially, this film is a meditation on the power of movies and the ever foggier blurring of reality and fantasy. What could be erroneously misconstrued as a hate letter to Hollywood and a brutal critique is actually an unflinching and romantic testament to Hollywood's raw power and ability to change how we view our lives. Lynch summed it up best when he said, 'This is a love story in the city of dreams.'*WARNING: POTENTIAL SPOILERS* Now here's where the average viewer is going to need some help. This movie is both figuratively and literally a psychoanalyst's dream. But one does not need to be an expert in Freudian psychology and dream analysis to figure it all out. I shall give two hints, or rather two things to keep in mind. Part of this film is dream, there are clues everywhere, but what parts actually are dream and what parts are reality is fodder for an endless debate. Secondly, you should be trying to identify certain characters as manifestations of the tri-component personality theory (1. The Id-our inner desires, our uncontrollable animal instincts. 2. The Ego-that which tried to control and keep things balanced and in harmony. 3. The super-ego-that which we imagine is actually controlling our actions, the 'dark force' we think is behind everything.)The stars are truly compelling, and David Lynch has become the master of emoting feelings out of facial expressions and silent interludes. Naomi Watts is clearly a great talent who is deliberately acting bad (unlike Patricia Arquette in Lost Highway, a bad actress deliberately acting bad). She looks like Tea Leoni's spunky kid sister with a dark secret. Laura Elena Harring looks like Catherine Zeta-Jones' Hispanic cousin, and although not as compelling as Isabella Rosallini in Blue Velvet, is still able to keep your attention and sympathies even through the most horrid of scenes.In the end you will have laughed, gasped, been shocked, been appalled, been completely mesmerized by scenes of beauty and scenes of horror, and ultimately fallen in love with whatever driving force is behind this film and hate David Lynch for confusing you all the same.I can not recommend this movie any more highly. It is David Lynch doing what David Lynch does best, and that's all we can ever ask for from such a talent.",10,4,6,21 December 2001
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," The Holocaust Presented as a Grim Children's Fable
","It's official. The award now goes to the British for making the most depressing film I have ever seen. For the first time in my movie-going life I witnessed an audience member's physical reaction to a film when a father was observed outside the screening room for 'The Boy in the Striped Pajamas' collapsed against the wall with his child emotionally distraught and crying in his lap. With the rest of the audience, including myself, stunned into silence after the film and exiting the theater a communal internalized wreck, I don't know if I was more devastated by what I had witnessed on screen or by that poor little child out in the hallway whose father for some reason thought this film would provide a history lesson his child could stomach at such a young age. As the film proves, the innocent are not cut out for war.That being said, I would recommend 'The Boy in the Striped Pajamas' to anyone emotionally prepared to sit through it. The film's climax will hit you like a sucker punch to the gut¬Öbut there is a lesson to be learned for those in the right frame of mind and mature enough to handle it. In adapting John Boyne's novel, director Mark Herman envisions the Holocaust as a grim child's fable, and in doing so, presents the historical events from a daringly simple new angle. Yes, 'Life is Beautiful' attempted something similar not so long ago, but that film was told from the point of view of a child-like man trying to shield his son from horrors and had abrupt tonal shifts that sank its dramatic impact. 'The Boy in the Striped Pajamas', however, keeps a powerfully consistent tone, and until the harrowing final act, is entirely told from the point-of-view of the young son of a German commandant assigned to run a concentration camp.Herman directs the film fairly well, utilizing visual motifs and not so subtle foreshadowing (that left me with a sinking feeling in my gut as the film progressed), and he is aided greatly by the wonderful cinematography by Benoit Delhomme. The script, though contrived in parts, is tight and moves at a brisk pace, and the normally sappy composer James Horner shows great restraint with his score that is both haunting and reverent to the events that unfold. The mostly British cast is stunning. As little Bruno, Asa Butterfield successfully permits us to relate to the child's na√Øve innocence without ever allowing the character to become cloying or blissfully ignorant. David Thewlis commands attention as his tortured and misguided father, and Vera Farmiga is dynamite as his distressed mother. She gives a powerhouse performance and proves yet again to be a gripping chameleon of an actress nearing the level of a Cate Blanchett.With its slim run-time, 'The Boy in the Striped Pajamas' seems a sound choice for a future generation of teachers to show their high school students in lieu of an epic like 'Schindler's List'. It also makes a good visual companion piece to Eli Wiesel's literary 'Night' as it shows a fictionalized flip-side to the same tragedy. As the real survivor accounts sadly fade with the passing of time, the horrors of the Holocaust will remain firmly in place in the world's historical fiction for centuries to come long after the last person who actually witnessed it has died. These stories will forever be screaming at us, and we would be wise to listen. Fault the film if you wish, but in its bold child-like simplicity it shows the insidious evil of the Nazis as two-fold. Yes, they slaughtered six-million innocent Jews, but it was an act of murder-suicide as in doing so they also sentenced themselves to death.",8,27,42,14 November 2008
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Kill Miramax--A Movie Like This Would be Best Served Whole
","Here's my major problem with QT's long awaited 'Kill Bill.'  While the film is always interesting from a movie buff's perspective (a QT film always is even when you end up hating it in the end), it doesn't get really interesting until the last thirty minutes (which are wildly entertaining) when Uma (stunningly beautiful and vicious as the revenge fueled blood lusting Black Mamba/The Bride) and the action move to Tokyo.  So in my mind, even if all of Volume II (to be released in February of 2004) is as entertaining as the last thirty minutes of Volume I, why in the world didn't the hire an intelligent editor who could've easily chopped out some drawn out exposition (does a B-level revenge fantasy really need an hour and twenty minutes of exposition?) and delivered us an all out go-for-broke extravaganza of over-the-top violence and action in one two and a half to three hour volume?  The only answer I can come up with is that Miramax is greedy and QT is full of himself.  He thinks every cool idea (and he has some really cool ones here from the retro opening credits to the battle to the death in a Japanese garden snow-globe at the end) that pops in his head needs to be filmed, and every spec of film he captures needs to be in the movie.All these things aside, 'Kill Bill' is pretty fun if you like gruesome cartoonish violence, a simple plot line (revenge is a dish best served cold), compelling visuals (I didn't care for the anime sequence, but found my jaw drop at the stunningly beautiful cinematography and set design in the Tokyo sequences), non-linear story-telling, and an ultra hip soundtrack. This really just is a fetish film for fans of kung-fu flicks, death wish fantasies, and spaghetti westerns, and there ain't nothing wrong with that as long as you realize that's what this is.  The casual movie-goer will probably be dumbfounded, as the film is virtually void of the trademark QT dialogue which is what I think made the over-rated 'Pulp Fiction' so oddly endearing to mainstream audiences.  I ultimately plan to see Volume II when it comes out, because I finally would like to see Uma Thurman Kill Bill. Until then, our bloodlust will have to be satisfied by this mixed-bag of cinematic tricks.",8,0,1,13 October 2003
Saw II," A Lean, Mean Sequel
","'Saw II' wisely follows the simplest of rules to avoid the typical trappings of horror sequels. It keeps things simple.1. Take the originality of the concept in the first film and elaborate on it. The gruesome set-ups from the Jigsaw killer up the ante in every way from the first film. Here we get up not two people trapped in a nasty bathroom/basement and a single detective trying to crack the case, but a whole group or people trapped in a booby-trapped house and a whole swat team engaging in a face-off with the killer himself in a race against time.2. If you had a twist ending in the first film, through people off guard with added gore and violence and more characters, so that when you pull off yet another twist ending, people will still be slightly shocked.3. If what made the original so oddly endearing was a laughably bad lead performance (courtesy of Cary Elwes), play it straight and populate the film with the likes of ex-TV and pop-stars like Donnie Whalberg, Shawnee Smith, and that cute girl from 7th Heaven. Gone here is all the humor, and genre fans will feel redeemed from the bad acting of the first especially with all the bone-crunching, throat-slitting, head-exploding action on parade here.In the end, the film is leaner and meaner than the first, and all the better for it. Considering the rushed nature of the production, the low budget, and the natural tendency for sequels to horror/slasher flicks to totally suck, this one is godsend.",7,4,8,10 November 2005
The Dark Knight," Terror in the Knight
","Director Christopher Nolan has tapped into a cultural zeitgeist with his soaring 'Dark Knight.' No other director has shown so much ambition while working within the context of such an iconic name brand belonging to popular culture. By building upon the excellent framework he set with 'Batman Begins' and adding in the chaos of the Joker (Heath Ledger, legendary) and the tragedy of Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart, admirable), Nolan, like Hitchcock before him, utilizes a B-level genre flick to tap into our shared cultural fears. Along with his co-writer brother, Jonathan Nolan, the director crafts a tightly wound tapestry that explores our archetypal fears of losing our identity and becoming that which we hate, while tuning into post 9/11 fears of terrorism, cowboy diplomacy, wire-tapping, and vigilante justice run amok.The cast assembled falls right into place with Nolan's epic and relentlessly dark vision of our current superhero mythology. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are again perfect in their supporting roles of wisdom and gadget providers, while Gary Oldman receives a surprising amount of screen time and delivers a sterling Oscar-worthy performance as the tormented Commissioner James Gordon. Replacing the dreadful Katie Holmes, Maggie Gyllenhaal is spry and feisty as assistant DA Rachel Dawes, but still seems out of place in her role. Bale is again brooding and effective as Bruce Wayne, though he gets overshadowed by the sly trickster that is Heath Ledger's Joker. Ledger is everything he's been hyped up to be. He's scary good and his insanely nuanced and subversively humorous performance haunts the film while his character terrorizes Gotham with a feverish intensity that is divinely married to Nolan's amped up tempo of thrills.The opening moments of the film fall victim to the typical trappings of a sequel as it tries to reintroduce us to the cast regulars while setting the stage for new conflicts. However, once the Joker starts playing his games, Nolan ratchets up the tension to a nightmarish effect that will leave your pulse pounding for two hours. With each terrorist act of the Joker and ensuing catastrophe, Nolan ups the ante, resulting in a film that is enormously entertaining while also making the obvious bloated runtime seem oppressive and nerve-wracking...almost as if the film is a terrorist attack against the audience......and maybe that's the point. With the opening camera swoop between skyscrapers zeroing in on a single window taken straight from Hitchcock's opening shot from 'Psycho', Nolan tells the audience what they are in store for. Two more images, along with Ledger's ghastly scarred and make-up covered visage, seep into the viewer's subconscious. The first is after a building is exploded we see an image of firefighters spraying water over the scalding steel left behind that is eerily reminiscent of scenes from Ground Zero. The second is after a hospital is demolished, an image of the building's carcass on the television seems taken straight from the Oklahoma City Bombing. As we watch the harrowing Joker-less climax involving Batman, Dent, and Gordon, and knowing in the back of our minds what became of Ledger in real life, we realize that terrorism can not only come from without, but from within. Sometimes we are our own worst victims.",9,6,13,22 July 2008
The Greatest Game Ever Played," Good Show, Mr. Paxton
","Actor turned director Bill Paxton follows up his promising debut, the Gothic-horror 'Frailty', with this family friendly sports drama about the 1913 U.S. Open where a young American caddy rises from his humble background to play against his Bristish idol in what was dubbed as 'The Greatest Game Ever Played.' I'm no fan of golf, and these scrappy underdog sports flicks are a dime a dozen (most recently done to grand effect with 'Miracle' and 'Cinderella Man'), but some how this film was enthralling all the same.The film starts with some creative opening credits (imagine a Disneyfied version of the animated opening credits of HBO's 'Carnivale' and 'Rome'), but lumbers along slowly for its first by-the-numbers hour. Once the action moves to the U.S. Open things pick up very well. Paxton does a nice job and shows a knack for effective directorial flourishes (I loved the rain-soaked montage of the action on day two of the open) that propel the plot further or add some unexpected psychological depth to the proceedings. There's some compelling character development when the British Harry Vardon is haunted by images of the aristocrats in black suits and top hats who destroyed his family cottage as a child to make way for a golf course. He also does a good job of visually depicting what goes on in the players' heads under pressure. Golf, a painfully boring sport, is brought vividly alive here. Credit should also be given the set designers and costume department for creating an engaging period-piece atmosphere of London and Boston at the beginning of the twentieth century.You know how this is going to end not only because it's based on a true story but also because films in this genre follow the same template over and over, but Paxton puts on a better than average show and perhaps indicates more talent behind the camera than he ever had in front of it. Despite the formulaic nature, this is a nice and easy film to root for that deserves to find an audience.",7,39,51,9 October 2005
Annie Hall," I Forgot My Mantra....
","Woody Allen's seminal 1977 romantic comedy 'Annie Hall' is not only laugh-out-loud funny (with some of the most quotable dialogue ever written for the screen...this is the 'Casablanca' of comedies, folks) but also sweet and charming (due in large part because of Diane Keaton's smashing performance as the title character, the flighty singer from Wisconsin with a quirky fashion sense and 'neat' outlook on life) without ever turning trite or sappy like so many romantic comedies tend to do. Allen wisely deconstructed the genre with his non-linear story-line (something that was later done to even greater effect with a more recent and profound look at relationships, 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind') and charming little theatrical tricks like talking to the audience or pulling extras into the scene for their opinions on what's been going on. It keeps the viewer off guard and allows for a free flow of comedic and philosophical ideas that might otherwise not have found their way into a more traditional film.In his latter years, Allen's best work has been when he is not part of the cast (my personal favorites being 'Bulletts over Broadway,' 'Sweet and Lowdown,' and the recent 'Match Point'). 'Annie Hall' was made in his heyday when he could still pull off playing a neurotic New York Jewish comedienne with charm and panache. There's something innocent and benign about his obsessions here, as this was long before the Woody/Soon-Yi fiasco and the days of grossly miscasting himself against younger female co-stars. Yes, Mr. Allen has been artsier (witness 'Manhattan') and more satirical (witness 'Zelig') but here, with Diane Keaton as his muse, he was never more charming or funnier.",9,68,91,12 February 2006
2001: A Space Odyssey," In Space, Everyone can see You Dream
","There are many movies out there so full of energy and self-conscious visionary bravado (films like 'Goodfellas' or 'City of God') that they perpetuate the myth of the greatest film of all time. Then, there are movies like Stanley Kubrick's '2001' that created the myth, and simply are.'2001' is the prime example of why Stanley Kubrick is the greatest director of all time. He was able to traverse many different genres throughout his career, and in doing so created the mythic templates by which all other latter films in those genres would attempt to emulate. Prior to this film, he made the greatest satire ever in 'Dr. Strangelove.' Following this film, he made the greatest costumed period piece in 'Barry Lyndon' and the greatest 'modern' horror film in 'The Shining.' Throw in films like 'Clockwork Orange' (another biting satire) and 'Full Metal Jacket' (the best 'grunts-eye-view' of war ever made) and you have the greatest director of all time.Here's why '2001' is the greatest science fiction movie ever made. The amazing visual effects and the set designs with their painstaking attention to detail still hold up to today's harshest scrutinies. I dare you to find a movie from any period that looks this good. It makes today's CGI laden films look like visual puke. It also presents us with a prophetic and realistic look at what might happen to our society as it continues to evolve and become more dependent on technology, and the quandaries of creating Artificial Intelligence. HAL, the super computer, is without a doubt the coldest and most profoundly dangerous villain ever to grace the silver screen.On its most simplistic level, '2001' is the most arresting combination of visuals and sound ever captured on celluloid. What make the film so transcendent are its philosophical and spiritual posturings on man's place in the universe and just how 'alien' our first contact with outside intelligent life may be. The overture and opening credits send shivers down my spine every time, and the ending gives me enough energy to fuel a thousand dreams. No other film in my mind is this innately powerful.",10,12,25,21 November 2005
Blood Diamond," This is Africa?
","An Edward Zwick film always reeks of quality. Think of his 'Courage Under Fire,' the first big film to address the Gulf War, or the Tom Cruise starer 'The Last Samurai.' Both were very good films, but didn't quite reach the epic status they seemed to be aiming for. Zwick commonly has compelling stories with big stars and a big budget...but his films are always missing that special something--the visceral jolt or that artistic flair that separate the good movies from the great movies. 'Blood Diamond' tries very hard to be a pulse-pounding and heart wrenching political thriller in the vein of last year's 'The Constant Gardner,' but in its earnest and noble attempt to bring to life the plight of Africans involved in the mining and smuggling of diamonds, it falls short.The writers deserve credit for trying to highlight so many compelling tangents of this hot-button story that touches on price gouging, corporate 'funding' of civil war, enslavement of native Africans in their own land, and the brutal indoctrination of child armies by radical rebel forces. Zwick, always competent staging a tense battle scene and realistic violence, unfortunately directs everything else in a pedestrian manner that hinders the inherent compelling nature of the plot. An uninspired music score and two false endings don't help.The superb cast helps keep things slightly off kilter and interesting for the audience. Leonardo DiCaprio as the suddenly conscious-stricken diamond smuggler has become one of those uber-stars who is always better than expected in spite of himself. He sports and unidentifiable accent (is it supposed to be a Zimbabwe accent, or someone from Zimbabwe doing a bad impression of a South African accent?) that isn't as nearly distracting as it was in the previews for the film. Following his masterful turn in 'The Departed', Leo has somehow managed to wipe away his pretty-boy image and become a very reliable man's-man actor-intense and brooding and ready for action. It's also nice to see the stunning Jennifer Connelly in a role other than that of a tortured middle class woman with dark secrets. She's underused here as the wily reporter looking to make a difference with her 'big story,' but her always slightly subversive line readings are effortlessly enticing, and she's become one of those rare actresses who looks even sexier as she ages. To round out the ensemble, there's Djimon Hounsou, always riveting in his typecast role of a passionate and angry African willing to do anything for his family.'Blood Diamond' is ultimately one of those movies that is greater to talk about than actually sit through. It has some fine performances and a compelling story that gives much food for thought, but isn't as well executed as it should be. Like all Zwick films, it has a brain and a keen eye, but its heart seems strangely insincere.",7,9,17,26 December 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," The 'Memento' of Romantic Comedies
","With 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' director Gondry and screen-writer Kaufman (who previously teamed up on the little seen and fantastically funny film 'Human Nature' starring Tim Robbins and Patricia Arquette) do for the romantic comedy genre what Christopher Nolan did for the mystery thriller in 'Memento'--i.e. they totally deconstruct it with a gimmick plot trick (here we have characters employing a company called Lacuna that will erase their memories of each other), non-linear storytelling, and strip down the essence of the genre (in this case, relationships) to the bare bones to reveal startling truths about love and companionship. We also get treated here to Jim Carey doing his best post-'Truman Show' work to date and Kate Winslet delivering yet another astounding performance as our doomed and psychologically tortured lovers. We also have the luminous Kristen Dunst, the always reliable Mark Ruffalo, a delightfully out of character Elijah Wood, and old stalwart Tom Wilkinson in great supporting roles. This is one of those rare films where everything-- acting, writing, directing, and emotional involvement from the audience all come together beautifully. For all its seeming absurdity, it ends up being one of the most honest looks at relationships film has ever given us.",10,1,4,3 January 2005
Taken," Don't Be Taken for a Fool
","And now producer/writer Luc Besson and director Pierre Morel present the comedy event of the year! Here's the pitch: Two spoiled obnoxious teenage girls from California go to France and get kidnapped by a group of Albanians trafficking dumb tourists into sex slavery to the highest bidders--and you guessed it, one of those high bidders is a Middle Eastern sheik. But oh yeah, did I mention one of those girl's fathers just happens to be a retired Jack Bauer-style super-spy who's about reign down a sh*t-storm on the streets of Paris in order to rescue his idiot daughter? And guess what--it's Liam Neeson! Yes, there is a bit of a novelty factor in watching the guy who played Oskar Schindler go against type and get crazy on these moronic dirt-bags. And gosh darn it, Liam does his best with the role. I can't remember the last time a film was sold to the American public entirely on the sound of one man's voice reading dialog. He alone makes the otherwise unbearable film watchable. However, let's be honest. As much fun as it is to watch Liam Neeson outrun a speeding car or electrocute some guy or kill a dude with a broken bottle, Clint Eastwood's 'Gran Torino' was a far better and more refined example of grizzled old guy 'badassery', and it was a hell of a lot funnier, and fancy that, had a moral.What we have here in 'Taken' is tone deaf French filmmakers sticking their nose up at Americans and spreading xenophobia abroad. I'm pretty sure they thought there were making a slick black comedy that no American would see through. Had they manifested this with a harder edge or more overtly satirical tone, they might've been on to something. Instead we get a second-rate episode of '24' watered down by a PG-13 rating that takes away any possibility of entertainment on even an exploitative level.Bottom line: Don't be fooled by Liam Neeson's voice. He commanded our attention in the teaser trailers, but this should be film not taken.",4,30,61,3 February 2009
Grindhouse," DON'T!!!!! (But I Did)
","Like the classic double-features it pays homage to, 'Grindhouse' features one half far superior to the other. The two-for-the-price-of-one deal is a mixed bag of schlocky, exploitative crap that pays off early for movie buffs.'Planet Terror'--8/10. Like his 'Sin City,' Robert Rodriguez's zombie fest is pulpy, unapologetic over-the-top fun. He perfectly captures the spirit of the grindhouse films of old. His film is funny, violent, ridiculous, and pointless in all the right places and continually delivers the money shots of oozing flesh wounds, exploding bodies, severed limbs, decapitations, and chicks with machine guns (and one, Rose McGowan, with a machine gun leg that is every bit as spectacular as you imagined). The cast is all in on the joke and spectacularly game at every point (Marley Shelton as the lesbian anesthesiologist and Jeff Fahey as J.T. 'the barbecue man' standing out). Operating at a crisp clip with no-nonsense or any attempt to parade as art, 'Planet Terror' offers plenty bang for your buck and could easily stand alone. It's the perfect example of giddy 'insider-fetish' film-making where the director entertains the audience by first pleasing himself.The 'fake trailers' shown before and after 'Planet Terror' are laugh-out-loud hilarious and operate brilliantly as both spoofs and homages. My personal favorite was Edgar Wright's trailer for the searing psychological thriller 'DON'T!' which in a sad bit of irony, could've been the tag-line for what comes next.'Death Proof'--5/10. Quentin Tarantino's rambling tale of an ex-stuntman stalking annoying and shallow women with his 'death proof' car operates like a retarded Frankstein monster of a film made up of all the worst parts of Tarantino's past efforts. A great performance from Kurt Russell and some fun car chase scenes aside, the rest is chock full of bad acting, worse writing and self-satisfied direction. This is the type of film where arbitrary dialogue is spouted by overly hipster actors playing non-characters we can't wait to see die. Tarantino directs it smugly as he parades women in their undies and hot pants around and shows us some cool cars getting banged up, but it has no sense of fun to it. It's the perfect example of banal 'insider-fetish' film-making that bores its audience because the director first and foremost pleases himself.Bottom line: Where as the 'Kill Bill' films should've been edited down to one flick, this movie, joined at that skull like deformed twins, should've been severed. Oddly then the film-makers would've been left with a horrifying scenario. No one would want to see Tarantino's half.",7,8,18,8 April 2007
Saw," For Those Who Love to Laugh and Puke at the Same Time...
","'Saw' is relentlessly grisly. The serial-killer genre has been run into the ground recently, but 'Saw' grinds it into mush and churns it out kicking and screaming once again. Here, the killer never really kills anyone, he simply sets up overly elaborate and grotesque scenarios that leave his hapless victims with painful choices, die a horrible death, kill yourself first, or kill someone else to escape. What we get here as viewers, is some of the best hardcore horror gore splattering this side of the latest zombie-fest.'Saw' has everything a hardcore cult classic of this ilk needs to stand the test of time. The director, James Wan, is a hapless slap-dash hack (the editing is especially horrible) with a lovingly perverse penchant for the grotesque and macabre. Hardcore horror fans will rejoice. The film's set-ups are clever, and its executions are over the top. The film is anchored by a screamingly bad lead performance from Cary Elwes. All the performances here (save for the creepy tape-recorded voice of the Jigsaw killer) are terrible, but Elwes (who always seems to be acting as if he is still in 'The Princess Bride') has some of the most howlingly awful sobbing/screaming scenes I have ever seen. Once you get done puking, you will laugh, as most of the audience did. I don't think the laughs are intentional, but by george, they are surely needed, because the last piece of the cult-classic-status puzzle is the stomach-churning ending. The last ten minutes of the film give us such a perverse twist, that it will leave the viewer shell-shocked. Don't expect a nice tidy ending. The film is as sloppy as its director, but the climax is as insanely ingenious as the killer it depicts. I was shocked, and so were the hardcore fans I went with, and that is saying a lot. So, if you are like us, see 'Saw', otherwise, I can't recommend this gnarly hack-work to anyone else.",7,1,2,1 November 2004
Mama," A Huge Waste of Talent
","In most horror films there is a suspension of disbelief required. I probably would've been okay with the overly convoluted plot of 'Mama' had there been some sense of suspense...but there's never any mystery to it and the clueless director shows us Mama in all her glory in the first five minutes of the film before the opening credits even begin.Decent cinematography and music score aside, the rest of this film is an absolute mess of clich√©s and underwritten characters. Poor Jessica Chastain is completely unconvincing as a punk-rock chick turned stepmother to two feral girls who were raised by an irate ghost in the woods. The ghost effects are unimaginative and the back-story of the ghost is one we have heard a million times. The ending is one of the worst of recent memory.With Del Toro producing, I had expected so much more. This is a complete waste of his name and Chastain's acting talents.Check out full reviews at theschleicherspin.com",1,18,41,20 January 2013
A Clockwork Orange," Hilarious Black Comedy
","If ever there was an over-rated Kubrick film, for my money, 'Clockwork Orange' is probably it. I may be unfairly judging it because so many things since its initial release from any number of films glorifying violence to similarly themed bloody satires like 'Natural Born Killers' or 'Fight Club' to the pop phenomenon of gangster-rap have repeated the same message. What I prefer to do is view the film as I think it should be, a brilliant black comedy.There is maddening genius on display here amongst the anarchy in Kubrick's film adaptation of the controversial novel. From the quasi-futuristic set designs to the hilarious speech of the characters to the outlandish costumes, 'Clockwork Orange' presents a future that doesn't seem that far-fetched, so we the viewer develop a certain familiar comfort level with the oddly off kilter surroundings we find ourselves in. The culture of fear it presents where elderly citizens and an incompetent government cower to roving bands of ultra-violent hooligans isn't that far removed from say, oh, I don't know, present day France or even America in some ways.What makes the film go down so well despite some of its shocking depictions of rape, violence, and torture, is that it never preaches to the viewer. Yes, there is something to be said about a culture of fear in an over-developed nation leading to an erosion of civil liberties and a totalitarian government parading as democracy....but let's face it, this film is in it more for the laughs (the facial expressions on Malcolm McDowell and Patrick Magee are especially uproarious), as its closing scenes will tell. Alex, was cured, alright, but we the viewers may never be.",9,7,13,21 November 2005
From Hell," One of the best modern Gothic horror films ever made. An overlooked masterpiece.
","My oh my, if ever there was a film overlooked last year, this was it. Not since David Lynch's 'Elephant Man' has there been such a hauntingly unique and creative artistic vision of Victorian England. And not since 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' has there been such an enjoyably disturbing onslaught of blood and guts. This surely is one of the most gory and shocking horror films ever produced. Add in a delightfully witty performance from rotund British character actor Robbie Coltrane, some fantastic theories on Jack the Ripper, marvelously imaginative and literate direction from a pair of ghetto-raised black brothers, a wonderful script spun from a graphic comic-book (!), a suitably off-kilter turn by Johnny Depp, conspiracy theories, political intrigue, scantily clad women, cool costumes, a wonderfully bad Irish accent from Heather Graham, some wild dream sequences and low and behold, you have one of the greatest Gothic-horror-gory-murder mysteries ever produced. A must see for horror film fans.",9,0,1,16 May 2002
Reservoir Dogs," Solid but far from greatness
","There's really not much to this flick.  It's an ultra-slick, highly stylish, ultra-violent quasi-gangster flick about an undercover cop working a sting on a diamond heist.  If you like this kind of thing, then you will get a big kick out of this, but otherwise, avoid it at all costs.  Tarantino, in his debut directorial gig shows he has a panache for very interesting dialogue (that usually has nothing to do with the plot) and a very stylish director's hand.  This flick is far superior to his overly praised 'Pulp Fiction,' (**) which in my mind was a sloppily put together episodic flick that had some decent movie moments but ultimately had nothing to say beyond its own shock value.  Tarantino's only other turn at direction was 'Jackie Brown,' (***) which for me was his only real 'film' whose only downfall was that it took its sweet time getting around to what it had to say about midlife crises. As it stands, 'Reservoir Dogs' (**1/2) is a solid flick but nothing great. If you want all this clever crime caper/con-game stuff without all the ultra-violence but still have the great dialogue, I recommend the work of David Mamet ('The Spanish Prisoner' or 'Heist' should do the trick).",7,0,1,18 March 2003
Eyes Wide Shut," Frustrating Last Entry from Kubrick
","It's a shame that something as muddled (though fascinating and watchable throughout) as 'Eyes Wide Shut' would become the last movie directed by possibly the greatest director of all time, Stanley Kubrick. It showcases all the things his detractors had been falsely claiming for years: he's out of steam, it's too long, it's too weird, and it has no point. Unfortunately the film is as overshadowed by the fact that it's Kubrick's last as it is by the fact that it was released at the height of Cruise and Kidman's status as Hollywood's uber-couple. Oh, how we wish Kubrick could be with us today, and how we all thought Tom and Nicole would last forever.Kubrick's look at marriage and fidelity can be boiled down pretty easily: misadventures in unfaithfulness can be equally damaging playing out in one's imagination as they can be in reality. Despite a great, raw, and entrancing performance from Nicole Kidman, the film is pretty much one-sided and dedicates most of its runtime to Tom Cruise's unrealistic though entertaining nightly escapades. Only in a Kubrick film would a man find the prettiest, most polite, kindest hooker in New York City and then just happen upon a huge aristocratic sex cult at some castle/mansion out on Long Island. The whole thing is more kinky than erotic and just a bit silly, which isn't to say it's without its merits.In the end, in spite of its flaws, I think it's rather fitting that the last line of the last film of a director like Kubrick who always had such a dark sense of humor would be, 'f*ck' and be spoken by one of the most elegant and beautiful and talented actresses of her generation. Sounds like a great idea.",7,3,6,3 January 2006
Inside Man," An Entertaining Lark
","If you're a fan of Spike Lee (and I most assuredly am since I was one of the twenty people who actually saw his last film, 'She Hate Me'), there's a certain smug satisfaction in watching his latest 'joint', 'Inside Man.' Spike Lee has never been a populist entertainer. His movies are almost always overtly talky, political, and married to New York City (I would even go so far as to call him the black Woody Allen). He has as many detractors and he does fans. There have been a few occasions where he's sidestepped to different types of stories (that were still very urban and very New York), fantastically disastrously with 'Summer of Sam' and surprisingly deep with his superb '25th Hour.' Here, hooking up with long-time collaborator Denzel Washington (who gives a cracker-jack performance as a slick hostage negotiator), Lee gives us his first flick of pure entertainment, and it's the kind of twisty, thrilling lark you would normally get from a latter day Hitchcock or a David Mamet at the top of his game.Like all great director's directors, Spike Lee, taking a que from Scorcese, picks a stale genre (the heist flick) and infuses it with his New York flair and socially conscious commentary. Sure, this is a film about the perfect crime (where robbing a bank is a cover for a much larger plot), but it also has the typical Spike Lee nods to society, race, and class struggles. There's plenty to delight in here, from Lee's self assured direction, to Denzel's perfect line delivery, to Clive Owen's oh-so-smooth performance as the heist-master extraordinaire, to Jodie Foster's atypical and surprisingly sexy turn as a consultant brought on the scene by the big-wigs to get things done. Foster, who has made a nice little niche as the prototypical 'powerful mother in crisis,' in films like 'Panic Room' and 'Flight Plan' is perfectly channeled here by Lee to turn her typical iciness into cool seduction, and who knew she had such great legs!? Leave it if Lee to channel the sexiness of everyday women. Take for instance the closing shot of Denzel's girlfriend lying in bed in her negligee twirling his hat with her feet. It's the type of classy, jazzy riff on sensuality and showmanship Lee revels in when he's not mad at the world. It's a perfect ending to 'Inside Man' and a reminder to the audience: sure, there may have been plot holes you could drive a swat team through, but who cares as long as you were entertained.",8,7,12,27 March 2006
The Happening," My Mood Ring Indicates Laughter
","Some mysterious 'event' causes people in the Northeast to start killing themselves (loved the Philadelphia Zoo scene!) and forces an unhappy couple (Mark Whalberg and Zooey Deschanel) to work on their marriage problems lest they die. The audience is put on the ground level as people react in different ways to the impending doom and the need to escape creates heightened paranoia. The half-decent set-up combined with an unintentionally funny screenplay make M. Night Shyamalan's eco-disaster flick 'The Happening' the most entertaining bad movie you'll see all year.Shyamalan has developed into a truly unique breed of director over the past decade. He's capable of crafting a decent thriller ('The Sixth Sense') but he's also been responsible for one the worst films ever made ('Signs') and some of the dumbest movies I have ever seen ('Wide Awake' and 'Lady in the Water'). Whereas his tactics in 'Signs' made me angry, I noticed something in 'Lady in the Water' that gave me a perverse sense of hope. That film was so bad, it was almost good. With 'The Happening', Shyamalan has finally crossed that threshold, and he's done it without irony or camp. He takes himself dead seriously, and he's crafted the crap in 'The Happening' beautifully. Special nods go to cinematographer Tak Fujimoto (who has become the premier photographer of trees and grass blowing in the wind) and James Newton Howard's excellent film score.In Shyamalan's 'Twilight Zone' universe, the scenes meant to be suspenseful or scary are instead hilarious, the moments meant to be emotional become banal, and the lines meant to be funny fall completely flat. The dialog in 'The Happening' is so bad I think the academy should go back and take away his best screenplay nomination for 'The Sixth Sense.' Watching poor Mark Whalberg (completely unbelievable as a science teacher who figures out what is happening) give what is possibly the worst performance of the last ten years makes you wonder how Shyamalan was ever able to direct Toni Collette and Haley Joel Osment to Oscar nods. Shyamalan leaves his cast, like the plants in the film, to blow in the wind without giving them a single helpful direction.Despite all this, I have to admit I loved every stupid piece of this movie from Zooey Deschanel's high-as-a-kite performance to the mood ring to Mark Whalberg talking to a potted plant to the crazy old lady in the woods to the people walking backwards. Shyamalan has performed a miracle by finally crafting another film that is suspenseful, but in all the wrong ways. When I wasn't busy laughing, I was on the edge of my seat wondering when the film would finally dive off the deep end into complete idiocy, and it did in that 'rifle' scene on the porch of the boarded-up house. Unlike an Uwe Boll who never showed a lick of talent, or a Michael Bay who has some technical skills but edits his films to the point of being unwatchable, Shyamalan has become an awful director whose films are completely watchable...and dare I say it...enjoyable.",4,8,17,17 June 2008
Mystic River," Flawed Yet Still Powerful and Thought Provoking Murder Mystery for Adults
","So the big question is does Clint Eastwood's 'Mystic River' deserve all the Oscar Buzz and lavish praise from critics?  Well, the answer, just like the answers given to many of the seedy dilemmas in this film about dark secrets amongst three friends reunited for the first time since childhood after one's teenage daughter is brutally murdered, is a difficult one.  Yes and no.  I think the reason 'Mystic River' has been praised to high heaven is that is represents the kind of old fashioned film-making so many critics wish Hollywood would return to.  This is a slow, dark, quiet, and morally ambiguous murder mystery directed by a beloved veteran (Eastwood) who really hasn't directed anything of substance in nearly a decade that serves as an acting showcase for some of Hollywood's finest performers.  It's solid entertainment for adults.  It's a competent, character driven adaptation of a best-selling suspense novel.  And most of all, it makes the audience think.  We think about the plot points, many of which have holes you can drive a truck through.  We think about character motivations.  Why did Sean Penn's character do that?  Why did Marcia Gay Harden's character not trust her husband (Tim Robbins)?  We think about the director's motivations.  Why was the lighting so dark?  Why was the music score so simple (yet oddly beautiful)?  We think about the point of it all.  We think what were they trying to convey here?  Is there any moral after all the misguided revenge and cover-ups?  Also, when was the last time you saw a thriller end with a climax that attempted to reach the level of Shakespearian tragedy and ALMOST succeed?  It may not be great film-making in that it comes up short, but it sure is good, and you have to celebrate it for trying.  So if heaping a film like this with too much praise leads people into the theater to see it, which in turn gets Hollywood to consider making a few more films like this instead of the homogenized drivel we normally see, then I'll be the first in line to rave about 'Mystic River.'",8,0,0,9 November 2003
The Departed," The Renaissance
","Martin Scorsese has reached a point in his career where he has free reign to do whatever he wishes as a director. It's hallowed ground for an auteur, and as such, every actor worth his salt would kill to work for him knowing full well that whatever Scorsese chooses to do will be an uncompromising work of art. With 'The Departed' he has quite possibly one of the greatest casts ever assembled. The deliciously convoluted plot based on the recent Asian flick 'Infernal Affairs' showcases Jack Nicholson as an Irish mob boss; Leonardo DiCaprio as an undercover cop infiltrating the crime ring; Matt Damon as the crime ring's inside man with the police unit assigned to bring them down; Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, and Mark Wahlberg as the cops working above Damon and DiCaprio; and a breakthrough role for Vera Farmiga as a police psychiatrist in a love triangle with Damon and DiCaprio. This brief but confusing rundown is merely the tip of the iceberg and reveals nothing of the plot twists and tension riddling every aspect of the film like bullet holes from a machine gun massacre. By now, Scorsese is to crime dramas what Hitchcock was to psychological thrillers. Comparatively, he's at the same point in his long career Hitchcock was when he gave us 'Rear Window,' 'Psycho,' and 'Vertigo.' Scorsese could've directed this blindfolded and it would've still been first rate. What's so thrilling about Scorsese as a filmmaker is that he's always directing full throttle with his eyes wide open. 'The Departed' is so ridiculously good it left me with chills afterward. After a brief departure to big budget Oscar pushes with 'Gangs of New York' and 'The Aviator,' Scorsese returns to the familiar ground of his most revered projects like 'Taxi Driver,' 'Raging Bull,' Goodfellas,' and 'Casino.' All his hallmarks are here: fantastic use of music, brilliantly choreographed bouts of violence, heart-pounding editing, deep and meaningful camera shots and movement, religious iconography, an epic and detailed sense of place (in this case, Boston), and highly quotable dialogue that is dramatic and funny and full of pathos in all the right places.With its rising tension and cat-and-mouse theatrics, 'The Departed' is easily the most viscerally thrilling studio film to come down the pike in many moons. Scorsese doesn't just treat us to his usual bag of tricks, he re-imagines them, and in exorcising perfectly balanced performances from an amazingly talented cast that in the hands of lesser director may have gone over-the-top, he delivers a modern day tragedy on par with greatest works of Shakespeare. For Scorsese, the big screen is his canvas, the camera his paint brush, and the blood splattered across the screen his awe-inspiring brush strokes. He's a veteran, he's a master, and 'The Departed' is his Renaissance.",10,6,12,9 October 2006
War of the Worlds," This is War Movie. This is a War Movie on Steroids. Any Questions?
","After channeling Kubrick for awhile (with 'A.I.' and 'Minority Report'), and delivering us two mildly entertaining larks ('Catch Me if You Can' and 'The Terminal'), Steven Spielberg finally returns to what he does best: crafting thrilling big-budget Summer tent-pole movies. Of course, this being the older more mature Spielberg, 'War of the Worlds' is far darker and more brooding than many of his past crowd pleasers, and it is also weighed down by the classically sentimental Spielberg cheese.Spielberg expertly weaves in some timely immediacy to his tale of alien invasion that adds to the mounting suspense and terror. He hauntingly reminds us of the shock and awe of 9/11 with his images of crowds running for their lives and buildings toppling. There's also a very effective sense of the unknown, which mirrors the terror and fear of New York City in the early moments of the attacks on the World Trade Center. 'Who is doing this do us, and is this the End of the World?' These are the same questions the citizens ask in the early moments of 'War of the Worlds'. Later in the movie, as the survivors are hiding in basements after the fall of civilization and the rise of the alien occupiers, we get a not-so-subtle but very meaningful reference to current geo-politics (pick your poison: the US involvement in Iraq, or the Israeli presence in Palestine). 'Occupations never succeed,' Tim Robbins' character reminds us all.All of that makes for a nice modernization of H.G. Wells' classic tale. The strenuous attempts at character development, however, keep the movie from reaching for greatness. The fractured family at the center of our story was in crisis long before the aliens arrived, and using the end of the world as a way to bridge the gap between broken relationships (particularly between father and child) is a bit quaint and cheesy despite the best efforts from the cast. Tom Cruise acquits himself nicely as the deadbeat dad fighting to survive and protect his children. For most of the movie, the superstar actor makes you forget he is Tom Cruise (that loathsome Scientology-loving, psychology-bashing, Katie Holmes-cradle-rocking, media whore), which is a real testament to his innate talents and Spielberg's deft direction. And Dakota Fanning's unnaturally natural yet very powerful performance as his scared daughter would've been more of a revelation had this actress not already been so grotesquely over-exposed at such a young age. Also, the overtly happy ending after the anti-climactic albeit faithful to the original source material demise of the aliens, is a bit of a letdown.In the end though, audiences should fear not, for Spielberg delivers those trademark long, lingering awe-inspiring money shots (alien tripods vaporizing towns from hilltops at night, a crowd in a frenzy to get on a ferry boat destined for doom foolishly thinking it is their only ticket to survival). For the excellent build-up of tension and those fantastic pay offs, this is Spielberg's best popcorn flick since 'Jurassic Park.'",8,1,6,4 July 2005
30 Days of Night," Best Vampire Movie in Over a Decade
","As night begins to fall for a thirty day spell over a small Alaskan outpost village, a motley crew of vampires comes waltzing in for a feast in David Slade's adaptation of the graphic novel, '30 Days of Night.' Ever since 'Interview with the Vampire' vampires have been depicted in films as something hip, cool, and sexy. Recently the idea of becoming a vampire is like making a fashion statement or becoming a Scientologist. In '30 Days of Night' the vampires are nameless, cunning, animal-like bloodsuckers and far from mindless zombies (which have been more popular of late). Finally, vampires are restored to film as monsters to be feared and not as some sympathetic and alluring subculture.The film grabs you from its opening shot of a man walking through a desolate snow covered landscape away from an ominous boat docked in the ice and never lets go. Director Slade wisely avoids many of the seizure-inducing trappings of recent horror films. Sure, there are the prerequisite quick-cuts in the intimate scenes of carnage, but there are also haunting wide-angled shots and one expertly staged bird's-eye-view crane shot when the vampires first begin dragging people out of their houses into the street. While successfully adapting some of the great imagery from the graphic novel, Slade is fully aware that this is still a film and shies away from CGI and overly-stylized lighting and effects that would detract from the sense of realism necessary in a far-fetched horror film such as this.Slade also makes good use of his cast. Danny Huston is perfectly creepy as the vampires' leader. Josh Hartnett, who is typically miscast and emotionless, actually fits well the role of a wooden Sheriff of a remote Alaskan town. Ben Foster, who always overacts, is used effectively here in a bit role as an over-the-top Reinfield-like character who ushers the vampires' arrival in town. Melissa George is pretty and sympathetic as Hartnett's estranged wife. Like many serious horror films of recent memory ('Dawn of the Dead' or 'The Descent') the film attempts some character development that is often 'emo' but never overplays its hand.Aside from being better directed and better acted than your run-of-the-mill horror flick, '30 Days of Night' is also fantastically gory. Decaptation aficionados will especially rejoice. Refreshing, too, is the way it takes its gore and action dead seriously. There are no silly one-liners or graphic sight gags. The characters are deeply affected by what they witness and what they have to do to survive. This is pure horror, and it's relentless.Yes, there are some missteps with the film's pacing and some huge leaps of logic in the amount of time that passes between events. However, for the shear originality of its central conceit, the intensity of the gore, and the haunting quality of many of its signature shots, David Slade's '30 Days of Night' is the most exhilarating horror film since Danny Boyle's original '28 Days Later' and the best vampire film since Francis Ford Coppola delivered 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' back in 1992.",8,267,407,23 October 2007
There Will Be Blood," The World of Blood and Oil According to Plainview
","There's a recurring nightmare of mine where I am falling down a well. Our reality is an illusion. This life is simply the dream we have while we are actually falling down a well. It always seemed as if the well was bottomless. After watching 'There Will Be Blood' I discovered the well has a bottom. At the bottom of the well is one thing. Oil.Also falling down this well was 'The Performance.' Watching Daniel Day Lewis play the unstoppable, unshakable, unfathomably misanthropic and greedy oil man that is Daniel Plainview, one is left to imagine that 'The Performance' was always out there. It always existed somewhere in the ether, in our collective unconscious, in our nightmares and anxieties. It took a visionary auteur like Paul Thomas Anderson to realize that if he did a modern film update of Upton Sinclair's early 20th century novel 'Oil!' and ominously renamed it 'There Will Be Blood' then this performance could be channeled onto celluloid as a testament to the defining struggles of 21st century mankind.Blistering cinematography of stark California landscapes from Robert Elswit, an evocatively organic and haunting music score from Jonny Greenwood (from the rock band Radiohead), and the beautifully fluid movement and framing of Paul Thomas Anderson's maniacally calculating camera grab you from scene one and never let go. Daniel Day Lewis moves through the film like a cold burning firestorm combining and combusting with the technical elements and the fabulous ensemble cast around him to create a rising tension that is unlike anything experienced in cinema since the golden era of Stanley Kubrick.The story is multilayered and allegorical. Led to an untapped area floating in dust on rivers of oil by a mysterious young man, Plainview soon comes face to face with that young man's twin brother, Eli Sunday (a fecklessly manipulative Paul Dano). Eli is a wunderkind preacher at the Church of the Third Revelation and has the town wrapped around his finger with his claims to be a healer and prophet. Eli agrees to let Plainview buy his family's land for the right price. The profits are to be used to build a bigger church. But when Plainview refuses to let Eli properly bless the drill site, a series of events unfold that Eli trumpets as acts of 'God' while Plainview views them as results of meddling people he can scarcely see any good in and must crush.The heart of the movie lies in Plainview's relationship with his adopted son H. W. (a wonderfully naturalistic and quietly expressive Dillon Freasier). When the boy is injured on a drilling site and loses his hearing, Plainview, torn by his love for the idea of the boy looking up to him and the friendly face the boy has leant to the family business, abandons him only to latch on to a shady vagabond (Kevin J. O'Connor) who trots into town claiming to be his long lost brother Henry. Plainview's replacing of a fake son with a fake brother shows his character's deep-seeded and wounded need to connect to someone when insatiable greed has been his only driving force.To explore in detail the film's deeper message and resonance for today's audience would be to spoil the ending. Suffice it to say, after the slowly infectious, nerve-shattering build-up, the film culminates with a soliloquy from Plainview to Eli that will make your jaw drop. In the end, it lives up to its title. There was blood. Whose was spilled is not a matter of debate, but what that blood says to its 21st century audience will be discussed and argued and studied for years to come. If you want to know what happens when greed guised in religious zealotry falls down a dark seemingly bottomless well with greed blatant as corporate capitalism, look no further than this film. There is a bottom to that well. There is a winner at the finish line. Meanwhile the blood is on the floor, the walls, the desert sand, the silver screen, the nightly news, and pumping through our bodies until we die.",10,12,23,6 January 2008
Downfall," Fascinating but Cold German Entry into its own History.
","'Downfall' is a fascinating and compelling look at the mindset of the German people at the end of WWII, inspired mostly by the firsthand account of one of Hitler's secretaries who survived the madness that was his bunker in those last days. Here we have an excellent performance from Bruno Ganz as Adolph Hitler, who shows the man's insanity, inhumanity, and his cunning way with people in his intimate circle that allowed him to seduce those around him and the German population at large. Even as everything was falling apart he still had both men and women falling at his knees begging for his next proclamation and willing to follow any order her decreed. In the end, the crushing defeat of his grand ideals, coupled with his irrational hatred for Jewish people that is actually a projection of his own inner hatred for himself and Germany ('The Germans seal their own fate. I have no sympathy for the so-called civilians,' he says towards the end of days), lead him into paranoid despair and eventual suicide. Likewise, we get a searing performance from Julian Kohler (a fantastic actress best known for her lead in 'Nowhere in Africa') as Eva Braun, representing perfectly the German elite seduced by the promises of a Utopian Third Reich, and who are in utter and complete denial of the horrors around them right up to the last minute as everything they fought for comes spiraling down into their own self-made hell.One of the few flaws of the film is that it can't decide at times whether to be a straightforward docu-drama (there are often too many of Hitler's inner circle to keep track of) or a soaring WWII epic (there's some compelling subplots revolving around Hitler's youth movement added for dramatic effect). While it may not reach the sublime artistic ideals of 'The Pianist' or have the emotional heft of 'Schindler's List' or 'Saving Private Ryan,' 'Downfall' deserves a place next to those films for it's unique perspective, for better or worse, on one of the most influential men of the last hundred years and the defining moments of the 20th century.",8,9,13,8 August 2005
The Last King of Scotland," Forest Whitaker-Scary as Hell
","'The Last King of Scotland' is a slickly made powder keg of a film about Idi Amin's (Forest Whitaker) horrific dictatorship over Uganda in the 1970's as seen through the eyes of his fictionalized Scottish doctor (James McAvoy). Whitaker is mesmerizing from the word 'go' and brilliantly displays how captivating a character Amin was: charming, theatrical, paranoid, and mad as hell.Director Kevin MacDonald only alludes to the horrors (300,000 massacred) while delivering a music-video style account of the free-wheeling decadence of Amin's regime while he still played in favor to his people. Much of the film runs like the early parts of P.T. Anderson's 'Boogie Nights' or any gangster saga from Scrorsese: hyper-edited, smoothly shot scenes depicting humor, violence, sex, nudity, and overly-indulged individuals new to money and power. It would've been more compelling had tighter focus been paid to Amin instead of the highly unlikable doctor character, who for the most part comes across as a flighty, over-educated twit with foggy ideas on good deeds and uncontrollable hormones that lead him to hounding after every marginally attractive married woman he comes across, including a barely recognizable Gillian Anderson donning a British accent, and Kerry Washington as Amin's third wife (duh, doc!). About two-thirds of the way through, MacDonald lets Whitaker loose, and his rampage is awe-inspiring. It culminates in a pulse-pounding white-knuckle twenty minutes that muddle a historical event concerning Israeli hostages with the shockingly brutal finale of the young Scott's stay in Uganda. Again, it would've been more emotionally involving had the doctor been more deserving of our sympathy. Still, Whitaker is fuming and unforgettable. He totally embodies the spirit of the oft-discussed and debated mad dictator, so much so that when the closing credits roll and we see stock footage of the real Amin, you'd swear these were images of Idi Amin playing Forest Whitaker.",7,112,137,15 October 2006
Stranger Than Fiction," Detailed, Astute, Eclectic, and Entertaining Pseudo-Comedy
","'Stranger than Fiction' is the complex tale of a simple IRS man named Harold Crick (an appealing Will Ferrel) who one day awakes to his own voice-over narration only to find he is the unwitting main character in the new tragic novel from acclaimed author Karen Eiffel (an excellent return to form for Emma Thompson). Imagine a Charlie Kaufman penned film where all the cynicism and nihilism is replaced with an endearing and heartfelt melancholy that creates a surprising amount of emotional involvement in characters who would've otherwise been over-reaching literacy devices, and you'll get a feel for the sincere type of entertainment Marc Forster's film provides.Forster, with his keen eye and eclectic visual sense, populates the film the sharp and contrasting visual angles, camera tricks, and in-frame oddities (like the play with numbers) constantly keeping the viewer engaged and on their toes. Fun supporting turns from Dustin Hoffman as a literary theorist employed by Krick to help find out if the story he is in is a comedy or tragedy, and Queen Latifah as Eiffel's no-nonsense publishing assistant help guide the viewers through imaginative stretches that are occasionally too clever by half. Ferrel gets to show some nice range here, and much like Robin Williams did with 'The World According to Garp' and Jim Carrey did with 'The Truman Show,' graduates with honors into more high-minded quasi-serious roles. His co-lead Thompson is subtly method and well studied as the reclusive sociopathic author who just can't help killing her characters.What really seals the deal is Maggie Gyllenhal as Farrell's love interest, the anti-establishment baker he is assigned to audit. She literally lights up the screen. There's one expertly framed and perfectly lit shot of her standing outside her townhouse inviting Farrel in for the night where the light from street lamp off screen is filtered in through the shadows of tree branches and hits her face in such a way that in that brief flickering frame you become insanely happy to be watching such a pleasant marriage of literary concepts inside a visual medium. At this point you don't care how the film ends. You're just grateful to experience that giddy moment of pure movie entertainment.",8,216,259,19 November 2006
The Wrestler," Down and Out in New Jersey
","A fading wrestling star (Mickey Rourke, perfectly cast) suffers a heart attack and must battle with being down and out in Sh*thole, New Jersey in Darren Aronofsky's gritty character piece, 'The Wrestler.' Message to Hollywood: there actually are nice places in Jersey...really...I'm not joking...trust me...but that's another story.Aronofsky utilizes a self-consciously shaky camera and grainy cinematography to emphasize his depiction of a life literally on the ropes. For much of the film we are walking with the camera behind Rourke seeing everything from his point of view--another stylistic choice that may wear on some viewer's nerves while seem like a stroke of genius to others.Admittedly I've never understood the appeal of pro wrestling, but I imagined it could be a decent vehicle for a character drama. Aronofsky delivers a mixed bag in this respect. Despite the expertly edited piece detailing the humorously brutal and tragic bout that leads to the aforementioned heart attack and the match that closes the film, the remainder of the wrestling bits are unnecessary and really add nothing to the story. The scenes in a shady gentleman's club (featuring a fabulously adept Marisa Tomei playing the over-the-hill but still hot stripper friend with a heart of gold) and the clips detailing Rourke's character's everyday struggles (including some great bits where he works a deli counter) are slightly more appealing and deliver some genuine moments. However, the scenes where he attempts to reconcile with his estranged daughter (an over-acting Evan Rachel Wood) seem staged and under-developed, which undermines the documentary style feel of the rest of the film. I won't deny I felt something for these characters, but haven't we seen this all before?As finely tailored as Mickey Rourke is to his part, his is essentially a one-note character where we see him in varying stages of failure that lead him to believe the only place he can find acceptance is in the phony but dangerous world inside the ring. As good as Rourke and Tomei are, the script plays their story safe and succumbs to clich√©s. That being said, 'The Wrestler' is still more engaging than your average Hollywood character study, and it's worth viewing for the occasionally authentic moment and the fine performances from Rourke and Tomei. But as Bruce Springsteen's theme song played over a black screen before the credits rolled, I couldn't help feeling sorry for Rourke and his character--and maybe that was the point. They try their hardest, but the film in which they appear isn't worth the hype.",7,4,7,9 January 2009
Ray," Superb Biopic
","'Ray' is grand entertainment. It does everything you want a fact-based personal biopic to do. It's educational, it is anchored by a powerhouse performance from the lead actor in the title role (the amazing Jamie Foxx), and above all it's entertaining. Despite a bloated run time, I was never bored thanks to the fantastic music and wonderful acting (someone give Regina King a supporting actress nod, please). Director Taylor Hackford directs the film in a very straightforward and simple way so that we can focus on the character and the real story and not be distracted by the style over the substance. There are carefully placed poignant flashbacks that give the film an emotional heft I was not expecting, and the film works best when Hackford shows how the darkest moments in Ray Charles' life (the death of his little brother, his womanizing, his drug addiction, the fighting with his managers and friends, the loneliness) are where he was able to create his most meaningful music. It is in these moments where the movie becomes truly uplifting. Ray was no saint, but he was able to rise from both the metaphorical and physical darkness that surrounded his life through sharing his gift of music with others. And it is in the darkness of the movie theater where the artist most connects with the audience.",8,1,2,26 November 2004
Paths of Glory," Stands the Test of Time
","An arrogant French general (a superb George Macready) orders his men on a suicide mission and then has the gall to try to court marshal and execute three of them for cowardice in the face of the enemy. A former lawyer turned colonel (Kirk Douglas in his prime) is the voice of reason against gross injustice. This excellently staged and wonderfully acted production is as much an acting showcase for Douglas as it is a directorial masterstroke by a young Stanley Kubrick who adapted this to the screen from a novel based on actual accounts.Kubrick displays a great control of sound effects and camera movement in the brief but effective battle scenes that expertly depict the controlled chaos that was trench warfare during WWI. Things get juicier during the ensuing courtroom battle where the deafening disparity between the elite who propagate and profit from war and the common citizens who suffer and die in war is shown with great lucidity.Unlike later Kubrick epics, this runs at a crisp 90 minutes, though suffers briefly from a slow and awkwardly staged opening ten minutes before Douglas comes on screen. Ultimately, this holds up very well to modern scrutiny thanks to the flawlessness of Kurbick's craft, the amazing ensemble acting, and the surprising depth of its philosophical and psychological pondering. 'Paths of Glory' is more anti-arrogance than anti-war, and is unapologetically sentimental and pro-soldier. As such, much can still be gleaned from its message.",9,108,118,28 July 2007
The Queen," Paparazzi Kissed the Princess
","The paparazzi kissed the princess that fateful week in 1997, but all the English people wanted was their Queen. Stephen Frears' competent, well written, expertly cast and intimate look into the Royal Family and British government in the aftermath of Princess Diana's death is a straightforward, no-nonsense stunner.Operating both as a comedy of manners where the newly elected Prime Minister Tony Blair (an excellent Michael Sheen) must save the Royal Family from themselves before the Monarchy is tossed aside completely by an angry, guilt-ridden public desperately wanting a statement, a word of comfort, or at very least the presence in London of their Queen Elizabeth II (played masterfully by Helen Mirren, who is as cold and stubborn here as she was conflicted and passionate as Elizabeth I in the HBO miniseries of the same name earlier this year), and also as a surprisingly touching testament to the British people's love affair with Princess Diana and more importantly the Monarchy, 'The Queen' succeeds splendidly on multiple levels.Frears combines archival footage of a grieving public and newscasts with intertwining splices of historical recreations and fictionalized riffs on what it must've been like inside the Royal Chambers. The writers get the mannerisms of the Royals down perfect, as people with stiff upper lips who declare their outrage with words like 'quite' and 'that's not how it's done!' One miscalculation is when the writers try to create a connection between Blair's love for his deceased mother and his newfound sense of protectionism over Elizabeth. It's only surface level, and Freudian, and seems rather out of place in an otherwise totally British film. The rest of the Royals serve as a sideshow, with Prince Charles wimpy and ineffective in the presence of his mother, Prince Phillip (James Cromwell) a rowdy lout, and the Queen Mother (Sylvia Sims) providing equal parts comic relief and aristocratic wisdom to her daughter.In the end, 'The Queen' is a film that sneaks up on you, funnier and more touching than you imagined, and anchored by a classic turn from a consummate British actress as a Queen who desires to understand her people and do them proud while honoring the traditions of her lineage.",8,84,135,9 October 2006
Raging Bull," I've Heard Things..I've Heard Things...
","'Raging Bull' is routinely named one of the greatest films of all time. 'Scorsese was robbed! This is his best film! This should've been Best Picture of 1980!' are the typical battle cries. Watching the film now, it emerges as one of those films I respect wholeheartedly as a Scorsese fan, and more importantly, as a film buff. It's not on my favorite films of all time list, and as far as Scorsese goes, I enjoyed 'Goodfellas' and 'The Departed' far more. Still, it is an uncompromising example of film as art.First, we have the usually bombastic Scorsese, beautifully subdued here from the classical music to the graceful camera movements to the haunting black and white photography. Second, we have Robert DeNiro as boxer Jake LaMotta giving the performance of his career that rightfully won him the Oscar. Thirdly we have all that we come to expect from a Scorsese film: iconic shots (like the pan to the blood dripping from the ropes), quotable dialog ('I've heard things. I've heard things'), and his rich archetypes (DeNiro and Pesci in their love/hate relationship as brothers, and a raspy and sassy Cathy Moriarity in the objectified wife-as-whore role). The fight scenes are the most artistically satisfying of any boxing film that has come before or since.Finally, it contains something only in which a rabid movie buff can find joy. It contains the link between two of my favorite directors: Martin Scorsese and David Lynch. As Joe Pesci watches one of the fights on TV, Pabst Blue Ribbon appears as the corporate sponsor. Later, in a scene where DeNiro is being interviewed at his Florida home, a Tony Bennet version of 'Blue Velvet' can be heard playing in the background. The movie gods shined down on us six years later when David Lynch made his classic thriller 'Blue Velvet,' which, in no small coincidence, featured prominently, Pabst Blue Ribbon as the favorite drink of Dennis Hopper's psychotic Frank Booth.",10,5,8,2 January 2007
Iron Man," Adequate Cure for Cinematic Anemia
","The crown prince of America's premier weapons manufacturer Tony Stark (a sober Robert Downey Jr.) grows a conscience after being captured by terrorists in Afghanistan and decides to fight for what's right in an innovative piece of body armor technology that will henceforth be known as 'Iron Man' in Jon Favreau's predictable but fun Marvel comic film adaptation.Wisely abandoning the corny mawkishness of the 'Spiderman' films and the recent attempt to revive the 'Superman' franchise, 'Iron Man' instead offers up some light satire, bright-eyed cynicism, and an attempt at witty banter. The always lovely Gwyneth Paltrow is a delight as Stark's sassy assistant Pepper Potts, and it's nice to see her doing something light and fun for a change. Also part of the off-kilter cast are Terrence Howard as Stark's inexplicable military friend and Jeff Bridges bald and bearded as Stark's mentor (and dun dun dun...enemy?) Downey Jr. apparently ad-libbed much of the dialog, which sometimes falls flat, but for the most part works. It's certainly far more enjoyable than the typical fan-boy in-jokes that plague most comic book movies.Certainly this is no 'Batman Begins' in terms of depth and scope of drama, but with slam-bang special effects and an effortless feel (despite a slow build up to the action), 'Iron Man' certainly fits the bill as a better than average comic book/action film. Is it any wonder critics and audiences have embraced it so warmly after suffering through loud obnoxious dreck like 'Transformers?' While it has been a bit oversold, 'Iron Man' proves that great special effects can be built around a smart story that doesn't have to pander to the lowest common denominator. Until 'The Dark Knight' it will have to cure our cinematic anemia.",7,7,16,6 May 2008
Casino Royale," The Good, the Bad, the Ugly...and the Beautiful Eva Green
","'Casino Royale' is the 21st 'official' James Bond movie, and as the longest running franchise in movie history, let's get down to the basics: The Good: Daniel Craig adds a cold, hard edge to Bond that hasn't been there in a long time. We'll have to wait and see over the course of the next few films if he can hold a candle to Sean Connery, but he has an acting range that surpasses Pierce Brosnan and is already miles ahead of Roger Moore.Eva Green as Vesper Lynd is the best Bond Girl since Diana Rigg in 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service.' She's a natural beauty who lights up the screen every time she is in frame. While some of her banter with Craig falls flat, the character development the writers give her makes her the most complex and fascinating female character since Rigg's Tracy Di Vicenzo, and Green is a good enough actress to pull it off.Also, Chris Cornell's Bond Theme Song, 'You Know my Name' is the best one since Paul McCartney's 'Live and Let Die.'The Bad: As dark and serious and true to Ian Fleming's original incarnation everyone tries to keep the film, Martin Campell (of 'Goldeneye' and 'Mask of Zorro' fame) is still just a run-of-the-mill action-adventure director, which means he can pull off some fun stunts that look great, but he has no sense of style to carry off some of the more intense moments. He seems to exist only to dangle stunt-men from various objects in midair, which makes the opening chase scene at a Madagascar construction site the most entertaining bit.The Ugly: I appreciate everyone's desire to strip Bond back down to the basics, but he needs a villain to play off, and the asthmatic poker playing terrorist power broker who cries blood (dumb!) just didn't cut it. Give the audience something to chew on. Nobody complained about them keeping the one-liners, the hot girls, or the hot cars...so let's get a villain worth routing against next time.The product placement (especially when he drives a Ford in Montenegro before getting his Astin-Martin) is so in-your-face it becomes distracting--so was the ridiculous Richard Branson cameo in the airport. This is just bad movie making no matter how you cut it.Finally, this felt like the longest movie I have sat through since 'Lord of the Rings: Return of the King' and I think this was at least forty-five minutes shorter. That's not a good thing for a franchise action movie, no matter how much reinvention was going on.Bottom Line: Wiping away most of the silliness of the last two Brosnan flicks, a leaner, meaner Bond has been delivered that still has many flaws. Comparing this to similar and more recent franchises, this is far superior to the 'Mission:Impossible' episodes, but not nearly as deliciously convoluted, clever, or emotionally involving as the Jason Bourne flicks.",6,3,8,21 November 2006
Signs," The Worst Movie of the Year, and one of the biggest Clunkers of All Time
","I normally don't post reviews of movies I hate, but when so many people seemed to have loved this film and fallen victim to Shyamalan's shyster film making tactics, I feel I need to voice my opinion.Yes, I understand that this was in actuality a film about faith and family. I also understand that the 'crop circle/alien' aspect of the film was simply a tool to simultaneously get people in the seats and test the faith of the story's characters.  But does that mean that all of the gaping plot holes involving the aliens (which I will not list here because so many other posts already have pointed them out) should be forgiven?  Of course not. Regardless of the director's motives regarding the aliens, this is still bad movie making.  There are also many plot holes involving the family (which have also been listed ad nauseum).  Plot holes aside, it's still just a flat out lousy movie.  Shyamalan takes himself and his stories way too seriously.  He thinks way too highly of himself.  He wants to be the greatest director of this generation, a hybrid master somewhere between Spielbergian sentimentality and Hitchcockian thrills.  He also seems to be repeating himself already with his past three films in trying to perfect a new genre--the tear-jerk thriller.  I think Shyamalan is capable of making good movies.  'The Sixth Sense' was a decent, well crafted, well acted film, although not nearly as great as many propose. He can also make interesting films.  'Unbreakable' was probably the only film where I was totally enthralled by the first hour or so, and then flat out hated the film by the last half hour.  'Signs' could have been a decent B-movie (even if it was still about faith and family) but Shyamalan approached the material far too reverently, as did all the actors.  Just because a movie is about faith doesn't mean it is good, or even well intentioned.  Again, with his supposed twist of an ending (and what a wretched ending this movie had), Shyamalan seems to think every movie has to have a twist (and a moral).  'Sixth Sense' had a good and appropriate twist. 'Unbreakable' had an appalling and ridiculous twist (ewww...it was actually a comic book movie BOOO HISSSSSSS) and 'Signs' has a completely inept and unnecessary twist, that really isn't a twist at all.  In fact, this really wasn't a movie at all.  This movie was neither scary nor touching, nor well made nor well intentioned.  There isn't a rating low enough to indicate how much I hated this film.",1,12,25,24 February 2003
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," 'I'm famous for my intolerance.'
","Vicky (a neurotic and sexy Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (a neurotic and gorgeous Scarlett Johansson) are two American tourists in Spain examining their differing views on love in Woody Allen's breezy and alluring 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona'. Amidst a tempestuous summer in Barcelona, the ladies are both seduced by a free-thinking painter (a perfect Javier Bardem) whose own life is complicated by his still passionate relationship with his ex-wife (a devastating Penelope Cruz, who has never looked more beautiful).Much like the change from New York City to London invigorated Allen in 'Match Point', this vacation to Spain has revived some of the director's more artistic aspirations. The scenery is postcard perfect but drenched in that same dizzying lushness that made Allen's view of NYC so intoxicating in 'Manhattan'. The churches, the homes, the art museums, the countryside, the intimate city streets and touristy details make you feel like you are visiting Barcelona along with Allen and his cast.There's also sharpness to the trademark Woody dialog that has been missing for quite some time. Like all of Allen films, this one is endlessly talky, but there's some great subversion when certain lines that seem like throw-aways actually pack a punch when given a second thought. When Bardem first attempts to talk Johansson's character into bed, he says something clich√©d about her being hard to please. Quick witted, Johansson replies, 'I'm famous for my intolerance.' She says it casually, but it packs a bite as it's the complete antithesis of her character's outward desire to be someone who rallies against cultural norms, and she presents herself as someone who is easy-going and tolerant of all.Allen also displays a keen sense of pacing when he creates tension in his build up to Cruz's appearance after her character is endlessly talked about but never seen until about half way through the film. When Cruz finally arrives, her moody whirling dervish of a performance is the perfect spice to liven up the soupy proceedings. Her seething, fiery line readings combined with looks that could kill make her the front-runner for Best Supporting Actress at the Oscars.The baseline archetypal characters are essentially clich√©d, but the way in which Allen handles all of their interpersonal relationships is fairly sophisticated and entertaining even when it grows absurd. There is of course that kiss between Scarlett and Penelope but also some moments of Lynchian-lite when Allen photographs the brunette Hall and blonde Johansson similarly to make them seem like they are two sides of the same woman. There's even more weirdness when die-hard Woody fans realize that in some perverse way Scarlett Johansson's character is the 'Woody' part--as in any film he does not star, there is always one character who represents the part he would've played had he been in it. However, film buffs will enjoy some of the nice touches like when Hall and another go to see Hitchcock's 'Shadow of a Doubt' (one of my all time favorite films) or the repetitive use of a Spanish guitar in the soundtrack whenever Bardem and Hall get together. But then there's the mostly unnecessary voice-over narration that fills in expository gaps and shows Allen can still be a lazy tactician.Woody Allen has always been an acquired taste, even more so in his latter years when he sometimes forgets how to provoke, but his fans should be delighted with this latest European flavored effort. In the end, you'll feel like Javier Bardem is the luckiest man in the world, Penelope Cruz is operating at the echelon of her appeal, and Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson, well, they'll always have Barcelona.",9,173,255,21 August 2008
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Her Majesty!!!!!!!
","It's really not so odd that director Shekhar Kapur would wait nine years and then craft a loud, bombastic sequel to his only claim to fame, the lavish period drama 'Elizabeth' which rightfully launched the career of uber-actress Cate Blanchett, in an attempt to resurrect his own floundering career. It is rather odd that Blanchett, a consummate actress of incalculable range, seems to never turn down a script, including this dud of a sequel to the film that first allowed her to shine. The oddest thing, however, is that the completely uncalled for 'Elizabeth: The Golden Age' is actually quite entertaining and might've received higher praise had the intrusive music score not induced such a numbing headache.Blanchett, of course, is terrific, and doesn't seem to mind that the screenwriters have turned her signature character into a woman with split personalities: a raving love-scorned woman in private who constantly crumbles under pressure, and a powerful monarch who commands the wind and becomes a divinity to her people in public. Elizabeth has no character arc here like she did in the original film that saw her mature from frightened princess to calculating queen. The sequel suffers from this lack of development for its titular historical icon, but Blanchett rules the madhouse with an iron fist, chewing the scenery when necessary for dramatic effect and maximum entertainment value.The sequel also suffers from too much focus on a silly love triangle involving Elizabeth, Sir Walter Raleigh (an uninspired Clive Owen), and one of her ladies in waiting (a ravishingly gorgeous but ultimately lifeless Abbie Cornish). The rest of the film covers events that were already treated in a more respectful and quietly powerful manner in HBO's miniseries starring Helen Mirren. These include Elizabeth's divisive relationship with Mary Stuart (a blistering Samantha Morton doing an entertaining bit of over-acting), and the defeat of the Spanish Armada, whose sinking is done up in a rock opera style that serves as a guilty pleasure to watch.Meanwhile, director Kapur, who never saw an overhead shot, candlelit scene, or 360 degree crane movement he didn't love, uses his bigger budget to ridiculously grand effect creating immaculate set designs populated with over the top costuming and epic pageantry. 'Elizabeth: The Golden Age' is completely unnecessary, but despite some of its stunning ineptitude, it turns out not to be a colossal waste of time and will entertain those who will allow it to bludgeon them. Where the first film was a smart period piece inspired by 'The Godfather', the silly sequel is a dumb art-house film inspired by obnoxious action flicks. Blanchett, who hopefully will become more selective in her roles as she ages, oddly seems at home in both. I'm not sure if that's the mark of a great actress or a desperate movie star.",6,6,9,10 February 2008
Identity," Crap-tacular
","*POTENTIAL SPOILERS*Good horror movies work best when you care about the characters. Thanks to a trite plot twist about half way through, I ended up not giving a hoot about the so-called 'characters' trapped at the hotel in the rain with a killer in this well-made but ultimately bogus slasher/mystery flick. 'Identity' starts off as a mildly entertaining combination of an Agatha Christie mystery and a good old 'who's getting axed next' horror romp. But then it tries to be clever with the most over-used of plot twists (all I will say is MPD) and alienates the audience in the process. The cast is very good, especially Cusack, Liotta, and Amanda Peet (an interesting actress who really needs a new agent and more confidence, as I predict she could blow us away in the right role but who has been regulated to the worst comedies or recent memory), but they all could do better than this slick thriller that is more dumb than clever. I was almost ready to forgive the film and pass it off as a moderately enjoyable flick, until one final plot twist at the end irked me to the point that I hated it. The ending is ludicrous and is even more painful to sit through thanks to some of the worst special effects of recent memory (which was surprising considering the decent production values up until that point). Oh well...rent something else.",5,5,9,13 July 2003
Beowulf," Chasing the Dragon
","*The following is a review of the digital 3D version showing at select theaters: Robert Zemeckis has always been a trailblazer with film technology. He was among the first to utilize CGI in 'Death Becomes Her' and with his adaptation of the oldest surviving epic poem in the English language, he perfects the life-like digital computer animation he first experimented with in 'The Polar Express'. Like his canon of films over the years, 'Beowulf' is an eye-popping mixed bag of cinematic tricks.The animation has come to a point where it is eerily life-like. In 'Beowulf' every blade of grass, every tree branch, and every strand of hair has been painstakingly detailed. And while it is hard to tell the difference between the digital Angelina Jolie and the real Angelina Jolie, there's still something about the human face, the nuances of the muscular features, the emotion running beneath, that this technology will never capture. It still depicts hollow, cold clones of real human beings that could never fully replace 3D flesh and blood.What makes 'Beowulf' so entertaining is the digital 3D technology. It creates some breathtaking vistas where you feel as if the landscapes are moving through you. In some of the more horrific scenes with Grendel, you'll find yourself jumping out of your skin. Zemeckis is like a magician with this technology. He's able to bleed something out of nothing by knowing how to get the reactions he wants from his audience with just the right sound effect, camera angle, and quick-cut to complete his trick. It's often ugly, but quite breathtaking.Zemeckis loses some ground when he relies too much on juvenile machismo grandstanding to further character development. Sure, I love a good death by chandelier scene or a man getting ripped in half by a monster bit as much as the next guy, but all the bawdy humor wears thin. Even lamer was the scene where Beowulf fights Grendel in the buff, which contained almost as many laugh inducing sight gags as the scene where Bart skateboarded nude through Springfield in this summer's 'The Simpsons Movie.' The mixed bag of tricks and sometimes slow build-up, however, eventually lead to a totally thrilling finale where Beowulf does battle with the dragon his misdeeds begot. In 3D, it's nerve-shattering fun. As an action adventure film, it makes the mark.Ultimately you realize why this story has survived over 1200 years. 'Beowulf' makes legendary the idea of a hero's fallibility and the global consequences of the sins of the father. These are universal themes that have been sung again and again in everything from Shakespeare to this year's best film, 'Before the Devil Knows You're Dead.' While the technology used to make this film may seem dated in a few years, the story will live on, and this just may be the definitive 'Beowulf' for high school English teachers to use in their lame attempts to connect with their students. The savvier kids won't be fooled, but there's worse ways to pass the time in class.",6,60,94,18 November 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," Good Old-Fashioned Shattered Glass Action Flick
","'Live Free or Die Hard' is quite a refreshing piece of entertainment this summer in the wake of so many effects-driven computer simulated action/fantasy films. With its silly title, smart-alleck lead character (Bruce Willis as Bruce Willis doing John McClane), and loads of old fashioned stunts involving cars, SUV's, elevator shafts, big rigs, helicopters, fighter jets, and collapsing highway bridges, this flick is a great piece of shattered-glass entertainment--a throwback to the late 1980's and early 1990's when movies like the original 'Die Hard' changed the face of movie action.There is some frustration to be had when you start to realize how much they toned down to achieve the friendly PG-13 rating. There's far less profanity flying, and while the body count is astronomically high (the collateral damage in this film in terms of human life and damaged property is tres magnifique), there's little blood and guts to be found. Still, die hard 'Die Hard' action fans should rest assured knowing there will be plenty of funny one-liners, hot chicks (a wonderful Maggie Q as the bad-ass female villain and the scorchingly feisty and cute Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Lucy McClane), super smart bad guys (a very good Timothy Olyphant), and jaw-dropping death-defying stunts. Director Len Wiseman orchestrates the complicated stunts very well like a masterful puppeteer, which is a shock considering how god-awful his 'Underworld' films were. The hand-to-hand human match-ups still bear some of his annoying hallmarks, but he's learned how to blow things up really well and has learned a thing or two about scope and editing in big action set-pieces. The excellent pacing and preposterousness of the stunts (especially the climax involving the fighter jet and the big rig) certainly put a smile on my face.There's a whole lot of computer hacking related mumbo-jumbo involved in the story, and there's a lot of downtime for male bonding and 'explanation' of the finer plot points that slows the film down some but is actually nice to see in a world now ruled by Michael Bay-style non-stop action. Plenty dumb, plenty thrilling, and plenty of fun, 'Live Free or Die Hard' is a pleasant surprise considering how unnecessary this sequel seemed from conception.",7,134,215,6 July 2007
Munich," Spielberg, the Apologetic
","In the opening scene of Steven Spielberg's 'Munich,' a group of friendly American athletes help a small army of Palestinian terrorists who they mistake for fellow Olympians over the fence into the Olympic village where they later take hostage and massacre the entire Israeli Olympic team. It's a great and knowing way to begin the year's last political thriller in the year of political thrillers. 'Munich,' helmed by one of film's modern masters ends the year of politics in populist entertainment with a bang.There's a confusing sense of anarchy in the first twenty minutes of yet another bloated run time where Spielberg cuts back and forth between archival news footage, viewer reactions, and the graphic reenactments of the terrorist act that overshadowed the 1972 Olympiad. Shortly after the tragedy, a covert arm of the Israeli government plots their retaliation. You don't get much back story on those involved, with the exception of the character played by Eric Bana (best known as the 'Incredible Hulk'), and it wasn't until after the plot was set into motion that I even realized the stately elderly woman heading it all up was the Prime Minister. Those not well versed in the actual events that shape the film may get lost here.Once the team of 'ordinary' assassins is assembled (among them the excellent Ciaran Hinds best know as Julius Caesar in TV's 'Rome' and future James Bond, Daniel Craig), the thriller mechanizations are set into place. Spielberg and his normal cohorts, composer John Williams and cinematographer Janusz Kaminksi, are firing on all cylinders during the meatiest part of the movie and clearly at the top of their games. Spielberg does a lot of crafty dissolves (that are both artistically beautiful and revoltingly gritty in some of their excessive violence and gore), as he weaves his haunting tale. As the assassins pick off targets and go from one scenic European locale to the next, we are treated to pacing that matches the best of Hitchcock's thrillers, and plot points that mirror the best characteristics of a John Le Carre spy novel.Of course, what we have here is Spielberg at his most self important. For all its rote thriller aspects, this is a political time bomb of a movie with a lot of things to say about terrorism. Though told from the point of view of Israelis acting out of a sense of vengeful justice, it really takes no sides, and shows how all involved think their cause is worth fighting and dying for, and all surrender their values once caught up into the international terrorist machine of bombings, assassinations, retaliations, and double crossings. Still, you also have to give credit to Spielberg, who even at his most austere is still a giddy populist. Who else would have the foresight to team up Julius Caesar (Hinds), the Incredible Hulk (Bana), and James Bond (Craig) as a team of merry assassins? To mirror the winking opening scene, there is a great closing scene as well, where one character tries to painfully resume a normal life in New York City. The camera lingers on a pretty skyline shot along the river with the World Trade Center looming large and reminding us that terrorism knows no boundaries and has the power to consume us all.",9,41,82,2 January 2006
The Truman Show," Ambitious and Entertaining Treatise on the Reality Media Creates for Us
","It's not often a Hollywood film arrives with such lofty ambitions as this. On one hand this is a high concept comedy in the vein of 'Groundhog Day' about an unwitting man whose entire life has been a TV show.  This is also a Jim Carrey vehicle designed to display his charms.  On the other hand this a very satirical look at the way the media manipulates our reality.  The film also wants to take a philosophical look at free will vs. a higher power and reality vs. fantasy.  It doesn't always work as the satire often keeps you from thinking too deeply about the underlying themes and the philosophical stuff keeps the satire from biting as well as it could.  Credit engaging performances and solid and thoughtful direction from Weir for keeping things afloat and entertaining.  There are some great cinematic moments here.  I loved the 'stolen kiss on the beach at night' and 'Cue the sun!'In the end this film is closer in spirit to psychological dramas and sci-fi movies where a person suddenly realizes they are the pawn in some grand experiment or a prisoner in an alien world than it is to anything in our current 'reality TV' obsessed culture.  Eventually it touches on a very basic conflict all humans must face (most people do so in childhood, some I fear never do).  The universe does not revolve around us.  In the closing moments we are excited for Truman because he finally realizes there is a whole new world out there to explore, but also slightly saddened because we know all to well that he will never be able to return to that idyllic 'childhood' existence.  How's it going to end?  Who knows...but things will never be the same.",8,113,146,20 March 2003
Casino," Scorsese on Scorsese
","'Casino' explodes onto the screen like Martin Scorsese doing an overblown riff of a Martin Scorsese film. All of his hallmarks are here in spades as he weaves his epic and vividly detailed saga of organized crime in Las Vegas. Much of the style here is over-the-top, and when you combine that with three brand-name movie stars (DeNiro almost hilariously subdued here, Sharon Stone at the pinnacle of her appeal and showing an amazing range here as DeNiro's gold digging drug addicted wife, and an insane Joe Pesci doing a gonzo take on an insane Joe Pesci) acting to within inches of their lives, you get a wildly entertaining albeit over long three hour ride. Toss in some scenery chewing from Don Rickles, James Woods, and that hilarious Italian grandmother (Scorsese's real life mother) in the butcher shop, and you can't lose. However, when the central conceit of the movie is to explore the criminal underbelly of a city that legally peddles crime and sleaze as entertainment, 'Casino' ultimately seems a bit redundant.",8,3,5,6 December 2006
300," One Nation Under a Raving Lunatic
","Zack Snyder's gleefully insane adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel, '300' just may be the first movie to appeal to both radically hawkish hard-line conservatives and to the most outgoing section of the gay community. Zack Snyder, it seems, is a uniter, not a divider. '300' is over-the-top visually and thematically, morally corrupt, erotically jingoistic, and infected with both nihilistic and fascist sensibilities.In an attempt to make the onslaught of computer generated images appear more like film, Snyder decides to add a faux-graininess to many of the more elaborate shots, which makes much of them hard to see. Of course, some of these images aren't without their artistic merit, often visually transfixing and compelling in their composition. Overall, he does a commendable job in his literal translation of comic book images to the big screen (much in the same vein as the far superior 'Sin City.') Some of it (like most of the well staged and fantastically gory battle scenes) is amazing, but much of it (even the Spartan soldiers' abs look computer generated) is just plain silly.For a movie that attempts to be so trailblazing from a visual perspective, the storyline stays alarmingly close to the conventions of both macho-man war epics and comic book action films. The dialogue is mostly screaming and vague speeches about 'honor and liberty and justice' backed-up by glaring and pompous music. It makes the script from 'Gladiator' seem like Shakespeare in comparison. As far as the cast goes, the beautiful Lena Headey lends herself nicely to the film's aesthetics and acts as if she is staring in a far more refined historical epic. In the lead role of mad King Leonidas, Gerard Butler does a wildly entertaining impersonation of someone doing a spoof on a young and robust Sean Connery. He's the only one seeming to have fun with the self-seriousness of the whole endeavor, and dare I say it, this could be a star-making role for him.Lambasting '300' for historical inaccuracies would be like condemning 'American Idol' for not allowing presidential candidates to debate on the show between songs. History is not what this film is about. In some ways it feebly tries to channel the spirit of Greek myth. In its celebration of physical beauty, view of courage as how loud you can scream and how many people you can decapitate, and idolizing the mentality of 'freedom at any costs,' it appeals to both ancient Greeks and unfortunately, a certain segment of the modern audience. Ultimately, this is just another film that fetishizes death and martyrdom over the innate will to survive. Even Mel Gibson's equally violent 'Apocalypto' recognized man's unshakable will to live. Willing a glorious death is no way to spend one's life, and as entertaining as much of it is, '300' panders to our basest desires of self annihilation.",5,12,30,13 March 2007
Sin City," Enthralling Pulpy Noirish Comic Picture Show
","I was never a fan of comic books, and an even lesser fan of comic book movies. With 'Sin City' (oddly probably the most faithful comic book movie ever in that it adapts film to a comic book level instead of adapting a comic book to film), however, I was completely entranced. I credit the aesthetics. Whether it's the stark black and white cinematography (speckled with bright color in all the right places), or the antiquated and noirish set designs, or the clever and amusing use of make-up (especially for Mickey Rourke's lovable thug 'Marv'), or the over-abundance of gorgeous women beautifully photographed in all stages of dress and undress, there is always something to look at here. And it was my busy eyes that got me totally caught up in this beguiling world of violence, sex, revenge, dames, shady heroes, corrupt cops, slimy politicians, good-hearted whores, and more castrations and beheadings than any other film in history created by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez (a director who knows not the mantra of a good editor that I never really cared for).Ultimately, with its roundabout episodic plot line reminiscent of 'Pulp Fiction', the stories really amount to nothing much, but that's just fine because the blazingly original visuals give your mind more than enough to chew on. While you may not think much about the plot or characters, you'll never forget the images, and this is the true testament of a good film. Yes, a great film would have an enthralling story, too, but when it comes to the lowest base of story-telling represented by comic books and their filmed counterparts, you're not going to get any better than 'Sin City.' Bravo, they've made every comic book film that has come before it and every one that will undoubtedly and unfortunately come after it, a moot point.",8,0,2,15 April 2005
Gangs of New York," It'll be talked about for decades to come...
","There is a very good reason why 'Gangs of New York' was delayed for a whole year that has nothing to do with its bloated budget and extended shooting schedule. There was a little event called 9/11. With this epic masterpiece that is as brilliant in its flaws as it is in its triumphs (which, by the way, far outnumber the flaws), Scorsese ultimately paints a picture of America that some, in lieu of 9/11, might find very unpatriotic. In the end (POTENTIAL SPOILERS), he seems to be saying that the biggest 'gang' of them all, is/was the American government. Scorsese takes a look at time in history that is largely unknown to people when New York City was ruled by gangs (usually natives vs. immigrants) and corrupt politicians who could care less about the Civil War or Lincoln or slavery (which is mostly what is taught now in history class about this era). The central historical event in the beginning is the brutal Five Points Gang War of 1846. This is mirrored at the climatic end by the Draft Riots near the end of the Civil War. The US government sends in the military to stop the riots and they leave countless numbers dead and the city in ruin. It is here, where the ways of the Old World (honorable territorial fights between gangs) are supplanted by the ways of a New Era (big government crashing down on you). At any rate, despite its pageantry and epic proportions and very melodramatic revenge plot (which many will see as a plus, and on all counts is wondrous and beautifully executed), this is still at its heart a Scorsese picture. This means a whole lot of the ultra violence, snazzy camera work (lots of dolly shots), interesting uses of music to punctuate the drama (I really loved the period minstrel music while the schizophrenic music score was a bit distracting), degradation of women (in service of the plot and the usually despicable male characters, by no means indicative of Scorsese's feelings towards women IMHO, though many might debate this point), and lots and lots of blood. Scorsese fans should rejoice at this. Any fan of cinema should want to see it for the grand spectacle of it all (the all non-CGI sets built in Rome are fantastic in that old fashioned classic Hollywood way, and the costumes are magnificent in a post-modern Dickensian kind of way...a lot of imagination and thought went into every aspect of this film), and of course, Daniel Day Lewis's portrayal of Bill the Butcher is worth the price of admission alone. However, if you are not a student of cinema or fan of Scorsese, you may find this all a bit overblown, over the top, and painfully long. Love it or loathe it, this will be a film discussed and debated for all time.",9,0,0,21 December 2002
Braveheart," One of the Best
","There's just something about this quasi-historical big sweeping epic that gets me every time. The schmaltz and romance works, perhaps because it is wonderfully balanced by gorgeous Scottish vistas and some of the grittiest and most gut churning battle scenes ever put on the big screen. This is the movie that every battle scene in every movie since has tried to top in terms of amazing choreographed carnage. Mel Gisbon makes William Wallace out to be a mythic sized hero and freedom fighter whose most heartfelt desire was to be left alone to raise a family on his own terms and by the sweat of his own brow. Powerful stuff beautifully shot, appropriately scored, reverently acted, and ultimately unforgettable. The revenge plot is a familiar and archetypal story that is often told, but not often told this well (much like 'Gladiator' in that respect). This is grand epic film making at its most heartfelt best and sincere.",10,1,3,4 March 2003
Slumdog Millionaire," Not Even Bizarrely Plausible
","A young call center worker from Mumbai with a rough-and-tumble past named Jamal (a likable Dev Patel) becomes a contestant on the Indian version of 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?' in the hopes that his true love (the beautiful Freida Pinto) will see him on TV and come back to him for good. Much of 'Slumdog Millionaire' is done in flashbacks as the audience learns the personal story behind each of the questions. For some strange reason the filmmakers want us to think a person like Jamal wouldn't normally know the answers to these random trivia questions, but he does because of his unique life story, see? Well, it's a mildly interesting central conceit that quickly falls apart. At one point, a policeman questioning Jamal remarks that his story is 'bizarrely plausible.' I wish I could say I felt the same.It seems to be a trend this year for movies to contain wildly shifting tones. This is the type of film that thinks it's endearing and cute when a little Indian boy is given no choice but to dive into a pit of raw sewage to get a chance to meet a movie star, and then tries to be gritty and deadly serious when a man takes out an orphan's eyes with a spoon so the kid will make more money on the street as a blind urchin. Combining elements of 'Oliver Twist', 'Romeo and Juliet' and 'City of God', Danny Boyle and his co-director Loveleen Tandan create a flimsy mosaic of convention and post-modern pastiche. With its sometimes fascinating look at Mumbai and its strange juxtaposition of modernity and immense wealth run amok with the biggest slums on earth, 'Slumdog Millionaire' is not without some intense and keenly interesting vignettes. However, the paper-thin script full of lazy characterizations and arbitrary moments leads to a painfully predictable denouement with a silly message about Destiny.Boyle is a director whose style has run out of steam. All of his trademarks are here: the shoddy editing; the shaky, grainy digital photography; the hyper-bright lighting that washes out most colors and makes whites and yellows blinding. Why is it I always feel like I'm getting an eye exam when I sit through his films? It left me with a headache that wasn't helped by the loud soundtrack. Any compelling moment, like the train ride that ends at the Taj Mahal or the early chase scene through the slums of Mumbai, I credit to Boyle's co-director Tandan.'Slumdog Millionaire' is an energetic film I desperately wanted to like. Had it a sharper focus and harder edge that more thoroughly explored just one of the millions of enthralling stories that exist in cities like Mumbai, it could've been a rousing success. Instead, with its slapdash enthusiasm that feebly tries to thread some meaning into the barely plausible tale, I'm left thinking that Mumbai deserves a far better film.",5,23,43,8 December 2008
Gladiator," One of my all time favorite films
","What more could you want?  A powder keg of a performance from Russel Crowe as a scorned general turned gladiator seeking revenge for his family's execution, an expertly recreated view of ancient Rome, a darkly comic performance from Phoenix as the villainous and terribly vexed emperor, a 'hey, look at me I'm hot and a great actress' turn from a virtually unknown Connie Nielson as the emperor's conniving sister and Crowe's love interest, taut direction from a seasoned director (Ridley Scott) who knows something about pacing and action and visuals, an amazing musical score from Hans Zimmer, awesome costumes and sets, and tons of blood and carnage, all make this one of my personal all time favorite movies.  Some of the CGI make look dated in years to come, but I don't think I could ever get tired of this story oft-told, but not oft told this well.",10,0,1,25 February 2003
Donnie Darko," A Stunning Debut
","Richard Kelly's stunning debut about a paranoid schizophrenic teenager who is haunted by a 6-foot evil-faced rabbit named Frank who commands him to do things and gives him horrifying glimpses of the future is not for everyone. But film buffs who like to be surprised and wowed and don't settle for pat nice little stories (and endings, and wow, this has one doozy of an ending every bit as mind blowing as say a 'Mulholland Drive' or 'Memento' or 'Twelve Monkeys'), should be overwhelmingly delighted by this film. Richard Kelly directs with a sure hand and maverick mind. He fully creates and realizes a truly unique and thrilling universe for his characters and images to inhabit, and once he creates the rules (which might not make sense in the real world, but make perfect sense in the fantasy world he creates for us), he never breaks those rules (a true test of great entertainment/cinema/literature that portrays fantasy or dreams) and takes us on one hell of a ride. If you like to watch cult movies then behold 'Donnie Darko' and you will not be disappointed (and maybe up all night thinking about it afterwards).",8,1,5,13 July 2002
Goodfellas," The Myth of 'The Greatest Film of All Time' Brought to Glorious Life
","If you hate mob movies, or hate Scorsese, then you probably won't be able to sit through this. But for the rest of us out there, this is arguably one of the best films of the 1990's, possibly one of the best of all time, and without a doubt one of the most influential films of the past twenty years. Every mob movie/underworld saga/generational tale/crime thriller from 'Pulp Fiction' to 'Boogie Nights' to 'Blow' (which played like the TV movie version of a great Scorsese flick) to TV's 'The Sopranos' owes a debt to this film. Scorsese was at the top of his game here, and what makes this film stand tall above all other movies of this ilk (including Scorsese's own 'Casino'--a great film in its own right) is that there is an overwhelming visceral charge to the film that makes it all seem so enjoyable despite the onslaught of blood, foul language, and unsavory activities. You are made to believe that these gangsters were having the time of their lives. So too were Scorsese and pals in making the film. And lastly, so too are we the audience in watching it all. Everything came together in this film so perfectly the viewer is left feeling oddly giddy amongst all the true life bloodshed. This sense of 'fun' is the one thing that his recent 'Gangs of New York' was missing, and may be what keeps that film from being ranked as one of the all time greats.As for the acting, Pesci is all at once hilarious and scary. De Niro is at his best. And Liotta gives a career defining performance (only in the recent 'Narc' has he been able to recapture some of this magic). As for some of the finer details, I dare you to find a movie that makes better use of popular music or Steady-cam shots. The cinematography, editing, set designs and costumes (that traverse the varied stylings of the 1950's , 60's, 70's and early 80's) are all pitch perfect. Is there a better scene than when Liotta takes Lorraine Braco to the Copacabana for the first time and introduces her to the perks of gangster life while 'And Then he Kissed Me' plays on the soundtrack? Will you ever be able to listen to 'Layla' without thinking about mob hits and a frozen body in a meat truck? All these things, a communion with the audience (here we share Scorsese's joy both in making a film and in our watching it), top-notch production values, great performances, and a lasting influence on later films are the earmarks of a great movie, the pinnacle of a great director's career, and one of the greatest films of all time. 'Goodfellas' may never reach the mythical status 'The Godfather' saga did, but as great films like this are becoming few and far in between, it makes you believe in the myth of the 'greatest film of all time.' Maybe it is, most likely it isn't, but we the audience for a brief moment, maybe for just one scene, are pretty much convinced THIS IS IT.",10,1,2,13 July 2003
Hustle & Flow," Well Acted Post-Modern Blackploitation Flick
","The 'upward economic and social mobility through musical talent' genre has never been one of my favorites. This is, remember, the genre that begot 'Glitter.' In the past three years, however, the genre has risen high in the ranks of populist entertainment in both its fictional ('8 Mile') and non-fictional ('Ray' or 'Walk the Line') forms.'Hustle and Flow' crackles and pops onto the screen in its first frames as a throwback to character-driven 1970's movie-making that explored a certain criminal or non-traditional subculture of society (ala 'Taxi Driver' or 'Mindnight Cowboy'). The filmmakers do a great job early on of giving us an intimate and sympathetic, though never glorifying, look into the life of a Memphis pimp and the relationships he has with his environment and hoes. A great ensemble cast and hyper-intelligent script give it a surprising emotional resonance and moral complexity, much in the same way P.T. Anderson peered into the dysfunctional family of adult filmmakers in 'Boogie Nights.' The characters in 'Hustle & Flow' use music in the same way the characters in 'Boogie Nights' used filming sex, as an abstract way to connect and communicate with the people around them.Terrance Howard (previously seen in a pivotal supporting part in the socially conscious 'Crash') gives a powerhouse performance in the lead role. He displays a certain gravitas few performers possess, and it's truly put to the test as he is still able to carry the film even as it descends into a series of gangster-rap clich√É¬©s in the final thirty minutes. The filmmakers really missed a golden opportunity to put out something that could've served both as a grandiose tragedy (ala John Singleton's 'Boyz in the Hood') or biting social commentary (ala 'Network' or 'Bullworth'). After displaying such promise in the first three quarters of the film, it's ashame they copped out, as their amazing cast and lead performer never did.",8,2,4,6 February 2006
Cinderella Man," Might I ask of Hollywood just one thing?
","From this point forward, Ron Howard should be allowed only to direct period-piece biopics starring Russell Crowe and an Oscar-caliber Hollywood sweetheart as Crowe's supportive wife. Just as this acting-directing duo did with their award-winning 'Beautiful Mind' audiences are again treated to a true story of triumph over adversity played up with sepia-toned cinematography, lovely attention to period detail, and a swelling music score.There's just something about Ron Howard's hackneyed mediocre directing style that allows for Russell Crowe's scenery chewing chameleon-like performances to shine at their brightest. He is the greatest actor of this generation, and here there is not one false note in his portrayal of scrappy under-dog boxer James Braddock, who went from the bread lines to the ring during the Great Depression and brought a nation on their knees back to their feet (or so the producers would like us to believe in their fairy-tale story). Likewise, Renee Zelwegger, like Jennifer Connolly before her, is pitch-perfect at Braddock's lovely wife, Mae. Please, Hollywood, from here on out let's cast Zelwegger only in movies taking place in the 1920's and 1930's. Just like in 'Chicago' she looks perfect in the part, as if she was born in that era. The rest of the supporting cast (especially Giamatti as Braddock's tongue-lashing manager) is top notch.Howard leaves no clich√© unturned and no heart-string unplucked (cute kids getting sick in the cold or shedding a tear at a father's promise, a boxing opponent of pure swagger and spite, a grieving widow finding hope in cheering for Braddock, cynical reporters and other rich-people type becoming overwhelmed by Braddock's show of heart). As predictable as it all was, it was still nicely uplifting, and proof positive this is the only type of movie Howard should touch, and Crowe the only star he should ever work with. Bravo, fellas, you've done it again in spite of yourselves.",8,3,6,5 June 2005
The Simpsons Movie," Super Size This!
","It's hard to believe it's been almost twenty years since 'The Simpsons' first entered our homes. Over the years we've seen the emergence of cartoons more scathingly satirical ('South Park') and more randomly ridiculous ('Family Guy'), but 'The Simpsons' has always kept chugging along. While it's been well past its prime for almost a decade now (oh, how we miss the Conan O'Brien years), Matt Groening and his team have decided to fire on all cylinders for the first foray onto the big screen. Staying true to its form and not trying anything too daring, 'The Simpsons Movie' is essentially a super-sized 90 minute episode.The plot of this film is a rehash of the standard 'Homer does something completely idiotic and selfish and gets all of Springfield in trouble and makes Marge hopping mad.' There's plenty of homages to some of the past great episodes (Jumping Springfield Gorge, Bart Becomes a Flanders), and all the characters are doing their classic shtick. Chief Wiggum almost shooting himself while eating free donuts that have been stacked on the barrel of his gun is especially funny. Most of the hearty laughs are found in the peripherals. 'The Simpsons' has never been accused of being subtle--witness here a literal visual depiction of Homer being stuck between 'a rock and hard place.' Always gently poking fun at religion (the stuff with Grandpa in church is priceless), politics (here we see Arnold as President), lampooning pop culture (Homer playing 'Grand Theft Walrus' in Alaska is a joke about five years too late but still laugh-out-loud funny), and most successfully taking sharp jabs at itself and its corporate sponsors, the film delivers plenty of sight gags and one-liners to please even the most casual of fans.As the 'Comic Book Guy' might point out, this isn't exactly 'The Greatest Episode Ever,' but it packs in more chuckles per minute than anything I've seen on the big or small screen this year.",7,9,19,31 July 2007
Atonement," Suite Britianna
","A budding young writer named Briony witnesses an innocent act she doesn't fully understand between her older sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley) and long-time family servant Robbie (James McAvoy) one restless summer day on her family's lavish country estate in 1935 England that leads to scandal in Joe Wright's dreadfully sumptuous adaptation of Ian McEwan's international best-selling novel, 'Atonement.' Four years later, all three characters try to find their own personal sense of peace or redemption during WWII.This brief synopsis does nothing to explain the intricate complexities of the plot and actions that take place. Although Keira Knightley's performance is slightly off-putting due to the fact she appears like she just escaped from a concentration camp (surely young British socialites did not look like this in the 1930's), the stunning cast shows full range here racing through curious emotions: spite, lust, recklessness, and selfish wanton abandon. The facial expressions, especially from the children in the early scenes on the estate, are priceless. None of the characters are particularly sympathetic as they are often vain, self-absorbed, and quite silly in their drama, but they are fascinating to watch. The first third of the film is played like a 'Masterpiece Theater' production of 'The Great Gatsby' as seen through the eyes of Nancy Drew.However, what makes 'Atonement' soar is the impeccable direction of Joe Wright. He makes the most audacious coming-of-age as an auteur since Anthony Minghella delivered 'The English Patient' back in 1996. Wright displays a near Kubrickian mastery of sound effects (notice the strikes of the typewriter keys) that transition from scene to scene and often bleed into the amazing score from Dario Marianelli. Wright also crafts a finely textured mise-en-scene that visually translates McEwan's richly composed story onto the screen with near note perfect fashion. Nothing can really prepare you for how well directed this film is until you see it, and the scene of the three soldiers arriving on the beach at the Dunkirk evacuation is one of the greatest stand alone unedited panning long shots ever captured on film. It left me gasping.That scene leads to the heart of the film. The often clich√©d romance at the core is trumped by Wright's depiction of Robbie, a single man forlorn and obsessed, his dizzying inner turmoil reflected against the grand canvas of a chaotic world at war. Likewise, Briony's redemption comes not in the too-clever conclusion at the end of the film, but in the intimate and symbolic confessional at the bedside of a dying French soldier. These moments leave lasting impressions, and left me imagining that if Joe Wright were to ever adapt Irene Nemiorovsky's 'Suite Francaise' onto the silver screen, he would knock it so far out of the park it would leave 'Gone With Wind' spinning in its gilded Hollywood grave.",9,121,182,10 December 2007
V for Vendetta," Remember Remember the 5th of November
","A hero sporting a mask eerily reminiscent of the king from the Burger King commercials (actually a Guy Fawkes mask here) who quotes Shakespeare. Natalie Portman with a shaved head. Hilarious allusions to Fox News and the Bushes. A comic book (pardon me, graphic novel) adaptation with an actual idea in mind and a strong political statement. What's not to like? 'V for Vendetta' is a better than average genre flick that is as enjoyable for its silliness (when we first meet 'V' he is a bit too loquacious and seems to exist only to ramble off tongue twisters) as it is for its high-mindedness. The political message may not be so bold or new (totalitarianism is bad, and we the people should rally against it through IDEAS) but it's timely and well played here.Natalie Portman does a decent British accent in what is basically a natural progression of her breakthrough role in 'The Professional' where she once again 'falls' for a vigilante with a heart of gold in the name of vengeance. Roles in forgettable quirky comedy/dramas and her interesting turn in 'Closer' aside, this is really her first chance to act since she was a child, and it's a joy to watch her here. It really is amazing how wasted and ill-used she was in the recent 'Star Wars' prequels. This is the perfect type of role for her and she carries the film through its sillier parts to make it the stuff of high drama.'V' doesn't have the visual chutzpah of 'Sin City' or the AHA! factor of the original 'Martix' or the deep psychological complexity of 'Batman Begins,' but it's full of great acting, big ideas, and a dense and satisfying plot played out to a proper conclusion. Brush aside some of the British stereotypes (everyone says 'bollucks' and the people are bit too pleased by a Jack Benny style comedy sequence meant to poke fun at their Chancellor and his war on terror), some clunky pacing in the beginning, and a missed golden opportunity for a release date (remember the 5th of November? unfortunately the studio didn't) and let yourself be entertained. Sure to have a cult following, 'V for Vendetta' is fun way to spend a few hours and just might leave you with something to think about afterward.",8,4,8,28 March 2006
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," A-Musing Oddity from Coen Brothers
","By sheer dumb luck, this film became the Coen Brother's highest grossing film ever. Essentially this is Homer's Odyssey by way of the Three Stooges. Everyone in the cast seems to be having a good ol' time. To get an idea of the sense of humor running through the film, witness about 90 minutes through the most beautifully staged and choreographed Clan rally ever put to film. There's plenty of Depression-era shenanigans and Southern fried humor throughout. Cinematographer Roger Deakins does here for color and the South what later he did for black and white and suburban California in his next collaboration with the Coen brothers, 'The Man Who Wasn't There.' He turns photographing shades, shadows, colors and textures into high art. This ain't no 'Fargo', folks. It's not even as deep as say, oh, 'The Big Lebowski.' The Coen brothers really don't have much to say here, but I'll be damned if I didn't get caught up in the old timey spirit of it all. In one of the strangest pop-culture phenomenas of the past ten years, the old timey bluegrass soundtrack went on to become more popular than the film and swept the Grammy Awards. I dare you not to tap your feet while Clooney and the gang schuck and jive their way on home.",9,0,0,14 June 2003
