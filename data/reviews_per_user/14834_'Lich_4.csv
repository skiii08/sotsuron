Antz," Different movie for da older guys ....
","Conservative parents worried that their children will be corrupted by the 'dirty' words in ANTZ might be more appropriately concerned about spelling. If their kids look up the 'Z' in ANT-Z, they might discover that it is the name of a 1969 movie by Constantin Costa-Gavras: a beautiful and beautifully effective attack on the fascistic (or downright fascist) regime of the colonels ruling Greece at the time. Leftist parents should teach their kids about 'Z!', the symbol, and about the songs in ANTZ and try to get their kids to ignore the placements for Mountain Dew and other products. ANTZ is inspiring debates about its politics and in that way it is earning its social keep more than most politicians in my part of the world. Z!  And long live the individual citizen in a human community!",Null,0,0,30 October 1998
American Psycho," Bale's Patrick Bateman: A villain for our time
","I assume I'm not original in this (but I comment on Shakespeare, so I couldn't be too hung up on originality)--but I'd like to nominate Christian Bale, in his American Psycho incarnation for Iago for the first great early 21st-century production of William Shakespeare's OTHELLO.  Bale's Patrick Bateman's got the youth--Iago is 28--he's got the looks (with some adjustments), and, most important, he's got the attitude. 	OK, you gotta punch him around a bit, cut his hair, and have him lose about 8 years of schooling, but he looks about 28 and obviously can do just about any English-language accent you ask him to. (Our American Psycho is played by a Brit.) 	And he can do a villain for our time.  The Beatles are dated, I think, and it's no longer Oswald from KING LEAR and 'I Am the Walrus' for Our Devil. It's Patrick Bateman, at least as Bale plays him: very darkly comically, the psycho-pathology behind and underlying the US of A during the triumphal decades of American capital. 	A Bale/Bateman Iago might work to destroy those around him not so much because they reveal the ugliness of his life but because they _are_ in ways he just is not.",Null,0,0,22 April 2000
U-571," Portrait of the artist as a young Yank submariner
","If you want history, get a decent book on Enigma, Ultra, and submarine warfare during World War II.  If you want to see a great World War II submarine movie, rent DAS BOOT; if you want another Coming of Age During WWII movie--with death replacing sex--you can do worse than U-571.	The 'thesis,' or, you should pardon the expression, 'surface' level of U-571 is a gung-ho propaganda flick (and if you're under 30, and don't know WWII US propaganda, and might be surprised by the-kid-from-_______-who-is-too-young-to-die actually dying, what follows might include a SPOILER).  Matthew McConaughey's Lt. Andrew Tyler must learn that it's not enough to be willing to die for his men; it's not enough for him to be willing to kill for his men; it's not even enough to allow his commanding officer (Bill Paxton's Lt. Commander Mike Dahlgren) to sink to a watery grave--he didn't his skipper much anyway; no, a real naval CO must be willing to send to their deaths men he loves like kid brothers, men who love and respect him like an older brother.  If the mission or the boat or the Navy requires it, you send your sailors to their deaths.  	Okay, but 'Semper Fi, do or die!  Gung-ho, gung-ho, gung-ho!' is US Marine Corps jive, not Navy, and there's a (sorry!) deeper level, if you want to see it, with a more subversive antithesis.  	Lt. Tyler learns that a submarine in wartime is not run democratically.  He learns to take command and act as if he knows all.  He learns that to achieve a crucial mission in a crucial war, he has to use the love and respect of one of his young sailors to get a job done, one where the sailor does 'do _and_ die' (to quote Lord Tennyson correctly). 
	Lt. Tyler learns the art of war and enters military manhood, doing what must be done in a Just Cause.  	Still, these Yanks at sea are in a U-boat, a German sub, dressed in German uniforms.  In fighting for that Just Cause, they take on the appearance of their enemies and two crucial doctrines of their enemies: that democracy is dispensable when really serious issues are at stake and that the individual may and should be sacrificed--killed off--if necessary for the greater good. 	According to the movie (SPOILER COMING), Tom Guiry's nice young Trigger is the kid too young to die who bloody-well _will_ die to save das Boot--sorry, the Boat--and do much to win the war for the Allies.  Where U-571 surpasses your average propaganda piece is that it subtly but surprisingly strongly suggests that we count the costs of this crucial victory.  To defeat our enemies, we may become uncomfortably like our enemies.",Null,3,6,25 April 2000
Pi," In 1990s New York City, a numbers theorist may have discovered the ultimate pattern in the universe, which would include the pattern behind the apparent chaos of the stock market, and would be the True NAME
","PI is an independently produced art film (Sundance festival winner) that is, generically, an SF mathematical mystery, plus thriller. Summarized by Vince Moore, with editing by Rich Erlich for the CLOCKWORKS-2 PROJECT: a list of WORKS USEFUL FOR THE STUDY OF THE HUMAN/MACHINE INTERFACE IN SF. The significantly named Maximilian-always called 'Max'-Cohen (Kohen Gadol  High Priest = Max. Priest) is a theoretical mathematician who believes in pattern in everything, yet he is still subject to inexplicable and incurable seizures and hallucinations (apparently from some variety of migraine).  He has focused his talents on patterns that may predict complex, apparently chaotic phenomena, with the stock market as his main, purely theoretical, interest. Just before his home-made computer (Euclid) crashes, it spits out some apparently random digits and highly unlikely stock predictions. Cohen throws away the printout and goes to complain to Sol Robeson: his current confidante and Go partner, and apparently Cohen's only male friend (he rejects friendship or even colleagueship with women).  Sol was once Cohen's mentor; and Sol once sought patterns in the transcendental number pi, perhaps finding them and suffering a stroke in consequence-and being wise enough to quit.  (Pi = ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, the ratio itself = 3.1416+ a nonrepeating series that can be extended indefinitely.)  Sol asks if the random number(s) the computer generated contained 216 digits.  Cohen is soon told by a Hassidic Jew who works with Biblical numerology that his group of Hassidim are looking for a 216 digit number (which, translated from numbers to Hebrew letters, gives the true NAME-of God).  Simultaneously, an organization combining elements of a think tank, Wall Street brokerage firm, and espionage operation aggressively solicits Cohen's help on stock investments.  Cohen goads Sol to reproduce the 216-digit number, which Sol does, has another stroke, and dies. Sol's earlier theory was that the 216 digit number was the product of computer consciousness as the computer 'died.'  PI is significant for the study of the human/machine interface primarily for the imagery of Cohen sitting in the midst of Euclid, which Robert Denerstein, the Scripps-Howard reviewer, saw as 'a giant computer that lines the walls of his apartment like a high-tech web' (_The Cincinnati Post_, 7 Aug. 1998: 3B).  Euclid is literally a very small main-frame but Denerstein does well to note the web imagery: at the center of the computer, destroying its main chip, are ants, secreting a mucoid substance that 'kills' Euclid, perhaps bringing it to consciousness and generating the NAME.  Cohen rebuilds his computer, around a superchip supplied by the mysterious Wall Street organization.  The imagery of Cohen inside the computer elements suggests strange juxtapositions of postmodern cybernetic space-but definitely not cyberpunk cyberspace-enclosing the human and insectoid, the natural and secular, along with the ultimately spiritual.  Cohen within his computer may be a new Kohen Gadol in a new Holy of Holies, bringing about the Last Days, in an apocalyptic crash of the stock market, or with the Messianic era.  Or he's another mad scientist, another nut venturing into areas reserved for High Priests or Messiah.  Cf. and contrast Arthur C. Clarke's 1953 short story, 'The Nine Billion Names of God,' wherein computers are used to list God's 9 billion names, at which time the work of the universe, and the universe, is finished (collected in Clarke's THE NINE BILLION NAMES OF GOD [New York: Signet-NAL, 1967]).",7,1,2,13 August 1998
