Alien 3," Terrible
","One of the worst movies in the history of movies. I've never seen a movie so blatantly ignore continuity. There were no eggs in the sleep chamber. The hypersleep pods are totally different. The ship design was different. The 'Sulaco' painted on the ship was white instead of black. The alien was plainly stupid in not cocooning the victims as in previous films. Killing off the main characters was pointless. The prisoners know only one word, the 'F' word. The gore is excessive and thrust directly in the audience's face unlike the stylish methods in the first two films.This was not an ALIEN movie. It was a copycat clone that screwed up every chance it got. Those who say it was a 'good' or an 'okay' film are forgetting that it is a SEQUEL which has certain responsibilites to live up to.Michael Biehn (Hicks) once said, 'They will never top ALIENS.' He was right.",1,505,557,18 November 2002
