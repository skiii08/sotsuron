Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Ugly and offensive garbage
","Borat has been getting a lot of attention recently thanks to great word-of-mouth and box-office success. However I feel that this a movie that is dangerously lowering the standards of what we see in the movies. The premise is like a leaf out of the book of Jackass and other juvenile practical jokes.If your idea of entertainment is blatantly insulting people to their faces, asking them to pick up crap, destroying their property and indecently exposing yourself to people who don't want to be a part of that, then you should take a look at yourself at what you do in your own society.Cohen's idea of joke is putting people in danger's way, insulting their beliefs and crossing over their boundaries while making himself look like and absolute ignoramus.You may argue that the film is supposed to be 'satire on the American way of life' but what kinds of normal people think the way he does - ultimate misogyny, calling people names and defaming their country and pride?It seems he also wants to take a stab at 'high society' crashing the feminists' group and the etiquette school and party, while mixing it with the blacks and the whore. However, the two latter groups only take to Borat because they understand his crudeness and language. He does not have to form a firm, meaningful relationship with these groups them and therefore does not have behave socially appropriate.He never even succeeds to critically vilify the affluent groups but only makes a himself look like a disgusting criminal. Even the college boys got tired of his antics and had to draw the line when he became socially over demanding and provoking.It is unclear what the aim of the film was - whether to satirise and poke fun at the American people when all it does is just make Borat look like an obnoxious fool. Even more sadly, the film which cost almost $18mil was just a vehicle for Cohen to irritate people and destroy their homes and property which they have honestly and earnestly worked for.In a developed society (for example the U.S) where one has social rules and the law to protect it's people from slander, destruction of property and assault, we should feel more thankful that we have a system to prevent people like Borat off the streets and in jail or courthouses where they belong.A disgusting piece of work Mr.Borat - I only regret that Kazakhstan has to put up with your despicable antics.",1,7,15,16 January 2007
Marie Antoinette," A chocolate box of tastes
","If you wanted to learn about the French Revolution, one way might be to stroll down to your local library, rent out a few archaic textbooks and maybe a BBC video documentary. No doubt you will acquire a great deal of knowledge, facts, and figures.However sometimes you long for being there in the late 18century renaissance; in France, dancing and lounging among Kings and Queens, indulging in the royal and decadent lifestyle. Marie Antoinette offers that eclectic alternative. Far from the fact, however staying within reach of the truth, Sofia Coppola has crafted a chocolate box of luscious exuberant tastes that look to good enough to eat. However in this film, it's the eyes and ears that do all the tasting.Based on the book by accomplished historian Antonia Fraser (who also helped oversee the making of the film), Coppola has crafted not so much a retelling of Marie Antoinette's life (or even death) but a slice of paradise during her time as the Queen. Not knowing anything about the Revolution, I decided to 'educate' myself on the Cliff's notes of the story. Fraser's story and subsequent documentary was fascinating, at the same time being illuminating. Surprisingly, Fraser who had a large input on the formulation of the film allows Coppola to indulge a fairytale with fancy sweets, dresses and rock music. The effect is a film that is stunning to look at, contains a thin thread of plot but is still entirely believable in context.Copola's script is economically sparse. There are long moments without dialogue; most of it is gossip and a form of recitative in between the scenes. The film relies on real stars - the direction, costumes, and art decoration - to tell the story. It covers the period in Marie Antoinette's life during which she inherits the crown, marries the king and attempts to conceive an heir to the throne.Marie Antoinette played by Kisrten Dunst captures the essence of a young princess, enjoying life at her prime - a most active and beautiful woman. Her soft and vibrant portrayal is well complemented by the pale lighting and ethereal colours of the palace. She plays with aptitude each scene of loss with as much honesty and pathos as she gives her dances and balls a joie-de-vivre. The supporting cast is an amalgamation of actors from different generations and countries - the result is a medley of American, English and French accents. While it sounds anachronistic, it is also refreshing in it's diversity. The bit players are all worth their salt from Judy Davis' staunch allegiance to Rose Byrne's vibrant festivity and the Ambassador Mercy's honest forthrightness. With a smashing pop soundtrack and exuberant visuals, the film will most likely please the young adult female demographic. This theme of female youth is highlighted throughout the film. Several scenes are dedicated to trying on pairs after pairs of shoes and fashioning hairstyles several feet high all while indulging on pastries that deserve to be in an art gallery. Despite not being of the target audience, I still was able to be swept away by the tremendous artistry of the costumes, decor, dresses and shoes; the exuberant hairstyles and clothing.Considering the young female subject of the film, it makes at lot of sense to guide the film in this direction. If it were a modern day retelling, the story might fashion itself as girl inherits money, goes shopping after which she is recovered; finds boy, gets married and starts family. Therefore, it is a surprising change of pace when we are treating to lengthy almost silent dreamlike scenes of Marie-Antoinette drifting through the palace, dozing in the gardens, and strolling through the Petit Trianon.Art decorators Pierre Duboisberranger and Anne Seibeldeserve, and Costume designer Milena Canonero deserve much credit for their contributions in the film which scream attention, almost outclassing everything else in the frame. Filmed entirely on location in France and in the Versailles palace, they make full use of the gardens and the surrounding environments. They have created an palette of pastels and creams in a rich fantasy world.Also deserving a mention is the cinematographer Lance Acord. He served as cinematographer on Coppola's previous film (Lost In Translation) and also for director Spike Jonze, and has made the most of the decadent architecture and fabrics of 18th century France.Like it's subject Marie-Antoinette is an attractive piece, alluring in it's extravagance and bewitching in visage. It's effect on you is not unlike the glazed pastries that Marie-Antoinette consumes during the film - gorgeous to look at, however not much but air inside.Coppola has exquisitely constructed an dreamlike piece on the of eve the French Revolution so that we might have our own Petit Trianon for a few hours.",7,1,3,4 January 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," A violent and mysterious fairytale about resisting under oppression
","Violent and touching, mysterious and somber all at the same; Pan's Labyrinth is a mystical historical fairytale set in the heart of the Spanish civil war. The story follows a bright precocious girl and her mother who go to live with her new father, a brutal, unrelenting captain intent on conquering the republicans who are threatening the fascist front.The film is beautiful to watch. Crisply filmed and recorded, you can hear the ruffle of the army uniforms, the ambiance of the forest life and the creak of seasoned wood furniture. The Spanish woodlands and country and picturesque and really take you back to classic 1930s Spain.At times it is very violent and merciless demonstrating the regimes that people were under during this period in Spain's history. In fact the camera never shies away from these shocking scenes. The characters are very aware of what is happening around them and many of them become caught in a stalemate. Some try to struggle against the oppression - you can feel their burdens and distress - and win back their freedom The weathered art direction and evocative makeup is sensual and nostalgic. The colours are very dark browns, greens and blues which suit the macabre content and atmosphere of the film, but this also contrasts well with the labyrinth that Ofelia escapes into.The film is very ominous at times and more balanced towards telling the story of the war rather than this young girl. I felt the film was a bit lopsided towards the violence and politics and not wondrous enough in the element of fantasy. I would have liked to know more about Ofelia, and delve deeper into her fantasies. Ofelia is played with such charm, inquisitiveness, with intelligence and beauty that it she becomes irresistible to love. I was disappointed that her storyline was not made exploited more in the film as Ofelia's interpretation of the world around her would have made some for thrilling scenes.In addition, we do not see much of her fantasies and they do not push the film's plot greatly in any way. The film's editing was also a but choppy at times and there were some moments that seemed to lack energy or a spark, and I found myself hoping the plot would move along.In any case, this is fine film, held up by the wonderful set decoration, make-up and vivid recreation of evergreen civil war Spain. The score sustains the film's horror and hope, ravishingly composed by Javier Navarrete. Thanks to the likes of del Toro and Iñárritu, Mexican cinema has been deservedly celebrated with a rich narrative and fantastical cultural elements. These are stunning filmmakers. Don't miss your chance to see this one.P.S: This film has been nominated for an amazing 6 academy awards without being recognised in the major categories and as a foreign film. This is fantastic cinematic craft.",7,2,4,25 January 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," Ridiculously laughable characters on a flimsy plot
","With so much buzz surrounding this film at the moment, I thought that I might be worthwhile to write my review which I had initially put off my review because my first impressions of the film were not favourable. However in light of the escalating buzz and recent PGA win, I thought it may prove valuable in hindsight before the Oscars next month.The independent American film has grown prodigiously in the last 10 years and more so gaining popularity at the box office and critical acclaim. Most recently, we saw Sideways and Lost in Translation both being nominated for Picture in 2004 and at last year's surprising outcome, the films nominated for the major awards were mainly independent films.This heavily character driven (and thin and flimsy plotted) film follows one quirky estranged family, cross the country in a mini-bus to get their idealistic young daughter (the antithesis of a Barbie doll) to a beauty pageant. The 5 principals in this story each have great character flaws: one is an egotistical self-help coach blind-sighted by his idea of the perfect family; the troubled outcast teen who hates his parents, the cranky and bitter war veteran, the aforementioned innocent ambitious daughter who dares to dream; and the wife who is the bread and butter (failing) to keep it all together.The film is set-up primarily as a comedy with these quirky characters finding themselves in ridiculous situations all stuck together in one eclectic yellow mini-van, but there are (apparently) moments of comedy including the nauseating screaming vulgar grandfather, the whines of the depressing misunderstood teenager and several encounters with implausible policemen, service-stations and motorway drivers.The story fails for me because (for any film) we should at least identify with he characters and given what develops in the story, we should feel enough to care for them by the film's climax. I found each of the characters one-dimensional, clichéd and a such a parody of themselves that I just didn't care.Plus the fact that they spend most of the film moping about themselves, screaming and acting only aggressive towards one another. By the film's end, nothing really changed for them; sure it might have a have had a happy note but I wondering what was the point? Did they learn anything? They will probably wake up the next day crawling around the house lamenting their existence.The script and direction by this husband and wife team was nothing particularly special, it tells the story adequately but brings nothing unique to the genre which has been told many times. Insert quirky kooky music and you have a film that attempts to tell a touching story on the unpredictability life and it's lighter side yet fails because the glaring implausibilities and plot-holes ultimately sink the ship.This film is trying to be funny and important but only ends up being an embarrassing joke about the absurd and laughably inane characters. Despite the puzzling buzz, I dearly and audaciously hope this will not make an appearance at the forthcoming Oscars  with stupid story lines and pitiful characters, it's clearly out of it's depth among the more thoughtful refined films of this season.EDIT: After considering the Oscar noms I'm not surprised at the acclaim it's received. However it will be difficult to make it without a director nom. The film sticks out in a crowd of distinguished films like a bright boisterous yellow mini-van. Despite my rant, I glad I caught the film that many months ago to see what the fuss is all about. I hope I won't be disappointed again come Feb.",5,3,10,22 January 2007
Dreamgirls," An iconic era in soul music shows us that all that glitters is not gold
","Dreamgirls seems like a winner from any angle you look at it from. Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Eddie Murphy in a film directed by Oscar winning writer Bill Condon about the rise and demise of splendorous R&B group The Supremes. In fact the film does look quite pretty at times plus plenty of toe-tapping, dreamy musical numbers that electrify your senses. The success of Chicago 5 years ago has revitalised the popularity and appeal of stage to film musicals. Combining so catchy tunes and spectacular glim and glamour, audiences find it hard to resist the genre. Add the overwhelming buzz on it's run to the Oscars and you have a sure fire hit.The film is a roman à clef about the onset and heyday of Motown and in particular one of the most popular R&B groups, The Supremes. We witness their ascent to fame, the divisions between the manager's wants and public tastes and their struggle to remain in vogue in a changing world of popular music.Condon helms the film with the all-star cast fully showcasing the razzle-dazzle and enchantment of the songs and glittery costumes and wigs. He brings a confident assurance to the film's success, previously winning an Oscar for his writing and being nominated for the best picture winning Chicago.However something must have gone wrong in Dreamgirls because it's efforts are incredibly disappointing. His directing fails to light any spark or interest in the characters, and the musical numbers are directed with laziness and indifference. More shocking is his writing, which is mediocre and abysmal. There are so many clichéd moments that made me cringe and cry out in frustration including some very cheesy dialogue and awkward moments in the second half involving the gratuitous worship of Beyonce. The acting (especially from big-name stars Beyonce and Foxx) is for the most part uninspired and forced.The buzz about Hudson and Murphy is well deserved with Hudson stealing every scene she's in from *all* the other actors. She easily topples all the others when she sings, overpowering them in volume, timbre and tenderness. And is completely natural. You can see that her acting is not as smooth as more experienced actors, but she remains very impressive considering this is her first acting role. Along with Murphy, she is the only one in the film who is truly acting, and not just imitating. Murphy downplays his role as the big musical attraction of the film, breaking away from his comedy star persona. He brings verve and exhilaration in his racier moments to affecting poignancy in his more tender moments. Foxx seems overtly smug and suffers from from bad writing of the 'bad-guy' syndrome. While Beyonce is admirable, she's such a dull character not helped by her acting talents.The songs in the film keep you bopping along throughout but the pace lags especially during the second half and here it descends into shallow melodrama and clichéd soapy writing. As avid lover of musicals, I thought the numbers were a delight but the lyrics lacked the sharpness and wit akin to say Rodgers and Hammerstein, or more relevantly Chicago and The Producers. I will admit that it's not really the fault of the film, but the numbers were actually a bit shallow and trivial to the theme of the film. Now I don't really have a problem with dubbing - and I understand that it helps to refine the sound on the film track - especially if it sounds reasonable and looks realistic, but sometimes it became too conspicuous and I felt discredited some of the film's integrity.It was actually interesting to notice that as Hudson is the newcomer in the film she is not mentioned on first billing in the credits and publicity. But her role in the film actually becomes the lead as she upstages the other characters and is recognised as the best singer of the Dreams. Plus she eventually becomes central and pivotal to the outcome of the Dreams' career by the film's end. Also interesting was the (coincidental) connection between Beyonce's character and her real life struggles of being an overproduced, over-hyped and marketed mediocre singer. Is it too much of a a stretch to suggest this is how it plays out in real life?Dreamgirls should have been so much better. Considering the hype leading into it's preliminary screenings and pre-emptive Oscar buzz, its astonishing to see how it has all fallen apart now. The lackluster and uninspired direction, combined with the cheesy and juvenile writing ultimately sink this ship. Even with it's high production values and saving graces from Hudson and Murphy, the film fails to impress. It is hard to resist the comparison with it's contemporary Oscar compatriot Chicago as they both were heavily gunning for Oscar glory and share the same writer. But where Dreamgirls fizzles and Chicago shines is in the slick costumes and art direction, sharp and satirical direction, murderous critique of society and a persuasive and meaty storyline. In Dreamgirls, I was entertained for the most part, but even more, I found myself bored and disappointed by what could have been.",5,0,0,24 February 2007
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," A mystical, ancient story with a potent environmental message
","Miyazaki's early film captures the wondrousness and magical elements that have perfused each of his latest masterpieces under Studio Ghibli. Once again, the familiar elements include child-hero protagonists, struggling against a plundering king or queen, and heavily laden with environmental morals.This film follows young Nausicaä, Princess of the Valley of the Winds, struggling to save her country from invading Ohms out to wreak revenge on humankind after hundreds of years of human's plundering the earth's resources have left it a desert. She acts as the guardian and saviour to a variety of curious and exquisite insects with the desire to keep their natural paradises intact.Having been a huge fan of Japanese animation when I was young, I have had a falling out with this style since being involved in live-action film. I had not seen an animated feature in this style for quite a while on seeing Nausicaä, and at first, one can be surprised at the sparseness of animation and lack of over-textured and moving environs. But once the story grasps your senses, you wake up to a wondrous and enchanting world, and you notice many of the subtleties that define the famous Studio Ghibli. The simplicity of the animation only enforces and characters and places their concerns in the centre frame. The action sequences are thrill ride every time, and a sight to behold. The fluidity and detail in these scenes is striking and so energising; and considering the movement is all hand-drawn, it truly is a marvel to wonder at. As in most Miyazaki films, the action is always a highlight and so fun to watch. The real skill is in the storytelling and Miyazaki pulls you into this world so charismatically and vividly. Soon you forget about the details attach yourself to the world  I was wondering why we can't have more simple, pure storytelling like this today?The film is quite strong in Japanese idiosyncrasies including the lifestyle, person-isms, speech, and most strongly, the humour. While I found it quite comical and amusing at times, some of the audience (many Aussies) found it quite disconcerting and even distracting, to the point I heard some doze off. This is unfortunate because if one sees the film with a very open mind you can find yourself being absorbed into all the charm of this dreamlike world. I was completely whisked away and really warmed to these distinctive characters.Nausicaä's battle for the environment on behalf of these intriguing creatures draws lucid parallels to the ecological demands we face in our world today. Especially with the recent interest in our natural world, Nausicaa highlights many concerns in her struggle that make us realise that sometimes we too caught up with economic development and world conflict to realise our most precious resources are in grave danger.Even with this early effort, Miyazaki's film is never primitive and only too relevant to out to the world situation today. He always tells a story so lovably and charming, and in what is primarily a Japanese animation breaks all the language and cultural barriers. It is only too easy to relate to his characters' potent themes of war, childhood intuition, and environment hazards. With Nausicaä, and the Ghibli legacy, Miyazaki proves himself as one of the greatest storytellers of our time.",8,1,2,2 March 2007
Million Dollar Baby," A Masterpiece
","Masterpiece. That was the M word that Roger Ebert used to describe this superlative piece of cinema is his much lauded 2004 review. Whether or not you agree with his integrity as film critic, it remains an outstanding film. Since then, it went on to win the much deserved Academy Award for best picture and director in a time when the awards are losing much of their credibility.Clint Eastwood has structured a film that plays straight to the heart. It is honest, simple and thoughtful film-making, The story is tremendously moving, beautiful to watch, and to be drawn into the world of long-lost, fallen, and overdue fighters.Written by Paul Haggis, who achieved success with Crash in the following year, it tells the tale of Maggie (Swank) who intends to make it in the often misunderstood world of female boxing. She has come from the wrong side of the trailer park, with only one aspiration in life - to box. Eastwood has once again paired up with Freeman, last seen together in their successful outing in Unforgiven. Along with Swank, the 3 main principals all manage career best performances thanks to Haggis' strong script and Eastwood's perceptive direction.Eastwood's Frankie Dunn is a conflicted man passed over by dreams, accomplishments and failures both personally and professionally. He seeks solace from God but in issues of boxing, he's a strict atheist. His daughter and apprentice-boxer have both abandoned him; he almost lost Eddie in a fight. Over prudently, he refuses to make the same mistake again. So he spends his days managing the rejects trying to box their way out of their miserable lives. He is played with such regret and loss by Eastwood which display the fragility of a man who achieved so much but at a great personal loss.Eddie 'Scrap' Dupris (Freeman with glass eye) narrates the film, serves as consciousness to Eastwood, and the observer in the gym and boxing ring to the viewer. His reputation as a former boxer as coached by Frankie is demonstrated through in gruff undertones, masked by a dogged, scar-faced demeanor. Freeman is a remainder of Frankie's bygone days, his success in the ring and as a painful memory of the ugly side of boxing. His life now amounts to nothing more at the gym than cleaning up the spit, beating up bullies and retiring to HBO in the gym where his dreams were almost realised.Swank provides the turning point for the two men that ultimately brings them to desperate measures in the film's final act. She is for Frankie, the daughter he wishes he had; for Scrap, the opportunity to prove himself as a real fighter. With Frankie's coaching, she makes into the world of professional boxing, and more importantly, she has the opportunity to live her dream. Swank inhibits the role. As her own life story mirrors that of Maggie, she connects with her on all levels. She is defiant, rough, inspiring and raw. The challenges ahead of her are overwhelming in their adversity. But in her heartbreaking delivery, she knocks them out of the park.The script by Haggis is heartfelt, honest and true. We smell the sweat and blood in a rawness that is both pungent and violent. Broken bones and bloody noses are part of road to victory. The paradoxical relationship between boxing an life is convincing and saddening.The true star of the film is Eastwood's direction. He presents a story that is hopeful and inspiring but never panders to sentiment or pity. The gym is shot with the faded renaissance of the glory days; the boxing scenes are filmed with humour, energy and a sense of danger. The lighting is also quite amazing; giving us just what we require, allowing the viewer to formulate their own shapes. Sharp flashes of light and darkness suggest hope, mystery, danger, sadness and spirit.Each turn of the story is a shot in the arm, a blow to the stomach. Things don't always go as planned but hopefully, we can experience a dream for just a few moments.A refreshing take on the rags-to-riches sporting story, it really transcends that genre. This film is about how we can achieve that dream worth fighting for, and go to all lengths to make it.A stunning film that shows us that even though there are many ways to tell a story; we can still be moved in such powerful ways.",10,1,2,5 January 2007
Into the Wild," The road to nowhere
","Christopher McCandless wants to be a free spirit. He wants to break the shackles of institutionalised education and ambition. Of parent's expectations and society's reliance on definition by what we do. He graduates college, donates all his savings to charity, erases all record of his existence and runs away from home to be in the wild. The justifications for Christopher's journey into the beyond are slowly revealed through flashbacks and memories of his family, through interactions and friendships with a range of colourful characters along the way. He is ultimately selfish, passionate, angry, and frustrated. But he is smart, reflective and free. It appears that he wants to anger those around him to prove himself to them, to prove himself to the natural elements. In this way he is brave and arrogant but he fancies himself a thinker. His actions and adventures end up causing harm to himself and minor setbacks in his journey. Each episode he makes is such that of life  a grand plan carried away into detours where the wind blows. For all this time in the wild he never communicates with family but forms new relationships with complete strangers, who take to Christopher's infectious and vivacious attitude to life. Christopher hopes to derive some meaning to life from getting out there and 'just living' but the land proves to be just as harsh and uncompromising as the rules and standards he faced back home.The scenery, filmed in the Western U.S states, is very picturesque and expansive, demonstrating an impressive variety of landscapes and lifestyles, yet proving itself a formidable adversary for our hero. As is the case for many ensemble pieces, Christopher's idiosyncratic troupe of hippies, musicians, tourists, nomads, farmers, and fathers form an instrumental role in his spiritual growth and eventual destination. They all help Christopher along on his journey, but he able to teach them a thing or two about living. With his apparent naivety and joie-de-vivre, they form somewhat of a de-facto family to Christopher, and some of the closest relationships he experiences. Christopher affects each of them greatly, from Jan and Rainey's relationship counselling to educating Wayne with his abstract musings on 'living', and to octogenarian Ron who learn to live and be free. While Christopher is clearly alone in the wild, he meets others alone in life. And through his new-age philosophy, he enhances their lives with new found insight and action.But for all his philosophising and gung-ho attitude to life, I just couldn't accept that he could just leave his parents and sister for dead back home, not even to write or call (even if they tried to find him). To go on a journey with no plan and no money is somewhat foolish, thus his reasoning for the journey. But even if the journey is more important than the destination. What was achieved in the end? Couldn't he have talked through this with his family, his sister? Why only now when surely he had support and friends back home? Martyrdom is an effective device in telling a story but in all reality, it's futile and a waste of life. Call me a pragmatist, a realist, but the fact that he made it out there for 2 years, refused to give up and died for his means is naïve and pointless. Sean Penn has crafted a strong that has a good heart, but fairly unfocused and lengthy considering many scenes should have been cut. The direction was satisfactory, not stellar and the whole film lags in many places in what could have been a much tighter thrilling story. The abundance of too many erroneous scenes and themes of unrealistic romanticism ultimately fail to convince. Christopher states give me truth over love, money, fame, and fairness. Nice ideals, but I would say get out of the wild, into the real world and wake up.",5,4,9,24 December 2007
Blood Diamond," Thrilling action meets shocking essential history
","There are so many great films out at this time of the Awards season that I find it difficult to decide which ones to watch and not watch. After noticing that DiCaprio (coming off the back of his fantastic turn in The Departed) was starring, and Zwick (the architect of recent glittering panoramas such as The Last Samurai) directing, I decided to immerse myself in the civil war of Sierra Leone. I was glad that I had as I was swept by the beauty of the country, the exotic jungles and vibrant deserts in the film.DiCaprio has matured into a fine compelling actor especially since his striking role in the Aviator. In Diamond, his thick South-African accent was just another dimension to the rough, charming, roguish diamond smuggler that serves as our eclectic tour through the fiery Sierra Leone. His performance was charismatic, stunning and heartbreaking. Not to mention he carries the film almost entirely with wonderful help from Connelly and Hounsou. He is at times is dangerous, confident, but tender and I was captivated in his company in war-zone Sierra Leone. Some of the quiet moments in the film where his character is trying to justify his actions and make sense of the world current situation are without a doubt his truly splendid 'money' moments in acting. His final scene in the film is so poignant and intense - the character truly alluring and remarkable.Jennifer Connelly is once again a headstrong, confident and eloquent strong female character. Her ideals and determination force her to expose the corrupt trade of diamond mining and hence the blood yielded for each diamond earned. The chemistry between her and DiCaprio was edgy, clever and well grounded thanks to some tantalizing exchanges from the screenplay. I thought she has never looked more beautiful, articulate and admirable. I think I must have fell in love with her again. Honsou exuded a quiet intensity throughout. He remains relatively silent for most of the film but when he speaks out under oppression or violence his intensity rages with ferociousness. His tender scenes with his son near the end of the film are also incredibly moving. Not to take anything away from DiCaprio (superbly) playing a South African but Hounson (an African-born) filled the role in every way.The landscape was beautifully filmed, taking us over fleshy jungles, cocky and rollicking villages, unrepentant deserts and picturesque mountainsides. The Hollywood factor was felt in many scenes with the overpowering use of Newton Howard's score and the money on the formidable sets. But I must be gracious because the sets definitely deserve mention for there complexity, variety and character. Not least the action sequences were fast-paced, sharply photographed and edge-of-my seat suspense. Notably (and thankfully) was the absence of CG effects and explosions which made the experience of being in a war zone even more terrifying.The commendable and guileless storytelling of the director and producers must also be mentioned. They have brought us a movie that highlights the effects of modern war and civil unrest in our world including the exploitation of people who cannot experience the free will and the quality of life that we take for granted. Myself being for the most part ignorant of these events in our world's history will definitely be learning more about the Africa's bloodshed history and their countries still in desperate need of aid.",8,1,2,21 January 2007
Rocky," Popular melodrama in a landmark era for American cinema
","1976. A landmark year in cinema. And one of the most heavily contested Academy awards in history. No matter how you look at it, the 70s was the greatest time for American cinema. Scorsese, Coppola, Lumet. Some of the fiercest battles were won in the Academy awards. And it was an exciting time for moviegoers.While Rocky may get a bad rap for beating out some of these American classics for the prize, the fact remains it still is a powerful, inspirational film about a man's dreams to be the best no matter what obstacles lie in is his way.The question is does it still hold up after over 30 years? The character of Rocky is one of the most memorable film characters ever and has and established Stallone as a serious filmmaker. Many of the sequences have been engraved in film and popular culture namely the training sessions, meat boxing and the final battle and closing scenes. For fans, these scenes continue to cause great emotional instability no matter how hackneyed and clichéd they have become today. And this is one is one of 'the greatest underdog stories ever told.'Stallone carries the film for it's duration - no other actor probably could have played Rocky. The character is well developed by Stallone who wrote the screenplay and was Oscar nominated for both his acting and writing. Stallone's mannerisms, raw, dopey acting style fit the character like a glove. The writing was poetic, heartfelt and honest but I did feel that there were some pacing issues and where the film lagged a bit. You could argue that Stallone merely played himself but he did a good job overall.The other strength of the film was the directing for which it won an Oscar. It sets up the Rocky's neighbourhood well, the missed opportunities, the darkness and lost hope. The shades of a dream wanting to be borne into light. The pacing was unusually sombre, quiet and patient for a orthodox story which ultimately worked in favour for the director.But I just didn't connect with this film. I thought the story was too simple and clichéd (in light of watching this 30 years after it's release and in hindsight of more recent boxing films) and there were some dead moments. I would have liked to see more about the fight and less about Rocky's soap operatic antics with his girlfriend and family. In the end I felt it too melodramatic for me add to that the (I can't help it) overdone music and story.Plus it is impossible not to think about the other American films around this era that have been lasted longer and more potently as a comment on American life and the dream. All the President's Men, Taxi Driver, Network and Raging Bull. All these films have something to say have hopes, dreams, and ideals. While Rocky has captured the hearts of the viewers, it's contemporaries remain timeless and more perceptive in today's world.",5,6,15,28 January 2007
The Last King of Scotland," A rugged suspense thriller that fills you with dread in your stomach
","Just in time for awards season, we are presented with a once-in-a-career maniacal, multi-layered and commanding performance. These characters are usually based off notorious historical figures in literature, music, science (Think Virginia Woolf, John Nash, Ray Charles, June Carter, add Idi Amin). These great performances all enhance their spirit and impact on our world history.The Last King Of Scotland is an adventurous and rugged thriller filmed and set amongst the rough deserts and buzzing cities of 1970s Uganda, Africa. Like the 'other' African thriller this year - Blood Diamond - it flaunts invigorating panoramas across the festive and lively people of Africa with some spirited on-set locations.The story follows Nicholas Garrigan, a newly graduated doctor searching for adventure and a chance to prove his newfound skills to save lives. He ends up in Uganda (by pure luck) and quickly befriends Idi Amin - dictator and ruthless leader. Their strike up a unique friendship and soon, Garrigan is living the high life with Amin - special treatment, boisterous parties, palace luxuries and limitless power. Things get out of hand when Amin's murderous and dogmatic policies result in failure healthcare, a stumbling economy, deaths, and assassination attempts. Garrigan's beliefs and ethics are put to the test when the Amin puts the pressure on him to stay on. Against his will, Garrigan soon ends up running a country he knows nothing about and signing his name in Amin's murderous tactics.The buzz says that Whitaker will probably win the Oscar for this one (although I prefer another leading South-African performance this year). He is impressive throughout, stealing the show in every scene he's in. He commands a frightening bipolar authority that is so charismatic and likable even in his moments of rage. His gaiety and jestery is so contagious that it easy to see why Garrigan forms such a close so quickly with him. And with Garrigan we also begin to see the precarious edge of his power to nasty consequences. But I must say that I really felt Whitaker should have contributed more him to the story. His appearances in the film were a little too disjointed and I compare the performance to that of Kidman's 2002 Woolf. All show but not enough maturity. I really wanted to know so much more about him - his rise and demise, and more character development. As a result, he came off as only series of ferocious vignettes rather than than the whole portrait he could have been.McAvoy carries the film for the entire duration well, serving as our eyes and our ears pulling us into his world. He does a commendable job and is enjoying a worthy bookmark in his career. It is chilling to see his world cracking apart and through his eyes it only too easily becomes our world too.I really would have liked to see more of Gillian Anderson's character. She is undergoing an interesting revival, doing the circuits. She is developed well at the start with some absorbing mysteries and a curious history, but we almost never see her again in the film and the opportunity is totally wasted.The story is suspenseful throughout but I felt that the editing could have been much sharper, plus/minus a few extraneous characters. In addition, the film's subject matter just didn't interest me as much as it should have - perhaps because it wasn't my cup of tea (no fault to the film intended). The scenery is vibrant for the most part showing of the exotic tones of Amin's palace and the harshness of the African nation.This is Macdonald's first fiction feature after the excellent dramatised documentaries, One Day In Sept & Touching The Void. With this film, Macdonald proves his niche in dealing with shocking historical events bending the line between gut-wrenching suspense and hard non-fiction. In 'Last King', he remains so true and honourable to the material all the way. A thrilling and suspenseful thriller, with some historical eye openers thrown in for kicks. However not quite my style - only an average drama for me but worth looking into for the memorable performance.",6,7,10,15 February 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," Intriguing concept of modern life but lacking in energy
","Every once in a while, a movie comes along that changes the way you look at a comedic actor and really shows off their acting prowess in the dramatic talent. Jim Carrey, Adam Sandler and Will Smith have all made the cut, each of them earning critical acclaim for their performances.Stranger Than Fiction tells the story of hopeless Harold Crick stuck in a boring job, living in his solitary life, being imprisoned by his daily routines. He trundles along day after day waiting for his life to explode into action. One day he begins to hear a voice in his head. Is it god? A higher power? Someone is writing a story about every waking moment of his life and only he has the power to take control of it; to try new things, fulfill dreams and find love.The revelation that something is changing occurs almost from the beginning of the film, so little time is wasted on establishing characters and setting. As a result the action begins early, and thankfully so do the laughs.Will Ferrell's performance has been hailed as moving, touching, and in slyly humorous overtones. He gives one of his best heartfelt performances here with much restraint and self-loathing comedy. By the end though I wanted to see more from Ferrell instead of just the poe-faced, drab IRS auditor. His transformation could have been stellar showing off a palette of emotions. By the time it came to 'carpe diem' for him I was let down a little bit by his sluggishness.Gyllenhaal is charming, sweet and sexy in her role and she provides an attractive love interest. Her character in the film is a good 'opposites attract' match for Ferrell and she has good material to work with in the film. Hoffman (as well as each of his films) as Professor Hilbert is marvelous and totally outshines Ferrell at times; is so natural and zany, pivotal to Harold's life changing actions.I really wished we saw more of Emma Thompson's Kay Eiffel, the chain-smoking author of Harold's life experiencing writer's block. She is so believably wacky and eccentric, inhabiting her role. Unfortunately there was not much for her to work with and the character was not fully developed as I would have liked. Her assistant (Latifah) was underused and wasted and I felt did not bring anything worthwhile to the plot or the dynamic with Eiffel.But the main problem I have with the film were the serious pacing issues, especially during the second half. There were some dead moments where the action didn't seem to move along even despite the commendable efforts of the fine actors. I felt the climax of the film was too drawn out and overdone and really lacked the wit and pace required in tradition with the film's subject matter. Forster tries to infuse humour into many scenes and downplays the score and tone of many scenes. However most of the time it comes out just awkward and lacking energy, ultimately I felt that the film slowed down terribly.The story itself is a very Woody Allen-esquire premise with voice-overs, blurring between reality and satire and rantings on the futility and ridiculousness of modern life. I was expecting a really clever, witty and satirist comedy but in the end I really was a disappointed. The script lacked energy and bite, the dialogue should have been much sharper. Also given the fantastic cast, how could you go wrong?This is a remarkable debut for this promising writer and another solid film for this versatile director. They had a fantastic cast that fulfilled their roles very well. But I felt that the script should have been much stronger and the editing was very flat. Still, a valuable addition to Mr Ferrell's resume and worth a look for the very intriguing concept.",5,1,4,1 February 2007
The Queen," An exquisite portrait of the charming Queen in a defining moment of our generation
","Is the Queen still necessary today? In 'The Queen', Frears paints an unflattering picture at times, and maybe candidly unsympathetic portrait of HMQE2. She is shown as a cold, resolute and inflexible mother, grandmother, wife, and daughter, trying to lead the country with traditions that are becoming stale and archaic. In one week, her popularity and status has never been under more scrutiny in today's society.It charts the infamous period in English history beginning with Tony Blair's remarkable accession as the Labor Prime Minister in 1997 to the shocking death of Princess Diana that unprecedentedly brought the nation, and the monarchy to a standstill. The events are interspersed with some amazing news footage of the palace and the public at the time, the vividness and striking quality of these clips resonate so deeply with those of us around at the time that the surreal events only feel like they happened yesterday. This was a defining moment of our generation.The film is beautifully furnished, filmed on location in the palace and surrounding English streets including No.10. The Scottish highlands were also sweepingly picturesque, the stand-out a fantastic helicopter shot over the rolling hills capturing the hunt for the majestic stag. Frears does a good effort directing, finding some unique angles within the palace, maintaining the suspense of the film throughout, and taking the time to showcase Mirren's fine talents.The acting is fantastic all round with Mirren leading the royal procession as the haughty and detached majesty seen by the public, but underneath her layers, a tenacious and pragmatic mother of the people who reminds us that even our leaders must be led sometimes. She commands a performance of restraint and economy, allowing us deep into her public fears with a simple shift of the eyes or in the intonation of her crisp delivery of English wit. Tony Blair, Prince Philip, and The Queen Mother are also all startlingly realised in multidimensional characterizations that demonstrate their futility, outrage and rejection of the collapsing of the idea of the monarchy. Both their physical and emotional attributes have been translated superbly to the screen. Each actor captures each members of the family's spirit and their characteristics without resorting to banal trivialisations or shallow caricatures.The script written by man-of-the-moment Peter Morgan is bursting with the dry English wit that is so subtle but punishing when well delivered. It assumes nothing and yet has much to say about the break-down between the Royals, the people and the 21st century. The smart delivery and meditations on modern government also make some realisations about biting that hand that feeds you. Plus there are some great deadpan one-liners throughout. The score by Golden Globe winner Alexandre Desplat is sweet and charming yet hints at the peoples' taking over of power. There are also some splendidly sensual and voluptuous passages that reflect on the Queen's state of mind during the film.I really wanted to like this film. The incomparable Helen Mirren in a superb majestic role. Queen Elizabeth 2 herself has always enchanted me and I was expecting a mature and refined drama about one of my favourite historical figures. Plus the film has an exquisite beauty. But perhaps I was expecting too much. Mirren, while breathtaking didn't elevate me to soaring heights and the characterisation was a little too harsh. QE2's charismatic and can-do personality, her efforts in the war, tribulations with former PMs and her relationship with the parliament deserve not to be overlooked just because she had a moment of poor public judgment. And I felt all her achievements in the name of England were overlooked in preference of making the Queen look like an prehistoric, dogmatic old bat. She was a very elegant and pretty young woman in her time and at 80(!) is in superb health and looks for her age.In the end, I also felt it was a little too 'telemovie' and not critical or salient enough to demand forceful passion from the viewer. Still well deserved Oscar noms and probably wins; a pleasure to see unique and vivid portrayals of the Queen and her family too easily dismissed as a bunch of stuck-up Royals. Long live The Queen!",7,0,1,21 February 2007
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," A hackneyed and over-baked Elizabethan soap opera
","Elizabeth: The Golden Age attempts to bring us something new in the currently overcrowded realm of Tudor dynasties and kingdoms. In the past few years we have gotten HBO's stunning Elizabeth 1 and Helen Mirren's QE2, The Tudors, and the soon to be released Mary, Queen of Scots and The Other Boleyn Girl. Unfortunately Elizabeth: The Golden Age is just a recycled rehash of these films and a souped up costumed soap opera. The film covers the ground late in Elizabeth's life prior to the Spanish Armada. With the lack of an English male heir, the Spanish kingdom is closing ranks on her throne, pushing forth their candidate to rule the English throne.Elizabeth is the meantime is swept up in her dealings with the smooth Sir Walter Raleigh. She is supported by the pretty but pointless in terms of story lady-in-waiting Bess Throckmorton, and Geoffrey Rush who is surprisingly reserved as her counsellor Sir Francis Walsingham. While all the actors involved are undoubtedly talented, they don't really have anything to do and their efforts are wasted on the atrocious script which amounts to nothing more than soap operatic gazing and tantrums.Not even Blanchett can save this train wreck of cardboard cut-out characters, juvenile musing and tantrums, simplification of the English and Spanish characters, and their respective puerile depictions of good vs evil. To top it off, the nauseating musical score only accentuated the sensationalized soap-operatic elements of this overblown cheese.Kapur seems to have gone downhill from the last Elizabeth. This 'sequel' was atrociously and pretentiously shot. Such direction involved blocking the characters form the camera with all manner of stupid objects from frames to walls and lights, shooting from ridiculously pointless angles such as ceilings and poorly edited scenes, jumping from time frames across England and Spain with no continuity of what is happening throughout the story.There have been so many better recent adaptations of Elizabeth. The trick is not to create something better than the last, or the umpteenth version of Elizabeth and Essex, but for audiences who crave more of one of our most enigmatic leaders; something that is unique, different and not merely a rehash of soap operatic whining and outbursts. Such material as The Golden Age that would be better off on the front pages of a tabloid magazine. Honestly in the end, I just didn't care.",5,10,16,24 December 2007
The Pursuit of Happyness," I wanted to stand and cheer for this man!
","It seldom happens that I walk out after seeing a film, inspired by the characters, their tenacity and courage. However once the lights come on after this one, I felt this great power inside of me to make a change. Sometimes we don't really appreciate how lucky some of us everyday that we have a place to sleep, eat and a family to turn to.Chris Gardner was able to make to most of his opportunities and never give up even in the face of losing everything. This man, was not a genius, born with some incredible gift. He is like any one of us. Striving to make the best of himself, giving it a go and always knowing that anything is possible if you try.The film, aptly directed by Gabriele Muccino brazenly tells the story of Chris and his son trying to make a living in the world. Chris is finding it increasingly difficult to pay the rent add to that the costs of childcare and ensuring his son has a good education. His wife (ferocious and heartbreaking played by Thandie Newton) has little strength and hope left in her and has given up hope completely. Despite this, Chris marches on and into a job at Dean Witter. He's a bright guy and applies himself diligently and earnestly. He uses every opportunity he gets to accomplish is goals, practically doing what needs to be done all while keeping his head afloat from poverty. Most of all, he never backs out when things get tough. By example, he teaches us some heartfelt and reliable rules about life.I thought it a little strange that an Italian would direct a film starring a black American about the hardships of living in suburban U.S. However when you watch the film, you realise it could be taking place anywhere in the world. This is a story about the steadfastness of a man trying to cope in a system that has abandoned him, where hope is scarce and precious. It is a story of hope, anywhere in the world. Add the shimmering luscious score by Andrea Guerra, I did feel some resemblance towards the films Il Postino and Cinema Paradiso, but this film never shies away from harsh realities and avoids sentimentalism abundant in those films.1980s San Fransisco and the bay is beautifully showcased by the shimmering waters and azure sky, set against the rolling hills and eclectic mix of Victorian and modern architecture. Seeing the city made me revisit some picturesque scenes in Vertigo where Jimmy Stewart is cruising around on the tail of his mysterious Carlotta.As many reviewers have already noted, the story never panders to blame, pity or politics. What is more inspiring is that Gardner never uses these excuses to stop him from doing what needs to be done. He always carries himself with confidence, integrity, a smile and fighting spirit.While some people may take the simplistic view that money is the be all and end all to happiness, the truth is that in order to live and sustain oneself in a developed society one must play be the rules of work to live. It is also necessary to understand that capitalism is necessary to sustain a wealthy economy. This film shows us the darker side of such a society but how each person can still make their dream if they work hard and have hope.I was deeply affected by the courage of Smith. He has wonderfully evolved since his early days as the skinny homeboy in Fresh Prince proving his versatility and maturity and the transformation is impressive. His character was tremendously brave, bold and inspiring. The qualities that made him a good person, good father were the same ones that told him never to give up. The chemistry with his son was tangible, raw and wondrous. Both of them deserve Academy awards nominations next week. They serve a testament to anyone who needs a chance in life just to live.I loved that quote that Gardner bestowed to his son when it seemed there was little hope in sight. It basically summed what he was trying to achieve in the film. But it was so simple and true that we should all apply it everyday - 'You want something? Go get it. Period.' I'm not an emotional person, but by the end I was cheering like no other AND had tears in my eyes. Truly inspiring.",7,0,0,19 January 2007
