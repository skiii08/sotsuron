Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," INCREDIBLE! THE BEST STAR WARS YET(NEXT TO 'EMPIRE' OF COURSE)!!!!
","What can I say? I LOVED IT! Even though I hated all the use of CGI (Computer Graphic Imaging) and I equally hated that duck-billed-rabbit-eared-annoyance JAR JAR BINKS, It was still an excellent film. It was the best STAR WARS movie since 'THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK'! All the characters were great (except the horribly mis-cast Samuel L. Jackson)! The Pod race and the Jedi showdown with DARTH MAUL alone was worth the price of admission (and the hours waiting in line). It was a very fun film! If you wanna see some 'deep plot & serious acting' then go see a SHAKESPEARE play, but if you want to have a damn fun time at the movies then go see STAR WARS EPISODE ONE: THE PHANTOM MENACE.",10,0,0,20 May 1999
