Skyfall," Skyfall Soars!
","Prior to this film being released, I felt that Casino Royale was Daniel Craig's best performance as the titular hero. Boy, was I wrong! This new film puts all of the past films to shame. The filmmakers knew they had to come up with a good film after the average Quantum of Solace. Films that have a personal issue for any character to deal with always makes the film more interesting to watch. Such is the case here. I was also glad to see that the filmmakers wanted to ground this film in reality, despite some new character additions. The acting was well done by everyone in the cast. My big hope is that from here on out, the Bond films will continue down the path that this film has carved. Daniel Craig is the model for every other future Bond actor.",9,2,10,12 November 2012
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," The Transformers are back and better than ever!
","This film rocks! I've seen the comments the detractors wrote to throw down on this film. What they fail to realize is that this is just a film. Summer entertainment at its best! The scale was bigger and the battles even better. I did wish that the film did move a bit quicker as the 3rd act was about to begin. The Twins weren't as annoying as other people were making them out to be. Yes, some of the comedy was overdone and forced, but it was a small price to pay for what was an otherwise very good film. The best element of the film was the relationship between Sam and Optimus Prime. It reminds you of the relationship between Luke and Obi-Wan, mentor and student, and even surrogate father-son. All in all, great job on the filmmakers' behalf!",9,1,4,4 July 2009
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A triumphant result!
","Before I begin, I want all of you who read this review to not be swayed by the negative reviews here on IMDb. Make up your own minds and give this movie a chance. Don't compare this film to anything Marvel has done thus far.Okay, so with that said, I want to begin by saying that this film is a solid film. I like how director Zack Snyder, and the film's writers created a sort of slow burn with the pacing of the film's narrative. Everything builds up quite nicely to the gripping finale. Nothing was out of place, with the actors' performances making the film's story and tone work very well. Everybody in the cast did an excellent job. I know I wrote earlier for those who read this review to not compare this film to Marvel's stuff. So, please allow me this small transgression...lol. For a while now, some people have been really giving Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice a hard time for not living up to certain expectations(that just means they wanted this film to be like Marvel's The Avengers). Well, let me say this(and I'm sure many Marvel fans will be ticked off): Batman v Superman is a much better film than Avengers: Age of Ultron. That's right. I thoroughly enjoyed this film more so than I did Age of Ultron. Why? That's because I felt as if the villains in BvS:DOJ were evil for all the right reasons instead of for no reason as in Age of Ultron. The stakes were much higher as well. So, in the end, make what you will from this review. But, be sure to see this film with an open mind. You will not be disappointed.",9,3,9,1 June 2016
Lucy," Limitless meets La Femme Nikita
","I saw this film yesterday. I was interested mainly because I like Luc Besson as a director, and I was curious to see how Scarlett Johansson performed in this film. First off, let's get to what works for this film: the action scenes are well done, for one. Luc Besson knows how to put together action scenes. Morgan Freeman is great as the professor who examines the premise this film is based upon. But, then again, Morgan Freeman is great in anything he does! Scarlett Johansson does a good job of capturing the character of Lucy, going from being a Waif, to being a Warrior. Now for the bad: the length of the film is only 88 minutes long. In the conventional sense, 88 minutes is right at the end of Act Two in a screenplay. Before I wrote this review, I read that this film was a decade in the making. A decade in the making, and the best Mr. Besson could do is a film that is only 88 minutes long? That's sad. This film needed so much more character development. I would have gladly appreciated this film if it was right at two hours or over. Lastly, there's the bad guy who doesn't really do anything more than shout, make faces, and shoot at people. In the end, this film is wasted as an opportunity to really be something.",5,2,7,13 October 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," SW:The Force Awakens-A worth addition
","Today, I was finally able to see The Force Awakens at my local theater. In all, it was a good movie. There were some areas that the film could use improvement, especially with the dialogue of one of the main characters. Also, I feel as if there could have, or really, should have been a switch with the actors for couple of the film's characters. Actionwise, the film does not disappoint. J.J. Abrams does a good job with keeping things going, especially in the second and third acts. There were moments in the first act where things felt too uneven. I have to say that I miss the 20th Century Fox fanfare music, because that was so much a part of the Star Wars experience. But, nitpicks aside, this film was a good return to form. I'm very eager to see what's in store for us when Episode VIII comes out.",8,3,23,27 March 2016
Godzilla," Forget the 1998 Godzilla ever existed....
","When the news first broke last year that Godzilla was being brought back to the big screen, let me just say I was hardly thrilled. After having seen the fantastic Pacific Rim, I didn't know how Godzilla would ever match up. Well, allow me to extend my most humble apologies to the filmmakers. This new film's director, Mr. Gareth Edwards, created a 'monster movie' with heart. But, this is not merely a monster movie. This is a movie about ordinary everyday people having to deal with the consequences of toying with nature. The cast here is well put together from Bryan Cranston as a determined scientist to David Strathairn as a no-nonsense Navy admiral. What really makes this film shine is the script and director's sense of realism. The musical score works very well here, particularly in the film's creepier moments. My only complaint here would be the film's running time. I wouldn't have minded 10 more minutes! lol. Finally, the monsters. Just one word to describe them: AWESOME.",9,1,5,18 May 2014
Alien: Covenant," Alien: Nonsense
","First, let me say that I love Prometheus. I don't what it is, but I feel that more care was taken to create that film. It rocked!! So, this past weekend Alien: Covenant premiered on HBO. The best thing about this film is the visuals. Ridley Scott really knows how to give his audience a feast for the eyes with the way he creates the environments for his films. That's the only reason I'm giving this review three stars. Beyond that, this movie is absolute rubbish. I read the novelization last year and enjoyed it despite the pathetic storyline the novelization was based on. Alan Dean Foster brings the chills and thrills better than the screenwriters ever could!! The main reasons I was turned off: the stupid decisions the crew made, final fate of a certain character, the process by which one of the parasites cause a crewmember's death, & the ending(which I chuckled at..lol!). Also, the amount of gore was a bit much. Sure, by now my comments are nothing new, but I had to give my opinion upon viewing the film out of curiousity. And now, since Disney has acquired 20th Century Fox, I don't think we'll get another good Alien film. Ridley Scott needs to step away from the director's chair and let someone else have a go at this franchise.",3,1,1,7 March 2018
