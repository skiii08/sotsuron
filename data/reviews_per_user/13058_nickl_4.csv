The Blair Witch Project," Break out your notebooks again...
","There is constant debate over this film, if it were in my power I would end it, but no man's voice should be silenced... given some guidance? perhaps, absolutely, most definitely yes. You watch 'Blair Witch,' and you're not watching a bad film. You're actually watching one of the most important horror films of the 90's. 'Blair Witch,' 'Scream,' 'The Sixth Sense,' and even the re-release of 'Exorcist' were the most important horror/thriller box-office takes of recent movie making history. With 'Blair Witch' you see how simply a story can be told, with a budget that isn't even a 1/6 of Tom Cruise's payroll for any film it is taken in effectively. Problems in the movie and dislike in the story was inevitable since the entire film was shot from one of three subjective points-of-view. You either agree with Heather, Mike and Josh, or you don't.. if you don't, you sit there and pity them for their inability to deal with (what most people might think) is a 'normal' situation. Seeing this in theaters on opening day, kids were yelling out 'shut up you stupid b****,' as Heather was screaming, looking for Mike in the old house in the woods, and going 'ooohhh, scaaaaaarrrryyy!' when we first realize that the trio is actually being terrorized by someone or something. I watched these kids, observing their hypocrisy, and noted it. These are the same kids who thought 'Scream' and its sequels were the best horror movies ever, when it followed the same story-structure that ever horror film made in the last twenty-five years have! That pattern being: maniac killer, blood and cuts, hot chicks, scenes constructed to make you jump - but no real genuine horror, nothing psychologically grounded. This is where I think most people did not see the marvel of creativity behind 'The Blair Witch Project'. It is the kind of film that has you asking yourself, and your friends what you would do if you were in that situation. That's how it's 40 page outline was written. The audience makes their own horror, in a way, provided with certain steps like little wooden figures hanging from trees, mounds of death stones and the creepy echo of children laughing in the darkness of a woods YOU KNOW there shouldn't be kids roaming around in. To me, there's a basic two formula method of how a film goes bad, after it's already scripted: 1. The film has a poor interpretation from the audience 2. Or the film has a poor interpretation from the director, producersOf course I'm not ignoring the 'can't make a good movie from a bad script, but you can make a bad movie from a good script,' rule. But once the movie is already on the big screen, it's up to the mind of the viewer to make the final judgment,'The Blair Witch Project' was a landmark for independent movie making in the United States for the 90's, along with being one of the most important horror films of that decade. Following the Hitchcock formula of 'less is more' it allows you to wonder what is just off to the sides of the camera shots, and what the three characters were seeing. Its strength was in the auditory sense giving the full panic of the three protagonists. All the while teasing the audience with a limited amount of visual effect. All in all, the horror of the film comes not from what so many other horror films give: 'what you see is what you get.' 'Blair Witch' makes it into 'what you hear is what you get, what you see.. is up to you to decide what's just beyond the reach of the camera.'My advise, watch the film again. Truly put yourself in their wet, muddy shoes and remember the last time you were in those kinds of woods. Now I'll ask you: if you thought the movie was no big deal, take a trip up to Maryland, pick a forest and go camping.. if you hesitate, break out your movie guideline and script notebooks. Time to revise...Above average acting. Excellent independent film-making. 8.4/10",Null,1,2,6 January 2001
Alien 3," Entitled opinions, simple observations...
","I first saw Alien 3 in theaters on opening night back in '92, and I can still remember the sickening 'grip' it had on me. The kind of grimy/feverish/dirty feel the set and production design induced on the audience - as well as the droll music score (heavy in dark reverberations). At first, I hated it for that, but soon I realized that's exactly what it was supposed to do. Film-making (no matter what genre) is meant to 'tap' the sensitive side to a person's mind. Between Ripley's ongoing agony of feeling physically sick & her personal battle against the race of aliens, the almost inhumane conditions of Fury 161, and most of all the threat of the dog-bread alien who instills constant fear, though we hardly see him - these elements compose a lot of what was seen in the original. I'm a student filmmaker and writer; I'm guessing that there's a lot more out there. I wouldn't dare say you guys are wrong in anyway if you didn't like Alien 3; I've read your reviews, you're all well spoken - criticizing fellow critics is childish. Film Aesthetics doesn't allow that kind of behavior. Remember, we're writing to the IMDb to examine the concept of the films we see. I think it's fair to say though: keep more of an open mind, and instead of focusing on the negativity of the story (and yes, there is some of that in this film) just sit down some night when there's nothing else to do and watch it again. Make an outline of the story. The major focal points of the script. The drives of the characters & most importantly the setting. Not to dictate (I'm no authority), just realize this: the film has almost no gunfire and minimal explosions. 'Aliens' WAS LOADED with this. Guys, come on, don't forget the logic in it: firing 10,000 rounds of ammo and burning the world are cop-outs to movie-making. IF OVER USED, they do nothing but waste screen time; time in which the writer could think of nothing else better to put to his pen. The true path to action or suspense lies in what the general audience can relate to, which is not having an RPG fired at your face. None of us know that thrill, but almost all of us know what it's like to fall off something high or be endangered by something, or maybe be cornered somewhere - instilling claustrophobia. From the 1st film we ALL KNOW that Ripley began as a central character who became the lead protagonist through default. From the 2nd film, more of a shoot-'em-up than an masterpiece, we understand Ripley is willing to sacrifice to gain. From a simple FNG POV I realized that Ripley had become a virtual 'prisoner' to her own commitments. Good recent examples of giving all you have, how 'bout 'Schindler's List' or 'Sling Blade?' Drawing examples of the strength of Ripley's character is just my way of (I guess you could say) 'defending' the 3rd film. The elements of the story existed and were defined well. Metaphorically, how could the situation be anymore worked out? And last but not least, admit to yourselves, the film was a far better entry than 'Resurrection.' I guess the only other thing I can fit in is this: David Fincher wasn't trying to top Ridley or Cameron for their films - not at his status in Hollywood. He simply interpreted the film the way he thought the story should be told. Interpretation is all it is. Screenwriters are told: you can't make a good movie from a bad script, but you can make a bad movie from a good script. 'Alien 3' has very keen dialogue, direct to its premise - but, sure, I'll admit it's got a few lines that are like a butch-90's flare of bad jokes or tough-guy one-liners. Wait a sec, 'Aliens' does, so does 'Alien'. 'Resurrection' is loaded with it. That's ironic. I'm still not quite sure what it is. I view 'Alien 3' as a solid *** film, intense and suspenseful. I only hope to one day get a clear solid answer as to where all the negativity comes from for it? Making a feature film like this is extremely technical, sometimes the makers lose concentration of that 50/50 balance they need to accomplish. The film isn't an atrocity. Could it of used some help... sure. I still wonder: if 'Alien 3' wasn't the third film but was just the first one (like a one-and-only) would we have thought differently about it? Keep your minds open guys, it's all interpretation, and we're all just trying to entertain. -Chris J. nlappos chris@redbug",Null,2,3,16 September 1999
Saving Private Ryan," The Best War Picture Ever Filmed
","The harrowing torment of combat has never been so accurately portrayed. This is a study of loyalty, courage, leadership and sacrifice, and it is a tour de force for Tom Hanks, who has filled the shoes of Jimmie Stewart. His quiet portrait of leadership is a cure for the swaggering macho of Stallone and Segal, who lied to a generation of Americans about what soldiering is all about.You must see it, you must take your parents and your children, and you must tell your congressman to see it.  Don't be put off by the violence, it is not just part of the story, it is the story.  I saw enough combat in Vietnam to really understand, and yet I cried for my father and his friends when I saw this film.",10,0,0,16 September 1998
The Shawshank Redemption," Simply told can sometimes tell it all...
","'Friendship or Prison' FilmI work in one of the last 'Mom & Pop' Video stores in southern Florida. Without the restrictions of a Blockbuster-like corporation job expectentcies, I'm able to discuss anything I want with anyone - for however long it takes. A few months ago I had a customer inquire about the film; I knew right off the bat he had 'doubts' about the quality of the film. I got it for him, and gave him a rundown of the plot when he asked me my 'No BS' opinion on the film. I just wish this guy knew I don't lie to anybody about this film. We must have sat down for two hours: I just listened, subjectively, while he came up with some question or comment that a friend or relative had brought to his attention - giving him the impression the film was 'sketchy.' In the end, it simply turned out to be a question of whether or not it's a prison film or a friendship film. How do you weigh it? The setting is constant, but the characters are defined so well it's blinding. I only mention the incident with the customer since it made me realize which road the film really fits down best. 'The Shawshank Redemption,' in the tradition of classic friendship characters such as R.P MacMurphy & Chief, Ratzo Rizzo & Joe Buck, Butch Cassidy & Sundance has its two main characters (Andy Dufrense & 'Red') as two guys tied into a friendship from *circumstance* (meaning prison). As the years pass and they can only see the world from a single point of view (behind the walls of Shawshank), they begin understand each other more and more on a spiritual level. Yes, it does start as a prison film, but eventually turns to a buddy/friendship film. With Andy and Red's friendship growing, the walls of Shawshank disappear - you can even notice there are almost no wide angle exterior shots after the first 45 minutes. The claustraphobia of the cells and the solitary cells are pretty harsh, yeah, but I take that as a metaphor for the restrictions the characters are unable to release; they're own ideas, beliefs and thoughts are also prisoners. I only discuss the conflict question of 'prison film or buddy film' just to set something straight. The last time I saw the movie, I realized: 'Does anyone watching it remember they were prisoners? Does anyone *see* the walls of Shawshank?' I think it was too difficult, with the Royal blue of the Gulf and the white powder of the beach, it's almost as if there's no trace of a dark, cold, and unfriendly prison anywhere in the film prior to that moment. Andy sees his friend, knowing exactly the reason for his arrival. After that, they know whatever lies ahead in life that could be challenging or difficult won't be anymore. It's a simple safety in numbers, 'you watch my back, I'll watch yours.' - very close to Joe Buck & Ratso from 'Midnight Cowboy.'chrisjohn email to: oneofthree78@aol.com",Null,0,0,14 November 1999
