Kill Bill: Vol. 2," This genre does not work outside of Asia, and that is all there is to say to this movie.
","The scene where Black Mamba escapes from the buried wooden coffin is quite remarkable (even if as from a fairy tale). This scene earned the 2 points. Otherwise there has been no plot in part 1 and this did not miraculously change here either. The character of Bill is one of the main problems. It is quite unbelievable that this rather chatty but otherwise not remarkable guy is the origin of all evil (read the Trivia, can you imagine that Warren Beatty ever seriously considered this role? I can't). It is further hard to believe that every woman in the movie develops a crash on him. It is then not easier to perceive that he has lovingly raised a child of the woman he had shot, but then again, did not get killed and waited patiently for her return, then had her buried, and then even various others attending to her. In the first place, he does not seem to be worth the trouble. Then the part where Daryl Hanna's (first) eye gets poked out- in case you are a martial arts trainer and your pupil shows disrespect, take an eye but continue the relationship? Why only an eye? The brother is an enigma. I won't go into details, but surely he could have put up more of a fight in case he was in the assassin business before now. And the kill Bill part at the end? Uma Thurman actually talks him dead. No spectacular fight scenes be here any more. These having been the only considerably good part of Volume 1, not much remains here to be credited.",2,1,5,7 May 2007
Lucky Number Slevin," Well done.
","Very well crafted movie, where everything works starting from the music on, the story, the characters, the cuts, really nice and entertaining.It was fun to see Bruce Willis performing not as a good guy in the first place, but a controversial figure (although he does not do much talking this time either). Josh Hartnett has been quite a surprise to me- he did much better than I expected. Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley were their usual good selves (nothing extraordinary, though).There are some real good dialogs, and some nice when not laughs but big smiles.All together, an involving, good storyline, decent performances = 109 minutes of good quality entertainment.<ul><li>- - HERE BE SPOILERS - - - </li></ul>Something I did not get is why Slevin would tell Lindsey about himself anything at all in the first place, let alone about his past and the job that is on. The other thing - you can trust a man with your life, he has raised you, he has taught you everything of his craft, he does everything he can to assist you in killing off the murderers of your parents (with what he had nothing to do directly), but you can not tell him, hey, you know, I kinda like this girl, let's keep her around for a while, shall we? And why? Beacuase he would SURELY not understand. Why would Goodkat shoot Lindsey in the chest, then again? Everybody is always being shot in the head in this film (the bookie is banged in the head with a ball, the Rabbi's men both get head shots, the son of the Rabbi is shot in the head), why the chest for Lindsey - okay, it is apparent, so as to have this plot twist. Well, it has not been worth it.Also, being a pro, why would you prefer an unknown girl to the guy who spared your life, your tutor and only living 'relation', so to say? Why do this love threads always get so week in otherwise good films? There were some moments of very good humor here. Josh Hartnett is being dragged around for a considerable part of the movie like a package, but for quite a long part, without the usual wrap. He takes it quite casually, in the end. The part where he 'mistakes' the Bosses guy for him leads to some nice dialog. The same is true with the Rabbi complaining about hard it is to get decent people to work for you. In his business, sure. The Rabbi's men in the car also made me smile (does he never talk? no, why? you would have to ask him. would he answer? no) My only concern is- where in earth does that horrible apartment house with those alarming wallpapers exist? It is my sincere - but doubtlessly unfounded - hope that it was only built as a set and demolished afterwards. The same is true for the hair cut of Josh Hartnett- life is easier for me if I suppose it was a wig.",7,1,2,9 May 2007
Memento," Didn't get this one, sorry.
","I gave a five because I found the intertwining storyline to be original and appealing but not more. The interweaving lead namely in my case to a complete chaos and I must confess I did not get the plot in the end. Christopher Nolan is great (thinking of Prestige or Batman Begins, the best Batman picture so far), really, but I couldn't follow him on this one.I could have done without the story still, but the cast could also have been better. Carrie-Ann Moss can't act. She couldn't act in Matrix, and she still can not. Joe Pantoliano was uninteresting as Teddy and although Guy Pearce gave a strong performance, well, it wasn't enough to save the day for me.I recommend this movie for people who have either been acquainted with the short story somehow before in the first place, or for avid fans of someone having to do with the movie because I can't imagine that anyone impartial might fall for it.",5,4,8,3 May 2007
Alexander," Stupid but spectacular.
","Q.: What happens when you subtract all the sense from Gladiator and mix it with the dumb approach of Troy and flavor it with unlikely and unreal characters (note: these need to be based on real persons strictly)? (drums) A.: Well, obviously the movie Alexander! The three points out of ten go to the love to the detail and the good looks of the movie. Because you might argue, that Alexander has a silly, even ridiculous script, but it surely has been shot nicely.While the occasion could have been used to depict Alexander as a great tactic, as a great ruler, as a great leader, as an interesting character, as a great thinker, or as a great man, in the least, instead a picture of a shaky, confused and pitiable person is painted.He is tormented by his influential mother, enters difficult relationships, and is altogether in the need of a big hug.Although the approach taken is interesting, it does not work very well. (I would just like to add in brackets that I never understood why Alexander's performer had to be dyed blonde. Why Angelina Jolie has to go about the place with snakes. Why it is so important that Alexander could have been bisexual, I thought it was already common knowledge that such sexual orientation was quite usual in those days. I'll stop here.) If you haven't watched it already, watch only if you are an avid fan of Greek mythology/ history, and enjoy spectacular movies and fight scenes even without contents. I can assure you that it is possible.",3,1,1,25 June 2007
Troy," Mythology without the gods and powerful characters is worthless.
","Although everyone is obviously trying to do their best (I mean the additional crew of make-up artists, hair stylists musicians, stunts and doubles and the sort), and this is why I give 3 points at all, the main characters are uninteresting and the story is incomprehensible in itself.I miss the gods very much, who flavor the original. As they are the key interactors leading to the events occurring, this movie without them feels like Grimm's Hänsl and Gretl would feel without the witch. okay, the kids are having a stroll in the woods, and all of a sudden they end up in the oven by themselves, pray tell me why.The best parts of the epic are Odysseus, and the gods, especially Athene. Cut this to a minimum and you have an uninteresting love affair, some (although impressive) muscle show-off and (without the divine interaction totally) inconsistent events following one after another.If you think any II WW movie would make sense simply skipping the Germans, and you have never encountered the original of Homer, you are going to love Troy (after all, it has Brad Pitt, right).",3,3,7,2 May 2007
The Prestige," Confusingly told story of two disagreeable rivals.
","Although the story is great, and the end-twist, i.e, no magic at all, is fabulous, the Prestige gets lost in the confusing manner in which it is told (exactly just like Memento; I do not understand that the same director who after all those unsuccessful attempts gave the Batman series a worthy movie, gets lost for the second time in his own story-telling).The many flashbacks, different views, diaries and all, lead to a sort of loss of sense for which you either have to watch the movie all over to check whether you got it right and whether the director has made any mistakes, or you just settle with what you have grasped the first time- a somewhat messy account of - to tell you the truth- uninteresting events.The feud between the two magicians is, frankly speaking, quite flat. Both are so annoying and dislikable, that you can't help but think that it would be in the general interest of mankind if both would perish. I am usually not this cruel, bit I certainly could not identify or sympathize with either.The good things include the somewhat dark perspective (the part with David Bowie and his experiments really can get you some goose bumps if you are inclined to get some), and the end with all those clones dead is quite eerie as well. So the feeling had it going. The character of Scarlett Johansson had much unnecessary screening time.The Prestige is really entertaining, but I am generally opposed to films and plots that are supposed to have 'meaning' and something to say, but are nothing but an optical illusion themselves. This is clearly the case with the Prestige- one admirable and great idea (that of the no-tricks) is exploited to its uttermost, all marrow sucked out of its bones. The rest is illusion.",6,2,7,25 June 2007
Lost in Translation," Three points to the cast. The rest is silence.
","I enjoyed the work of Sofia Coppola in Part III of the Godfather Saga as Maria Corleone, I think she was great there as an actress. She did not strike me as a great director here. Lost in Translation, apart from indicating real tough issues we shall have to deal with, i.e., compatibility of cultures of so great varieties, and the question whether the main points do or do not get lost in translation (no kidding, that is a question), does not shine. The story is uninteresting (why do people go places they won't be able to enjoy? you are in a great huge unknown ancient city and feel unlucky, come on, just go home folks, please).The three points are for the perceivable efforts of the very good cast, especially Bill Murray and Giovanni Ribisi. Scarlett Johansson I believe to be a very good actress but in this movie she is portraying herself almost, that is a considerably lesser effort.Why on earth an Oscar....?",3,1,6,3 May 2007
American Pie," If you are not an American teenager, I suggest you do not watch this one.
","As I am not an American teenager myself, I failed to grasp the sense of the entire movie, I am afraid.Further, I feel somewhat uneasy that I have watched it at all.Hence I comment on this title: anyone over the age of 20, not American, who is not likely to laugh about bad language and noises coming from peoples' body cavities, skip this one as I should have done myself.Why is it, that since Grease nobody could come up with a somewhat intelligent take on high school students and their major issue (a.k.a get a girl/boyfriend quick before the party/end of semester).The characters are uninteresting and unreal, the story is simply dumb.There is only hype around this film because there is a tendency to cheer on vulgarity nowadays instead of admitting you simply feel insulted and think it misplaced and ridiculous.",1,19,46,25 June 2007
Being John Malkovich," Ridiculous attempt that failed.
","Being Malkovich is a very disappointing movie. You have trusted the seemingly good cast (and as you will have to admit to yourself, this was indeed a huge mistake). You have trusted the Academy (yet another time - you are not learning from your mistakes). No plot or originality be here, really. There are some ideas all in a row, like, for example, the offices in which you can only walk bent(could work out, really, in some futuristic drama, or in Alice in Wonderland the third Sequel, but it does not here), the doorway to another person's life (although much harder to believe, but it could still work out somewhere, some place, it does not here), from which passageway you are dumped to a ditch after 15 minutes besides a motorway (sounds quite appealing, right?). The ideas do not add up to anything worth watching. The creators are testing our intelligence. Let's show them we have one. Simply don't watch or in case you have, do not recommend this movie.",1,6,13,7 May 2007
The Machinist," Strong movie, not-that-strong storyline.
","While the performances (credits not only to Christian Bale, but to Jennifer Jason Leigh and Aitana Sánchez-Gijón), the cinematography and the atmosphere created are outstanding, the plot (especially the 'twist' at the end) seems to reverse around itself, and when in the end you come to think of it, there is is actually not much to reconsider.This is a pity, because there have been many interesting subplots that could have been developed. The post-its left by strangers (all indicating his own guilt in the end), the picture where he refuses to recognize himself, the epileptic boy (that was a shivery part), the arm cut and his own 'accident' - I tend to believe that this must have been different originally, but had to be cut from the end version, but who knows.I have to admit that because of the elaborate son-mother line I assumed for the largest part of the film that Reznik is going to have his mother (who I supposed to have died in the car accident caused by Reznik instead of the little boy) in the fridge, the fish took me rather by surprise.The ending with the car accident is good, yes, but somehow unsatisfactory, because unlike in Fight Club, e.g., where the final impression is that of 'how on earth did they come to this ending, I would never have thought of that, I'm stunned', the Machinist is a bit easier to predict, yet still an extremely strong and well-done film.Worth watching rather for atmosphere and great acting. You won't bite your nails but learn an important (if not belated) lesson about why to drive very carefully and how important a good night's sleep can become.",7,2,2,7 May 2007
Shrek the Third," It is Shrek the Third. It is great the third time too, but you have to consider that it is the third time.
","It is definitely not the most rewarding task to do a third part of a flourishing movie. The audience is already used to several of the jokes, the characters as such are not fun in themselves (as they undoubtedly were in the first - and, the newer ones, in the second - movie), so saying that Shrek the Third is much worse than its predecessors is just simply not fair.It is a little bit worse, though. The main problem I would say is that they operate with so many characters, that you do not have the chance to learn to like, hate, or be afraid of them, respectively.Doris is my favorite new character by far.The girl-pack (Rapunzel & Co.) are also okay, but again, nobody gets more than one or two minutes screening time- that is not enough to develop or show a character you can find cool. Also, the scene where King Harold dies (several times) - well, I am not easily offended, but that was a bit of a stretch.Apart from that, there is a lot of stuff to laugh on and enjoy, the story is a decent (but again, not well-elaborated) parody of the Harry Potter and King Arthur sagas, the part where Pinocchio is interrogated is a gem (did you catch before that the same guy is doing the voice for Pinocchio and the piggies?), and so is the escape of the ladies from their prison.Everybody you liked is here, including the Gingerbread Man, the Wolf, and of course the Donkey and Puss and the rest. the nanny dwarf is just sooo cool. The story is mainly centered around Shrek trying to get back to the beginning of Shrek No. 1 - with one addition, Fiona- and have his peace in his swamp. Meanwhile, he has to find a new king to replace him, get acquainted with the fact that he is to become a dad, and try to save Far Far Away from Prince Charming and those, who never had a happily ever after before. Quite a lot to do there! The animation and the technicalities of the background reminded me of fabulous old Walt Disney backgrounds, they were so well-done. if you compare the technique with that of part 1 - well, the development in such a short time is amazing. I think that it is unfair to go to a third part of a series and expect that the original characters for whom you have gone there have been completely reinvented so that you get the same thrill as you did the first time. The magic of newness is natural to fade.So - there is quite a decent amount of laughter you can get from Shrek the Third. Go see the movie and enjoy it as I did.",8,0,2,22 June 2007
The Illusionist," Fairy tale set in Vienna.
","I must agree with the comments indicating that the material covered in this movie would have been enough for a short story only and is - somewhat- insufficient for 110 minutes.The aforementioned mystic aura of some sort is the best part of the Illusionist. The performances are fine as well- Edward Norton is, as always, very good at what he is doing, and Paul Giamatti and Rufus Sewell are also okay.I am very sorry Liv Tyler could not do the part of Eisenheim's love interest in the end, as her fairy-like person would have added a lot more to the mystique of the film.You get to figure out the tricks of Eisenheim on the way along with Inspector Uhl. You do not get all of them explained. If you prefer explanations, go watch Prestige instead. The music did the plot well and underlined the magic greatly, although in a somewhat repetitive manner. The camera works so well you get your eyes glued to the screen - even if you won't probably bite your nails in excitement. The major problem is that while the Illusionist keeps you watching if you are a fan of myths & magic, it certainly does not hold a great plot twist. So no big surprises can be expected there. The ending is quite predictable. This is a pity because there is a lot of potential to the story, and there certainly would have been a lot more to the setting, and the characters, and the actors portraying them, if only it had been tapped.Crown Prince Leopold's character should have been exploited much more. I missed a real confrontation or row between him and Eisenheim; the one at the Prince's premises was not much of that. The death of the Crown Prince is viewed by the director in a totally detached way which surely tries to say that bad guys always die in the end, but hey, who took whose fianceé around here? Also- even the general basis of the story, i.e., that the girl and Eisenheim are childhood sweethearts, seems quite like a fairy tale itself- it is quite unlikely that a girl of her status would have been left alone on enough occasions to develop a relationship with a boy of his standing, and go unnoticed for an adequately long period of time.So - I recommend you watch the Illusionist for what it is -a somewhat romantic fairy tale set in Vienna, in the era of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, in the troubled and magic times of the great Eisenheim. And it is very good as THAT.",6,0,0,25 June 2007
Children of Men," Read or watch 1984 instead.
","Despite the wonderful cast, the story - apart from the basic idea, which has appealed to me so much that I eventually watched this picture- is a disappointment.Why are there no kids? Why then yet one to come? Why does Michael Caine as Palmer sacrifice himself instead of fleeing, it is sooooo pointless. Why is the old lady helping them flee interrogated, captured and killed? Why does Julianne Moore as Taylor kidnap Clive Owen as Faron in the first place, I should rather think there are far better and more forward strategies to get your former love of your life involved in your issues now, really.No explanations are given, which would be if not okay but acceptable, in case of a coherent story, unlike here. Apart from the few war scene intermezzi at the end where the pregnant girl is almost worshiped by the folks who continue shooting afterwards nevertheless (business has its own rules), I could not name any other capturing parts. The end of Faron at the seas is almost an insult to the viewer.I am quite sure that the novel must have been better and that this is an unlucky Hollywood version only, otherwise I can not imagine why after the so great 1984 has been written and made into a movie, and we have had Matrix and The Island and a bunch of others dealing with the end of the world as it may seem likely, anyone would have seen anything in this non-existing plot.",3,4,9,3 May 2007
Shrek 2," Being a good guy is tough.
","Shrek 2 is just perfect in its manner.The idyllic life of Shrek and Fiona (and their numerous friends) in the swamp ends with a dinner invitation to the parents of Fiona. Then many problems start to unfold. With an evil fairy godmother, a frog king (best part, I love King Harold, please note as my brother did when when you re-watch the movie that the royal bedroom is plastered with numerous adorable pictures of ponds, hint, hint), a Puss-in-Boots and a marvelous additional cast featuring the Muffinman (the Muffinman? the Muffinman!), fabulous (smaller and greater) Gingerbreadmen, Donkey and Co., Shrek 2 is first class entertainment for 93 minutes, which even has a lot to say and teach.",10,2,3,22 June 2007
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," 2 for the spectacular fights.
","I might be mixing KB 1 and 2 below, sorry for that, it all blends together. Being no fan of Tarantino (except for Jackie Brown, end of the list), I could not say that there has been anything that specifically great about Kill Bill. The fight scenes are spectacular. Period. This is a movie in my eyes that tries to say 'hey, in case you do not like or understand me, you are just not at an appropriate level of evolution yet, okay?'. It is bloody, and illogical. This is often true for Tarantino's movies, I think (I did not like Pulp Fiction either and could not get through it once).Many have stated this before, but pray tell me, in case you wake up on your hospital bed after years of coma, how on Earth are you meant to grasp the whole situation immediately. And in the first place, why did they wait patiently for Uma Thurman's character to wake up? Did they assume they could chat it over in the end and be good friends again? The genre works with Asians - all-round, real, not imported Asians I mean- as in Wo hu cang long, but is in my opinion a total miss here. The same is true for the Anime part, which I found ridiculous and overdone. Why bother that much with Lucy Liu's character anyway? I do not believe there was much originality in this movie. The Charlie's Angels up against each other thing might have worked but did not. I suggest Tarantino and manga fans watch. Martial arts fans pick something decent instead.",2,22,43,7 May 2007
National Treasure," 'Treasure' does not refer to the movie itself in any way.
","Kids deserve somewhat better, I think.The well-known cast still does not counterbalance the lack of a plot, especially, as they receive no chance to act. The characters are both undefined and unrealistic. I can't possibly imagine why Diane Kruger would be nominated for a best supporting role for the job she does here at the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films and why supporting, anyway? I thought she is the main guys love interest, and she has quite a decent amount of screen time. The good points are references to the Freemasons (this usually works, here even this is creaking), and the spectacular inside shots in the museum. Walt Disney can always be relied upon when it comes to good looks. Hidden chambers in the subway, involved parents and the Declaration of Independence with the lack of real action are just too much, especially without a link between them, but following upon each other. I think this movie might work after all, in case you watch it as a genre parody, and do not expect too much. Parents should explain to their children afterwards that these sort of films can also be done properly, this one is not to be considered as standard. And my personal question: if good guys use Google and bad guys use Yahoo, where would I qualify as user of MSN? Grey zone? I feel offended.",3,2,4,8 May 2007
Inside Man," Now here is a twist for a change!
","Amongst so many blunt attempts to produce when not a thriller right away but at least an action movie with an at least halfway interesting storyline, here is an original and exciting plot to enjoy.The basic idea of the mingling with the crowd is great in itself. Add a good cast (Clive Owen is a great choice), a typical setting of bluffed police officers, some shooting, and you have quite an excellent action picture in itself.The Jodie Foster and Denzel Washington thread is a bit too far fetched and too long (I would even say boring and forgettable), that is why I give an 8 instead of a 10 right away.",8,1,2,3 May 2007
Pulp Fiction," Couldn't make it through.
","I have not been able to get over more than 15 minutes of this movie despite several attempts due to the fact that everybody is always so keen on Pulp Fiction.I suppose the trick must lie somewhere after these 15 minutes, but it is rare to see such uninteresting characters (two otherwise so great actors, really) chat for such an incredibly long time without any sense in their dialog at all. I simply can't get beyond that initial quarter of an hour even with fast-forwarding. Why is everyone so frantic about this film? I felt I simply had to comment on this movie so as to somewhat spoil the (in my opinion undeservedly) excellent rating.",1,13,39,8 May 2007
The Da Vinci Code," Ron Howard didn't crack the Da Vinci Code.
","I have read the book before seeing the movie with family members who haven't. Thanks Heavens we watched it on DVD because after every 10 minutes we had to stop for me to explain what was going on.It seems that director Ron Howard and his script-writers have left out just about everything that would have added some depth or meaning to an otherwise not bad, but far-from-great novel.The cast is an enigma to me. Audrey Tatou in all of her roles is always herself, and I think few are extraordinarily fond of her (she is somewhat creepy) and Tom Hanks, otherwise good as he may be, here with a humiliating toupee or bob, whichever)is not fit for the role of an adventurous beau professor, either.Paul Bettany excels as Silas (okay, he is always great), he is outstanding in an otherwise extremely poor movie. Ian McKellen is miscast. Alfred Molina tries his best but the role he has has been twisted been emptied by the movie makers. Even Jean Reno has such a poor role that I completely forgot he had anything to do with the flick and just got reminded as I went through the cast.This all adds up to a movie where - as our private screen testing revealed- nobody gets anything who hasn't read the book, and the ones who have feel they have to apologize.The others didn't get that Silas is a victim of fanaticism and is betrayed. They saw a freak and serial killer in him.Nobody understood what the catholic Church was doing with Bishop Aringarosa.Nobody seriously believed that Audrey Tatou's character understands even part of what she is talking about (as it could not be understood by anyone who has not read the novel).The novel has something of the Umberto Eco's Name of the Rose- some thinking, some theories, some religious sacrileges, to give you a spooky and enjoyable medieval feeling. The movie completely fails to transfer this. Instead, the characters do an awful lot of talking- which is really annoying, as the characters portrayed by the badly picked actors are, other than in the book- and from their lengthy and cheesy dialogs is the complicated story to unfold. Well, it doesn't.If there is anything good to be credited to the novel of Dan Brown, it is the atmosphere and tension related to mysticism, fanaticism and religion in general, as well as the secretiveness of the sects involved that hook you and make you read the novel in one night. Nothing of that atmosphere was cast in the movie adaptation. Less talking (or even a dark, male narrator's voice) and a little more tension could have done most of the job. If there ever was a movie deserving a 1 out of 10, this surely does.",1,0,2,22 June 2007
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Entertaining, strangely.
","Having overcome the initial shock that two allegedly top-notch assassins are supposedly not aware of the job of the person they live with, despite the fact, that they met while both being on the run in South America and covered up for each other, the movie was quite enjoyable. I feel the more so, since the Trivia for this picture states that the original cast would have been Nicole Kidman and Johnny Depp. It seems quite impossible to come up with a more awkward couple. At least Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are a good match. The Smiths is nothing memorable, nothing special, but in its own way surprisingly entertaining (once). Still, if for some twisted reason you would want to see professional, exciting and intriguing (and also touching and intelligent) fights between members of a couple, watch Ying xiong's Broken Sword and Flying Snow instead.",3,1,5,9 May 2007
The Departed," Depart before this movie starts.
","Jack Nicholson is a real good villain, period.As for the story - it starts off as extremely intriguing, a brick here, a brick there, great acting, and still, in the end, which is blatant and potty, you feel there has been much ado about nothing.Everybody shooting everybody for various reasons is a possible finish-off, no doubt. But then why take the efforts to build up a fantastic background in the style of the best Mafia movies so far and then end in a shooting scene which is not original, not exciting, not interesting, not comprehensible, and does not follow logically from the plot.I think there could have been a lot more to this story but they have either ran out of time or money or patience or their common sense. It is regrettable, since the build-up of the characters is so extraordinarily good and it all goes down the drain at the end of the day.",3,10,16,3 May 2007
Downfall," Simply uninteresting.
","A throughout unrealistic movie, I did not even manage to get through to its end (watching it on DVD, I fast-forwarded the remaining few minutes).No, this is not a good story, this is not even a credible or likely story, it does not seem to have any realistic touch about it, which is quite a surprise in case of 'hystorical movies', as this one aspires to be.I could not name anything I liked about it.WW movies usually either have the looks and the ketchup (Saving Private Ryan), or the plot (Sunshine), or the characters (La Vita é Bella), or all of it (Schindler's List). Der Untergang has none of these. I believe that in case of such topics, a movie should be made in the event that it has to offer something: a new perspective or approach, new characters, anything at all. To me Der Untergang was a disappointment all together, surely awarded for the topic, and not the actual realization.",1,9,104,7 May 2007
The Good Shepherd," The 10 years the director spent elaborating this project definitely show.
","The Good Shepherd is, although considerably long, extremely intriguing. The atmosphere generated is of such fine quality that - unlike in most spy stories, you can immediately relate to the main character, Edward Wilson, wonderfully portrayed by Matt Damon, and continue with him on a strange journey at the end of which Wilson is hopelessly entangled in the net of the early CIA.What makes this spy story different from all other spy stories is that there are no spectacular action scenes, no bad guys and good guys, and, what is very rare in the cinema, the director does not transmit a ready-made opinion to the viewer on what he or she is supposed to think of each and every character. The viewer is thought to be capable to form an own concept. What a refreshing novelty! While most of the actors do fine, Matt Damon is brilliant.And I have never heard of Tammy Blanchard before, but she does some great acting here.The Good Shepherd sports some excellent music which is one of the reasons you are hooked on the film from the start. The first 15 minutes are more exciting than a dozen other spy thrillers put together (yes, the James Bonds included, yes, the newest one as well).One of the many reasons The Good Shepherd works so well is that throughout the story a sense of reality and everyday life is kept. Pictures of the main character's working hours are followed up by equally interesting family matters.The only thing that annoyed me was that the characters seemingly did not get any older, although a substantial amount of time passed as the story evolved.It is absolutely a shame that this movie did not get any Oscars.The Good Shepherd is not only an interesting account of the early days of the CIA, but the fascinating story of an unfortunate man who should never have trusted anybody but himself, and the consequences of when he did.",10,2,4,9 July 2007
Shrek," Ogres are fun!
","The story of grumpy, unsocial and feared ogre Shrek, who develops a crush on a princess with a little secret.Besides being extraordinary fun, full with great characters, the story apparently also has something to say about grumpy people (pardon me, ogres) are often good-hearted in the inside, princesses are not always what they seam, and the looks are not the thing that matter.I have had the 'Welcome to Duloc' song in my head for several weeks after having first watched Shrek 1.Not only is Duloc a perfect town, but Shrek 1 is a simply perfect animation movie. Once in a while it happens that truly deserving movies win Oscars. This has just been the case right here.",10,0,1,22 June 2007
300," Please read the cartoon first!
","I watched 300 in a row after the 'original' that inspired Frank Miller and reading the cartoon at the same evening. I can only recommend this to anyone approaching this movie without being a special fan of Frank Miller's works. In the follow-up, 300 - apart from undoubtedly being simply fascinating from a technical point of view- was also outstandingly enjoyable as a great cartoon adaptation.The heading I gave this comment is due to the fact that in case you do not read the comic beforehand, I do not believe that much of the story and the atmosphere is going to be understandable or likable.My only objection is that Lena Headey is so lame as sole female character that it hurts, really. The scene where she performs her speech before the elders, the speech that is meant to come from a queen, a wife and mother worried to death is so unconvincing that I considered the speed button.(Her role could be disputed as well, but the role is not the problem.) Otherwise, the cast is brilliant. I especially liked that this movie did not try to sell itself with big names but took advantage of real good actors instead.This movie keeps you excited and holding your breath all along which I think shows its values best considering the fact that the ending is really no surprise to anybody at all.",10,3,8,17 April 2007
Fantastic Four," A movie where all went wrong.
","Despite the part of the cast that is doubtlessly performing in an outstanding manner (that is, Michael Chiklis as Ben - my childhood favorite- and Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom), the whole movie has gone all wrong.Not even the great visual effects can make up for the tangled and stupefied plot. The fight scenes are quite spectacular (although the one on the bridge is pretty low) and the make-up artists have done very well. While Jessica Alba I consider good, and I have already reviewed the acting of Michael Chiklis, the other two of the four are profoundly miscast. Ioan Gruffudd is totally uninteresting (he is supposed to be the lead main brainy and clever superhero, remember) and Chris Evans is also lost in his role which I would not have considered to be as tough as to get anybody lost in it at all (an easy-going careless torch-man)How can you mess up a very simple first-of-a-franchise movie about the supposedly touching background story of supposedly nice and evil, respectively, supposedly interesting action heroes? This is a riddle to me. I hope the second part will do better. There is so much more to these characters than what has been shown here.",3,0,1,3 May 2007
Sin City," Never seen something this pointless and unproductive
","I don't personally mind a bit of Hollywood-ketchup dripping and heads or hands hacked off (there they go) here and there in case it is reasonable, or else, appropriate or necessary for the story, really, however very strongly supposing that there IS a story.I suggest you only go for this masterpiece in case you have nothing better to do, better things in this event including several punches in your face, a car accident and an annoyed rattlesnake locked in with you in an unlit elevator that's just got stuck.For instance, there is no plot whatsoever unless you consider the fact that everyone gets either wholly or partially eaten up by others or totally or partially killed by the end of the movie, a story.Characters just wander up and about the place, and if you fear, blood is all over well, as for one thing, you won't see it from the slime sprinkling all around and covering it. As said before, the sprinkling does not lead anywhere. It is a joyful per se sprinkling we have to deal with.All the blood and lousy horror-effects available have been carefully collected to add up to a pointless and unintelligent massacre, in the end of which the only feeling you will have when leaving the cinema is that of a strong disappointment in both the directors (whom we have thought and seen to be capable of doing better) and yourself for having been brainless enough to sign up for such a waste of time and money, in the present case, your time, and your money.Don't be fooled by the brilliant cast! Even they can't compensate you for the total lack of sense in this story.",1,8,18,13 July 2006
Gladiator," A stunning duel staged against the decaying Roman Empire.
","One comment insists that Gladiator would be something for Fight Club fans. I do not get the idea, but I have to admit that I indeed enjoyed both films very much.That much said, be prepared for beautifully shot scenes, spectacular fights, some interesting characters (there could have been a little enhancement in this respect, but nevertheless, the characters are strong and sound).Kudos to Joaquin Phoenix in the first place. He performs a haunted, tormented and cruel emperor you can still sometimes glimpse the human and pitiable side of, and is altogether very creepy and goes under your skin. Yes, he definitely should have gotten the Oscar. He is the only member of the cast I can not imagine to be replaceable. His interpretation of Commodus adds depth to Gladiator as otherwise it might have been just the usual the very, very, very good guy battles the bad, stupid, really bad one against all odds. Russell Crowe is a fine Maximus. He engages in some spectacular fights in and out of the arena while showing off genuine feelings and wits. The opening battle is in its genre perfect in my belief. The much disputed scenes where he is floating over the fields are a bit kitschy, a bit cheesy, but still, nice thought, and do not work that bad with the excellent music. Oliver Reed and Richard Harris are both rendering great performances and contribute mainly to the authenticity (not meant in a historical sense) of the story. Why is it a problem for so many that in the end Maximus fights and kills the Emperor in the arena in a duel that never ever took or would have taken place in reality? Do not expect historical correctness or accuracy, this is not a documentary to be broadcast on National Geographic or the History Channel. Enjoy Gladiator for for what it is, an action-drama-epic imaginary saga set in powerful cruel ancient Rome already overshadowed by its unavoidable fall from greatness.",9,0,0,9 May 2007
V for Vendetta," V for Vendetta is good, while it should have been great.
","V for Vendetta - despite the obviously good basic story, for which and for the great performances I give 7 points- is somehow not well done. I do not wonder Alan Moore, the creator of V refused any association with this adaptation.Thus in the following I shall try to only criticize the movie as it was made, and leave the comic as such alone.Hugo Weaving is a fine actor and it is a very unrewarding task to accept a role of a man in a mask because it could- technically - be just anybody else. The same was true for Edward Norton when he did the part of King Baldwin in Kingdom of Heaven. It is rare that a man in a mask can be remembered for additional features such as singing as Gerard Butler in the Phantom of the Opera. So all together, very brave of Hugo Weaving, and I am sorry we did not get to see any of him.The genre is unclear and undefined. It is not a drama as Children of Men, as V chooses death over a life with Evey, who loves her. It is not a profound criticism of our civilization as such- well, maybe it is for the English, anyway-, as 1984. It is not an action-flick in the sense of Matrix - the parts meant to be action are rare and understated. The story (interpreted by the Wachowsky Brothers) is not as fascinating as that of the Island, for example. It tries to get the best of all these and ends up using the worst clichés of all. At some points, the story-telling obviously stumbles.There is the end scene, where all dead (who made their very own sacrifice and should be honored and left alone) are standing within the amazed crowd again. I really tried to see this as some sort of statement relating to the disturbing and stupid monologue Evey has to deliver at the end on the topic 'V was all of us'. My attempt failed and it still looked stupid.And why does no one (the parents of Evey, Deitrich, the girl whose story Evey reads while she is in prison) ever try to flee in this movie? Evereybody is sitting and having a cup of tea, waiting for the guys with the black bags to arrive.Why is V so kind with the lady he kills, who is obviously one of the key figures that lead to his deformation and torture? Obviously we are supposed to understand that he is a gentleman. Why does V tell the police officer that he has been waiting for him all these years??? What does that police officer do, anyway? And the ultimate goof where I really had to laugh out loud- the slowing-down and Matrix-like falling of the raindrops when Evey is freed from prison, as well as the slow motion burning of the fire from where V had to escape, put together- we would have seen the parallel anyway, thank you, those 10 minutes or so would not have been necessary. Ant the fact that Evey even uttered 'God is in the rain' - a touching sentence which has been read by her just 10 sec. ago so everybody still remembered it- is an insult and seriously damages this climax of the plot.Further, I have to mention that I can not imagine where on earth Evey found those roses in the underground to put on the deathbed of V. Maybe I just missed something.Higlights are the Benny Hill-tribute of Stephen Fry's character, V's monologues and fencing, and Natalie Portman.V for Vendetta as a movie is good, but it is the subject matter that is great. There go the credits.",7,0,3,22 June 2007
