Captain Phillips," Gripping
","'Captain Phillips' is a compelling and remarkable movie making from the opening frame to the very last. The movie is a gripping, dramatic and harrowing true life story about modern-day piracy and understated heroism on the high seas. The drama keeps you literally on the edge of your seat.Tom Hanks gives one of the best performances of his entire career and deserves an Oscar for his role in this. He was the perfect choice to bring the emotion needed to carry this traumatic experience to life and make you totally believe. The whole cast were phenomenal, the pirates were perfectly cast and delivered impeccable, intense performances The action scenes won't be beaten this year. My only criticism was the annoying shaky cam in the early scenes. Overall, this is the most impressive and well-executed movies of 2013. Awesome!",10,1,3,18 November 2013
Gravity," Tense
","I now am reassured that I NEVER want to go to space. Contains dizzying vertigo, tension, a lot of suspense and admirable performances. 'Gravity' is a powerful movie of two astronauts marooned in space when an accident destroys their shuttle. This movie is a technical and visual feast for the eyes. Clooney's performance is slightly bland but Sandra Bullock is great in this and gives a knock-out performance, a solid pick for an Academy Award. 'Gravity' lacks a little in dialog, there are some corny lines and there are several glaring scientific errors, but it's still neat, overall entertaining and hard not to enjoy. Go see it.",8,1,3,20 November 2013
Ted," Juvenile movie, but not for kids!
","You'll either love or hate 'Ted' depending on if you appreciate Seth McFarlanes humor. If yes, a no brainer, but this movies not for kids! Watching a good bear gone bad talk filth for an hour is so offensive that it pushes boundaries but what the heck, I was hooked from the beginning because I was too busy laughing my head off at the corny jokes to care. Mark Wahlberg does a great job alongside on screen girlfriend Mila Kunis. If you like 'Family Guy' you'll surely love this. Sure, it has it's flaws, a bit dumb and hit-and-miss in places, but for the most part pretty funny and worth checking out for the humor factor alone.",7,0,2,26 November 2013
We're the Millers," Enjoyable goofy road movie
","This is a lighthearted and funny road-trip movie with a fair share of laughs, likable characters and strong comic performances. Its almost an unique growth story of a man that has grown tired of his miserable life and finds something worth fighting for. You know where the plot's going, but it's still fun getting there. The interaction between the four main leads is great. It's a little too raunchy to be a movie for all the family and there are a few gross-out moments and some of it is clich√©d, but it does go beyond your average comedy. Jennifer Aniston gives a great performance, but casting her as a stripper is a bit unconvincing, but anyway let's face it, she's hot!",8,0,1,7 November 2013
