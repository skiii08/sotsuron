Scarface," the power of artistic passion and freedom
","If you look for flaws in this movie, you will certainly find them, like in any movie. The thing is, you just don't care with this kind of artistic expression. It's like Jimi Hendrix - he more than often missed a note or two or played with a off-tuned guitar, but when something so powerful and original hits you, you're just dazzled and left speechless in amazement.In Scarface, you get a triple treat: Al Pacino in 101% form, Brian de Palma with some incredible directing and the utter original, real and razor-sharp screenplay of Oliver Stone. Method acting by Pacino works here like a firecracker - it broke any kind of consciousness in me that I was after-all watching an illusion, it took me from my seat and inserted me mentally in the action. That end scene is something else...'You f**** with me, you're f****** with da best'.In a top ten of memorable quotes packed movies, this one will definitely be in the first 5. 'I kill communists for fun'. How much complexity in a simple line - it is drama,humor,mindless lack of morality, and the list can go on. Also, the characters are almost iconic: the corrupt cop, the Columbian drug-lord, the junkie wife, the lost sister...all characters are developed with great insight and realism.The casting is also incredible, even Mary E. M., which I usually find annoying. F.Murray A. has a small role, but effective and Steven Bauer does exactly what his character is supposed to be doing. It is pointless to say that the movie would have been less without Pacino, who shines like the sun in this one. His performance could be placed alongside any major work of art and belong there 100%.'In this country, you gotta make the money first. Then when you make the money, you get the power. Then when you get the power, then you get the women'. The American Dream. Explains it better than any history book.'The world is yours.' Careful what you wish for.",10,2,5,28 April 2006
Inglourious Basterds," When you lose your heart and soul as an artist....
","...you get something like this.Playing with artistic concepts and instruments as artifices in order to communicate something is one thing,but when you either have no idea what you want to say or your idea is something so personal and incomprehensible that maybe it's best to bury it in you rather than produce something for others to see,then what you end up with are those artifices only,without any kind of substance.Now,I'm not sure if Tarantino is either clueless(or somewhat of a nihilist) or that he really has an absurd agenda,but either way,his latest movies are pointless.I gave Kill Bill 1 5/10 because I at least acknowledged the technical side,but in this case,even the technical pluses are drowned in a sea of absurdity.If Tarantino thinks that he can rely 100% on reinterpreting movie clichés in a movie, without any regard for reality and common sense,then he's mistaken.It may work for the Zucker brothers or Jim Abrahams,but this one is no feel-good comedy,but rather a fictional continuous gore-fest and surrealist crap.If people are buying this one,it says something really disturbing about them.About how people are entertained these days.Tarantino may have largely avoided the 'Hollywood way',but he slipped into something very idiotic.So,1 point for the technical part and for entertainment, and 2 points for Waltz (Landa) and the whole multi-lingual thing(impressive).The rest is pointless.Really garbage.",3,19,35,24 January 2010
The Notebook," interesting, touching and ...crappy
","Mixed feelings about this one. Saw it on HBO,cuz I would never pay a cinema ticket for a movie with R.McAdams again after Red Eye.The dialog had its moments and the filming was pretty nice.Story was somewhat corny, but it was suppose to be primarily romantic, so it didn't bother me much.Where the movie really kinda falls apart is that it almost never puts emphasis on the complexity of the human emotions.It is almost like the director was going: 'Ok,ok,this is where the audience feels romantic and identifies with everything,let's not complicate things any further and stick to that.Too bad, because the movie might have had potential.For ex., there is a scene where Noah and Mrs 'Born with a silver spoon in my mouth' have a final argument and discussion outside the parents house.I liked the dialog and the acting, only the whole thing stops where it was getting interesting.Some more 'I hate you'-s,'Go to hell' and some more hysteria would have been more realistic and maybe some long shots insisting on the characters emotions would have created a more complete picture. The same pattern of 'stop here,it will get hazy and confuse the audience' is followed throughout the movie, culminating with a final scene between Allie and Lon where he is behaving with the utmost nobility and selfishness and the scene ends....right there.My point is, the characters are...well...incomplete and to some extent unrealistic and one-sided. Too bad, because the subject was treated decently otherwise and had some interesting issues.It deserved a 5 or 6 from me actually, but R.McAdams, as always, manages to wake the subjective beast in me.Will somebody stop casting this woman, please !!!!!!",4,2,2,10 April 2006
Alexander," Oliver Stone is surprising,as always
","I am a very big fan of Oliver Stone. One of the things I like about him is that he always surprises me,no matter how 'predictable' he may seem. Here are my comments: 1. I didn't read any comments here on IMDb that said this is not a typical 100% historical movie.I am surprised,because a lot has been said about this movie. Some of Alexander's and Ptolemy's monologues and some ideas that come from this movie have references on very actual issues: East meets West,tolerance to other cultures (mainly Eastern culture).Stone risks a lot here by trying to add this kind of ideas to an already very complex subject.He may have overdone it a bit,but it would be nice to imagine Alexander having Gandhi or Martin Luther King type of ideas.Of course,it is extremely hard to imagine a ruthless military leader preaching racial and cultural tolerance to his battle-hardened generals,but hey, Napoleon is also an example that such peculiar personalities do exist.So, it seems plausible,and historical facts do support this theory about Alexander. 2. About casting: I think Colin Farell was a good choice.A lot have said that he was too today-looking and lacked the greatness of Alexander.But who really knows what Alexander was like? Stone and Farell delivered a perfectly believable character. Kilmer and Jolie were excellent, and also the others were good choices, as far as I am concerned. 3. About the bisexuality theme: no comments here, except that maybe Americans should try to be a little less puritan (it is the 21-st century,grow up!) 4.Screenplay and story were excellent.Very original and very dramatic.The subject was extremely demanding and Stone did a very good job. 5. I think it is a shame that the movie was so criticized. Very underrated movie. 6.Allthough overall Vangelis' music was OK, I do think that he could have done a better job. The battle scenes music (esp.the one at Gaugamela) is a bit too common. 7.The Oscars and the Golden Globes have proved, one more time, that they are sometimes blind. This movie definitely deserved more recognition. The comparison with 'Gladiator is mostly incorrect. Ridley Scott is very different from Oliver Stone. Of course, you can make some comparisons (afterall, it is about antiquity, emotions, heroics, love and so on). I thought Gladiator was a great movie, and so is Alexander. But Alexander was about a very known figure and it set itself a higher target. And Gladiator does have a big flaw in the story, which is Commodus in the arena (that was uninspired, Mr. Scott), just like another excellent Scott film, Black Hawk Dawn, with those last dialogs btw soldiers (cheesy!). But that's just the point. Stone, in most of his movies, is unable (I think he does that on purpose) to deliver a final punch. So, for those viewers that want an ending, no matter how absurd, Scott makes it better (but loses its artistic value in the process). So 2 great directors, but different, Stone takes more risks and usually has a very personal agenda. My rating is 9/10, because of 2 minuses: didn't really enjoy Vangelis and those Hopkins monologues were a bit forced. Overall, wonderful.",9,11,23,17 January 2005
Cast Away," impressive and touching
","I don't feel there is any need to describe this movie too much or to emphasize its meanings, since anybody who has read or seen the story of Robinson Crusoe has a pretty good idea of what this movie is about. I'll just focus on the differences here and on some things that I found charming and some not so charming: 1. I don't know if it was done intentionally, but Hanks' character is a typical workaholic of our day and age, a yuppie and someone totally dependent on consumerism. So I found myself feeling a slight satisfaction when he was cast away. I was kinda going: 'Let's see what you do now, Mr. Career-Driven Corporate Employee CEO of Fedex Wannabe'. I am sure the makers of this movie had no intention of creating such a blunt statement to the extent I am suggesting, but I felt it that way.The question here is: What do you do if you have nothing except yourself? When you're not Mr.X, with a social status and every bit of your outer world disappears and you are left with nothing but yourself? Now the 'solution' of our hero, going through pain, anguish and suicidal thoughts is to hold on to his past. Here is the major difference to Robinson Crusoe. Robinson finally adapts. Our hero never really does, even though he does manage to create some kind of inner balance not without the help of one of the most beautiful characters in movie history: the volleyball Wilson. Their relationship is extremely touching.2. The emotions of the character are strong and presented eloquently and in an elegant manner to the viewer. You really feel with the character. The only flaw of the movie, in my opinion, is that it's just a bit too picturesque. Sure, some gritty realism - like the pulling the tooth out scene,but sometimes too picturesque. Fortunately the incredible versatility and excellent casting of Tom Hanks covers most of that and really touches you.3. As for the coming back sequence and the ending...very very nice. Lots of great acting and storytelling here and the conclusion is definitely appropriate and consistent with the character development. Great final frame with the crossroads. Only one observation (in the sense of 'What would I do in the same situation?'): I would have definitely have opened up the package and adapt like Robinson C. (at least I feel so). The fact that our hero never manages to really adapt is a statement of our fragility as a social animal.The fact that he needed that unopened package to be finally delivered as a way to keep his sanity all those secluded years is a sad reminder that it is extremely hard to be really free from your outer world. Robinson Crusoe was written centuries ago, in the classical/pre-romantic period of literature, in a time when, it seems, there was a lot more confidence in the ability of man to live at peace with himself. I am not sure whether I am more like this Fedex guy or Robinson, but I would definitely prefer Robinson.Anyway, Bravo! Tom Hanks and let's hope Zemeckis will make THIS kind of movies as opposed to his usual obnoxious content-free block-busters.",9,1,2,19 April 2006
Pearl Harbor," A perfect example of brainwashing
","OK, so let's sum up this movie: the 2 male characters are handsome, funny, heroic, generous, have no flaws, bla bla bla. Their fellow soldiers are not so handsome (how convenient) but are full of all sorts of qualities bla bla bla.The girl looks and acts like Mary Poppins and her friends are sexy, funny, bla bla bla. Pearl Harbour looks like Disney Land or the Blue Lagoon. Battle scenes are OK,but why not throw the John Doe character (Gooding) who's a cook but shoots down Japanese planes like Rambo.American flag metaphorically sinking in the water.The President is heroic and stands up from the wheelchair in a Scarlet O'Hara fashion and swears never to be hungry again, or to crush down the Japanese, or whatever. The British air squadron commander is so impressed with Affleck's character and delivers one of the cheesiest and stupidest line in movie history: 'God save the German Army if there are more like you where you came from', or something like that. People,stop wandering why people generally and Americans in particular are so ignorant about the world, history or whatever if they are given such artistic examples. It is not the lack of realism that I mind so much (afterall it is a movie) it is the pretense of realism that it is annoying. Too bad about the actors. Baldwin and Voight should have skipped this one. Mr. Bay, stop misguiding people, please.I am not saying that was not reasonably historically accurate, it is the WAY that it is presented that is wrong. Hollywood can sometimes be extremely annoying and this is one of the best examples.",1,13,24,5 January 2005
The Dirty Dozen," Ahead of its time
","Politically incorrect,violent,wonderfully acted,depressing yet exciting,no cheap heroics,no patriotic crap.One of the most inspired movies of all time.OK,movie was made in 1967,right?So,what do we have:criminals,prostitutes,violence,women civilians killed (stabbed and burnt alive),graphic violence,racism,religious fanaticism,lunacy,retards and war,action and comedy. It's delightfully paced and exciting,esp. due to some wonderful actors and their performances(no reason to go into that,just watch the movie).The chemistry between the actors is fantastic. One of my favorite movies ,I just watched it for the maybe 50-th time last night (first time I watched it I was 12 years old) and still hasn't lost its magic to me one bit.",10,1,4,8 August 2008
Saving Private Ryan," Painful to see talent go in the wrong direction
","I'm a WW2 and war movies fan.I thought I made that clear from the start.I gave 'The Dirty Dozen' and 'Platoon' 10 points,and I'm not a particularly indulgent reviewer.So,even though it was directed by Spielberg,which I don't like as a director,I had high hopes for it,simply because I saw the beginning Normandy landing scene in a preview and I was amazed by its force and grandeur.Also the actors were terrific,Hanks,Sizemore,Pepper...But goddamn you Spielberg,you really know how to put poop sauce in our spaghetti,don't you? American flag...American flag...old tear-eyed guy reminiscing...comforting family...American flag...a tombstone...American flag...I GET IT, Spielberg,give me a break....then,nice war scenes in Northern France...and the poop sauce really starts to hit the spaghetti...absolutely unrecognizable German Wehrmacht...now I won't rant about historical inaccuracies and plot absurdities ('though there are plenty),but most of those guys looked like zombies,not German soldiers. One thing is certain: Spielberg has no idea about war, not really.He's talented enough to draw it for us,but shallow enough to be clueless about what it is about.So, yes, I watched the Normandy landing scene and the end battle scene 3 times...guilty pleasure I guess...and I fast-forwarded all else...including the very end,which was as melodramatic and pretentious and naive as almost the whole picture.So,4 points for the effort,the actors,the battles...(the spaghetti). The rest was,as I mentioned, poop sauce.",4,7,15,27 February 2010
The Pianist," Outstanding in so many ways
","I was mesmerized by this movie,Polanski and Brody were a dream team.Everything fits into place,and this is one Holocaust movie that doesn't point any accusing fingers and doesn't turn into a memorial.It is visually stunning, with a breathtaking performance by Brody in the foreground,history in the background and Chopin masterfully interwoven in between. Polanski and Brody made everything seem so intimate, crystal clear, simple yet gut-wrenchingly emotional and I have rarely seen a movie so well-paced.It just flows naturally, like a beautiful piece of music. Polanski is in a class of his own and this is his crown achievement. As for Adrien Brody,absolutely fantastic,one of most moving performances of all time.",10,0,0,25 September 2008
Dog Day Afternoon," A straight-forward and blunt view of a complicated and absurd world
","Sidney Lumet is a wizard.When you start watching this movie,you are almost put to sleep within the first 10 minutes.Then, starting with Pacino's sudden erratic behavior,you are violently shaken back to life,then taken on a roller-coaster emotional ride and by the end,you are scarred for life.But there is one condition: you need to accept and agree that the world is gray,crazy and absurd.Otherwise,the movie almost makes no sense.One reason for that is that the Pacino character and the screenplay are extreme beyond belief.BUT (and I find this genius),it is presented to us in a human,clear,methodical way,like it's the most normal thing in the world.It's Kafka without the philosophy and symbolism,replaced by human drama and social issues. Everything about this movie is impressive and Al Pacino above anything else.The characters are marvelous,so identifiable and yet so over-the-top.The movie also succeeds in making collective characters (the public,the police,the press) so vivid and together with the individual characters, are perfectly coordinated in a crazy dance right before our eyes. Too bad about the Oscar competition with One Flew Over The Coockoo's Nest that year,where it lost to almost every category in favor of Milos Forman's masterpiece, because it definitely deserved more hype than it got.But it is a cult classic nevertheless,I've rarely seen people talking so passionately about a movie than about this one, and it's interesting to note that it appeals to almost all ages (except under 18, maybe). On a last note,I find that Lumet's work is so underrated.His movies are just as impressive as Scorsese's or Kubrick's,and yet he is one of the least hailed.",10,0,0,1 October 2008
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Quentin doesn't know when to stop
","QT should know, since he is a very original artist, that artists should reinvent themselves constantly. Especially when you have an in-your-face, parody/farce-like type of production style. RD, PF and JB were 3 movies where QT introduced himself to the world in style, with a lot of original stuff and contribution to cinema. Very good sense of humor, creative ... everything and tons of originality.However, I think that HE MADE HIS POINT with those three movies. The biggest problem with Kill Bill is that it is UNNECESSARY. Just some polishing and focusing of the QT style, but only that. There is virtually nothing really new in these two movies, and what is worse, QT chooses to emphasize what he PREFFERS from his CALEIDOSCOPE of creation, and he chooses kung-fu, no plot, violence, special effects and pointless chaos. These elements, combined with good story, complex acting and witty and original dialog, to name a few of the things I like about QT work, are complementary, but in Kill Bill, they stand alone and dry out in the film.I will give this movie 4 points for beautiful visuals, some nice dialog and some good directing now and then, and generally for QT, which I like a lot as an artist and an innovator, but, man, stop your eclectic, self-indulgent 'thing' and move forward instead of backward.",5,1,2,11 September 2006
Black Hawk Down," War Porn
","Being a fan of war movies and history, I remember watching this one when it came out and be impressed by the production,but feeling guilty about watching and liking it (because the of the biased script and the direction of the movie).The reason I'm commenting NOW is because I noticed, to my surprise, that this movie is used as a reference for a very good and accurate war movie and I want to make some points clear: 1.Where a movie like Platoon was accused of cramming in too many scattered historical events into one story, BHD manages to take one much more simple, recent and better documented event and be incredibly selective and subjectively focused in its depiction. Hence - war porn,we see the actual act in vivid detail,but are treated like retards regarding the why and the how. Nobody is interested in an elaborate script of a porn movie because it is assumed (and rightfully so)that nobody gives a toss.However this is war and history,not a sexual act.And the effect is the same, we get turned on.And whoever doesn't feel guilty about being turned on merely by human slaughter and misery should really start thinking about it. Aren't we supposed to learn something from movies and books instead of just be entertained? 2.I read that Ridley Scott said that he wasn't interested in politics at all when doing the movie.That may be convenient but it's an absurdity,at its best. Surely he must have realized that it would turn into a recruiting tool for the military, just like Top Gun (incidentally directed by his brother). He also must have realized that by not telling the whole story (trying, I mean) he distorts reality to a point where it doesn't become entertaining anymore, it becomes insulting.3. The funniest and scariest part (just like in Top Gun) is that this is a story about elite forces, people that do this for a living, and yet SO many people identified with the characters. Most men couldn't even hold and shoot a Minimi light machine gun without probably killing their own mates in battle, due to stress and confusion. The friendly fire rate in Iraq and Afghanistan is nearing 40%, that says a lot about even the real training of ordinary troops and yet people in movie theaters eating popcorn or watching the DVD at home on a comfortable couch confuse reality with Call of Duty (VG)...if that doesn't scare the heck out of you, it should.In conclusion, I would have liked to give a top mark to this one, because the production is really spectacular and it's a guilty pleasure, but thinking about it, it doesn't even deserve a 4/10 because of its sheer irresponsibility.",4,8,16,16 April 2011
The Graduate," I have one word for you : PLASTICS
","What a ride....This is a perfect example of what art can generate if one puts soul and wit into it. Firstly, I find human emotions and life issues depicted in a bitter-comic manner to be a charming combination.Love,sex,insecurity,family relationships,shyness,deception are treated with great humor and witty dialog in this movie.Long and elaborated shots,incredible story-telling creativity (like 1-st person camera views,long still frames,distance frames),video-clip like sequences (beautifully sustained by Simon and Garfunkel's heart-warming poetry and sad irony).There is enough creative film work in The Graduate to suffice for 10 movies.The dialog is excellent and the acting pure genius.And, oh...the time frame...the sixties...don't get me started.The 2000's are like an insurance seminar compared to that... No need to praise this movie anymore, it speaks for itself.It is not,however,a movie for the masses.This is no Ben-Hur type of flick,with spectacular imagery and epic storyline.It is an epic of the inner soul.It requires a bit of meditation, it is only entertaining if you get in touch with your inner self and not expect to watch the screen and BE entertained. Despite its comic appearance,I always felt that it touched a sensitive somehow sad chord in me.It's kinda like:'Haha very funny, but I felt those type of emotions and they didn't seem funny then.'It's also so easy to laugh at other people's feelings,torments and emotions, but when you realize that you are also part of that old human comedy and drama, your laughing becomes more restrained.More mature.I always connected with this movie, and with Mike Nichols.Too bad they don't make'em like this anymore.We live in an era where people like John Woo and Michael Bay are starting to dictate what we will be watching more and more.What a shame....",10,177,211,7 April 2006
Taken," My consideration for French filmmakers just dropped
","French director, and French writer (Luc Besson)...and this ???? Take it as an adrenaline action-packed movie and it's great. But the background story is offensive to say the least. Whatever happened to that famous French/European subtlety ? This movie manages to vilify Albanians,Arabs and French and make heroes out of CIA operatives and the US in a way I thought only Rambo could. They probably wanted a action movie with a background moral message, and they succeeded and while doing so, managed to make a caricature out of a very complicated issue (prostitution trafficking in Europe). On top of that, to vilify Arabs from an American point of view NOW, when the US has 2 dubious wars in 2 Arab countries ? I gave 5 points for the childish enjoyment of seeing a good action revenge movie, and took 5 points for a shameless use of serious issues. Hollywood, please grow up.",5,3,7,8 October 2010
Avatar," A new film genre: Politically Correct Preeching SciFi Fairy Tale
","Confused already? No? Well apparently millions of people weren't either,when they declared this to be one of the best movies they've seen in their lives,and then presumably bought a second and third and fourth cinema ticket to see this.I am not one of those people.I was confused.And amused.And pardon me for saying this,but I had to wake up the latent retard in me to be able to enjoy riding flying dragons,some unidentified horse-like hippo,a Jurassic something and a whole world apparently perfect. Well,that bothers me.Nothing is perfect.Even when you're high,you know that you're going to have a hang-over.Those Navi's were so perfect that it made me suspicious.The movie doesn't show this,but i bet they were into something really nasty,like attacking other tribes and raping all the women.And I bet they had their way with those flying dragons.Yes,I'm talking zoophilia with a dragon.Nevermind connecting neuron pony tales,how about connecting some penis and dragon pussy.Disgusted already? Now you know how I felt when watching Avatar.Oh yes,the CGI was ground-breaking.Let's hope next time Cameron just employs hundreds of Indian and Chinese computer programmers to give us Avatar 2, no actors,no common sense,no plot,just a diluted message and just computer generated Navis being perfect in their perfect world.",3,14,21,3 February 2010
The Last Samurai," A cheap plastic chair and a Coke on a table in a Japanese garden
","The plastic chair is...Tom Cruise. Maverick in a historical, character development-driven movie...bad casting to say the least. And the table with the Coke is the exaggerated action and the bad taste simplicity of the storytelling and dialog. And the rip-off...pleeeaasseeee. What exactly was original in this movie? What was the documentation of this movie: multiple viewings of Dancing with Wolves and Shogun? With all its shortcomings, the movie might have worked to some extent, but as soon as it got a little off the ground, little Tommy stepped in and ruined it. It was not necessarily his mediocre acting (here it was mediocre, usually it's BAD) but the fact that he was inappropriate for the part. Mr 'Risky Business' (as in 'Risky to cast him in serious roles') doesn't look like a broken down disillusioned vet. 3 points are for some nice filming and landscapes, nice topic and good supporting cast (especially the Japanese actor playing the samurai boss). The rest is cheap, predictable and melodramatic (in a bad sense).",4,5,9,1 June 2006
National Treasure," brainwashing+moneymaker+stupid
","I am not one of those snobby critics that automatically badmouth all things commercial. I think naiveté and simplicity can be entertaining sometimes. But National Treasure managed to wake up the subjectivity and snobbery in me, because it is THAT bad.1. The Freemasons and the Templars are presented as some kind of saviors of history, some mysterious philanthropists. In fact, they presumably were/are responsible for some of the most terrible crimes in history, right there with Stalin and Hitler. The crusades were unjustified attacks on the East, just like Vietnam and Iraq today (yes, I agree with those IMDb commentators that wrote about this parallel).2. 'The Declaration of Independence is not a bargaining tool. Not for me', or something like that. Not only that it is propaganda, but it is active and brutal propaganda. That 'not for me' is like an accusing finger pointed at the audience. Maybe I am being a bit paranoid here, but it is propaganda nevertheless.3. The actors did a surprisingly good job, but they should have skipped this one for the moral implications.4. I live in a ex-Comunist country and every time I see American nationalism and patriotism, it surprises me how similar it is to the Comunist one. Believe me, it is. I am not saying that America is not be praised for its obvious qualities, but believe me, extremism is the same, regardless of political beliefs.5. Museums that were not shown in the movie: 'How we stole the land from the Indians Museum' 'How we promoted slavery Museum' 'How we kill our Presidents if they become undesirable Museum' Don't get me wrong, I appreciate America for its qualities, but it does have the tendency to be pretty defensive about the negative aspects.6. My 1/10 has nothing to do with the actors or the work that went in this movie, just with its sheer stupidity.",1,8,15,6 February 2005
The Da Vinci Code," Croissant hamburger with some porridge
","Writing a action/adventure book based on a conspiracy theory, in principle, is a bad idea. But when you make a movie based on that very book you get a recipe for disaster. I don't know if you heard about this but there is a conspiracy theory concerning the Beatles; it basically suggests that starting with Seargent Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band - LP, the original Beatles were replaced, and this theory is supported by 'facts'. Now imagine you would make a adventure novel and movie out of this. Imagine having a scene where outside the studio where the historic Let It Be is being recorded, the 'real' Paul McCartney would try to take out the new Paul McCartney with a sniper rifle. You get the picture here? Now Da Vinci's Code is really an unimaginative book and film. It 'steals' a very well known conspiracy theory, turns it into a freaking circus, done in bad taste. Clichés and kitsch hit you every 5 minutes. The French look disgustingly boring.... 'French-like', the American is a brilliant intellectual (completely opposed to the obnoxious hoards of American tourists visiting Europe, ;)) and the English was so 'typical' English that he managed to get on my nerves in the first 2 minutes. I hate clichés, and this movie is full of it. And then you have the 'action'. It's supposed to be a roller-coaster ride but it looked like a cheap predictable TV-show episode. I won't go in the conspiracy theory and I won't rant about the reason why the book and the movie were so successful because I really don't want to offend people. But I will say this: for a movie that is supposed to be bold and a a sort of taboo-breaker, the almost complete silence regarding MASONS and FREEMASONRY is pathetic. I mean, what were the movie-makers afraid of? They can mention that Jesus had a sex-life but let's not talk about Masons cuz I guess it's taboo. Booooooo!.Those Masons are soooo tabooooo !!! Booooo!!!!!!! Jesus!. I mean Jesus, Mary and Tautou !!!! Boooooo!!!!!! P.S.1 point is for the actors, who really kept me awake. Cuz the movie was a sleeper. Zzzzzzz!!!!!!",2,1,4,25 May 2006
Titanic," overinflated lack of realism and clichés
","Don't wanna bother too much with this one, so I'll give 2 points for the technical part.Ship sinking - good, and so on. As for the rest: childish screenplay,idiotic intrigue,a good-hearted Robin Hood Picasso--DeCaprio in a relationship with Ms.Rich Bitch (I thought this looked like a lesbian relationship, with Winslet being the dominant partner).As for the depiction of the class issue,it reminded me of some Communist propaganda stories.The whole feel of the movie is second-rate sentimentalism.The other characters are incredibly one-sided (Billy Zane looks like a Bond villain and the rich people are the worst bastards I have ever seen).1 billion dollars wasted in a giant corny video-clip.This movie made me sick.As for Celine Dion and her over-hyped song...no comment,except I had no idea that cheesy and corny are the qualities needed for an Oscar-winning song.Now I know. Actors were really alright,but the movie is so melodramatically over the top that it's just insulting....",3,7,12,21 March 2008
The Matrix Reloaded," 'Pretty Woman' for the nerds
","For those of you that may remember, 'Pretty Woman' was a movie about a prostitute marrying a millionaire. Nothing wrong with that, except the story and the way it was presented was responsible for the worst brainpollution since Madonna. I mean, any stupid, fat, mediocre women would identify with Julia Roberts' character. Which means that you would have a 'I am a bitch but also a saint' attitude from all the women around you, regardless of how uninteresting they were. Matrix 1 was OK. Story was OK, and everything else seemed to fit into place(except of course, Keanu R., who never fits in anything except maybe as a vegetable or a surfer). But this Matrix really was terrible. Imagine average young office workers in cubicles watching this movie, dreaming about kicking everyone's ass, shagging Wonder Woman and saving the world in the same time. There is nothing wrong with daydreaming so you can escape from reality, except you have to do it in good taste. And this movie is definitely bad taste. 3 points are for: - Lawrence Fishburn, Monica Belucci (I don't care how she acts, when you look like that, you can afford to act badly ), the special effects (which I might add, as awesome as they were in this movie, are normally intended to be supportive of the story, not THE STORY) - Bad points: Dialogue: 'Why am I here?'; 'You don't know?'; 'No'; You think you don't, but you do.';'Do I?' GET ON WITH IT YOU MORONS!!!!!!!! Story: what story? Oh right, Neo meets a guy at the end and he tells him he was a moron all along. Now that was about the only part of the story that had any meaning to me. Sun glasses: Will someone please explain to me why all were wearing sunglasses? And I don't need a SF nerdy explanation, just explain to me how somebody could be so stupid to imagine the characters like that. I would not like to meet him in a dark alley. I am sick just thinking about this movie, I'll stop here.",3,2,4,29 March 2005
War of the Worlds," why spielberg, why ?
","Spielberg always reminds me of Elvis; a talented artist who rarely produces anything of quality. Sure, these kind of statements are subjective, but let's examine this movie for a second: 1. Tom Cruise is not a dramatic actor. Period. He is forced in his acting, and with some minor exceptions (Born on the 4-th of July, for ex.) he acts very badly. That singing to his daughter in this movie was positively a crown achievement in bad acting in an otherwise 'distinguished' career in bad acting. And, to his credit in a way, he looks like a responsible parent, so he was completely wrong in this role. 2. Was this movie really science-fiction?. The definition implies that it should be scientifically solid, minus the fictional elements. But this does not justify how 20+ people in an iron cage falling 20+ meters to the ground survive uninjured or that an super-advanced race of aliens manage to build a high-tech tracking machine (I mean the serpent looking arm at the end of the picture) that relies solely on sight and hearing to track something !? So apparently the aliens had no idea of infrared rays, motion detectors or x-ray. Congrats, Mr. Spielberg, you surpassed John Carpenter in the 'best science fiction joke of the year' category. 3. There must have been some benevolent voodoo made on Cruise' family, cuz guess what - they all survived ! So that means you can walk out the theater feeling invincible, until something completely unrealistic will happen to you like a friend of yours dying from an allergic reaction to a bee sting and then you will understand what a true 'genius' Spielberg really is as a storyteller. I am really looking forward to Spielberg's next crap. Who needs realism when you can enjoy a 5-th grade level movie and feel good for the rest of the week?",2,4,7,22 August 2005
Bram Stoker's Dracula," you can't go wrong with Gary Oldman
","Pluses: 1. Gary Oldman. Very different Dracula, but also very convincing. The truth is, all the other famous Draculas were great too (Lee, Kinsky).Oldman does it differently, but he is great. The Romanian that he speaks in the movie is remarkable, very slight accent. He even got the tone pretty well, this is not some pathetic American actor throwing away words in a foreign language. 2. Atmosphere and screenplay. Combination of Ken Russel and John Carpenter, pretty credible. Of course it's commercial, I think it was meant to be. The weeding in the Orthodox church was remarkably well done. 3. All actors except Keanu Reeves 4. I believe the sexual innuendo and scenes fit well with the story.Minuses: 1. Keanu Reeves. Sorry Keanu, but surfer, bozo or robot are just about your limits. 2. The gypsy characters. Mr. Coppola, those didn't look and act like Gypsies, they looked more like overdressed Mohawks. And that 'Gipsies willing to give their lives to protect their noble master' simply doesn't hold. Apparently, your Romanian consultants were shallow at this one. I do not see Gypsies like that at all.Overall, flawed, but got the atmosphere right and the acting and dialog was decent, on occasion excellent : (Van Helsing at the dinner table: 'She suffered alright, we put a stick in her heart and cut off her head', approximately quoted. Loved that one.",7,0,2,7 February 2005
Inception," I MUST be dreaming
","I only arrived at the 35 minutes mark on this one and I had to turn it off. I never do this, commenting on a movie I haven't seen in its entirety, but I will make an exception in this case because it reeked of pretentious and 'interesting' from the very start. Christopher Nolan must be so full of it by now, with the success of the Batman series, that he thinks he can discard some platitude on to the screen, by relying on big stars and some teenage fantasy...and by the way, other than Watanabe,Caine and Berenger, what's with all the teenage looking actors (I have to admit, good ones)? For a second there, I thought they are turning Beverly Hills 90210 into a movie. I admire Leonardo di Caprio as an actor, but if I ever see him in an action man-hero sequence again, I'll call Kate Winslet to squash him like a bug (in Titanic, she looked huge compared to him),he's just not believable in those roles (and I thought Charlie Sheen looked ridiculous in the 80' s and '90's) no matter how much he tries, sometimes it works sufficiently, sometimes it doesn't but the fact that he seems to look for those roles all the time, and what a shame, compared to his earlier roles.I'll just stop here, I've rarely received such a bad vibe from a movie. The incredible special effects (which i acknowledge with 1 point) only made it worse, since they were supporting crap.",2,21,39,17 April 2011
Lord of War," very nice
","I was surprised by this one.Great character development,realistic characters,good storytelling,quality acting,demanding subject told beautifully,great filming,complex drama. The African episode is haunting. I don't feel the need to analyze it, since the film is not pretentious in any way and is done in very good taste, no forcing whatsoever and even the in-your-face morality which would constitute a forced element is almost eliminated by a good-paced and realistic movie. I identified with the emotions of the characters quite heavily and the different ethnic nuances in the story were done with great attention.The casting is absolutely stunning, Ian Holm and Jared Leto in particular. Very nice movie.",9,3,5,31 March 2006
The Shawshank Redemption," Excellent but ultimately shamelessly aims to please the audience
","Don't get me wrong,I loved this movie. It's a beautiful and powerful fictional story, beautifully and powerfully told. Incredible job by everyone involved,and this is a very rich movie,it goes everywhere and never misses,and the control and confidence with which it is driven forward by Darabont reminded me of Coppola. It also reminded me somewhat of The Hill,Pappilon,Brubaker which are one of my favorite films about incarceration.Which brings me to my only discontent about Shawshank Redemption: the fact that Andy Dufresne succeeds in solving everything so completely. Revenge,freedom,happiness,reward for his patience and determination, all with one precise blow. And fate somehow cooperates.Well,that's too much for me.The happy ending was nice,but it was a bit too happy.It really goes straight for that pure part of our being that would want everything to be spectacular and complete, which gives us great emotions but ultimately 'insults' our common sense.Andy Dufresne managed to beat the system. It took 18 years but he did it. Beautiful but I don't buy that. Makes for a great movie but doesn't leave much room to meditate.However I wouldn't even think of rating this one less than 9 and really deserves top marks. However,looking around me and thinking about my fate and the fate of others and the fate of the world, I see no Andy Dufresne's. I see the warden, I see Red and I see almost all characters but not Andy.He's like Tristan or Heracles to me,and I don't believe in those hero myths.So,almost perfect movie,but I'll make and take a point by rating it 9.",9,0,1,31 March 2010
Platoon," Loved it!
","I have to say that Oliver Stone seems to be one of the most misunderstood directors in the world. What some people don't get is that one of the main values of an artist is his originality. How HE sees things,how HE creates something. Stone has an OPINION and a TAKE on things which he throws in our faces. He is SUBJECTIVE, as all art should be.All these people here on IMDb that say that Platoon and other Stone pictures don't do justice to Vietnam veterans miss the point.This movie is not only about Vietnam veterans, it is about people in an extreme situation.About feelings, emotions and human behavior.It is fairly historically accurate and it is enough.Dialogues are excellent, as all dialogs written by Stone.Of course you have to FEEL like Stone to really appreciate his movies.You have to connect.If you don't, that's OK, but don't criticize simply because you don't agree with how he perceived the events. Acting is brilliant,filming beautiful,screenplay excellent. You can sense the 100% passion that went into the making of this movie, and this is the most that you can ask from an artist. Europe (generally) loves your movies Oliver, so don't bother with your shallow and brainwashed compatriots. 10/10",10,3,5,3 February 2005
Any Given Sunday," 5 steps to make this movie better
","1.Replace Jamie Foxx with Wesley Snipes 2.Replace LL Cool J with Forrest Whitaker 3.Either make Cameron Diaz try harder or just replace her with an actress of reasonable talent 4.Try to use less footage from Ben-Hur (OK idea, but completely overdone,I got the parallel in 5 seconds, no need for 5 minutes)5.Please decide which scene is the actual ending of the movie and edit it accordingly...by the time Pacino's character was announcing his going to another team and taking the star player with him, I thought the movie had ended with the conversation between Jamie Fox and Al Pacino, which was also a weaker ending than the scene before that with the victory...all that mess,when you have 2 hours and 33 minutes at your disposal ?...c'mon...On the bright side:1.A pretty unique insight in the world and life of professional sports and sportsmen. 2.Great and diverse camera work and editing (except for the end scene/scenes).3.Very informative and plenty of narrative elements that add to the characters and story, you're not bored for one minute if you know where to look. 4.Realistic and human characters, like in most of Stone's movies, they are incredibly believable and balanced. 5. Al Pacino, James Woods and Matthew Modine in the same movie directed by Oliver Stone, that's got to be worth something, and it is.",7,0,0,17 May 2010
The Matrix," A beautiful metaphor somehow emerged from this movie
","Why somehow? Because casting Keanu Reeves in a metaphor-movie is always risky business, considering his 'enourmous versatility'. Here is an example: Keanu happy :) Keanu angry :)Keanu hurt :)Keanu in pain :)Keanu having an orgasm :)Keanu trying to be intellectual ............... Apart from that, he seems an OK dude, really. Is this movie philosophical? Well, yes, it's a pretty nice abstract explanatory image of the absurdity of the world we live in, and it is consistent with a basic philosophical basic presumption on which an entire argumentative algorithm - type system is subsequently based on. The beauty of such a vision is that you can interpret the idea of this movie in a personal way; some of my fellow commentators have brought up issues like: the absurdity of work ?!!!! (mino from Romania - gimme 5, bro). Can't say I don't agree,pal,while you're there in the Matrix, please help Tyler Durden blow up the rest of the banks too, will you?:). What I mostly saw here was a nice metaphor regarding the reaching of a higher understanding of the world. Our bodies are rigid mechanisms, the only way he can achieve freedom is through our minds. We could be rich, glamorous or whatever, but we are still flesh,bones and blood. It's our minds that we have to think about.Where I don't agree with some of my fellow commentators is that this movie has a religious dimension. Every time something like 'The Matrix' appears on the market, there will be hoards of people joining that big 'ol atheist love parade. The same with E.T.,War of the Lords and the SF-movement generally and...the newest jewel encrusted in the existentialist frustration crown: The DaVinci Code. I mean, give me a break, I'm not a religious person, but use your own brain and generate your own ideas when it comes to faith and God. If you can't, that's absolutely OK, but better turn to traditional religions rather than the Watchowski Brothers.Having said that, the movie is very entertaining and nicely done. What I disliked a bit was the video-clip type of filming and the very clean advertisement-type 'feel' of the movie. Also the dialog was sometimes overly preachy, although as I said earlier, the basic idea is great.I would have taken one point out of the deserved 8 because of Keanu R., but since one of man's most expressive features are the eyes, and Keanu R. is wearing sunglasses for most of the movie, we don't have to look to often into the eyes of KEN, so it's bearable.'You humans are like a virus' Damn right, Mr. Smith.",8,1,2,18 April 2006
