Ford v Ferrari," Left turn only
","One word: boring. Whoever thought this was a good idea for a movie should learn programming computers to perform specific functions. They should certainly never work at anything requiring interaction with the public. No good guys, bad guys, twists, or payoffs on the supposed expectations. I don't viscerally hate many movies. This is one. I usually like Damon, Bale, Berndahl, and many of the other cast. I had to force myself to sit through the whole thing. If you really want to check this out, wait for free streaming somewhere. This is clearly one of those movies that critics are pushing to demonstrate their 'influence' or get paid, and there are so many fake 9/10 and 10/10 reviews here it's hard to trust IMBD anymore.",1,32,101,18 November 2019
Yesterday," Thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
",Well done. The music is faithful to the original songs. Great picks for the lead and the romantic interest. All the awkward moments Jack experiences made the movie better and more real. I was going to pass on this and I'm very glad I didn't. I took a chance with a free rental and will now be getting the movie for my personal collection.,9,0,0,21 November 2019
