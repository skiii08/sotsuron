Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Racy. Interesting. Intriguing
","As a Holmes fan, I couldn't have asked for a better take on the stories and the character of Holmes & Dr. Watson. Robert Downey Jr & Jude Law make their roles come alive with such élan that you just refuse to believe that anyone else could take on these roles. The only cast member who I felt was out of place was Jared Harris who acted as Professor James Moriarty. Somehow, I felt the role need someone more cold, calm yet menacing, and deep. Holmes' relationship with Watson is highlighted in this film. Their chemistry is hilariously funny as there are a few scenes involving Holmes dressed as a woman that brings the comedy to its peak with the lines 'lie with me Watson'. The action scenes were awesomely backed by beautiful cinematography. Some of the scenes help build a connection between the character and audience. For instance, when Holmes's sees everything as he says his curse; it engages the viewer on his personal thoughts. The train ride to Watson's honeymoon & the one with face-off between Moriarty & Holmes are my favourites. The movie ends with a hint of the next sequel. It has been some time since the game of shadows has released. I really am looking forward to the next Sherlock Holmes movie in this series.",9,1,2,4 October 2015
Sherlock Holmes," Blown Away!
","This is the 2nd time that I revisited this movie. I have been a big fan of Arthur Conan Doyle's creation, Holmes. This movie is an amazing reprise of this character. I quiet love the choice of actors to play the lead & sidekick – Downey (Holmes) & Jude Law (Dr. Watson). There are quite a few parallels between their lives and the character itself. Casting Downey as Holmes was a masterstroke! I appreciate this more after reading his biography. I must call out the excellent sets, costumes & music. Although these lurk in the background these add to the mood & pace of the movie. The end of the movie clearly gives a hint of a 2nd part, which indeed was released in 2011, equally exciting! Set in 1891, Sherlock Holmes & his colleague, Dr. Watson successfully arrest the aristocratic serial killer & occult practitioner Lord Blackwood to close their latest case. But when Blackwood supposedly walks out of his grave, all hell breaks loose. Holmes is hired by a secret society to investigate into the matter, only to discover that his nemesis has been planning a more sinister plot all along. Downey's role as Tony Stark in 2008 gave him the much awaited blockbuster & Holmes gave him an opportunity to cement his position, the following year, as an actor to reckon with in mainstream cinema.",9,0,2,3 October 2015
The Soloist," The music must go on...
","'The Soloist' is one of those movies that pieces you together. I came across this title on reading Robert Downey Jr's biography. This is one of his most sincere portrayals. This is based on a book written by Steve Lopez. Downey plays Steve Lopez. The chemistry between Downey & Foxx is mystical. Both come together in the most unusual way. The movie explores one of the most debated topic; does a mentally ill person need medications to get better, is love and emotional support not way more powerful? Both characters feed off each other's friendship, making each a better person. The film puts forth a pertinent question; how many other Nathaniel Ayers lurk around, clueless and lost? Life is unpredictable. We may never truly know the answer to this question. However this movie is all about a gem found after being hidden for ever so long. This is by no means a fairy tale movie. Ayers does not get better in a jiffy. However his find, road to recovery & his attempt to refit into the society, not just helps him but Lopez too. Worth a watch. Does your heart a great good! :)",9,0,0,2 September 2015
The Martian," You will surely Gravitate to The Martian
","I have been eagerly waiting for this movie to his the screens. I sure was not disappointed. Being left out & all alone in an inhospitable planet surely sounds like the worst predicament, however the mood the pace and the thought is positive and happy. The protagonist learns to accept the situation, make the best of what he has got and move on with hope. This is one of the best power of mind movies I have seen. Often, when we are hit a bad patch, we have 2 choices, either we move on or we give up. This movie is about survival at its best. Matt Damon adds life to the character Mark Watney. You just cannot not like him and go on a journey with him. His advice to the future group of budding astronauts is practical and valuable. This is one of those movies where there is no right or wrong, no villains, no monsters, just nature, man and his emotions.From a technical point of view - visual, cinematography, acting, direction, and score – I'm pretty sure this movie will be an Oscar contender. The cast is awesome and support each other seamlessly.",9,1,38,4 October 2015
