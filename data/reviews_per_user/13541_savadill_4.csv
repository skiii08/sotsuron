They are very smart and they do what they do to survive their encounters, and their big dream is to go to Bolivia and start a life there but then they start robbing g banks and running from the police and it takes them forever to get to Bolivia and on their way they stop at butchs' sisters house and stay the night there and then take her to Bolivia with them and she robs the banks with them but the police never figure out that it was her helping them so the police don't try to catch her",9,1,2,23 October 2018
