Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," non stop action
",This movie excellent. I saw it two times some people say if all you want to see is robots fighting then don't watch this because it is just is dogs humping and robots humping humans and also close up of Megan Fox then don't see this movie. All of what I said is true but there is still a lot of robots fighting each other. But most people saw this movie because they thought Megan Fox is sexy and they would probably go on IMDb pro and get her address and send her letters asking y if she would send them a picture of her breast or asking her if she would have sex with them. But most people I know saw the movie because they like Megan Fox like I stated above but then again they would see it because the movie is full of action. The most favorite part for my friends and I was when Sam Witwicky died and came back to life to save Optimus Prime's life and to save the movie. I hope there is a third movie.,10,1,5,5 July 2009
