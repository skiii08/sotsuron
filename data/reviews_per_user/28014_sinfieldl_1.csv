The Avengers," Entertaining? I prefer EPIC!
","Avengers Assemble. As a 21 year old Marvel fan/Comic fan i've been looking forward to this movie since the announcement of its production, and i'm happy to report that my excitement wasn't in vain. I've always said that an epic movie must make you want to immediately see it again, and the Avengers has done just that.One of the many things that i loved about this movie was that it is obvious that the production team has taken time to research Avenger comics and cartoons. I have seen many criticisms made by the general public of a certain character (Hulk) and about how he is different from the last two films. What these people don't realise is that the way the Hulk is portrayed in the Avengers is the way he was created by Stan Lee & CO, if anything the Hulk is proof of the hard work and dedication that the production team has put in to making this movie.I could go on and on about the film, but i'm not. I just recommend everyone to see it in cinema. Perferably in 2D as 3D suck (in my opinion)! Avengers Assemble is the best film i've ever seen. . . so far. Stay tuned for Dark Knight Rises!",10,9,18,28 April 2012
