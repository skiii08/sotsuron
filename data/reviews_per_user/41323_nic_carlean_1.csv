It," Not by the words of the book but has the same feel
","You may be hearing negative reviews about the CGI or the minor inaccuracies to the book, and i will not spoil these but i think that this does not make a difference if you are going to see a Stephen King movie or are just going out to enjoy a horror film. This film is scary, but does not overload you with jump scare after jump scare. Instead the makers took the right path and built up tension throughout the first act with downright terrifying imagery like something Stephen King would have come up with even if not all of it was accurate to the book because in some cases, if it was, that would have disrupted the flow of the movie. And to balance this, they added the good-natured light child-hood summer atmosphere to ease the audience with a Stand By Me (or rather it!) feel to it. One complaint i have is that the movie should of either had more dialogue from Pennywise or less of him because i feel that some of the other monsters should have gotten more screen time to shine. To conclude, to a normal movie goer, you will enjoy this film for it's tense atmosphere, it's jokes, it's smooth story-telling and Richie! To a movie goer wanting a Stephen King movie, you will enjoy all that, the casting and the care gone into making it have the heart and soul of childhood memories that the book had. I recommend this film to all.",7,6,13,8 September 2017
