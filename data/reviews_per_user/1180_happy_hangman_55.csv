The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Padding
","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1' will not be remembered as the peak of this particular franchise. It's not bad, it just drags a bit...though considerably less than the first half of the final novel in Suzanne Collins' trilogy. If anything it takes the necessary time to deal with the protagonists qualms at becoming the figurehead for revolution, which is so rushed in the prose version. A few good stunts and effects sequences, and some nicely tuned supporting performances from the great Philip Seymour Hoffman, Julianne Moore and Woody Harrelson, but, as ever, it's all held together by Ms Lawrence. I have yet to see that lass give a bad performance, even in dross like 'The Last House on the Left' remake. The film just about succeeds in remedying the dramatic deficiencies of Collins' storytelling, and making sure all the key pieces are placed appropriately for the endgame is vital...but having to wait for Katniss to cut-loose an' whup Donald Sutherland's wrinkly ol' posterior until November 2015 is annoying.",6,3,5,15 March 2015
The New World," A Poke In The Eye For Disney-History
","A curious feature of Terence Malick's 'The New World' is that nowhere in the script is the central character referred to by her proper name. Pocahontas. Perhaps this is to distance what purports to be a more culturally aware and historical accurate telling of her tale from the Disneyfication (literal and metaphorical) of her legend which, sadly, has greater purchase on the popular imagination. In some respects this distance is achieved. Although represented as morally conflicted between fondness for his lover and her community and his loyalty to the British crown, Colin Farrell is not the idealistic, tolerant, clean-cut hero of legend. He is a moral coward and a complete git. This is probably one of Farrell's better performances, though he does, as ever, walk through much of the film looking slightly stunned - somewhat as though he's just been smacked in the head with a plank of wood. He tries too hard. Q'Orianka Kilcher's Pocahontas (referred to for much of the film simply as 'The Princess' or by her baptismal name, Rebecca) is, by comparison, fresh, earnest and a joy to watch. Unquestionably the star of the movie. Christian Bale gets, for once, to suffer from no notable neuroses or psychoses, and a host of able character actors (though the talents of some, David Thewlis and Jonathan Price  the latter of whom has no lines at all - in particular, are underused) provide able support. August Schellenberg's Powahatan is surprisingly subtle in his characterisation.It's a beautiful film. The combination of Emmanuel Lubezki cinematography and James Horner's score works superbly well, capturing the majesty of Malick's New World. A nice contrast between the functional, ritualistic demi-paradise of the 'Naturals' and the filth and disorder of the 'civilised' settlers is established early on  complemented by the reactions of Powahaten's people visiting the London of James VI/I (astonished and horrified in equal measure by the majesty of the architecture and the hellish need for the white man to enforce order even to the natural world).Not a perfect film by any measure, and the portrayal of Powahatan's people is a tad idealistic, but a creditable attempt to tell Pocahontas' story.",Null,4,8,31 January 2006
Walk the Line," The Man In Black Lives!
","There's a traditional path to be trod in the pop bio-pic: the rocky road from impoverished childhood trauma and underestimation through the first flushes of success and excess, and thence to either redemption through the love of a good woman or untimely death. It's a deeply furrowed lane populated by the likes of 'Lady Sings the Blues', 'The Buddy Holly Story', 'Elvis Lives!' and last year's 'Ray'. 'Walk the Line', James Mangold's account of Johnny Cash and his pursuit of the love of his life, June Carter, follows this map step-for-step, yet still manages to be genuinely touching.Given that Judi Dench's cliché ridden performance in the awful 'Mrs Henderson Presents' is honoured in the recent Oscar and Bafta nominations we should, just perhaps, be wary of thinking that these lists are arbiters of quality. In the cases of the central performances given here by Joaquim Phoenix and the ever-dependable Reese Witherspoon, such plaudits are genuinely deserved. Witherspoon ups-the-ante a notch or two, giving us a quality mix of vulnerability and sassy Southern 'pep', and Phoenix has a troubled feral quality that does Cash proud. More importantly, there is a genuine chemistry between the pair on screen, aided no-end by Mangold's decision not to have his leads lip-synch to recordings of Cash and Carter. Theirs was a relationship based on music, and their scenes on-stage are amongst the best in the film, chiefly because we can see performers performing. They are hardly sound-a-likes for the real couple, but there's sufficient parity to make their characterisations convincing. Phoenix's rendition of the opening of the 'At Folsom Prison' concert is absolutely electricand I say that as a big fan of the Man In Black.There are, I suppose, a few too many rapid-fire 'cameos'  a cocky Jerry Lee Lewis, Buddy Holly and Elvis ('That Elvis boy sure likes talking' poon, Johnny!')  but these at least capture the hectic pace of the 1950s touring programmes. More could have been made of Cash's truly long-suffering first wife: Ginnifer Goodwin gives a solid performance, but narrative emphasis being on Johnny and June, she is reduced in some scenes to being little more than an obstacle  a plot-device to be circumvented to get to the happy ending. I, personally, would have liked to see more of (the continually underestimated) Robert Patrick as Cash's gruff, dismissive father. These are deficiencies, to be sure, but they pale to near insignificances in the light of the central performances by Witherspoon and Phoenix.",Null,0,1,7 February 2006
Mission: Impossible III," Tiny Tom Suffers In Hoffman's Shadow
","Tom Cruise makes a surprisingly good Jennifer Garner. J.J. Abrams 'Mission: Impossible III' is pretty much a re-hash of plot points and characters from his 'Alias' TV show  in the days before it disappeared, cryptic cipher in hand, up it's own narrative back passage. There are bluffs and double-bluffs a-plenty, our hero gets all angsty about deceiving his lover and leading a double life, we spend two-plus hours of screen time chasing an artifact the purpose of which is never explained, and certain characters from 'Alias' simply seem to be played, here, by actors on a slightly higher pay grade  most notably Simon Pegg's comedy techno-geek. Abrams fondness for non-linear narrative is also indulged.This, by the way, is not a complaint. At it's best 'Alias' was a superbly quirky and imaginative show, and at his best Abrams can be an exceptionally fine adventure writer. This is a well-paced, densely plotted piece of popcorn accompaniment  vastly superior to it's predecessors in the franchise. Big guns go bang. Cars go bang. Buildings go bang, and our plucky hero triumphs against all adversity. And, just in case we're enjoying all the violence too much, the writer reminds us of his liberal leanings by throwing an implied seeding-discord-overseas-to-justify-aggressive-American-foreign policy sub-plot, but, like most of the characterisations this is undevelopedand doesn't distract us from the nice fireworks.Philip Seymour Hoffman dominates the film, despite having comparatively little screen time. One has to feel a little sorry for Tiny Tom, being set against a proper actor, one with actual screen presence and who has used the bare-bones of character sketched in the script to create a more memorable screen-persona than the bland action-movie clones around them.It doesn't have much to say, but it says it boldly and very loudly. It's what an action movie should be.",Null,1,3,8 May 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," Slick but Superficial
","Scot Paul McGuigan's 'Lucky Number Slevin' is a sharp, funny, quick witted little movie populated by character actors who are fully engaged in their script and characterisation. It's by no means perfect  certain plot points are glaringly obvious, as indeed are continuity errors  but it is a film which requires audiences to pay attention as double-crosses pile on top of one another.Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley (sorry, Sir Ben Kingsley, he seems to have grown a little pompous in his old age to insist on such on-screen honorifics) are amiably malevolent as the warring gangsters at the heart of the story, and Lucy Lui and Josh Hartnett make an engaging couple. The script is, however, the film's strongest point, the dialogue is snappy, though at times it verges into near parody of Ellroy Leonard.The designer, however, needs to be shot. Every set is cursed with either '70s wallpaper or decorative tiling inspired to foster migraine.Hartnett's best film so far, and huge improvement on Paul McGuigan's previous directorial efforts.",Null,6,18,2 March 2006
John Wick," Silly, Brainless, But Fun (Spoilers)
","This is a very silly film, redeemed by the fact that it appears to glory in its ludicrousness.Keanu Reeves takes a very fine Italian suit on a number of increasingly violent adventures to avenge his...um...puppy. A former enforcer for the Russian Mob he is feared as 'Baba Yaga', which we are told again and again is 'The Boogeyman'. That anyone remotely aware of folklore can tell you that Baba ISN'T the Boogeyman is the least of this film's narrative flaws: the Curious Incident Of The Kevlar Vest That Vanished In The Night is a fairly major plot-goof.That it works is down to Reeves's deadpan delivery of some preposterous dialogue, the playful use of supporting actors: Ian McShane, Clarke Peters and Lance Reddick are very amusing. More could be made of Michael Nyqvist, and Alfie Allen seems to be destined for a career playing a succession of disappointing sons.Also, if you like shoot-'em-ups this is very much your film - or franchise, I should say: the producers intentions in that regard are very clear long before the credits roll. Reeves offs a ludicrous number of baddies - I literally lost count in the mid-50s - while having only one of their weapons come anywhere near him..and only THEN because that Kevlar vest I mentioned seems to have inexplicably evaporated between scenes!As I say, very silly indeed...but fun if you are amused by cartoon violence.",5,1,5,28 April 2015
Alexander," Tragic
","The critic and film historian Robert Sarris said of Robert Rossen's 1956 epic 'Alexander the Great', featuring Richard Burton as our titular hero, that it 'aimed for greatness and lost honourably'. Oliver Stone's current offering to the Dionysian gods of cinematic excess, 'Alexander', has much in common with it's predecessor but, sadly, honour isn't one of them.Like the earlier film and, for that matter, every film Stone has ever made, it's  at knocking on three hours  seriously in need of a good editor. It has an all-star cast, mostly drawn - in the great Hollywood tradition of the Classical world being populated by British character actors  from current Equity rosters (the likes of Olivier, Barry Jones and Michael Hordern are replaced by rather more low-rent personages as Tim Piggot-Smith, Brian Blessed and that big fella from the Scots Porridge Oats advert). Also, like the original movie it features a dark and hairy Celtic-type who can't do accents as the blond, blue-eyed Hellenic hero. With Burton  a man with natural presence and authority  this latter incongruity is more easily overlooked than is the case with Colin Farrell, who has the general demeanour of a bleached and strategically shaved Gremlin. Hairy Col's verbal limitations have also, it seems, led Stone to populate Macedonia with Irishmen  with a token Welshman and Scotsman thrown in for good measure (Greeks are all Englishmen, by the way). This means that Val Kilmer, as Alexander's dear old dad, Philip, has to adopt a brogue almost as astonishingly unconvincing as his wig, and that unintentional titters abound in the auditoria as hairy Hibernian's slap each other manfully on the back proclaiming such classic lines as 'In t' name o' Zeus, Alexander, d'ye t'ink I'm a daft auld sod?' Foreigners are granted a variety of curious accents. Angelina Jolie sounds Russian and Athena alone knows where in Hades Rosario Dawson is supposed to come from.This coming from Laughin' Ollie Stone it's a poker-faced presentation, offering conspiracies a-plenty. I wouldn't have been surprised if there had been talk of a Lone Swordsman on a grassy Grecian knoll when Philip was offed. The main difference between this film and the 1956 offering comes in its treatment of Alexander's homosexuality. Nary a mention was made of Big Gay Al's rather more than Platonic relationships in Rossen's film. Here, it's evident, but is the object of knowing disdainful frowns from his contemporaries  which shows a pitiful understanding, on the part of Stone, of Hellenic sexual politics. Here it's clearly presented as a character flaw, showing nothing more clearly than the director's cowardice in addressing the issue: in a film notable for it's visceral excess, and which requires nudity from Rosario Dawson in a near-rape scene, Stone limit's Alexander's 'unnatural' appetites to precisely three hugs and two pecks on the lips. The film is a muddled hotch-potch of incidents from Alexander's life. This would be less of a muddle, admittedly, if a fifteen minute flashback two-thirds of the way through the film was presented as part of the otherwise straightforward linear narrative. There are a few parallels between the life-choices and characters of Alexander and Philip, but these appear almost to have been afterthoughts. The greatest impediments, though, are that - despite it's great length - characters are not permitted to evolve beyond one-note caricatures (though Kilmer, an actor I have little time for, normally, tries harder than most with what little screen time he has), and that Farrell has no authority whatever on screen. Thus, sorry though I am to have to say it, I am forced to confirm the critical evaluation of 'Alexander' offered by the Chavs whose departure from the cinema preceded my own. One succinctly noted 'That was rotten.' 'Aye,' said the other, referring to the pulchritudinous Ms Dawson, 'But that coloured bird is kinda fit!' Indeed she is, boys. Indeed she is.",Null,26,40,19 January 2006
Constantine," Hell On Earth
","Okay, I admit it: I was predisposed against 'Constantine' before I ever set foot in the cinema. I'm a bad, bad man. I'm fond of the John Constantine character in the 'Swamp Thing' and 'Hellblazer' comics, and thought the decision to transform Vertigo's middle-aged scouse occult wide-boy into a surly Keanu Reeves, and move the setting from London to LA was foolish. How ill considered and prejudiced of me. I also thought that a horror movie directed by a pop video maker would be little more than a particularly bloody epileptic lightshow. What a cultural snob I am.Pity I was right, isn't it?It's a lazy movie. Constantine's emotional response to the discovery that he has lung cancer is akin to the disdain of a supermarket teller who discovers the bar-code on a tin of beans won't scan. The sly charm and sarcasm of the comic Constantine (the defining characteristics and, consequently, the principal reasons for his appeal over the past twenty years) is transformed into sulky rudeness  presumably because guile is beyond the ability of the leading man. Rachel Weisz is little better. She's in twitchy funny-accent mode, though, which is never a good sign. Tilda Swinton tries very hard as the Angel Gabriel to be a little more than an archetype, as does Peter Stormare as a particularly oleaginous Satan, but both these character-actors are set exclusively as antagonists to Reeves  but as all true drama comes from conflict and contrast between characters, the poor sods are working against a brick wall. Francis Lawrence's direction iswellnot apparent.It's hard to see who the film is aimed at. Much of the iconography and many of the characters from the comics are retained: Constantine is aided by his taxi-driver friend Chaz (who, in the US, would call a Charles 'Chaz'?), and frequents the occult club of the witch-doctor Papa Midnite, but these icons are distorted to such a degree that they bear no relation to their originals. There's a reliance on gimmicky props, such as the 'Holy Shotgun', which the comics have been mercifully free of these past two decades. Indeed there's so little of the character and back-story of the 'real' Constantine in evidence here that it's a wonder they even bothered to use the name,Visually, there are flashes of brilliance. David Lazan's art-direction is very good. His design of Hell (a fire-storm ravaged urban desert) is splendid, but it's over-used to the point where it becomes almost tedious, and an escalating reliance upon CGI effects also gives the overall impression of this being a particularly over-ambitious Aerosmith video.",Null,0,3,19 January 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Family Fun
","'Brokeback Mountain' is a fairly traditional Ang Lee film. The director has given us everything from cross-cultural romantic comedy ('The Wedding Banquet') and literary adaptation ('Sense and Sensibility') to historical adventure ('Ride With The Devil') and superheroics ('The Hulk')with stops at every genre station in between. One thing all of these films have in common, though, is that they concern dysfunctional families. Often pairs of them, in fact.A generally genial and traditional tale of doomed love, it says a great deal about our society that this story has caused such a furore in certain quarters. If Ledger's 'other' was female, their relationship would hardly be worthy of critical note. That the emotionally and sexually conflicted protagonists should come from traditionally down-at-heel blue-collar traditionally right-wing backgrounds makes it the source of controversy. I'd like to think that that makes the near twenty-year span of the story a picture-postcard of period mores, but  the flick being banned in many places  that's clearly not the case. As with 'Ride With the Devil' and the superior 'The Ice Storm', Lee demonstrates that the outsider's eye is often more effective in observing US culture than many of it's home-grown film-makers.Gyllenhal and Ledger have a genuine on-screen chemistry, the latter giving a less forceful  but perhaps more nuanced  performance. Michelle Williams, surprisingly, outdoes both of them, giving a rather moving turn as Ledger's wife. Largely, though, the two principals dominate.It's a good film. Not Lee's best, not by a long shot, and  it's importance in highlighting continuing sexual hypocrisy in US culture aside  I don't think it's worthy of much of the praise heaped upon it in recent months. Still, though, it is an excellent piece of cinema.",Null,1,19,20 February 2006
Spotlight," Superb
","I enjoyed 'Spotlight'. It's a nicely-paced character driven ensemble drama: a slow-burn investigative tale which heaps outrage upon outrage, and builds to an indignant peak before asking the audience a few stern questions about culpability and individual moral responsibility. 'If you tolerate this...', and all that jazz! It also gives Michael Keaton his best role in years, reaps a rare understated but powerful power from Liev Schrieber, and enjoys fine supporting turns from Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdam and John Slattery.A satisfying piece, and Tom McCarthy's best since the excellent 'The Station Agent': the guy knows how to get the best from his cast. Yup, I enjoyed it. Would probably have enjoyed it more, mind you, if I hadn't been distracted – just a little – by an elderly lady two rows in front of me, complaining loudly that it was 'All lies!' every five minutes! I'm sorry, dear lady, if you are offended by the film, but even the Boston Diocese admitted that this stuff went down, pretty much as represented on-screen. Still, even in provoking such a rare and adverse reaction – the lady was asked to leave – 'Spotlight' appears to have been very successful in ENGAGING the attention of its audience. Which is, perhaps, the point.",8,0,2,17 October 2016
Match Point," Allen Loses the Match
","'Match Point' is Woody Allen's most serious film in many years. Like the superb 'Crimes and Misdemeanours' it has at it's heart a cheating husband who seeks to murderously remove the obstacle posed to his prized familial happiness by a pushy mistress. Sadly Jonathan Rhys-Meyers Chris (the poshest working-class-boy-made-good in cinema history) is no Martin Landau, and, though he sweats and pouts in a conspicuously angst-ridden manner in the latter stages of the film, his performance, overall, is seriously wooden - a woodenness which surprisingly extends to many of the supporting characters, which is unusual for Allen. Emily Mortimer as his doting wife and Scarlet Johansson are capable and consistent as, respectively, the love and lust of his life, but Rhys-Meyers' character is not solid enough for them to work with, or for audiences to care about them or him. Given the murderous conclusion to the film this makes for a peculiarly passionless love-triangle. Penelope Wilton and Brian Cox, as Mortimer's parents enjoy much less screen time, but are more convincing as characters than any of the younger leads. John Fortune, Mark Gattis, Ewan Bremner and a host of very fine British actors are given very little to do other than stand around like extras. A shocking waste of potential uncommon in a director who can normally be counted upon to use character actors well.Odd trans-Atlantic clunkers in the script ('I thing you've had one too many G-and-T's, dear!'  the British middle-classes only ever talk like that in US films) aside, the serious tone of the script is maintained until, surprisingly, the final twenty minutes, when we are confronted by a few staggeringly ill-judged comic moment which jar astonishingly with what has gone before  and with the sudden spectral visitations of Chris's victims which follow. The ending is muddled and discordant. A shame  as otherwise it's a creditable addition to the Allen canon, far superior to other recent efforts.",Null,1,4,31 January 2006
Crash," Quite Simply Superb
","Here Sandra Bullock (headlining, though she actually has precious little to do) redeems herself after the atrocity that was 'Miss Congeniality 2', and Matt Dillon gives his best ever performance. Don Cheadle is, as always, excellent.I was initially a little put off by Haggis's approach to characterisation, as, in it's first quarter, the script is really an essay on the angst of liberal white America, but as the film develops archetypes and expectations are both successfully reinforced and undermined  a neat trick, if it can be pulled off, which it is here. In one case  the tale of an immigrant shop owner angered into irresponsibly taking up arms - a whole series of cinematic clichés seem to be converging, only for the rug to be pulled out from the audience at the last moment  the consequence of which almost had me in tears.It's that rarest of Hollywood beasts, an ensemble piece  borrowing a little from the style of Altman's 'Short Cuts' and Anderson's (underrated) 'Magnolia', with story-arcs featuring seemingly unrelated characters having a domino-effect on other tales and characters. It's easy for characterisation to suffer when there's a concerted effort to join-the-dots between plot lines, but for the most part this process is handled with subtlety, and there's not a bad performance in the whole thing.",Null,1,6,19 January 2006
Closer," Thought Provoking But Theatrical
","Adapted from his own play by Patrick Marber, 'Closer' is without a shadow of a doubt the most theatrical film I have seen in a very long time. This isn't entirely a criticism, as it establishes a firm structure upon which plot and characterisation can be built. This skeleton is very leanly fleshed-out: there's a great economy of location, with each scene change advancing the narrative by many months, and we are provided with minimal information as to what has occurred in the lives of the principal characters in the intervening time. This, of course, means that the use of flashbacks  though rare  jars with the general tone and rhythm of the piece. A more cinematic re-structuring of Marber's script may have remedied this, but I fear greater fault lies in the rather pedestrian direction of Mike Nichols.The performances are sound, particularly that of Clive Owen. Although unsubtle and aggressively (though not violently) sexual, there's an endearing earnestness to his character, Dan. Interestingly, he is the only character who is entirely open about his feelings, intentions and desires. He immediately admits to an infidelity, fully prepared to accept the consequences of his stupidity  and is outraged not by Julia Roberts's admission that she has been sleeping with Jude Law but by her deception of him. Marber clearly believes that Dan is a model for the modern honest sexual male  openly acknowledging his pornographic lusts  and this may be true, I suppose. Unfortunately Nichols direction, in spite of Owen's performance, renders Dan as a tragic-comic caricature much of the time.A painfully flat performance by Julia Roberts  another one of Marber's bland women  doesn't help. She has only one outstanding scene, a vicious argument with Owen where she is forced to confess the sordid details of her liaison with Law. Even here, though, it's Owen who steals the moment with the glorious kiss-off line which it would be inappropriate to reprint here  but which I hope, in the course of some future failing relationship, to use.Law is no more annoying than usual, and tries hard to turn on the charm. What could have been an interesting representation of a selfish moral coward verges all too often (and unsuccessfully) toward apologia. Natalie Portman gives a capable turn, too, as Law's stripper girlfriend, Alice. All things to all men - Caesar's Wife in a sequined thong - she becomes an object of fascination for both Law and Owen (and briefly, artistically, for Roberts, though this is not developed). We are told that her wild sexual history was used as inspiration for the former's only novel and that, in her words, the only thing he missed out was 'the truth', but we are, as an audience, told nothing of her past. A sexually obsessed Owen seeks her out, pays for her to strip for him, but becomes frustrated because she'll tell him nothing but the truth about herself and her sexuality  even if he is incapable of recognising it as such. She's cast in a variety of fantasy roles: Law's rescued waif and Owen's whore (Marber's Sphynx, perhaps?), but how far either is accurate is uncertain. Alice, I think, meant to be shaped as much by our own prejudices and preconceptions as she is by Portman's performance. Portman is a strange choice for this role. She is a stunningly beautiful young woman, but  even when garbed in the most minimal pole-dancing garb  oddly nonsexual. She's like Audrey Hepburn in that regard. Perhaps the argument could be proffered for Alice as a modern-day Holly Golightly  both, after all, have mysterious pasts, work in areas of the sex-industry (though unlike Capote's Golightly there is no indication that Alice is, or ever has been, a prostitute) and have rather tortuous emotional relationships with their unsuccessful writer boyfriends.'Closer' is a good play. It's not a bad film, but Nichols surprisingly fails to recognise it's essential un-cinematic nature.",Null,0,1,19 January 2006
Suicide Squad," Just...not good
","'Suicide Squad' is, it has to be said, a bit of a mess. Not the out-and-out car-crash many reviewers claim, to be fair, but a prime example of a film made by committee. 'Hey, guys', you can imagine some Exec ejaculating with cynical glee 'Smart-arse, mis-matched teams with lots of comic one liners and post-modern comic- culture references work for Marvel Studios...let's try THAT!' Enter Will Smith playing...um...Will Smith. Hello, CGI Croc - revelling in his grotesquery. Hey, putting Scarlett Johansson in a leather cat-suit worked...so put Margot Robbie in a ripped t- shirt...no, even better, a ripped WET t-shirt...will be EVEN BETTER! And the '70s soundtrack thing from 'Guardians of the Galaxy'...yeah, we'll do THAT, too. This is, essentially, David Ayer trying to make a DC movie in a Marvel style...without really understanding why those films work. All down to character, Davey. 'Suicide Squad' tries to do too much all at once. Katana, Croc, Boomerang and Enchantress are pretty much undeveloped one-note characters who exist only to make overlong CGI fight sequences just a little bit longer. Viola James' turn as Amanda Waller is nicely nasty, but unlikeable – which is, admittedly, kind of the point of her character, but it makes it difficult for viewers to see her rescue as A Good Thing. What the POINT of Enchantress and her 'machine' was remains a mystery, possibly because Cara Delevigne's performance is so oddly out of step with everything else in the plot. Jay Hernandez tries hard to be the moral centre of the story, but all his effort is wasted: he's essentially ONLY there to give the CGI guys something else to do to pad-out a weak plot. Smith is good, but under-used. A solo outing for his character might be a better option. The big surprise, for me, is Jared Leto. His wild-card Joker is interesting enough – including elements of Ledger and Hamill, but sufficiently divergent from both to remain original, and to be genuinely unpredictable. No obvious chemistry with Robbie, but a character which could – and most likely WILL – be effectively developed in Affleck's forthcoming Batman film.",4,1,4,17 October 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Fan-Boy Treat
","I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this. The jingoism of the first film was gone, replaced with a rather interesting discussion on the moral compromises we are often urged to accept for the sake of peace. Action-fans are provided with the requisite explosions and shoot-outs, too, of course. Borrowing as much from political thrillers as blockbusters raises the quality of the piece. It's very 'talky' by action movie standards, but nicely balances that action with characterisation (in that Chris Evans HAS one, this time, and Me Johansson is more than just kick-ass eye-candy), and hints at a rather darker Avengers flick to come. And we had Batroc ze Leaper. A fan-boy 'Yea!' to that!",7,0,2,15 March 2015
Capote," Classic Hoffman
","Bennett Miller's 'Capote' is an excellent showcase for the talents of the always capable Philip Seymour Hoffman, an actor of astonishing range who has, until now, not enjoyed the credit he deserves. Tracing the decline of the fine (if fickle) faculties of a wit such as Truman Capote was never going to be an easy task, but Hoffman succeeds in making the writer, for all his conceit, self-absorption and moral duplicity, a genuinely sympathetic character  rather than a shadow of the self-caricature the author himself adopted in later life. Katherine Keener (again, an often underrated performer), as Harper Lee (whose importance in the writing of the source novel, 'In Cold Blood', is all too often forgotten, but is honourably credited in Gerald Clarke's study of the writing of that text which, in turn, provided the basis for this screenplay), provides solid, sympathetic support, as indeed do Clifton Collins, the ever reliable Chris Cooper (superbly suited to the role of the stolid Alvin Dewey), and Bruce Greenwood - as Capote's long-suffering partner.My only real criticism of this film  superbly scripted and directed as it is  is that more could have been made of Capote's empathy/infatuation with Perry Smith. His attraction to the murderer is clear enough, as indeed is his growing sense of guilt at lying to and manipulating his subject in order to learn the truth of the Kansas murders which sparked his writing  but the points of parity between the two which helped establish their relationship are largely neglected. Perry's final 'revelation' is stark and, by all accounts, helped unbalance Capote's emotional and creative equilibrium, and greater detail of how the pair connected might have added weight to our understanding of Capote's 'fall'.All in all, though, a thoughtful, sensitive and refreshingly stark approach to what in other hands might have been a run of the mill murder mystery",Null,0,1,2 March 2006
Corpse Bride," Dead Funny
","Visually stunning and suffused with Tim Burton's trademarked comedy-Gothic feel, this is not a bad movie  but had the unrealised potential to be so much better.It doesn't favour favourably in comparison with Burton's other necromantic animation, 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'. Both films feature the musical talents of the director's regular composer, Danny Elfman. In 'Nightmare' Elfman voiced the hero, Jack Skellington, and the movie benefited greatly from his superb light-operatic vocalisations. He produced a superb score for that film. The music in 'Corpse Bride' isn't bad, but it's performed, for the most part, by actors  Depp, Helena Bonham-Carter, Albert Finney and Joanna Lumley  who clearly don't have a musical bone in their bodies. Elfman is featured, as a scat-singing 'Mr Bonejangles', and his 'Skeleton Crew' sequence is the most energetic and tuneful portion of the picture.Depp's English accent is faultless, and he  along with the rest of the cast  resist the temptation to engage in 'cartoon acting'. There are few 'silly voices' and the animated figures are subtly matched with their dramatic vocalisations. Paul Whitehouse's elastic larynx is used to good effect, as he voices half-a-dozen supporting characters.It looks moody and lush, and probably deserves a second viewing just to relish the expressive subtleties of design and characterisation. It's good. It's also much better than Burton and Depp's other offering this year, the overrated and saccharine-sweetened contrivance that was 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'. I liked it. It just deserves to be a much better film than it actually is.",Null,0,2,18 January 2006
American Hustle," Modern American Classic
","'American Hustle' is quite excellent. There is not an ounce of uneccessary dramatic fat on this smart, blackly comic script. The period detail is wonderful (the designers clearly relishing garbing Amy Adams lean frame in all manner of flattering '70s outfits), and even the most superficial and unsympathetic characters are allowed the chance to shine - be it Jenny Lawrence (cast against type as a needy, infuriating but endearing bimbo), Christian Bale (showing just how good he can be with directors who don't tolerate his self-indulgence - and providing a return to form for the former Bat-Boy), Adams, et al. Great soundtrack, too.",8,0,4,15 March 2015
The Aviator," A Worthy Effort, But One Which Could Have Flown Higher
","I enjoyed this film far more than I thought I would. I like Scorcese, particularly his early films where imagination and narrative focus triumphed over budget. The years following 'Cape Fear' I found a little too self consciously concerned with stylistic tricks (and traps) borrowed from the European film-makers the director admired  there are, for example, parts of 'Casino' that are pure Michael Powell  a reaction, no doubt, against critics who cast him as master of grim-'n'-gritty urban realism, and the only successor to Cassavetes as King of the Indies. One thing which has been consistent throughout his career is his determination to capture cultural snap-shots of Americana  from the discordant Europeaniism of Wharton's 'Age of Innocence' and the chaos of 'Gangs of New York', through the re-invention of the first great US cinematic innovation, the mob-movie, to the contemporary union of dysfunctional family and celluloid-sociopathy, 'Cape Fear'. In a sense all of his films are concerned with the American cultural obsession with identity: Travis Bickle reinvents himself, the city itself is shaped by ethnic divisions in 'Gangs', etc.. In some respects it's surprising that it took him so long to turn his eye upon the life of Howard Hughes.There are (conscious, I think) references a-plenty to 'Citizen Kane' as Marty tries to make sense of the obsessive-compulsive genius and unwilling celebrity. Hardly surprising given the subject matter. Like Kane Hughes dominates those around him, but is capable of great kindness in their defence, and like Kane his greatest repulsion is the notion of personal hypocrisy. Leonardo DiCaprio gives what I believe to be his best performance, turning in a nicely nuanced disturbing and sympathetic turn as the hero. I've known a few obsessive-compulsives in my time and his performance hits just the right note: we can see why others believed him a freak or a monster, but this understanding is undercut by sympathy for his schizophrenia. In some scenes the overriding feeling is of watching him crash-and burn, both emotionally and literally.Cate Blanchet's turn as Kathering Hepburn is more problematic. It's astonishingly stilted, but this is a consequence more than anything else of the character being one of the most imitated icons of Hollywood's Golden Age: Katie was astonishingly stilted. Once the myriad of mannerisms settle it's a fine performance  though not, perhaps, one worthy of a Best Supporting Actress gong. Kate Beckinsale has an easier job as Ava Gardner, more famous at the time, but less lastingly memorable as an icon (how many Ava Gardner films can you think of, off hand?). She gets to fluff around in furs looking exotic.John C. Reilly, as Hughes business manager, is excellent, as always. If someone can find a flick that the bulldog-faced bloke isn't good in I'll be most surprised. He's proof that 'character-actor' is still a valid job description. Alec Baldwin (who, it seems, has been at the pies again) is suitably oily as the Pan-Am CEO.Scene setting and staging is kept surprisingly simple, particularly given Mr S's predilection of late for tricksy scene-segues and edits, and he spares the CGI gimmicks until the big action scenes when they can be of most effect. All in all it's no 'Citizen Kane', but it will stand, I believe as a sympathetic but not entirely uncritical tribute to an American Icon  and a reminder of precisely why he was an icon, rather than the twitching freak of more recent memory.",Null,0,1,19 January 2006
The Revenant," Gruelling
","'The Revenant' is visually stunning. Looks fantastic, and both landscape and action scenes are handled with genuinely cinematic flair. Unfortunately, the narrative doesn't do anything or go anywhere unexpected. Our relentless revenger, Mr DiCaprio, starts off gnarled and surly, and ends the same way. Similarly, Tom Hardy's villain is clearly an irredeemable villain from his first grumblesome grunt. The nearest we get to character development comes through the portrayal of the young Captain in charge of the trapping exhibition - and his fate, too, is telegraphed. Leo is good, as is Hardy, but they are caricatures - I've seen both give many much more complex and nuanced performances, and don't really see why THIS revenger-greatest-hits should get them so many gong nominations. It's a commonplace revenge flick with Art-house sensibilities.",7,0,2,17 October 2016
The Hills Have Eyes," Predictably Gory
","I have never seen the original version of 'The Hills Have Eyes', so I'm in no position to comment on the loyalty, or otherwise, of the script and characterisation of the current screen incarnation, directed by Alexandre Aja.As part of the larger family-in-distress-from-bloodthirsty-hicks sub-genre, though, it's traditional fare. The cock-sure and homely are quickly offed, the spoilt blonde quickly becomes the lust-object of the aggressors, and the downtrodden liberal hero embraces brutality in order to protect what he loves. The mutant miners, too, as the slavering, gibbering, malformed gimps we have come to expect. That said, these are all tried and tested elements of the genre, so perhaps it would be redundant to complain that they are clichés.To it's credit, despite the occasional lapses into astonishing improbability  the seemingly indestructible family pet who repeatedly arrives to save the day just in the nick of time, and the feckless teens who develop MacGuyver-type tricks and traps to counter attacks of their foes  it does have a certain unpredictability. There are violent set-pieces, of course, but most of these seem to emerge out of what passes for a plot  rather than from a need to see someone eviscerated according to a set cinematic schedule. How much this structure is borrowed from the original, or is a refinement of the same, I cannot say.What really lets the film down is a lack of decent characterisation. We are not invited to sympathise with them  other than, in the most general terms, the unfortunate circumstance of being butchered by mutants  so, ultimately, we have no emotional investment in caring who lives or dies.In the final frames we see the same electrical binocular view of our heroes as in earlier scenes, indicating, of course, that the defeated mutants are not their only threatand that a franchise is on the way.Mildly diverting, if predictable, gore-filled twaddle.",Null,2,3,22 March 2006
Jarhead," War. What is it good for?
","'Jarhead', the latest offering from 'American Beauty' director Sam Mendes is an odd compote. In part it tries to emulate Altman's 'MASH', emphasising the juvenile testosterone fuelled antics of a close-knit group of servicemen in combat, and in the long days and weeks of tedium which occupy most of their times. Oddly - save for a few almost throwaway observations on the reasons for baby-sitting the oil-fields of Said - politics is pretty much kept out of the picture. This is a problem. How can a film set during the first Gulf War, where the indigenous populations of the occupied or protected territories are routinely referred to as 'Rag Heads', be considered without a political context? No doubt this reluctance to weigh his characters down with conflict-specific political baggage is intended to emphasise the universality of the old adage that War Is Hell, but without this context the characters become little more than military-movie archetypes: the sensitive but patriotic hero who discovers the army isn't what he thought it would be, the weedy grunt, the badass career soldier, the redneck, etc., etc.. This is a shame, as there are some very good performances here. Jake Gyllenhaal is an engaging leading man, bringing to mind, at times, a young Alan Arkin in 'Catch 22', and Peter Sarksgaard is excellently focused (if, as ever, slightly creepy) as his Scout Sniper partner. They are, however, working with an undemanding script. It's very stylish and impressively filmed  but it lacks the intensity of the (oft referenced) 'Apocalypse Now', the surreal nightmarish quality of 'Catch 22', or the bittersweet satire of 'MASH'. A good film which descends all-too-suddenly into sentiment in it's final act, determined to make a point  but not sure what point it wants to make.",Null,0,1,18 January 2006
Captain America: Civil War," A bit of a toy advert
","It's big, it's bold, and it's brassy. It has the same sassy, one- liner heavy scripting which have become integral to the cinematic Marvel Universe. It allows Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr to face off and explore the issues of duty, conscience and culpability which underpin their characters. In that regard it is not unlike 'Batman Vs Superman'. LIKE the recent DC flick, it would be far better - dramatically speaking - if the writers thinned-out-the-herd and dispensed with the franchise-fodder padding. The Black Widow, Bucky, Rhodey, T'Challa and The Falcon serve a dramatic purpose. Ant-Man, Hawkeye and other Avengers, less so - and Spidey's appearance seems like a heavy- handed way of re-booting a franchise the studio has lost faith in.It's not a bad film, and it has a lot to tickle the fan-boys' funny bones - the Scarlet Witch/Vision romance, for example - but it could have been tighter and more satisfying if the padding and some of the humour had been dropped - much as :Batman Vs Superman' could have been improved if it wasn't so damned earnest.Most unforgivably, it's an action sequel which demands that the viewer be familiar with the major story-arcs of the Captain America, Iron Man and Avengers franchises. If you don't know Ant-Man from his solo flick, fine - but the heavy-handed Infinity Gem references are tangential to the Cap story...they bog things down, when letting Bob and Chris growl at one another (something they do well) would serve the story better.The influence of The House of Mouse is clear - there being huge sections of the flick which should have 'TOYS AND ACTION FIGURES AVAILABLE FROM THE Disney STORE' subtitled, throughout. I shall re-watch 'The Winter Soldier', tonight - a far more satisfying drama.Oh, and the high point of the screening I saw had nothing to do with what was on screen - as a five-year-old in his Cap outfit marched boldly into the auditorium and ordered the audience to be 'At ease!' When a dozen or so of us saluted back and said 'Aye, Captain!' he burst into a fit of the giggles. Ha!",6,1,4,17 October 2016
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Too Much Padding
","The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug. Like 'An Unexpected Journey' is's a flabby film that doesn't care a great deal about character. It#'s very pretty (especially Evangelne Lilly), but crow barring so much Middle Earth canon from other tales and, less forgivably, made up toss that is so alien to Tolkien as to be laughable, makes for a leaden and sloppy narrative, whose only concession to pace seems to be having a CGI action sequence crammed in every twenty minutes to keep the audience awake. Cumberbatch's serpentine voice-work as Smaug is the only redeeming feature. They say every good film has a beginning, a middle and an end. This is ALL middle.",4,3,7,15 March 2015
Batman Begins," Holy Cow! A Decent Bat-Movie!
","Christopher Nolan had a big problem with 'Batman Begins'. Eight years on from Joel Schumacher's Day-Glo camp-fest, 'Batman and Robin', with it's unfortunate echoes of the 1960s TV series, and sixteen years on from Tim Burton's muddled-but-stylish Gothic sprawl, he had the onerous task of dispelling public perceptions of his protagonist based on his earlier screen incarnations.He manages it, largely. I had fears  mostly founded on the involvement of 'Blade' screenwriter David Goyer, famed for unnecessary tinkering with long established characters in page-to-screen transitions  that the film would be visually stunning, but lack substance. Quite the opposite is true, at least in the movie's first half. If anything the most interesting scenes are those in which no capes, cowls, gadgets or gizmos are present. In part I think this can be put down to Nolan, whose choice of source material is telling. He was, apparently, intrigued by Darren Aronofsky's aborted attempt to bring Frank Miller's 'Batman: Year One' (arguably the last good thing he wrote) to the screen, used key elements of that origin-story in developing his script. Bale's performance is excellent. We knew from 'American Psycho' and 'the Machinist' that he was adept at exploring the dark side of his characters' natures, and his switching between the frivolous, dandified public Bruce Wayne and his true nature are disturbingly convincing  a million miles from George Clooney's avuncular turn in the last movie.The supporting actors are splendid, particularly Gary Oldman as the idealistic young Jim Gordon, Tom Wilkinson as Mob boss Carmine Falcone and Michael Caine as faithful retainer Alfred Pennyworth. There's a good chemistry on-screen between Caine and Bale, establishing the only real relationship in young Wayne's life. Morgan Freeman is excellent, and Linus Roach, as Thomas Wayne, manages to give a sensitive, pointed performance, despite his having about five-minutes screen-time. Ken Watanabe as Ra's al Ghul (my favourite Bat-baddie in the funny-papers) has a great natural presence and authority on screen, but is given very little to do. Cillian Murphy, less imposing as Jonathan Crane, The Scarecrow, is, on the other hand, over used- but then I've never been particularly impressed by Murphy in anything. Katie Holmes is pretty, but serves little real purpose. Liam Neeson's Henri Ducard is disappointingly uneven - his calm, measured sensei in the first half, is hardly consistent with his near-deranged zealot in the second.The involvement of Goyer means, of course, that the finale will be a hurried, muddled affair. As was the case with the 'Blade' movies he feels compelled, here, to end on a bang. Thus, in the final reel we are heading toward a threat of city-wide destruction which Schumacher would have been proud of, when a more intimate hero/villain confrontation would have been more in keeping with the general tone of the film.Doyer tinkers a-plenty, but, safe for the fireworks in the finale, most of his tweakings of established 'mythology' are forgivable.Violence is well handled. It's neither stylised nor glamorised. Most action scenes are filmed in shadow or in extreme close up, emphasising the suddenness of the Bat's actions, and establishing him as a fearful creature of the night.Aaronovsky's intention of filming 'Batman: Year One' would, I think, have worked much better, but this is still an effective and (moderately) intelligent actioner. The sinister spectre of Schumacher has been exorcisedand that, for Bat-fans, is the important thing.",Null,0,1,19 January 2006
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Grand, Indeed!
","I like Mr Anderson. He's quirky. He's funny. He's absurd. He has a superb eye for the use of location and landscape...all qualities the likes of Terry Gilliam, also a social absurdist in his way, appears to have drowned in his interminable visual onanism, in recent years! Anderson also - and this has always been his great strength - to write to the unexpected strengths of his cast. Ralph Feinnes and Tony Revoluri are gloriously funny as the effete, mannered M. Gustave and his Bellhop sidekick, Zero. Willem Dafoe a comically snarling baddie and Adrian Brody similarly vile. There are cameos a-plenty from Anderson stalwarts, slapstick abounds, but however outrageous events become, the script and the characters are always at the forefront. Very good.",8,0,3,15 March 2015
It Follows," Missed Opportunity
","'It Follows' is frustrating in ways it is difficult to explain without giving away the plot. Suffice to say it takes the connection between Sex & Death in American teen-centred horror movies to a far more literal end than usual. Writer-Director David Robert Mitchell borrows a lot from '80s and early '90s – Carpenter's over-use of suburban steadi-cam and Lynch's love of the perfectly framed symmetrical establishing-shot and overlong extreme close-up, with occasional Cronenberg-like fascination in incidental details. The soundtrack – a smattering of discordant synthesized chords, whines and pops – is distinctly retro: retro Carpenter at his least musically imaginative. To its credit, it takes its time, establishing tension gradually, rather than leaping from one bloody set-piece to another in rapid succession, and there are occasional sparks of visual inventiveness. A shame, then, that so much of the cinematography is derivative. . It's trying to do something interesting with the trope of the relentless inhuman predator, but largely fails. Partly this because it is too mainstream for the art- house crowd and too arty for the multiplex (those people want more gore). The who, why and what of the predator are completely avoided, which adds to the tension and anxiety of the characters – of whom only Maika Monroe, the female lead, seems emotionally invested in proceedings – but makes the internal-logic of the horror franchise (and you just KNOW this is going to be a franchise) difficult to fathom.",5,5,47,15 March 2015
Frozen," Fun..Especially for The Disney Store
","I approached Disney's 'Frozen' with a certain trepidation, and many people whose opinion I respect have praised it as a radical revamp of the studio's approach to female representation. Hmmm. Well, it's not QUITE that. The requisite Disney princess gets her guy and, in keeping with rom-com tradition, the whole mis-matched couple thing is explored. That's not to say there are no surprises. The interesting tweak to the tale - VERY loosely based on Andersen's 'The Snow Queen' - is providing us with two Princesses, and two classic male-shirt archetypes...so the path toward self-empowerment and self determination is rather less clear-cut than the traditional Disney model. What makes this different from most such tales is not just that the female characters HAVE choices, but that the audience does, also, in determining which whom their sympathies should lie. The character designs, too, combine classic Disney styling with more modern fashion (be warned, parents, lots and lots of little girls are going to want Anna and Elsa toys from The Disney Store, this and every Christmas to come), the Trolls are delightful, and the purplish Sven the reindeer steals the show. Nice voice-work from the cast, particularly Kirsten Bell and the redoubtable Alan Tudyk (Wash now seems to be the go-to-guy for quirky cartoon baddies). My only real criticism would be that there are a few too many songs, the weakness of which is reinforced by having a genuinely memorable better of a song, the authentic 'Let It Go' at the heart of the narrative. While not exactly the radical reinvention of sexual like- minded it's been hyped as...it's still rather healthier an approach to the Princesses than we've seen of late from the House of Mouse ('Brave''s Merida aside, that is - she's Scottish, and we expect her to be troublesome!)",6,2,6,15 March 2015
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," A Pleasant Surprise
","I had serious reservations about 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty'. I love the Thurber short story, and Danny Kaye's gloriously disloyal 1947 rendering of the tale on the big screen in equal measure - but find Ben Stiller too mannered a comic actor, in recent years, to be watchable. Too many trademark ticks and tricks in his emotional repertoire. While largely disregarding Thurber (and Kaye, though there a number of enjoyably OTT fantasy sequences - only one of which, a hokey Benjamin Button skit, seems redundant), I have to say that I was greatly impressed by this film. It is, in point of fact, one of the most beautiful pieces of cinema I've seen in a long time - the audience, like Mitty, discovering the glories of the world outside his glum, humdrum existence, a world he'd only witnessed in miniature, vicariously - and the landscapes of Greenland, Iceland and even New York are quite gloriously rendered (kudos to DP Stuart Dryburgh). Stiller's direction is confident, and the performances - including his own - are measured, restrained and all the more effective and affecting for that. I hate the term, but this is, at heart, a 'Feel-good' movie - and a thoughtful one, at that.",8,4,8,15 March 2015
The Incredibles," Up Up And Away
","Hugely enjoyable. Now, as I am a Class A certifiable dyed-in-the-wool comic-book geek who wears his ceremonial anorak with pride, this should come as no surprise. The Geek in me appreciates the reverential nods, in plot and characterisation, to the 1960s Lee & Kirby run of 'The Fantastic Four', Alan Moore's 'Watchmen' and 'Miracleman' and Brian Michael Bendis's 'Powers', but these are secondary to a sharp, funny script, well rounded sympathetic characters. Kids will love it, as there's plenty of colour action and slapstick, but the film is knowingly aimed at a more mature audience: the heroes are a dysfunctional family with genuine problems and aspirations. That they wear spandex and fight giant robots is just an added bonus.That 'The Incredibles' should work on so many elements should also be no surprise. director and writer Brad Bird was also responsible for the splendid and underrated 'The Iron Giant', based (albeit loosely) on Ted Hughes 'The Iron Man'. Rent this film. Now. It has more heart than a hundred cynical 'Shreks'. Also  and this is most odd in a mainstream studio animation  Bird is listed in the credits as the sole scriptwriter. When was the last time you saw an animated studio movie without half a dozen, or more, names on script? 'The Incredibles' is one man's vision, not a compote of committee-led compromise. It works.",Null,0,1,19 January 2006
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Awkward Middle-Film in (Inevitable) Trilogy
","'Amazing Spider-Man 2' was less satisfying than its predecessor, as many of the action sequences looked and felt like RPG graphics. That said, Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy was rather better fleshed-out than in the original movie. That she is the most engaging character in the film is unfortunate as - as any comic geek knows - as soon as she and Pete chat atop the George Washington Bridge, things will not be ending in hugs and puppies. Andrew Garfield is still mumbling too much, and Chris Cooper is wasted on such a small role, and his grimmacing heir is too clearly a nut from his first appearance to be anything other than a caricature. The Parker family back-story is nicely expanded (in expectation of a big reveal in Part 3, I'm betting), but everything else seems rushed.",4,1,7,15 March 2015
Million Dollar Baby," Hits The Spot
","With a face seemingly hewn from Mount Rushmore, Clint Eastwood is as much part of the iconic landscape of American cinema as the titular letters on the Hollywood hills. Unlike that signpost his appeal is rather more than superficial. There are few more successful reinventions in tinsel-town. It could be argued, indeed, that as a producer and director he is far more interesting than he ever was as an action-hero leading man. I suppose this shouldn't be surprising, as his earliest directorial effort, 1971's 'Play Misty For Me', made when he was one of the most bankable stars in the world, is (though overlong) an effective, intelligent and genuinely unsettling thriller  nicely paced and relying on a carefully crafted suspense rather than standard shock-tactics. It's easy to forget just how many films he has directed  twenty four in all  ranging from run-of-the-mill studio fare like 'The Eiger Sanction', 'The Outlaw Josey Wales' and 'Sudden Impact' to more ambitious and intellectually engaging offerings like 'White Hunter, Black Heart', 'Unforgiven', 'Bird' and the splendid 'Mystic River' (one of my favourite films of 2003). Oddly, given that two of those films have won 'Best Film' and 'Best Director', we still think of him principally as an actor (in which field, one should also note, he has improved considerably in later life). In maturity he's shown that he has something to say. Not only that, he says it with force and subtlety. Given his own oft-expressed right-wing sentiments his filmic approach to issues of personal ethics (as opposed to public morality) is refreshingly ambiguous: his characters' opinions, dilemmas and life-choices are their own to make, rather than being determined by middle-American public consensus. In 'Million Dollar Baby' Eastwood eschews the bright lights of the ring for a muted palette of shadowy greys and browns, and this carefully toned visual approach extends to the plot and performances. We are told just enough about the characters to care about them, and are shown just enough in the boxing ring to capture the energy and determination of his principal players. As in 'Mystic River' his interest seems to dwell more on the cause and consequence of a particular action than the action itself.This is nowhere better exemplified than in the presence of Morgan Freeman. Freeman actually does very little  his character existing on the fringes of the main events of the film - but does it superbly well, his subtle understatement more effectively commanding the camera (and the emotions of the audience) than the histrionics of any number of current leading men. Eastwood has the same emotional authority. Hilary Swank is also quite excellent. I have yet to be disappointed by her  even in studio toss like the abominable actioner 'The Core'. Her turn in 'Boys Don't Cry' was astonishingly instinctive and direct, and the near disillusionment of her earnest, optimistic policewoman in 'Insomnia' was utterly convincing. Here one cannot help to be swept up and carried off in the wake of her character's indefatigability. Obviously, given the nature of her role, her performance is by far the most physical in the movie, but she has learned from her co-stars that less-is-more, that more sincere emotion can be conveyed by what chooses not to do on screen. Subtle and deceptively complex. .",Null,1,2,19 January 2006
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," No Luck Needed...A Class Act
","How much you admire George Clooney's 'Good Night and Good Luck' probably depends on your politics. Those on the far right, particularly those who have emerged in recent years as apologists for the 'honourable intent' of Senator McCarthy, will no doubt dismiss it as liberal propaganda. Perhaps so. If it is propaganda, though, I think it's more in reaction against the 'my Country, right or wrong' mentality of so many mainstream newsmen and commentators, unwilling (or afraid) to be branded as 'unpatriotic' by criticising the current US administration. David Puttnam hailed this, at the recent BAFTA awards, as one of the most important movies of recent years, and I think he might just have a point.The ensemble cast are simply superb, from the sombre, authoritative David Strathairn as Edward R. Murrow, and Clooney as his bullish editor, to smaller, more nuanced turns by the likes of Jeff Daniels, Robert Downey, Frank Langella and Ray Wise  affecting as the tragic news anchor Don Hollanbeck. Strathairn and Clooney dominate, but it is important to note that theirs are simply the most prominent amongst a host of well observed, impeccably delivered performances. Hard to believe that this is not the work of a more experienced director.The frenetic pace of live broadcast journalism is well captured, as, indeed, is the genuine sense of terror and paranoia during this undistinguished political era. Good use is made, too, of stock footage from the CBS archives, which  inter-cut with dramatised or scripted segments, add greatly to the authenticity of the film, and the arguments of it's protagonists. An important and politically prescient film.",Null,2,5,20 February 2006
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Fanboy Nirvana (Spoilers)
","If Whedon's films have a fault it is that he tries just a little too hard to give his audience more bang for their buck. Ordinarily, this wouldn't be a major problem: indeed in episodic TV drama it is an advantage. Characters are fully-rounded and developed. The Fanboys (and girls) have their appetites for their favourite heroes fully sated. In a self-contained feature, though, this can occasionally be a burden.I liked 'Age of Ultron'. I'm a comic-geek and a film-buff, and I think the integration of supporting characters from the 'Thor', 'Captain America' and 'Iron Man' franchises (some of whom are going to become more prominent as Downey and Renner explore other projects) was amusing. The major achievement of the first 'Avengers'movie it that it made these franchises cohesive. But if the reaction of some of the viewers grumbling in the aisles at my screening are anything to go by, it can also make for an over-busy narrative for the uninitiated.The big guns are all good. Downey and Hemsworth dominate, but everyone gets their chance to shine (and quip). Spader's voice work as Ultron is maybe just a little arch, but it suits the tone of the movie, and Bettany's Vision provides an interesting counterpoint to all the hysteria. The dialogue is great: though some of the one- liners were verging on being just too-cute...almost a parody of a Whedon script. But busier.The movie's biggest redeeming feature is clearly Whedon's love for his characters, and that's what stops this being just another splashy special-effects flick...but it's greatest failing is that characters, relationships and the group dynamic are oddly left hanging...at least until the NEXT episode.",Null,0,3,28 April 2015
Pride & Prejudice," Picture Perfect Period Pap
","Much to my surprise 'Pride and Prejudice' is really rather enjoyable. Keira Knightly makes a suitably petulant Elizabeth Bennett, Matthew Macfadyen a bemusedly surly Mr Darcy, and the supporting players are generally very good. Even ten years on this version has been compared constantly with the 1995 Andrew Davies BBC adaptation, unfavourably in most cases. I think this is a little unfair. Jennifer Ehle was too old for the part of Elizabeth by a good ten years, and Colin Firth's Darcy delivered surly by the bucketful, but lacked the underlying sense of social awkwardness which makes the character ultimately sympathetic, and Davies, typically, tweaked the plot on more than one occasion to 'improve' (sic) on the plot. There are quite a few liberties taken in the current film adaptation, of course, but these appear to narrative abridgements and occasional simplifications of Jane Austen's dialogue, and, I have to say, there are no real linguistic clunkers to offend fans of classic lit. Actually a few anachronistic contractions, etc., are fine by me. If they were to occur in a Readers Digest abridged edition I'd be irritated, as this would go against the intention of the author  this stuff is supposed to be read, after all. Film is different  sometimes a single silent shot says more than ten pages of dialogue. By resisting the temptation to incorporate every one of Ms Austen's witticisms and aphorisms, and relying on character the script seems more organic than Mr D's: Austen's jokes and jibes are great on paper, but as dialogue simply make characters seem more snide and self-satisfied than is really required. The sense and sentiment of the original is retained, which is the important thing. The Bennett sisters are nicely  if fleetingly  drawn (even poor earnest Mary, normally neglected in adaptations), and Brenda Blethyn, 'though not the glorious comic grotesque Alison Steadman created for the BBC version, is allowed to flap and flutter her head off. Donald Sutherland is good, too, as Mr Bennett, and my only real complaint in this adaptation is that more time isn't given to the relationship between Elizabeth and her father. Their exchanges in the novel are, understandably, pace-killers for the scriptwriter, and I can understand why they are simplified or excised here  but, that said, they are really rather nice. Knightly and Sutherland work well together, and it's a pity they weren't allowed to do more. No doubt the staggering inappropriateness of her casting as Domino Harvey (reviewed yesterday) was designed to steer wee Keira away from English Rose/Period Drama Queen stereotyping. If this is anything to go by, then she should stick with that archetype for a tad longer: a few good, solidly written stereotypes might turn her into a decent actress.",Null,0,2,18 January 2006
National Treasure," A Simple Old Fashioned Adventure
","A very silly film which, for all it's many faults, is a refreshing antidote to the overrated (and underwritten) 'Da Vinci Code'. It covers much the same territory  Templar/Masonic conspiracies, bizarre and convoluted ciphers concealed within buildings and artworks, hidden treasures, yada-yada-yada  but does so sure in the knowledge that it's a flashy, shiny easily disposable piece of toss.All of the key elements of the Templar Treasure Myth (TTM) are in evidence, from the mysterious cargo of the lost SS Charlotte, the coded messages sent between the fifty five Masons who wrote the US Declaration of Independence, and even oblique references to the Nova Scotia 'Money Pit' beneath which the treasure was said to have been hidden (though for reasons of dramatic unity this is moved to Philadelphia). The film is nonsense from start to finish, but is fun  unlike Dan Brown's dreary by-the-numbers 'thriller'.",Null,1,2,19 January 2006
Inside Man," Mainstream Triumph for Lee
","Excellent. At long last an intelligent caper movie with a genuine sense of mystery and characters you can give damn about.This is Spike Lee's most mainstream film to date, but, thankfully, it is one in which his passion for personal politics  for the personal and cultural dynamic of urban identity  is not ignored or sidelined. The issue of personal responsibility (or perhaps culpability might be a more appropriate term) is, as ever, right at the heart of the film.Denzel Washington is splendidly cast as the hostage-negotiator detective caught between the respective machinations of the city's hierarchy, as they protect the interests of a notable citizen, and the enigmatic hostage takers in a Manhattan bank. There are certain aspects of the plot  the nature of the secret Christopher Plummer's aged banker wishes to conceal, amongst them  which are a little too well-telegraphed, but there are enough surprises to keep even the most die-hard aficionado of the caper-genre puzzling over the plot until the last few minutes.There are a few too many zoom-to-camera character shots  which seem out of place  but the rest of the film is so consistently good these are easily forgiven.Clive Owen redeems himself after the atrocious 'Derailed', and Jodie Foster is highly effective in her most unsympathetic role to-date, as the high-class 'fixer' brought in by Plummer to protect his interests (memorably congratulated by the Mayor of New York for being a 'magnificent c***'). Chewetal Ejiofor and Willem Dafoe provide excellent support for the always-watchable Washingtonwho steals the film. That said, like all good caper flicks, it's an ensemble piece.Music also enhances proceedings, with a score by Terry Blanchard which - though it sounds like every other score by John Barry  enhances the old fashioned sense of cinematic drama which permeates this movie.",Null,1,3,29 March 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Dire
","This is a very revealing film. It doesn't have anything new, original or particularly interesting about the Catholic church, Christianity or the nature of belief, but it speaks volumes about the source novel. I didn't like 'The DaVinci Code' as a piece of prose: I think Dan Brown is a lazy, derivative, plodder of a writer. I did think, however, that it might make a decent film  a medium where cliché, preposterous serendipitous co-incidence and an emphasis on spectacle rather than substance is often an advantage.It isn't. This doggedly loyal adaptation simply highlights the writer's creative deficiencies. The dialogue is leaden, loaded with unnecessarily heavy-handed hints at profundity and significance  ironing the much touted plot twists and revelations flat. The nature of Audrey Tautou's character (of which more later) is so lumpenly telegraphed that even those who had not read the book (lucky them) would guess at it after the first half hour. There is no real attempt at characterisation, as dialogue is so heavy in exposition that personality and psychology don't get a look-in. Hanks and Tautou stagger through the film looking as though they've been stunned  reading the novel had the same effect on my mind, though in my case I was near-insensible at the thought that this drivel is currently the best-selling novel in the English language. Ian McKellern fares a little better, enjoying the few comic lines the wearily dry script is graced with, but even he is lumbered with a tired archetype. The normally excellent Bettany and Molina are just plain awful.These faults are, essentially, those of the source text. Director Ron Howard must share some blame, however, for allowing the pace of what is essentially a chase-movie to sag so often, and using the wide variety of artworks and historic buildings featured so poorly. This could  for all it's lack of narrative drive  have been a beautiful film. It isn't. At best, visually, it's unremarkable. It's a controversial book, undeservedly so, as it has nothing new to say and what it does have to say is put poorly, so it is possible that Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsmith  both capable of excellent work - have chosen to stuck so closely to Brown's book in order to deflect criticism as to it's content. If this is the case, then they are cowards. If it is not, then there is little excuse for this being such a poor film.",Null,2,6,25 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Harry Loses Much Of His Charm
","Mike Newell's attempt to darken the tone of the Harry Potter franchise in 'Goblet of Fire' is welcome. Out go a number of the more tricksy background CGI embellishments, and a greater attempt is made to develop Harry's character. The opening is genuinely creepy, and there are more opportunities for Daniel Radcliffe to interact with, rather than react to, other performers. Ralph Feinnes as Voldermort is gleefully grim, works well with the young lead, and it would have been nice to see more of him. Newell references many a horror movie to good effect, but this, essentially, is where the film falters: the characters and the plot just aren't distinct enough to penetrate the darkness, and the inevitable lesson-learned  about the finality of death  is somewhat undermined by Harry having just survived his latest encounter with Lord V through the intervention of his long-dead parents (not to mention an odd bathroom encounter with the increasingly randy  disturbingly so as wee Danny's 16 and Shirley Henderson is 37  Moaning Myrtle. Radcliffe is a more confident presence than in previous ventures, but he doesn't have sufficient presence to carry the film. All in all a game attempt at redeveloping the franchise, and occasionally visually interesting  but let down by an insubstantial script and characters.",Null,0,1,18 January 2006
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," An Interesting Take on Modern Middle-American Family Values
","Having earned his action-adventure spurs helming 'The Bourne Identity', and it's serving as Producer on it's sequel, the excellent 'The Bourne Supremacy', it's no surprise that Doug Liman should deliver a focused, energetic product in 'Mr & Mrs Smith'. Like the Hitchcock flick from which it borrows it's title (and the names of a fair number of supporting characters  'though somehow I don't think this is supposed to be a remake of Hitch's only screwball comedy), this is a vehicle which eschews the dark side, and establishes itself as a romantic-comedy early on. It lacks the pitch-black comedy of it's nearest cinematic relation, John Houston's 'Prizzi's Honour', or the emotional subtlety of George Armitage's 'Grosse Point Blank', but it's an engaging-enough romp for all that. Mind you, the words are by Simon Kinberg  previously a script-doctor on such stellar catastrophes as 'Elektra' and 'Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle'  so a lack of subtlety is hardly a great surprise. The plot is a no-brainer. A bored young couple discover that they are assassins working for rival agencies when each is assigned the task of killing the other. In their increasingly manic attempts to off each other they discover the true love lurking beneath the lies. Hmmm. 'True Lies' and 'War of the Roses' join the crib-sheet. That much is in the trailer. There's really little new, here: this is almost an anti-Bourne, the characters are amoral and mercenary and the action is provided in a succession of gleefully destructive set pieces, rather than arising out of plot-driven necessity. That said, the Smith's boredom when placed amongst their suburban neighbours (killers are not social animals), and the final scenes  in which that great shrine of American consumerism, the Department Store, is decimated by the newly reconciled spouses  could be read as a critique (of sorts) of the trappings of domestic 'bliss'. It's a star-vehicle, and one which delivers exactly what we expect. Brad Pitt wears a lot of smart-but-casual gear, takes his shirt off regularly, and pouts in a manner likely to please many a young lady in the audience. For the boys, Angelina Jolie is back in Lara Croft mode, strutting her stylishly sexy stuff in Prada and PVC. She also pouts a great deal. Poor Brad's pales in comparison. Much the better actor of the pair, and possessed of rather more natural screen-presence than Pitt, it's notable that she's given rather less screen-time, but there is a chemistry between the leads, and neither Liman allows neither to dominate the movie in it's totality. They work very well together.It's not a bad movie, and it has some genuinely funny moments. I liked it far more than I thought I would. Given Liman's track-record, though, it's a slight shame that the opportunity wasn't taken to make a more satiric film.",Null,0,3,19 January 2006
War of the Worlds," A Big (Non-Martian) Mess
","This owes so little to the stated source-novel that the use of the title is surprising. As we would expect from Spielberg, it's visually stunning, but it resorts to so many other expected Spielberg clichés that these images are subsumed in a sea of schmaltz. Spielberg films either involve a child of separated parents or a man who has lost (or is in the process of losing) his family. The military and authority figures in general, are either self-serving or inept. Technology is rarely to be trusted. All this is here, along with the cheesiest sentimental ending the film-maker has manufactured in many years.Ultimately this film sinks because of casting. Dakota Fanning  who gave DeNiro a run for his money, recently, and is the favoured child-actor-in-peril for supernatural or sci-fi thrillers (she was the best thing in Spielberg's TV venture, 'Taken')  is good, but her character is not allowed to develop. This is something of an oddity for Mr S. who is usually very good in dealing with kids. Justin Chatwin is plain annoying, and I don't think I was alone in hoping against hope that his character was hit by a heat-ray when he vanishes part-way through the film. Sadly, though, he survives  hey this in a Spielberg movie. The casting of Tom Cruise as a gutsy but feckless blue-collar divorcée dad is preposterous. Noel Coward would be marginally more convincing in such a role. Even Tom Hanks, Spielberg's other regular leading man these days, by virtue of his pot-belly and potato face would have been better in the role. Tim Robbins, as a deranged paramedic, gives the best and most layered performance in the film  despite having little more than ten minutes screen-time.This is, by far, the most violent Spielberg film I've ever seen, and is, clearly, visually informed by TV coverage of the Twin Towers  with grey faced crowds, swamped in dust and debris. Indeed the destruction of New Jersey is so unremitting that the best word to describe this film might well be 'relentless'.",Null,1,3,19 January 2006
12 Years a Slave," Great Cast
","12 Years A Slave', based upon Solomon Northup's 1853 autobiography is, as the subject matter would suggest - a freeborn black-man being kidnapped and sold into bondage as a 'Georgia Runaway - pretty grim. The underrated Chiwetel Ejiofor conveys the controlled fury of the hero as he struggles to survive in a society where he is solely considered a commodity. The only problem with the narrative - and this is something I first noticed when I first read the book, in my teens - is that many of the white characters seem like caricatures of Southern cruelty and disdain. This is, of course, an interesting inversion of the depiction of black characters in the literature of the day. It is to the credit of many of the supporting cast that they come convincingly to life. Benedict Comberbatch's Mr Ford is a study in kindness blighted by moral cowardice, and the paranoia and psychosis of Michael Fassbinder's Edwin Epps is a genuinely unsettling, and all too believable, real-life monster. A nicely understated and utterly heartbreaking performance by Lupita Nyong'o, as the molested slave Patsey, is worth the ticket price, alone. Well worth a look.",6,1,3,15 March 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Exhausing, But Engaging - Despite A Repugnant Protagonist
","'The Wolf of Wall Street' is a mixed bag. A black comedy about greed and morality, it shows a rare lightness of touch in the great director when dealing with humour, largely absent in his dramatic work.The pacing and central performance from Leonardo DiCaprio are superb...for the first two hours. After that, though the performances are great - DiCaprio demonstrating a surprising flair for slapstick - the whole thing seems to slip down a gear. Or Two. Odd, as dramatically this final third - yes, it's THAT long, should be the most frenetic. Largely a film likely to be remembered chiefly for the acting rather than the director's distinctive vision.",6,0,3,15 March 2015
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Too Much Middle-Earth
","'The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies' was, it has to be said, one of the most pointless cinematic experiences I've had in years. The 'Lord of the Rings' films were events. People waited for them with genuine excitement and anticipation. Surely, Mr Jackson took certain minor liberties with JRRT's text (the linking of Arwen's well being to the destruction of the One Ring still strikes me as odd), but the narrative approach was consistent and the designs for the various peoples of Middle Earth astounding. The Hobbit films, though, have become an exercise in endurance - grafting on additional sub-stories which have no relation to and distract enormously from what should be a simple, fun adventure story. Structurally it is a great juddering mess: the first ten minutes belong at the end of 'Desolation of Smaug' (the ending of which lacked any impact because it was inexplicably cut short) - and the You Think It's All Over...But We'll Have Just ONE More Redundant Fight Scene...Then Do It All Over Again attitude sparks of a Director SERIOUSLY in need of a good Script Editor. As with the first two films, many of the additional scenes are there, it seems, because Jackson thought a particular image or location would look cool, and no-one had the balls to tell him enough is enough. Many of the CGI scenes looked a tad shoddy, and the invented Tauriel sub-plot really got on my nerves...Tolkein DOES really need to reprAzent da ladies more, but creating a feisty female character only to reduce her to the filling in an unrequited Elf/Dwarf love sandwich REALLY isn't an improvement. Pretty, pompous, predictable, over-produced...and two whole fricking films longer than it needed to be.",4,2,6,15 March 2015
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," 'This is not the film you are looking for...!'
","Of the three prequels this is, without a doubt, the most visually impressive. Like many recent fantasy films, however, it uses an abundance of (often quite obvious) CGI because it can rather than because it should. It becomes, therefore, quite exhausting to watch. The performances are, almost without exception, utterly dreadful.Natalie Portman is a very good actress, when she has the right script. No-one has the right script, here. She's left to stand around on a succession of balconies (with increasingly outlandish hair-dos) looking tearful and coming out with such wooden lines as 'I don't know you any more!' 'We used to talk!', etc., etc., ad nauseum. Ewan MacGregor looks alternately bored or mildly constipated. Hayden Christiansen wins the Mark Hamill Emotes-Like-A-Chest-Of-Drawers Award for the second film running. This film  the whole prequel trilogy, in fact  hangs on us caring about Anakin's fall to the Dark Side, and his becoming Darth Vader. We don't. The setting-up of characters and incidents recognisable from the first films becomes tiresome  right down to the wiping of C3PO's memory (he's built by young Anakin in 'The Phantom Menace', but has no knowledge of Anakin, Obi-Wan or anyone else he encounters in 'Star Wars').Most disappointing is the first image of Vader in full regalia. Anakin's burned and dismembered body is surgically installed into his suit and respiratorapparently with his cape already attached! He then breaks free from the manacles which secure him to the surgeons' slab and lurches around like Boris Karloff in 'Frankenstein' yelling 'Noooooooooo!'Bad. Not as bad as the first two prequels, but still seriously duff.Nice music, thougheven if we have heard it all before.Some of the scary bits are likely to frighten kids in ways the earlier prequels didn't. Hopefully that'll diminish Lucasfilm's toy-revenues and encourage all concerned to sit down and think up something original.",Null,2,7,19 January 2006
Lord of War," War, What Is It Good For - A Laugh, Obviously
","Today's pleasant surprise was 'Lord of War', which was really rather good. As a good ol' left-leaning Guardian reader I know a little of the villainies of the arms trade, but from a nuts and bolts perspective this film was really rather educational. The film-makers sensibly let events unfold without heavy-handed authorial judgement.Nick Cage's everyman screen-persona is used to good effect Â– he's amiable, genial even, and prone to wry dark commentary on his job, but his 'If I didn't do this job someone else would' attitude, probably mirrors that of much of the US and UK film-going audiences. The consequence of his actions and attitudes are nicely layered, and their representation subtly paced. We, as a collective audience, are encouraged applaud our 'hero's wits as he confounds his interfering Interpol adversary, Ethan Hawke, in the early stages of the movie, which makes us complicit in the consequences of those wiles, seen in graphic detail later on.The film also has a few interesting things to say about the US Government's arms-trade interests, and their own culpability in many of the world's killing fields.Not bad at all.",Null,1,4,18 January 2006
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Odd, But Rewarding
","A very sharp, sassy script and a convoluted, but engaging, examination of reality, theatrical reality, media reality and self- perception, 'Birdman' shows just how good Michael Keaton can be, with good material. Casting a film about a washed-up superhero actor trying to prove his worth (to his family, himself, his audience and the world in general) by staging a self-penned Raymond Carver adaptation, with actors who have associations with such franchises, was clever. It plays on our own perceptions. Is Keaton the volatile troubled soul in real-life he appears to be on screen? Is talented, over-analytical anal-retentive Edward Norton mocking his notoriety as a 'difficult' actor to work with? The interior of the theatre is used really well, helping to variously establish, remove and self- consciously muddle the different 'realities' at various points in the film. I like this movie, also, because it means I can say something nice about Zach Galifianakis...whose insensitive dork schtick I really can't abide, but who does some solid straight-faced character acting, here, as Keaton's slightly camp lawyer.",7,0,4,15 March 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Ultimate Edition is better
","Over the past few months I've heard all manner of comments about how 'Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice' is 'The Showgirls of Super-Hero movies'. Not so: as long as 'Green Lantern', 'The Spirit' and (Gods help us) 'Catwoman' live on in our cultural memory, the bar for truly dire hero-flicks will remain quite exceptionally low.It's...not that bad.It lacks the thoughtful aspect of 'Man of Steel', and the messianic allegory of that film is continued a little too heavy handedly, here - even down to the film's Easter release (sent from his Daddy in the sky and raised as one of us, he dies to save us from a baddie identified - albeit fleetingly - as 'the devil', only to inevitably return...in the sequel.)That said, the performances are very good, and Ben Affleck's grizzled Batman/Bruce Wayne is excellent. Deserving of his own solo flick, I think. He does 'angry' very well.For comic geeks like myself there are obvious nods to 'The Dark Knight Returns', 'Doomsday', 'Trinity', 'Public Enemies', 'Batman: Year One', 'Batman: Earth One' and a host of individual tales (including the dystopian Batman issue #666). Gadot makes an excellent Wonder Woman, and some of the fight scenes are quite beautifully staged.Two things let it down...annoyingly, but not irredeemably. Firstly, there's the unsubtle teasers for the imminent movies featuring Aquaman, The Flash and Cyborg. This franchise-fest slows the narrative, when it needs to maintain momentum, and seems woefully contrived. More annoying is writer David S. Goyer's inability to write a superhero script which DOESN'T involve the sudden third-act appearance of a monster/machine-which-will-end-everything. The Blade flicks, Batman Begins/Dark Knight Rises...all spend ages developing believable personalities and motivations...then throw it all away in an unnecessary effects-fest.Grrr, Mr Goyer, Grrrrrrrrrrr!Many of the plot issues, particularly with regard to the 'magic bullet' and Bruce Wayne's back-story are properly fleshed out in the 'Ultimate Edition'...which provides a more coherent narrative, and should have been released in cinemas.",7,3,7,17 October 2016

Munich," Hardly an Olympian Feat
","'Munich' has managed, it seems, to offend just about everyone in the Middle East. The Islamic world finds it's representation of the Black September team who murdered the 1972 Israeli Olympic squad superficial, and it's understanding of the underlying issues which led to that act and it's bloody reprisals equally scant. The Israelis are outraged that their actions in retaliation for the Munich killings should be subject to ethical scrutiny. Both sides have their say, and the zealous defence of tribal territories is clearly established as the principal motivation for all concerned. But  and, given that the narrative is told from the perspective of the Israelis this is hardly surprising  it is a largely one-sided story.Oddly, it's not this which prevents this from being a serious discussion of continuing . divisions in Middle Eastern relationships. Eric Bana, as Avner - the leader of the unofficial Mossad squad dispatched to terminate those he is informed by his masters are responsible for the Munich killings  gives a nicely layered performance as the patriot dispirited and dehumanised by his own deadly endeavours, and if the film works at all it is greatly due to him. His gradual realisation that he is an instrument of political manipulation, that some of his actions may lack righteous justification provides what moral debate exists within the piece, after all. No, what undermines the film is Spielberg's uncertainty as to whether he is conducting a personal, political debate or making an action-movie  as each action of Bana's team is, essentially, a dynamic little set piece. A more reflective, polemical piece may not have been so attractive proposition for the studiobut it would, I think, have made for a more stimulating piece of cinema.Supporting performances are generally good, particularly Daniel Craig's Semitic zealot and Valeria Tedeschi as Bana's wife. Geoffrey Rush is rather disappointing as our hero's Mossad spymaster: a surprisingly stilted and unsubtle effort. The best, and most understated supporting turn comes from the always reliable Michael Lonsdale. Always worth watching, and a performer with genuine presence and seemingly effortless on-screen authority.",Null,0,2,7 February 2006
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Same Old, Same Old
","'Kingsman: The Secret Service' is...well...exactly what you would expect from a Jane Goldman adaptation of a Mark Millar comic book. It's absurdly violent, devoid of any subtlety in characterisation, insistently profane and – just occasionally – bloody funny. Colin Firth plays a John Steed style spy, recruiting noob Taron Egerton into a troupe of impeccably tailored spies. Rather more restrained than 'Kick Ass', it's okay and you'll probably think you want a sequel – but bearing in mind what the same team did in 'Kick-Ass 2'...you REALLY don't. As a parody of posh super-spy tomfoolery (incessantly referenced in the script), it works. Samuel L. Jackson is amusing as the lisping baddie, sending his usual cool screen-persona up, and the ever-reliable Mark Strong gives able support as the de facto 'Q' for the team, but it is essentially lightweight, disposable fare. Best scene involves a VERY inventive use of 'Land of Hope and Glory', which provoked a round of applause at the screening I viewed.",5,2,9,15 March 2015
Inside Llewyn Davis," Not Quite A Classic
","The posters for 'Inside Llewyn Davis's hype it as Classic Cohen Brothers, and it is most certainly that...sort of.Replete with an oddball, outsider protagonist, a host of endearingly iconoclastic supporting characters, great use of landscape and occasionally blisteringly hot one-liners. A period piece, set amid the early '60s folk circuit, it riffs on Ulysses (sometimes a little heavy-handedly) anduma certain Bill Murray film (though to name it would if not actually spoil a surprise, make you arch a quizzical eyebrow a little less archly). Oscar Isaac in the central role of an aspiring folklore is by far the Cohen's least sympathetic leading character in quite some time, and it is greatly to his credit that despite this disadvantage he's almost endearing in his single minded capacity to learn nothing from his mistakes. The music is always entertaining (superb soundtracks being yet another perennial quality of Joel and Ethan's flicks. John Goodman, F. Murray Abraham, Justin Timberlake (again demonstrating his skills as an excellent character actor) and the lovely Carey Mulligan (brunette, here, and thus making me even happier than usual) are all as good as you would expect in file-sharing this Homer homage.",6,0,1,15 March 2015
Sin City," Old Miller's Misoginy
","I had low expectations of this movie  chiefly because my expectations of author and co-director Frank Miller have diminished radically in recent years. Twenty years ago Mr M. was one of the most innovative and challenging writers in the comic-book medium: his 'The Dark Knight Returns' is both an effective satire of the medium and an effective dystopian adventure story. Like the true masters of the genre, Eisner, Kirby and Moore, he recognised that, while graphic storytelling has much in common with prose narrative and still more with cinema, it was an entirely different medium that required a distinctive 'grammar'. While Miller was never a visionary in the same league as Eisner or Moore, and lacked the populist touch of Jack 'King' Kirby, he was one of the key writers in developing literate, intelligent comic-narrative.Then, in the mid 1980s he started believing his own publicity. He refused to be edited, artists found him astonishingly difficult to work with, and most of his work  by the mid-1990s  was self illustrated or self published. What followed was a series of violent, misogynistic, neo-noir tales  stylish, visually distinctive, but ultimately with nothing to say. Initially these works were hailed as ironic, but, through repetition and an over reliance on cliché, it soon became clear that there was precious little irony intended.Welcome to 'Sin City'.On film as on the page, 'Sin City' is an oh-so-stylish mess. It looks great. Rodriguez, as cinematographer, and Art Director Jeanette Scott have captured much of what made Miller's artwork so interesting, but so much bloody time is spent trying to recreate these images that, particularly in the first third of the film, the pace is leaden. As this film is aimed at a mass-market such panel-by-panel reproductions are pointless  and, remember, I'm saying this as a confirmed and unrepentant comic-geek. That said, the use of stark whites and jet blacks is used very well in the final story. A little more consistency in certain visual areas  blood, for example, is variously white, black or red  would have been appreciated.All the men are hard-as-nails, borderline psychotic and have hearts of gold. All the women are whores, betrayers, victims  or a combination of all three. No woman in 'Sin City' is perceived as anything other than a sex-object, of one sort or another. Rosario Dawson, Devon Aoki, Brittany Murphy et al are, therefore, unfeasibly attractive streetwalkers, yet  despite the acres of collective flesh they display during the course of the movie  Jessica Alba, the only one amongst them to have a 'no-nudity' clause in her contract, manages to be far sexier than the lot of them. I'm forced to admit, though, that, for all my criticisms of Miller's sexism, I'd probably have gone to see this film just for the sight of Alba in her cowgirl outfit.As for the men? Powers Boothe, Michael Madsen and Michael Clark Duncan are criminally under-used. Benetio Del Toro is bloody awful. Clive Owen's attempt at an American accent is distracting. Mickey Rourke and Bruce Willis, as Marv and Hartigen  the two most interesting characters in the 'Sin City' graphic-novels, fare a little better. Willis has learned late in his career, it seems, that his more restrained performances are his best: in his less animated moments he's at his most expressive.Ultimately this is a big stylish mess of a movie.But Jessica Alba does look very nice in her cowboy outfit.",Null,2,5,19 January 2006
Macbeth," It was a rough night...
","Justin Kurzel's 'Macbeth' looks glorious, and the composition of each frame is an aesthete's delight. Bit of a problem, there, as far as I'm concerned, as it slowed the pace of the film enormously. Michael Fassbender is quite superb, and the always reliable Paddy Considine and Sean Harris likewise, but the lingering languor with which (in particular) the highland landscapes were handled diminished momentum, and – with it – the domino-effect sweeping paranoia evident in the play, and with it, the cascade of Macbeth's decline into madness. It also, more seriously, lessened the impact of Lady M's transition from ambitious pragmatist to despairing sentimentalist. Without that emotional evolution that sea-change in their characters CAN'T take your breath away in the way that it should. That said, I could look into Mm. Cotillard's eyes for a month without blinking, so I can't blame Kurzel for lingering his lens on her. An artistic success, visually, a spectacular performance from Fassbender, but otherwise...meh! Oh, and THE LEAST imposing Malcolm. EVER.",6,1,3,17 October 2016
V for Vendetta," Never Mind The B*ll*cks
","It's difficult to see who exactly James McTeigue's 'V For Vendetta' is aimed at. Even given that Alan Moore's complex tale has been stripped to the bone (perhaps inevitably, as otherwise we'd be looking a looong film), it's far too wordy for most action-movie audiences  and, by the same reckoning, too violent for more thoughtful patrons. There are allusions to 'America's War' in the near-past, and of how religious fundamentalism and intolerance have come to shape the dystopia represented, but these connections are astonishingly heavy handed and unsubtle. This, plus the Wachowski Brothers fondness for cod-philosophising reduces Moore's incisive wit into something more blunt and unsubtle. That said, there are a few genuinely interesting comments made about the nature of terrorism which I'm surprised survived into the final script. No wonder the Daily Mail hated it.The biggest problem is the main character, the man known as V. In the comic book world (where masks are the norm) V's blank, unchanging gaze adds to his mystery. Here, though, his only expression is vocal, a great limitation of the talents of Hugo Weaving.A Prologue  intended, quite clearly, for American consumption  explains a little of Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot to destroy Parliament. To some extent I can see why this is done, as very few Yanks will have heard of Fawkes, and may wonder why our hero, V, dresses in the style of this historical character. This introduction sets the plotter up as an idealist, a crusader against injustice, which taps into part of what our hero is supposed to represent  the Freedom Fighter. It's a simplistic interpretation which does rather defeat the essential message of Moore's character and book. Fawkes wanted a new order, yes, but he fought on behalf of an authority no more democratic or tolerant than the one he sought to destroy. He also wanted vengeance on those  the Protestant King James, especially  whom he felt has persecuted his Catholic brethren. The bulk of the population considered him a terrorist  which is why his defeat is celebrated each November 5th. Moore's character is complex  recognising that Idealism, Terrorism and Vengeance are all part of the same destructive impulse. In the graphic novel V quotes, on occasion, from the Rolling Stones' 'Sympathy For The Devil', which is the best indicator of what the character represents  his own personal vendetta aside, he's an Anarchist, a catalyst for sudden and bloody change.V's 'origins' are hinted at, but by depriving us of the detail of the original source material he becomes more human, more the 'wronged man'  and, again, I can see why this was done, as audiences are expected to empathise with their hero  but it does make what he is (as opposed to who he is) less frightening. And V should be frightening. Another attempt to humanise V  the hint of romantic feeling between him and Natalie Portman's Evey  completely misfires.There are a few equally misjudged comic moments, the worst of which  a grimace-inducing 'Benny Hill' skit (more trademarked 'British' humour for the Yanks), but there are a few changes that actually work. Stephen Fry's Dietrich is virtually unrecognisable as the character from Moore's book, Dascombe, upon which it is based  but does, as a gay man masking a liberal outlook within a totalitarian regime, serve as a potent all-too-human counterpoint to our mask-wearing 'hero'. Portman's Evey is also a million miles removed from her source-character, but her screen persona is less successful than Fry's  a shame, as she could have probably made interesting work of that more ordinary, desperate Evey. For all the many changes I'm glad to say that the touching Valerie sub-plot survives intact.Tim Piggot-Smith enjoys a fine return thuggish form, and John Hurt overacts his wrinkly little head off as the Chancellor. Steven Rea is excellent as the dogged, sad detective Finch  probably the most loyal transfer of character from page to screen.Visually it has it's moments, and it is very stylish  as one would expect from the Wachowski Bros and Joel Silver - but very few of them are truly cinematic  save, perhaps, for the final Tchaikovsky accompanied scenes of Parliament, which was genuinely impressive.I was prepared to hate this film with a fiery passion, but didn't. It wasn't  to use what the scriptwriters seem to think is the only British expletive  'b*ll*cks', but it has no real excuse for not being considerably better, given that so many of the plot changes were so unnecessary. It's the best adaptation, thus far, of any Alan Moore subject  though given how bad 'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' and 'From Hell' were, that's not saying much. That said, it is seriously flawed, and most of those flaws arise out of a basic misunderstanding of the nature of the central character.",5,87,182,18 March 2006
