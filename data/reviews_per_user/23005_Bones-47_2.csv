Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A kids movie
",I had heard this was a poor effort before I saw it. A few minutes into the film I realised it was a lot worse than I had been expecting. If Lucas wanted this to be a film for children under 12 then he succeeded. If this is meant to appeal to those of us who remember seeing the first 3 in the cinema all those years ago then I can't fathom his reasoning.The FX are good and that's about all. Those of us who hate Independence Day know that flashy effects can't disguise what is essentially rubbish.,1,2,4,15 May 2000
Alien: Resurrection," How could they?
","I loved the first two films. In fact Aliens is my all time favourite. The 3rd film, though not without merit, was a terrible disappointment. Alien4 is an awful pox ridden travesty. I hope they don't make another one (shudder!).",2,1,2,2 June 2000
