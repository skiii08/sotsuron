It," Surprisingly good
","So as somebody who has never been a fan of horror, and who was dragged along by his 15 year old son...I found this film surprisingly enjoyable. The characters were likable and interesting, the villain seemed interesting as well and right from the start he spoke, which I liked (No big reveal at the end, he was a proper character from the beginning) The acting was terrific, particularly the accurate portrayal of teenage boys banter. There was even a comedy aspect at times, really not expecting that! I guess it was a bit long as my main criticism but I stuck with it because I really wanted to see how it all ended. Really worth a watch through fingers/hunkering behind knees/crushing a partner's hand!!!",8,5,10,17 September 2017
