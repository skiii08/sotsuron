Requiem for a Dream," Too far out there
","This is just another pothead movie that has gathered too much acclaim just because the movies format is weird. If you ask me it's one of those movies people say they like just for the sake of being trendy. I don't like watching movies that I constantly have to refresh myself as to what's going on. Don't get me wrong I don't have any problem with movies that don't follow the tradition story telling format. However I do have problem when movie makers purposely try to make the movie confusing and easily misunderstood, because they are relying on the critics not to see it for what it is (mindless crap) but rather to see it as unique. Here are some other movies I think are too far out there: 1.)Requiem for a Dream 2.)Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas 3.)Romeo + Juliet (1996) 4.)Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 5.)Natural Born Killers",1,4,10,30 March 2006
