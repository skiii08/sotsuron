Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The most anticipated film of all time.
","I can't believe that this film came from the same man who brought us American Graffiti and the original Star Wars trilogy.  I know almost everyone in the country was very disappointed in the final product and I will admit that much of that was due to the amount of anticipation toward the film.  But much of the disappointment came from the fact that is simply wasn't as good as the other three installments.The Phantom Menace was severely disjointed and lacked any real direction.  I myself, though I won't consider it the failing of the movie, wondered at the point of Jar Jar.  The film screamed marketing at us even though this was probably the most bulletproof film to ever be released.  There was no way this movie was not going to make money. Yet it seemed to many fans EP I was simply a ploy at marketing toys, cola, and toothbrushes.For allot of people this story line was holy, especially the story line of Anakin and Obi-Wan.  What we wanted to see were relationships and the eventual failing of these relationships.  What we got was a short glimpse at who Obi-Wan might have been and a longer than necessary glimpse of who we hoped Anakin wasn't.  I don't attribute this to Jake Lloyd because I feel that it was Lucas' writing that simply didn't recognize the character study that should have taken place with Anakin. Also, I know Ewan McGregor to be a wonderful actor in both comedy and drama, and his part in EP I was dull and lacked any real sense of who Obi-Wan truly was. I think perhaps with a different script both of these characters would have shined a little more.Overall I was disappointed as were many, many other people. What I was left with was a sour taste that remains today.  Frankly I am much more excited about Lord Of The Rings than I am EP 2 and that makes me sad. For more years than I can count I had been waiting to see this part of the story, and I was let down.I do hope that EP 2 & 3 will be better (it is a good sign that Lucas had another writer look at the script and make changes) but I will hold on to the original trilogy as an endangered species. Because, folks, they just don't make em like they used to.",5,0,1,12 June 2001
Minority Report," Neo-Noir at its Best!
","I have found that sci-fi films don't work anymore. If we try to think of truely GOOD sci-fi films the list is pretty short... most of them contain the names James Cameron or Steven Spielberg. While this seems to be the case (especially in the last couple of years) Steven Spielberg has done the impossible and created an amazing piece of filmmaking by fusing an interesting future world with the best ideas of Film Noir.Without going into detail about the film it's all classic 'who-done-it' and when, where and why. Tom Cruise clocks in an amazing performance (which means allot coming from me because I usually stray far & away from Tom Cruise films) which is depressed and twitchy. Spielbergs directing is at a new level and, while he hasn't mastered this level yet, he is obviously not far from it. The only real failing of the film is its ending which takes a bit too long to wind up everything into a nice and tight little ball. Even though the story does fit together well it still lacks a climax which can overcome the first heart pounding hour of the film. Still though, it's the best I've seen in a long time and can't wait to see what Spielberg will turn out next. I know a musical may be in his future and that makes me happy because I love to see directors pan themselves out and do different things. 4 and a half our of 5 stars",9,0,0,24 June 2002
Fight Club," Appears to be slipping into film obscurity.
","I haven't seen another film all year that rivaled Fight Club in it's acting, directing, and story telling.  This is saying a lot considering I'm a huge Star Wars fan and this was the same year EP1 hit.  It is sad to say though that Fincher's talents have been ignored by critics (or just misunderstood) and the film is fading away.  It didn't do very well at the box office and received mixed emotions from critics and audiences.  Too bad, Fincher really strutted his directing stuff in the film and will probably get only the admiration of us growing film students and makers.  Kudos to you David.",8,0,1,19 February 2000
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," What an Enjoyable Ride!
","Ok, I'm not much for the Disney engine but I do have to admit that I really enjoyed Pirates of the Caribbean if for no other reason than Johnny Depp's wonderful performance.The film itself is the usual action fair with aggravating editing and impossibilities galore. The effects were very well done and were the first in a while to really make me think 'how'd they do that?'.
A film like this, though, doesn't rely on plot or depth or anything like that. It relies on a feeling of adventure and fun. And darn it all, I had fun. I had more of a good time at this film than any film I can recall in recent memory and think that Depp's performance of Jack Sparrow deserves every bit of acclaim it's received and more.I'm not too keen on a Pirates 2, but if Jack Sparrow is back, I'll be there Maties!!!***.5 / ****",8,1,2,26 November 2003
X-Men," Very, very good.
",First I must say that a special hats off to Hugh Jackman for his impassioned performance of Wolverine. Next I got the feeling that Bryan Singer desperately wanted this movie to be great. He was obviously a little out of his element here but he succeeded in making a stark realization of this wildly complex comic. I collected X-Men and Wolverine up until Onslaught and I have to say that waiting for this film was only second to waiting for Episode I. Sadly I have to say that this film out did Star Wars from start to finish. I was not disappointed.  Some of the character development on characters needed to be fleshed out but on the whole I loved it.  I left the theater with a big smile on my face and a warm spot in my heart.  I was excited and proud of everyone attached to the film. Hats off guys.,7,0,0,17 July 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Lost Faith
","There is a polarity in the views of Star Wars fans these days. There are those that hold we all were just younger when the original trilogy was released and, as adults, are looking to feelings that cannot be achieved within the heart of an adult. Thus we view the new, prequel, trilogy as less substantial than the first. The other half of us says that, no, Lucas has lost sight of his original vision and has lost direction with the entire film making process.I, for one, am among the latter. But I arrived there after a personal struggle of epic proportions. I could not let myself believe that what was tantamount to my religion was becoming what Episodes I & II had become.What have they become? I will definitely say that they are unique films with amazing visual effects just in sheer amount. If films are like their auteur then they can be seen as a near perfect reflection of where George Lucas is in his life. A man who really doesn't understand the rest of the world. A man who has cut himself off from many sides of reality and can't seem to get back into touch with it. A man who doesn't know what young love feels like anymore. Most importantly a man who is obsessed with the technology of film making over the emotional psychology.Not that these things are necessarily wrong. People are who they are and the man is more comfortable than I could ever hope to be. But for the makings of a film this sets up a bad precedence.  Lucas' films are now devoid of life. They are windows to his soul. A soul that lives cut off from the realities of the world. As I've already reviewed The Phantom Menace I'll skip that and just move on to Attack of the Clones.I don't really know where to begin. Ewan Macgregor is charming as usual and I feel sorry for him in some ways. But in other ways I know his career is not in danger so hey Ewan, just sit back and have fun with it. Hayden Christensen is another story.  It's impossible to tell anything about his acting in the film because the dialogue is so horribly static and emotionless. But overall he's not who I pictured as Anakin, and the writing of his character has gotten out of hand. Darth Vader was a character we respected out of fear, Anakin Skywalker... we don't respect... we don't feel sorry for... really, we just don't care. He's a screw up and a jerk at that.
Which brings us to Natalie Portman. Natalie, I think you're beautiful and a wonderful actress but these films don't show that. Amidala is cut out of an oak stump but at least she seems stable and in control... which is another problem. There is nothing in the script or film, which gives us any clue as to why this beautiful, strong, and smart woman would want to have anything to do with Anakin. She seems to fall in love with him simply because the script said so.Which brings me to the overall plot. There wasn't any. At least not as far as I could tell. Something about someone trying to unite some people against some other people for no real reason that I could see. If there is a reason I'm missing I think it could have been worked in a little better. I also didn't quite understand the battle at the end. Who were we fighting... who are 'we' for that matter. There seemed to be no real reason for the battle other than George though there should be a battle.  It was visually impressive but, since I didn't know what was really going on, I didn't really care and it was one big special effect. And about the special effects.Allot has been said about the overall effects of the film and I do have to agree that they are staggering and plentiful. My problem is that nearly every second of screen time that computer-generated creatures and people had, was very painfully obvious. It may have had something to do with the digital film but it looked bad to me. Now just because a visual effect isn't convincing doesn't mean that the movie is a failure. What happened is that since the story had gone away from anything resembling coherent we then rely on special effects to dazzle us. They didn't. They just sort of stood there and looked pretty. It's a difficult thing to loose one's faith. But I have lost it. Star Wars was my religion much until I reached about 21. Now I have no faith in the franchise. I have to desire to watch any of them any more. Harry Knowles once wrote that Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones was the make or break of the series. Star Wars is now, to my dismay, broken.",3,0,0,2 July 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Absolute Perfection 10/10
","There are many (and I do mean MANY) wonderful reviews of Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring, so I will not stir over what has already been said... the film is one of the best, albeit maybe THE best, to grace the screen since this humble reviewer can remember.As a society it is very important to recognize great pieces of work when they come around. Too often we play host to the mindless drivel that froths from the rusty machine that is Hollywood. Peter Jackson and company have shown us, without impunity, that true greatness can be achieved.  We no longer have to settle for what is fed to us. I look back over the years of films I have loved, or in many cases just wanted to love.  They all pale now, brought down to stylish icons of modern cinema as opposed to great works of film. The myths that we have clung to for years tell us that films can only be so good. Those myths are gone. Gone and for many of us, they will never return and we are left staring at hollywood with contempt for the garbage that we must settle for. 
I will settle no more. Because Peter Jackson has done the impossible and given us a window into another world. It never once feels as though this was something filmed or acted or scripted.  It never feels as though this didn't actually happen somewhere in some far forgotten time.Casting: Perfect Acting: Perfect Directing: Perfect Scripting: PerfectPeter Jackson... I salute you. 10 out of 10",10,0,0,19 December 2001
American Beauty," Best of 1999?
","American Beauty was an interesting foot note in the explosion of avant garde films of 1999.  But I have a severe problem putting it close to the top of that year.  Most people feel that one of the more overlooked films of that particular year was Fight Club which deals with some of the same ideas only on a much broader and more anarchistic way.American Beauty should be looked at as an American tragedy much like A Raisin in the Sun. But just because it's 'like' A Raisin in the Sun doesn't mean it's also great.  The film contains some great acting from Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, and the entire cast but the story is overly cliche at times and lacks the reality that it sets itself up to be.  If all of this is supposed to be taking place in a real world, as Mendes sets up, there are several substantial problems.  It seems in his world POT has no smell and successful drug dealers are not the brightest bulbs in the house.To many times this film tries to be a character study and is unable to because of the unbelievability of the characters. Again, this is not a problem with the acting but rather the film making.I suppose I was more impressed with The Sixth Sense and Fight Club as potential motion pictures of the year.Again, not bad, but not great either.",7,0,0,11 June 2001
Dark City," One of My Favorites.
",It's rare to find a sci-fi film that's actually high concept. Dark City is one of the few that combines ideas with visuals extremely well.  For a low budget film it is powerful and interesting to watch.  The story is kind of new and the mysterious plot twists through out are perfect to keep me watching and wondering.  Alex Proyas had a rough start with The Crow (a film I also liked) but shows his true colors and strength with Dark City.,10,0,2,20 July 2000
Batman Begins," The Bat Soars in this Amazing Adaption!
","We've seen some good comic book movies in Spider-Man and the X-Men films, but we haven't seen greatness until now. Batman Begins represents the greatest comic book film to date. Coming at a time when we seem to be going backward instead of forward with ideas and plotting for blockbusters, Director Christopher Nolan shows us that a movie based on a comic book can be not only great entertainment, but it can be a powerful film in its own rite. This is the comic book movie we've all been waiting for and, more importantly, this is the Batman film the character has always deserved.Restarting the franchise was a little risky, but I dare say that after the debacle that Joel Schumacher gave us in Batman & Robin, a fresh start was needed. After years of development hell, Christopher Nolan (director of Memento and Insomnia) came to the forefront and decided what type of movie was going to be made. He was interested in how Bruce Wayne became Batman. This is very different to the previous installments that try to suggest when and why Bruce Wayne became Batman. We know the why's (Wayne's parents are gunned down in a back alley) and the when's are inconsequential as Batman exists out of time and place. The how's are the interesting part but have always been neglected.Something else that Nolan does right is to not put emphasis on the villains in the film. Previous Batman films focus their attention on the colorful and weird villains that Batman must face down. But this creates an inherent lack of connection with our main character. Instead, Nolan gives us a movie about Bruce Wayne and his own journey for justice.It's tough to pin down every single thing that works in this movie, but there are highlights to be sure. Christian Bale is a perfect choice for Bruce Wayne/Batman. He is a good-looking man, who is capable of being both a playboy and disturbed. Bale succeeds in making Bruce Wayne and Batman two very very different people. Another highlight is the action, which doesn't pass into the realm of the completely unbelievable, yet is still unbelievable and exciting. Finally, and I think my favorite highlight, was the sound design. Never underestimate the power of good sound design. Batman's race through Gotham city in the finally tangible Batmobile is made believable by great choreography, but it is made exciting and thrilling by wonderful sound design.Batman Begins exists as three types of movies at once and succeeds powerfully on all levels. 1) It is a comic book movie about a super hero. 2) It is a drama about a lost soul looking for justice. And 3) It is a horror film about a nightmarish psychopath stalking the back alleyways of Gotham City, preying on the corrupt. This is wonderful film-making. The best comic book film currently in existence, and a damn fine and accomplished film. I can't think of higher praise.",8,3,4,19 June 2005
Schindler's List," Spielberg's Finest Work
","There is a reason Steven Spielberg is a household name. He is, quite simply, the greatest director in the history of the medium. He understands film and how it works, but more importantly than that, he understands his audience. he understands how he can best communicate the story he wants to tell to the masses, without sacrificing truth and his own identity. Schindler's List is a glowing testament to that fact and it is Spielberg's finest work to date. Do I ever think he'll surpass Schindler's List? It's possible I suppose, but I think the story was so personal, that he won't really want to. This is Steven Spielberg's Magnum Opus.There are conflicting truths about Oskar Schindler and what type of person he was. When you compare the movie to what his family say about him, there are small inconsistencies. Before I had seen the film I had heard both sides of the argument and felt fairly safe in feeling that both sides of that man were represented on screen. The business man, and the savior. I think the film portrays him as a business man who doesn't really understand the good he's doing until it's almost done. I like that. That's truth. That's human. That's who I'd bet Oskar Schindler was.Looking back on the film, I'd say it's one of the best looking films I've ever seen. That's not to say it's pretty. It's high contrast Black and White was an inspired choice. I'm partial to Black and White anyway. There's something mysterious and nostalgic about it. But the lighting and cinematography by Janusz Kaminski (his first collaboration with Spielberg) are a glory to watch.I particularly liked Liam Neeson's performance as Oskar Schindler. It was quiet and reserved until it needed to be loud and booming. I liked how he was able to shift character to blend with the Nazis then right back to dealing with his workers. It was a very nuanced performance. One of his best.All in all Schindler's List is a powerful film about saving lives. One man spends all his life making a fortune, then spends every cent of it to bring safety to 1,100 Jews. That is beauty. Within Schindler's List there is a small bit of dialog about what power actually is. Honestly the answer doesn't come until the end of the film.Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.",9,9,13,7 August 2004
Moulin Rouge!," A True 10!!!
","Simply one of the best films I've ever seen. With that said, here's the review.  Honestly I don't know what to say.  I have never seen a movie like this.  I have never had an experience quite the same.  What a rush of exhilaration.  What a beautiful story.  I have seen many, many, musicals and this takes precedence in its ability to energize and captivate.There is an immediate level of unbelievablility to the entire film as it is presented in an extremely artistic fashion.  But after 15 or so minutes you will sit back and be drawn into its world.  Quick cuts and bizarre camera moves make the film an assault on your senses.  One of the great bits of Moulin Rouge was its ability to tell this wonderful story in a different and fresh way.  A small note on Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman.  Both of them sing, both of them dance, and both of them ignite the screen and Ewan solidifies his place in my heart as one of the best actors on the scene. I cannot put into words the beauty of this film and its light-handed approach to the genre of musicals.  I heard another review which stated 'Your heart will sing,' and that is exactly what mine did.",10,0,1,8 June 2001
Reservoir Dogs," A Bleak and Disturbing Film from a Treasured Director.
","** / **** Reservoir Dogs is an interesting beginning to one of America's finest filmmakers careers. I loved Pulp Fiction in so many ways but most of which came from the last 15 minutes of the film in which we understand Samuel L. Jackson's journey in the film. It is that quality that is missing in Reservoir Dogs that, in my opinion, is the film's failing. The film is nothing but graphic pain and violence. There is nothing to endear any of the characters to us (unless you are endeared to people that like to mutilate people to hip 70's tunes). The characters have no real journey. The dialog is inventive (as we expect from Tarantino) but the plot is not. It's about violence for the sake of shocking the audience. It's disturbing in the ways that a horror film is disturbing without the payoff in the end. The film is extremely popular and that disturbs me more than the film itself.",7,6,11,23 March 2004
Army of Darkness," Nothing But Fun!
","A friend once convinced me to watch Army Of Darkness when it first came to video.  I was sure I wasn't going to like it because I was not a big fan of the horror genre.  (Nothing wrong with horror it's just not my cup of tea). After about ten minutes I was rolling on the floor and realizing that the film was the best bang-em-up adventure I'd ever seen.  There was a level of violence so prolific is was comic.  I had to rewind it and watch it again the same night.  It was allot like the first screening of Independence Day, though I say there was allot in Army of Darkness that was much better for the budget than ID4:)",10,1,1,20 July 2000
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," More Than the Sum of It's Parts!
","At last we come full circle. As I sit writing this, it's tough to think of the idea that there will be no more Star Wars movies. This isn't a reaction to Revenge of the Sith as much as it is a statement of a generation. As long as allot of us have been alive, there's been the wait for a new Star Wars movie. Kind of interesting, perhaps now it is a time to think and dream of other things as opposed to hoping and waiting for the inevitable. Star Wars fits into many of our lives as a type of road marker.Does all of this really mean anything? Who knows but what IS known is that my film-making tastes have changed over the years and Star Wars, I had begun to feel, was a part of the child I had left behind who yearned for adventure and pulpy science fiction. The Phantom Menace was a small disaster, coming at the heels of other films that captured my imagination more (like Dark City) but still left me with some good feelings. Attack of the Clones, on the other (and more depressed) hand, was a complete failure as a film. I hated it and still do. It is everything which I hoped a Star Wars film WOULDN'T be. Dull, boring, devoid of character, and poorly written. Through all of the prequels, however, was Lord of the Rings which (for many of us) represented what we WANTED to see out of Star Wars. Rich characters, lavish sets, bold emotion, and gripping tragedy. I was disappointed with George Lucas, not because he'd made a couple bad films, but because he refused to take any criticism about them and try to fix the problems he'd created. And I wondered if the fanboy child in me had died along the way somewhere. Thus going into Episode III, I had dismal hopes even though word of mouth had been generally positive.Going with a friend of mine from work and my dear wife (who also had very dismal hopes for this film) we sat patiently in a decidedly empty theater. For all the hype surrounding the amount of money that Sith was pulling in, it was a little surprising and didn't say much for repeat business. But the trailers eventually came and went and the familiar phrase 'A Long Time Ago, In A Galaxy Far, Far Away' shown on the screen, sparking the interesting yet again in the inner-child I thought might be dead. As the opening crawl faded away the movie panned down to the underbelly of a ship ... I was hooked. From a film-making standpoint the opening shot is glorious. Not flashy, not choppy, but elegant and serves to take the viewer into the film. Kind of grabbing the audience by our coattails and pulling us in for a ride.And what a ride it is. Without hesitation I can say that this is the best film of the prequel trilogy (though I know that may very well be faint praise). And it is a film that I had no clue George Lucas had left in him. Are there problems with the movie? Yes, great big ones that threaten to make the film implode. One of which, involving the newly suited Darth Vader, threatens to make a parody out of what was supposed to be an emotional scene. And let us not forget that Lucas cannot write dialog that is anywhere near romantic. Padme is reduced to nearly a blibbering idiot in the film. The other major problem the film has (and this is in majority due to the miswritten first two films) is that Anakin's turn is too sudden and complete to be anywhere near the realm of believability. This is distressing as the rest of the film is bent on his decisions and his decisions don't really make THAT much sense. It's an amazing feet then, that I was able to move past these faults and get swept up along with the finale of the movie.What works in this film, works on an extraordinarily entertaining and emotional level. There are moments in Sith which succeeded in making me happy, sad, excited, curious, and shocked. Not things I associated with the first two prequels. Take, for instance, that opening shot I was talking about. I know, intuitively, that everything I'm looking at takes place on a computer. But instead of having the perfect movements of a computer, the camera follows the ships almost not quite sure where they are going to turn next, putting the viewer in a position of guessing at what is about to happen. Another, almost paralyzing moment in the film is the end of the great duel between Obi-Wan and Anakin. All in all, this duel was a little too truncated and could have been bigger. But the end of it all (and we may be moving into SPOILER mode here), with Anakin dismembered and burned beyond recognition, using his last breaths to spit curses at Obi-Wan as Obi-wan turns and walks away, is fantastic and well written. Not the type of piece I would have expected from George Lucas.To summarize; Revenge of the Sith is hampered really only by mistakes made early on with The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. It seizes it's chance though to be something more than it's parts and makes for not only great entertainment but a happy (albeit rather dark) place for fans to end this series. 6 years ago I thought it impossible to write a negative review of a Star Wars film. Now, I'm surprised (delightfully) that I have written a positive review of the final Star Wars film we're likely to see.Final Grade: B+",6,1,2,23 May 2005
The Emperor's New Groove," Boom Baby!
","Wow, I must say that I normally don't get a thing out of Disney pictures. Usually they are so bent on message that they don't entertain. Not there is anything wrong with that in, and of, itself but I don't care much for their type of film.  With The Emperor's New Groove, however, I never felt beat over the head with a message or anything near heavy.  It was entertaining simply to be entertaining.  I laughed and laughed, mainly at David Spade and Patrick Warburton but the others in the cast had their moments too.  10 out of 10 from this reviewer who normally gravitates to art films.  Good going guys. It's rare that a movie can keep me laughing as much as this one did.",10,1,2,20 June 2001
Trainspotting," Brilliant Piece of Filmmaking!
","Danny Boyle and his crew crafted a wonderful piece of story telling that escaped the bounds of a simple 'drug' movie. It's disturbing, violent, and sick, yet manages to understand at its heart what the problems are with drugs in reality. In many ways it is very much like Pulp Fiction (though not as well written) but has the underlying morality. Through all of the sickness and disgust, the protagonist knows what is wrong and is trying to fix it.Apart from Shallow Grave, I haven't really appreciated much Boyle has done, but Trainspotting lands high on my list as great pieces of work of the last century. Trainspotting isn't for everyone, but it is a wonderful example of shoe-sting filmmaking.***.5/****",10,1,2,1 June 2004
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Best of the Series.
","There's not much to say about this film that wasn't said in 'Clerks'. But I do have to say that it is very difficult to make a sequel better than the original and Empire surely did that. In many ways it is the very example of what a sequel should be; something that carries the characters further and in a more serious direction without loosing the feel of the original.  That is, of course, the main problem with The Phantom Menace. It completely looses the mood of all of the previous films.  Empire is dark, rich, and a wonderful piece of work to watch.",10,0,0,12 June 2001
Gladiator," Great Acting, average movie.
","Well, this is a strange place I find myself in. I'm a huge Ridley Scott fan and a big Russel Crowe fan.  But the movie lacked in several areas. I think that the story itself was very powerful but it didn't translate that well to the screen.  I'm not really sure whose fault that was but apparently I'm the only one that noticed it anyway. It also never got my blood pumping the way I think Ridley intended it to. The battles were poorly shot and hard to watch, especially on the small screen. I must give credit where credit is due though. The film is very beautiful and the visual effects of Rome were very good.  Russel Crowe was, as usual, amazing and Juaquin Phoenix stole the entire film away from even Richard Harris (I was very impressed). Overall the film was watchable but lacked the epic part of an epic movie.",7,0,0,9 February 2001
