The Avengers," The Avengers : The Best SuperHero Movie!Need i say more!?
","'Spolier Alert'. Don't read further if you feel you don't wanna get your hopes too high. Trust me guys the movie is so freaking awesome any superhero movie fan would be in for a treat! But the least you expect from it, the more you would enjoy and savor each and every 150 minute of this flick!My hands have been itching to write this review from the moment the end credits rolled on the screen.To start off, Take a Bow and Applaud Mr Joss Whedon, the Director and Writer of this movie. He has done what countless movie makers couldn't achieve when they attempted to make a super hero movie with the same set of characters and actors. His ensemble of superheroes has more character depth, more action, more story and some effervescently witty dialogues than any of the other solo movies based on the characters of this film. Whedon has come up with a script that's cheeky and breezy, full of witty banter and sly pop-culture shout-outs as well as self-referential humor, one that moves with an infectious energy that (almost) makes you lose track of its two-and-a-half-hour running time.The hype has been building for years and it couldn't possibly be more deafening at this point. Four years ago around the same time, 'Iron Man' arrived in theaters and kicked off a bold, long-term plan (by Hollywood standards, at least) that would see four different Marvel superheroes appear in their own solo movies, then unite in a single film featuring not just all of the previous films' stars, but many of their supporting cast, too.What's unbelievable, though, is that despite all of the odds against it and the stratospheric expectations heaped upon it, 'The Avengers' still manages to not only live up to those expectations, but to exceed them with an epic adventure that's just as impressive as its larger-than-life characters.For a film that required so many prologues to get to this point, it's surprising how little up-front exposition is required to bring newcomers up to speed with 'The Avengers' universe. While the film clearly assumes some familiarity with the main characters and a few basic plot points of the preceding films ('Iron Man,' 'The Incredible Hulk,' 'Thor,' 'Iron Man 2,' and 'Captain America: The First Avenger'), co-writers Joss Whedon and Zak Penn have done a great job of weaving any necessary information into the early portions of the film and making the exposition feel organic.The premise of 'The Avengers' is this: Thor's evil brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has returned, and he plans to use the Tesseract (the powerful, glowing blue cube last seen in 'Captain America') to take over Earth. When Loki proves too powerful for Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and S.H.I.E.L.D. to take down on their own, all of the characters from the previous Marvel Studios films team up to defeat Loki and the alien horde helping him.To be honest on the face of it, the plot does seem to be taken straight out of a comic book, and is laughably old-school in its simplicity, but its genius lies in how this bare-bones narrative foundation allows the film's talented cast and creative team the room to do what they do best.It's the sort of adventure that comic fans are accustomed to seeing in print, but just like the best comics, 'The Avengers' truly shines in how it fills out its narrative skeleton and the area around these tropes with vibrant storytelling, compelling character development, and moments filled with so much heart – and humor – that the entire package stands on its own.Joss Whedon has pulled off the tricky feat of juggling a large ensemble cast and giving everyone a chance to shine, of balancing splashy set pieces with substantive ideology. Stuff gets blown up real good in beautifully detailed 3-D in 'The Avengers' — the area in and around Grand Central Terminal, for example, gets obliterated beyond recognition in an exhausting, climactic battle — but the film as a whole is never a mess from a narrative perspective.Read more at : http://devlifeintechnicolor.com/2012/05/01/the-avengers- the-best-superhero-movieneed-i-say-more/",10,1,5,4 May 2012
