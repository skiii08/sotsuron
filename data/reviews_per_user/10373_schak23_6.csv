Black Swan," Visually thrilling but awful stereotypes
","Still I want to give 6/10 just simply because Arronofsky is a great director. He made some silly stuff (The Fountain) but knows how to create some beautiful cinema which shows his compassion for composition and bringing together old-fashioned characterization and filming and modern use of the digital effects and editing. So, Black Swan is a roller-coaster drive, full of shocks and awesome, powerful scenes that create the atmosphere of madness and obsession we see Nina going through. Well done for that; I thoroughly enjoyed that. But then, my god, are we still in the 60ies? For crying out loud when does this stupid stereotype finally dies out in cinema? Innocent virgin = good; Innocent virgin on the brink to become a sexually active woman = mad and bad, very bad, so bad, that she cannot survive.... Please, please. We had it all before. And, as before, madness and disorder in a woman is depicted with her sexual awakening and it must end with someone sticking something into her body to shut her up. (Another fine example from mainstream Hollywood for that? Watch X-Men III). Would be nice to see different stories with different women. Winters Bone for example. A lot of madness to be seen, still organic characters, with more to see than just clich√©s I am so tired off.",6,3,6,26 February 2011
We Were Soldiers," too simple
","It's hard to accept, that so many viewers think so positive about that movie. The main aim of the movie maker is simple to read: to win a war America already lost. The truth is that Vietnam was a disaster, but one should not consider it as a military disaster which has to be rewritten by such simple stories. It's better to understand that war itself is a disaster even if it is a war which seems to be necessary. But the film shows the opposite. The film depicts the war and especially the enemies like John Wayne did it in The Green Berets and it's a horrible image of the US army having leading soldiers like the figure of Moore. What's it like to be a father and a soldier Geoghegan asks (in a church!)and the only thing Moore has to answer is that God should help him to kill that other b...... . Is that reality? And is it authentic to show thousands of running and screaming Vietnamese soldiers like those guys we saw in the 50s and 60s? It maybe a realistic depiction according to some of the quoted veterans here in the user comments. I don't blame those, but please don't forget: It is nothing more than a single event, a single perspective, a film and a story. I prefer to understand a war movie as something mono-dimensional about a complex truth. Wallace and Gibson say nothing more but: Vietnam, Politics, doubts, sorrow, pain and grief? Ah, come on, f... it. They Were Soldiers and they were heroes, there's nothing more to say. I have only one word for that: propaganda. I really do hope that the whole American society doesn't think like Wallace and Gromit, sorry, Gibson. But there is still a spark of hope in the war film genre. Thank's, Clint. Some flaws, but many opportunities for contemplation about something that is not simple to understand.",2,4,10,8 February 2007
Bird Box," You have seen this before...
","Undoubtedly great acting and lots of suspense. A well crafted piece, and surely a strong addition to the genre. But: yes, it will feel like you have seen it all before. Monsters, but not real monsters in a sense that the idea ever gets more of an explanation. Apocalyptic and as usual the real fright comes from the evil in people and the real test is courage and how humane we can remain to be in such situations. Frankly, quite boring and if you know that there won't be any sort of understanding in the end, equally annoying to watch. Just compare it to Black Mirror, where a great idea can actually lead the story, not like here, where everything is quite predictable and too much driven by typical plot elements...",4,1,2,28 December 2018
Prometheus," Disappointing
","Ridley Scott! Uneblievable. What a disappointment. So much to look forward to, so much to experience. Then, what disaster. Absolutely no sense at all, pointless plot, really poor storytelling, nothing makes sense, scenes without any connection. I am speechless. Good sound editing, good visual effects. Point taken, someone threw money in and said, make it look nice, don't worry about meaning or sense, the 3D-event-and-sensation-generation swallow any nonsense. And so Ridley did. Hard to believe, this was meant to be like that. If anyone has an explanation for this, please come forward, but truly, nothing in this film is coherent or within the story or the setting plausible. Very disappointing.",3,8,13,26 June 2012
Life," Groundhog day Hollywood
","Another piece of evidence for the crisis of filmmaking in Hollywood. Well crafted and by all means masterly produced and acted. But, why? Why make superhero movies, and, here, horror films which are pretty much exactly the same as you have seen it before? Are mainstream audiences seriously that dull and forgetful so you can just throw the same piece of film at them again and again?
The horror genre as many other genres really needs another Blair Witch moment, fresh innovative ideas, good stories.
The great cast feels a bit wasted here.",4,2,3,26 February 2019
The Thin Red Line," Unforgettable
","It is about four years ago, when I saw The thin red line. I read about many famous actors who were very keen on working together with Terence Malick on this film. Later I could understand their interest. It's what I would call a anti-war-movie, but it does not only show shocking pictures, or needs a banal love story in order to show the beast of war. It shows that everyone looses his life in war, whether one gets killed or not. There is no politic and no justification in the movie, just a poetic approach towards the fate of uncountable wasted lives and the response to refuse war. I can really recommend the movie. There are so many fantastic actors to see, the cinematography is outstanding. Don't miss it.",10,3,7,10 July 2004
