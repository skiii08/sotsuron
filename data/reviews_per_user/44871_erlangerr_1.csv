Whip It," Let Down
","I am a big fan of Ellen Page, Drew Barrymore and Alia Shawkat. Naturally I had high hopes that this would be a unique, quirky, indie and generally good movie. What a let down!Here are the stupid things about this movie:* endless spirals of clich√©s including conservative '50's housewife', reconciling food fight, indie boy-crush in band, beauty pageant queen turned roller derby star and mother turning up to championship against all odds (not) * nerdy twig of a girl asked to join a roller-derby team * G rated underage, underwater sex scene SANS condomNOT compelling!! no no no",4,15,29,20 January 2010
