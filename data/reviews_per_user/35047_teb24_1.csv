The Benchwarmers," More than Funny!
","I took my 13 year old daughter and her grand father for his birthday, we all laughed so hard! This movie is everything great without having to be worried about my teen seeing something inappropriate! Adam Sandler.............give us more! This was the hardest I have laughed at a movie since Mr. Deeds! I thought it was great the way there was a message to kids particularly when my daughter is almost 6 ft tall! Thanks so much for great, clean humor....I wish Hollywood would understand we need more movies we can attend with the kids without taking them to a Disney movie. Bottom line.......hilariously funny with a message!",10,5,10,22 April 2006
