Vertigo," A minor correction
","I just read an incorrect comment on this movie.  Andrew 162 remarked about the 'shape of the church tower' and referred to its location as San Francisco.  In fact, that adobe building, is Mission San Juan Bautista, which is about 100 miles south of San Francisco off Hwy 101. The Coroner's Jury scene is also filmed in the same town, in one of the historic buildings there.  Mission San Juan is one of the original California missions, and is the oldest continuously operating church in the state.  The bell tower in the movie was a set constructed by Hitchcock, there was no bell tower there at the time, but there is one there now, which was constructed since.  Lastly, the scene in the automobile in which they are 'driving down' to San Juan Bautista, the divided highway with the eucalyptus trees, is actually still there, but it is located south of San Juan Bautista on the way to Salinas, so they would not have passed that stretch of highway between San Francisco and San Juan Bautista.  Maybe this is 'too much information,' but I had to get it out there.",Null,3,3,22 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," I walked out.
","I couldn't take this movie.  I loved the books, read them all, including 'The Hobbit.'  I even liked the animated version that came out in the '70's. There were some lovely things in this film, liked Elijah Wood, liked the sets, costumes, etc. My major problem with this movie was that it was very cold in tone.  It went from battle to battle, and the scenes in between the fighting were little more than 'whew!'  The books were emotional, the books were involving, evocative.  This was awful.  When the characters emerged from the underground dwarf mines, and I realized that they had at least two set-piece battles remaining, I was out of there. It was a shame to waste such a talented cast.",Null,0,0,21 February 2002
