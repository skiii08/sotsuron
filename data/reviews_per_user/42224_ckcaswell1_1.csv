Come and See," Hauntingly Truthful Movie
","Come and See blew me away from the first bomb that exploded. The beginning sequence that Saving Private Ryan mimicked was breath taking and eerily haunting with the contrasting dark greens and blues of the landscape. Every second of the movie after that was ripping your heart out of your chest and tearing it to pieces. Every shot from the extreme close ups of Florya and Glasha to the continuous long shots at the end just add to the hauntingly beautiful cinematography and heart wrenching story. Even though this movie does leave you feeling emotionally drained at the end, you don't regret seeing it. You start to understand the dark side of war and fighting and how it isn't always about glory and honor, as Hollywood often makes war out to be.",7,1,1,13 June 2009
