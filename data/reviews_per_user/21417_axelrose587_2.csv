The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Best film of 2012... In my opinion.
","Every decade has their coming-of-age story. People of the sixties had The Last Picture Show, seventies had American Graffiti, eighties had Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles, and the only thing I can think of that the nineties had was She's All That. And now my generation of teenagers has Perks of Being a Wallflower. Based on the coming-of-age novel, which I haven't read, the movie follows Charlie, played by the guy from Percy Jackson, and his trials and tribulations of being a freshman in high school. He then meets Patrick, who I swear is a gay version of me, and his sister in law, Sam, played by Emma Watson (Harry Potter). This is an interesting blend of a lighter beat era film mixed with The Last Picture Show. It shows just how naive Charlie is going into high school. Like eating pot brownies, feeling awkward in different environments, and just being a wallflower a lot of the time. He find someone he loves and doesn't really know how to handle it because he's never loved before. He knows he loves her but doesn't know how to tell her and doesn't really know how to react when he dates somebody who he doesn't love. All three of the characters go through the usual mishaps in high school. Patrick is in love with the school's quarterback and they have a secret relationship because they are afraid that the people they love will resent them. It's a sad thing to have to live with being gay and I understand what he's going through. Then Sam is very promiscuous, always getting drunk and sleeping with men. When she finds love and then have it ripped away at the end, you feel heart broken for her because you love these characters by the end and you want to see them lead a good life in college. There's a line in the movie that perfectly sums up this movie, and life in high school. 'Why do I, and everyone I love, pick people who treat us like we're nothing?' And the answer is, 'We accept the love we think we deserve.' That speaks volumes because I actually know people who feels like this. It's amazing just how right this movie is. I do understand gays being shunned in school, and feeling awkward around a group of people, and having people treat you like we are nothing. I've never seen a movie where I feel a little bit like all of the characters. The performances are strong, the music is awesome, and you walk out of the theater knowing that no matter how bad life may feel in high school, it'll all be better in 1460 days.",10,4,8,8 November 2012
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Interesting
","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is the old school video game and manga style live action story of an awkward twenty two year old Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) who lives with his gay friend, Wallace (Kieran Culkin). He finds love in Not Kate Winslet from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, or Ramona (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). But in order to win her heart he has to get through her eight ex's. Now I am not a Michael Cera fan so it was difficult going into this knowing he was the star. The only reason I wanted to see this movie was the high recommendations. My first impressions of this movie were that it's stylistically beautiful and imaginative. The humor meshes well with the characters and situations, and the plot was very old school video game inspired and worked in the live action setting. But on the other hand, Scott Pilgrim is a terrible person. He's a socially awkward fourteen year old stalker who throws away girlfriends like cheeseburger rappers. He hurts a girl who loves him, even though she's slightly crazy, for a more 'interesting' looking girl. My hatred for this character made watching this movie very difficult because when Scott got beaten up I was cheering because he's way out of this girl's league. She is a vulnerable girl who is dating a spineless wimp. But what changed my mind was the ending where he defeats the final ex through the power of self confidence. And after he's won her heart, he realizes how much of a horrible human being he was. He matures and comes to terms with the fact that he has hurt his old girlfriends. And you realize that the reason Ramona dated him was because she ran away from her past, which was filled with ex's who treated her wrongly. She wanted somebody who was harmless. No matter who. But by the end she realizes that he really loves her and is willing to go the distance to protect her. He also mends his old girlfriend's wounds, and she forgives him. The movie as a whole is a feast for the eyes, but doesn't choose style over substance. It balances the two well.",7,1,4,1 February 2013
