The King's Speech," a movie about a King learning leadership
","I have not yet seen this movie, but I might as well write some words about it because I was inspired by the plot line. I myself have had a hard time taking up the courage to speak in front of a lot of people so this movie which is about the King himself learning to lead his followers with the help of a speech counselor intrigued me. Often, when a movie is about the era of the kings, it is about war. However, the director of 'The King's speech' focused on the process of developing one's leadership and gaining the trust of the majority. Edward, who is often the popular image, is depicted quite negatively, contrasted to King George who rose step-by-step.",9,0,0,15 March 2011
