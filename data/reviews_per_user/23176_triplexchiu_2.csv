Miracle," A touching movie
","I remember when watching this film and I now own this movie on DVD and its one very touching movie. The Evil Empire had just invaded Afghanistan and things just couldn't get any worse. The effects of the Vietnam War, inflation rates were high, economy was just terrible and to add more to the effect, the Iran Hostage Crisis. 56 American soldiers were taken hostage and it was a public humiliation to the people of America and something known as the lack of confidence was a major factor in the lives of the American people. Because of these events, this is the reason why the Miracle On Ice was considered 1 of the best moments in sporting history. It showed how the players bonded together and pulled off the impossible and caused the biggest upset in history!",10,1,2,5 January 2006
Grave of the Fireflies," Its a film you watch once and thats it cos its damn sad
","The title of this review says it all. Its a film that you will watch once and then cry then don't ever watch again. Why?? Because it is the truth and quite possibly telling a story of a real life family in Japan during the time of war.Real sad that the war had cost so many lives and that the people in their own country suffer harshly as a result of it.This movie tells the story of a boy who is doing his very best to look after his little sister and his struggle along the way in trying to look after his sister. This involved not telling her of what is happening in Japan to keep her comfortable.Warning: This is not a typical Hiyao Miyzaki film where it is an adventure and some heroic ending occurs. Or some happy ending. This is a film that has an ending that will leave you shocked, crying. This is perhaps Hiyao's best film ahead of Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke.",10,1,4,10 July 2006
