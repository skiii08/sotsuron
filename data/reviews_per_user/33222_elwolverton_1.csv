The New World," His Finest
","Easily the most artful film of 2005, and the crowning jewel of Malick's career. I though he had permanently outdone himself with The Thin Red Line, but this is a more focused, affecting film than its predecessor. This is the closest I've ever felt to *watching* fine literature or poetry on film. If you have an open, patient mind, you will be richly rewarded.Others have commented on the sluggishness of the film, or on Malick's over-reliance on natural footage to fill in for storytelling and characterization. I think there is a fine line of ambiguity in symbolism. Malick walks this line like a world class trapeze artist. Every time I watch this film, I come away with new layers of interpretation. Oo ah oo ah, etc. Go see this film.",9,0,2,1 June 2006
