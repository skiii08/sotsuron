The Blair Witch Project," Stark Terror Unleashed on unsuspecting populace!
","Go see this movie and oh, by the way, bring your cross, Bible or whatever your representation of what keeps you safe in this crazy world happens to be.This is a great movie in spite of (because of?) the budget.  It is simple and I think that's the reason it makes for a great story.  Horror, true horror is simple.  Nothing to distract you from what's happening and in this case, the filmmakers have excelled.I'm sure by now you all have heard, read or seen the basic premise of the movie which is (bear with me :) the story of three film college students wandering off into the Black Hills of Maryland in search of the mythical Blair Witch named after the town which bears the heavy burden of being the witch's primary target.  These three disappear, never to be seen again in spite of 33000 man-hours of searching and then a year later, their footage is recovered.The movie opens up with the kids in happier times, excited at the prospect of making a 'kick-ass' movie.  In high spirits, they take off into the dense forest armed with their video cameras and the usual accoutrements of camping: a book entitled 'How to Survive in the Woods', compasses and a map. Things take a turn for the worse when their sole map suddenly goes missing and things begin to go bump in the night.  One can sense terror beginning to creep into our character's lives insidiously and almost imperceptibly as they try to gather their wits about them.'It's impossible to get lost in America!' one of the characters, Amanda, is heard to affirm with a little trepidation as day rapidly approaches night. Little does she know! Go find out what happens next.  I guarantee you won't sleep so easy after seeing this movie.What I have a problem with is this: The common-sense tactics anyone lost in the woods employs to get un-lost is nowhere to be found in the movie. There's a scene where our doomed travelers decide, after the loss of their only map, to travel south and end up going around in a huge circle.  They made this decision while standing next to a stream!  Everyone, or at least, I hope everyone knows that one way to get un-lost in the woods is to follow a stream which won't turn on itself and usually ends up leading out of the woods. Another is the insane insistence that they have of taking their cameras and shooting film everywhere they went.  'Normal' people don't do that but I guess that without this, there'd be no movie and what fun would that be? <wink> <wink>",9,0,0,4 August 1999
Any Given Sunday," Ready for some football?
","Being a long-time resident of south Florida, I found the story of this most excellent movie familiar.  Stone surely must have based the QB (Randy Quaid in one of his best roles ever)on the aging Dan Marino of the Miami Dolphins. Whatever his inspiration, Mr. Stone has done a wonderful job (again). This expos√© of Football, as it were, is craftily and beautifully executed.You feel what it must feel like to be on the field on any given Sunday: the utter confusion, the terror of knowing that three 250 pound line-men are rushing at top speed to take you down, the need to concentrate beyond your overpowering fatigue, the constant ebb and flow of confidence as you line-up against your opponents.  All of these components of the gridiron has been captured in a captivating manner by the great Stone, who, as usual in his movies, has a small part.  There isn't a single actor I can fault.  Nigh perfect casting followed nigh perfect performances.The potential for a confusion is neatly and simply averted; the flow of the movie, in spite of Stone's signature cutaways, is logical so you don't feel overwhelmed by the action.  The behind-the-scenes look at Football management is not only enlightening but thought-provoking.  Al Pacino is excellent and so is Cameron Diaz.  Their scenes together are fraught with tension.  Lawrence Taylor, Jim Brown and some of Football's greatest players and coaches lend even more credence to the 'Footballity' of this movie. You also get to see how this game affects the families and friends of the players, for good or usually, for bad.I love this movie and think it is the best Football movie of the century.",10,3,5,27 December 1999
The Matrix," 'What I did on my Spring Break'
","Having put up with so much drivel at the theatres recently, I sat down in the plush seats of my neighbourhood theatre not expecting much and I was pleasantly surprised, to say the least. The plot/theme is not original but very well here adapted to screen. The acting is par excellence (for Keanu :) and the fight sequences are tremendously exciting; moves every little boy wishes he could use to thwart bullies the next day at school! Try as one might, there are very few holes that can be poked in the logic of this movie. I hereby award this movie three karate chops out of three and a half. :-)",Null,0,0,7 April 1999
