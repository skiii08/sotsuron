The Ring," Officially freaky, but...
","Horror movies had been for a long time regarded as the more bloody it is, the scarier it will be. Take for instance the 'Friday the 13th' movies. After a little while, it became ridiculous. When 'The Sixth Sense' came out, M. Night Shyamalan re-ignited the sense that scary doesn't always have to be someone after you, but the unknown. The mystery.A mystery is a good description for 'The Ring'. The scary story comes out of the belief that if you watch a certain video tape, you will die in seven days. Why? That is what the story is all about. That alone is kind of freaky. Just to think that by watching a video you will die kind of gives one the 'eebie jeebies'.'The Ring' doesn't waste time on gore. There are only a couple of moments that there are glimpses of disturbing images. They are on the screen so briefly that it almost acts as a camera giving you a mental picture of what the people looked like after they died. I was surprised though that it only received a PG-13 rating. I really don't recommend to anyone that they allow there 13 year-old to see it. They WILL have nightmares. Either that or they'll never want to watch another video again. Especially if they just find it.",7,0,0,20 August 2003
X2: X-Men United," A Great Movie with Surprises.
","The only basis for judging this film was on the first X-Men. I wasn't thrilled with the first movie. I thought the action scenes were cut a little short and when I finally got a small dose of some fights, it ended rather quickly. To be frank, the X-Men got their butts kicked. And on top of that, they did not leave any time for some growth. The movie was one hour and forty minutes long. I was keeping my fingers crossed going in to the second movie. I was not disappointed. At a great two hours and 15 minutes, the film left enough room for character development and wonderful action scenes. Some unexpected twists and good acting accompanied the script as well as visual effects that surpassed the first one. Go see this movie in the theatres. You will not regret it. 9/10",8,0,0,5 May 2003
