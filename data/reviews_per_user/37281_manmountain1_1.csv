United 93," Tragedy accurately depicted!!!
","As I am writing from Greensboro,NC this plane had a special place on the local scene. One of the stewardesses, Ms Bradshaw was from here. After I watched this movie, the local TV news had interviews with both her Mother, as well as her Sister. Also interviewed were patrons at the theater that first showed this re-enactment. I will not go into details of how the tragedy unfolded; it was widely covered by the media at the time. The thing that impressed me was to watch it unfold made the viewer feel like they were a part of the scene, feeling the feelings that the passengers felt. It was as if you were there, hoping to change the known outcome. The accuracy and facts were carefully researched. Waiting 4 1/2 years after this incident was like a new wake-up call, that it could happen again. A must-see film.",10,6,13,29 April 2006
