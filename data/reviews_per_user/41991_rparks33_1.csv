The Hangover," The Hangover
","The Hangover is a movie about some guys (Stu, Doug, Alan, Phil) who go to Vegas for a bachelor party. The bachelor party is for Doug and it is just a few days before the wedding is supposed to happen. While in Vegas the group ends up losing Doug and the whole movie is their journey to find him. They try to back track (from what they can remember) and find him.There were a few reasons why this movie was so great. For one, the cast couldn't have been much better than what it was. Zach Galifianakis is one of the funniest people in Hollywood today. Also, it's a really catchy movie and is very easy to quote without even realizing it such as 'Driving drunk... Classic!' Another reason I loved this movie so much is because it was appealing to people MY age (college student) and even people much older than me.I do not have very many complaints about this movie. There were a couple parts that I thought were a little slower than the rest. For instance, when they are in the desert at the end with the Asian (for those who have seen it know what I'm talking about and for those who haven't will know after you see it). Another bad part was Tyson's acting. I understand he's a boxer and not an actor but it could've been someone else famous who knew how to act a little better.Overall, I was very pleased with the movie and I am now a proud owner of the DVD. It will always be a classic to me as my DVD collection grows.",8,3,6,24 January 2011
