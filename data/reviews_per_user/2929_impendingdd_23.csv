The Avengers," A successful failure
","Yes, those exist. The soundtrack of this film couldn't have been more generic it's depressing to the ears. The jokes are corny and are only mildly funny at the theater with other folks upon the first viewing. It's try hard comedy. The film itself is a joke and a massive disappointment. These are awesome heroes. The film should have been more awesome. It could have. It could have had great writing, less alien CGI and more care for its characters. It's simply, boring. But hey if you like action, if you like generic, if you like CGI, if you laugh at anything, if you love these comic book heroes so much you'll make yourself believe this is a good movie just so you can be happy, then great for you! All power to you. But this is as average as average cinema gets. And I stand by that.",1,1,4,11 March 2020
Us," Peele isn't a horror master
","Peele's sophomore horror film proves that Get Out was a fluke. Get out was by no means a masterpiece either. Here, in US Peele awkwardly blends horror and comedy and it doesn't work. The Alexza scene was so forced. The voices of the woman doppelgänger was so distracting and bad. Like someone was trying to make a horror film at home with friends. Peele has to get off this idea that because he has some pretentious opening and fresh new idea, he's going to have a master film. You have to tighten the screws for an overall coherent and consistent picture. P.S. For those wondering, the film provides no scares.",1,7,12,27 March 2020
Moana," Disney has a new low standard
","Whatever happened to casting singers or actors who can actually carry a tune? Whatever happened to Disney movies that had amazing soundtracks. It seems as though we've accepted the mediocrity of what Disney now is and we don't expect better or the best anymore. Watch a classic Disney film from 90's or early 2000's and tell me Disney hasn't lost their touch. I'm not saying this is a bad film, no, it's just 'good'. That's the problem. What's stopping them from hiring people who can really sing? The formula is really quite simple. They certainly have the money for it.",1,1,6,19 June 2020
BlacKkKlansman," Spike's a has been.
","Spike oughta hang his hat and go watch a Knicks game, film isn't his forte anymore. It was clear he was a has been when he took the job of remaking 'Old Boy' in 2013, an unnecessary and lazily directed remake. Spike also won't watch Django Unchained because he thinks it's racist. The guys a complete joke. You're a has been, Spike!",1,4,20,1 April 2020
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Why do they keep having brits play American superheroes?
",This film lost all credibility when Parker says a Dominican lady gave him a churro. Churros are made and sold by Mexicans mostly. In fact it's a widely known thing in NYC. The innacuracy here is racist and makes it seem like the writers were trying very hard to be New York. The film overall is mediocre and doesn't match the heart of Raimi's Spider-Man films.,1,0,5,27 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A Disgrace
",A very messy film. This trilogy was entirely depressing. When looked at in its entirety it seems like such a waste of time. It's very bad. They should have gave the job to Favreu from the very start. But thats just the way these things go. A plane crash of a trilogy. Truly baffling. I imagine 8 year olds and Disney fanatics will see this film as just fine. I'm not even that much of a Star Wars fan and I still saw how bad this film was. 'Space Balls' is more of a Star Wars movie than this preposterous attempt at a space opera.,1,7,16,19 March 2020
Bohemian Rhapsody," 8.0 rating is absurd.
","This film was horrendous. Ruined Queen for me, overhyped. Typical music film about a rock band. Nothing new to see here.",1,1,9,1 April 2020
Bird Box," Overrated garbage
","A movie for stay at home moms and teenagers who love memes. If you have any grasp on what a good film is, this movie isn't for you.",1,7,10,19 March 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Rated far too high
","Another generic Marvel film. Forced jokes. Lots of CGI. The Hulk is a complete joke in this movie (So is Thor), waste of a good actor and character. It's the ultimate Marvel movie, and we don't get to see Hulk go berserk? Totally lame. There was a lot of wasted opportunity in this film, it isn't by any means a great movie. Russo brothers are lame. This movie was so anticlimactic, Marvel tried so hard to give their characters heart and soul as they wrapped up the franchise. If you've seen this movie once there's no need to watch it again.",1,10,18,31 March 2020
Toy Story 4," SHOCKED at good reviews.
","This movie has no heart or soul. It's the sloppiest Toy Story film yet. It could have easily been a movie of its own it didn't need to be Toy Story 4 and tarnish the movies before it. Key and Peele in this movie was a big mistake. They don't fit at all. Buzz is hardly in it. Bo Peep is a completely different character. And I'm all for change, trust me, but at least have it make sense. And don't get me started on Forky. This should have been a spin off or Disney Channel movie not a feature film. Very lazy film they tried throwing in some heart feltness but make no mistake, it's a cash grab. We're living in a day and age where morals have gone out the window. Don't show this to your child please, they're guaranteed to turn out a psychopath.",1,0,3,22 March 2020
It Follows," Don't listen to the good reviews. Not horror.
","I can't count how many people have said this movie was scary. I imagine these are the same folks who thought Babadook was good, or even decent horror. It's a teen flick trying to imitate horror. Very anticlimactic. About one jump scare that actually works. The idea of the film is interesting but it misses the mark of execution, totally. If you consider yourself a true fan of horror, keep scrolling when you see this film pop up on your steaming service.",1,1,3,11 March 2020
The Lion King," Amazing achievement in CGI
","I can't possibly give this film a lower rating. To be fair, when compared to the original animated film, yes the voice acting and and spirit and fun is inferior. But if you want to see The Lion King cartoon, go watch it. No one is forcing you to replace that one with this new remake worth realistic animation. The CGI here has you looking at animals twice in disbelief. In a few years to come we won't be able to tell the difference. That's an amazing revolutionary achievement. It shouldn't be downplayed. Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner as Pumba and Timone are a duo of much needed comic relief for the film. The jokes work. My problem with the film is I don't understand why a lot of the voice actors couldn't make a return. James Earl Jones returned as Mufasa which was a little weaker than his first performance. The Heyenas, all different, still a little funny at times but again don't match or exceed the original. But you know for a practically shot for shot remake it really isn't that bad. I enjoyed this movie it still touched me the way the original did. I enjoyed the little changes and appreciated what they kept the same. It's one of the best remakes of a Disney Film thus far. One final thing, BeyoncÃ©'s new 'Spirit' song feels completely forced and doesn't really fit. It sounds like a gospel song and it really was entirely unnecessary. She's fine as the voice of Nala and Donald Glover aka Chidlish Gambino is good too. In conclusion it's not as bad as folks are saying and it's not amazing either. I enjoyed seeing the story of the Lion King with realistic animals.",10,0,4,27 March 2020
A Quiet Place," Overrated
",What's Jim doing out of the office? Making a copy of the film 'Signs' by M. Night? I think so! This film leads you to believe it's a horror film and it isn't by any means that. It's a home movie made by John and his wife Blunt. And everyone's buying it!,1,3,6,4 April 2020
1917," Another typical war movie
","British accents are so unbearably annoying. Walked out the theater, couldn't take it.",1,4,13,24 March 2020
Jurassic World," Weak film. Franchise defiled.
","These 'World' films are pure garbage, and if you think otherwise you're probably either forcing yourself to like them, you're a child, or you're simply an idiot who likes bad movies. The CGI in these films are horrendous and distracting. Chris Pratt as an action star is laughable. Dude's boring and overrated. Jurassic Park 3 was infinitely better than this cash grab. Save your money.",1,0,2,24 March 2020
The Dark Knight," Possibly the most overrated film of all time
","Some things I will never understand. Women, why we exist on earth, and the massive praise this film has received since its release in 2008. The Dark Knight is truly overrated. For starters, Bale's Batman voice is laughable and distracting. It's horrendous. The score of this film is so tedious it feels like one giant trailer, it fails to recognize suspense. The film itself is a wannabe gangster film and it's very boring. I will give it to Nolan though, he may very well be a genius. He made a comic book film as close to real life as possible, which I theorize caused so many people to praise the film itself to be genius. It was something very different. But that's not enough to make a movie 'the best movie of all time', as I've heard it being referred to. I've tried countless times to give this movie a chance. Over and over struggling to find out why it's held so high. I cannot say that I simply dismissed it, I've actually tried. And yes, I'm fully aware of Heath Ledger's performance and that it was a key element of this film's praise and success. And yes Ledger was terrific, that's apparent. His annoying tongue tick aside and tiring faux 'you wanna know how I got these scars' stories, he became the Joker. But that just wasn't enough for me, the film isn't a masterpiece, not even close. It's almost as bad as your typical action film. You know what, who is anyone kidding, this is a typical action movie with Batman. I don't care about the characters, there's too many distractions. I am still in search for someone who will agree with me, as it seems that everyone holds this film to a high standard.",1,9,15,2 March 2020
12 Years a Slave," 12 years of boredom
","McQueen saw Django and had to make this film which, while it's more historically accurate, isn't nearly as entertaining. A bore.",1,3,7,27 March 2020
Inception," Nolan should retire.
","Nolan's only good movie was Interstellar. The man makes the most boring films in existence and idiots will eat it up, even if he directed literal dog poo on the sidewalk, and hail him a 'genius'. Give me a break. I had a dream within a dream within a dream that people actually saw Nolan for the con artist he is.",1,4,17,2 April 2020
Lord of War," Fantastic Film
","Cage, Hawke, and Leto are perfect actors in this bold picture about international gun trade. It's an entertaining, thought provoking, and heart aching demonstration in a near flawless depiction of what is arguably one of the biggest controversies globally, but more narrowly, in the United States. Cage often takes films that give you something to think about. Widening the perspective in a scale you can't deny and painting a story that forces you to listen. The cinematography and editing is consistent and captivating. The acting and dialogue is fluent and realistic. It's exciting and engaging, never boring, from start to finish. And to top it off, the soundtrack is really quite awesome. Cage is a joy to watch as a quick witted international arms dealer, with a supporting cast that does very well too. It's undeniably one of his best.",10,0,0,22 April 2020
Black Panther," Extremely overrated.
",Nothing special about this film. Might as well be watching Captain America. Really overhyped. I can't believe people actually say this movie should have won Oscars LMFAO.,1,1,2,5 April 2020
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Average at best
","A ten year old could honestly write a better script. Ben Affleck is a terrific Batman and Zack Snyder and his writers failed him in this and in Justice League. But make no mistake, this is a much better film that JL. There are some scenes that are great and make me wish the film was consistently great. The 'Versus' part, the fight alone begins epic but quickly dissolves and disappoints. I guess you can say these folks really don't care about fan pleasing because the fight is so short, I mean c'mom! Give the people what they want! An epic fight, not some warehouse brawl we get in every other action flick. It could have been infinitely better. Jesse Eisenberg was interesting. Not sure if that means good. We've never seen a Lex Luther quite like him that's for sure. The film just feels sloppy but somehow withholding on some awesome potential. Armored Batman is cool as hell! The dream sequence was bad ass! 'Do you bleed?' Is an epic line. But what good is it when everything else doesn't match these epic scenes, am I supposed to sit through the bad parts to see the little bit of good? I suppose that's what YouTube is for. But Batman V Superman was a long awaited, epic event and just did not deliver. I left the theater feeling cheated but somehow a little confused because I did enjoy what actually worked. That being said, with so many films hitting the mark on everything, it's really no excuse.",1,2,7,22 March 2020
Godzilla," I think I saw Godzilla but I'm not sure
","I'm sure he has to be in this movie, I mean it is called Godzilla. But all I saw was a bunch of people. Go figure!",1,1,2,24 March 2020
The Simpsons Movie," Perfect movie
","A classic American family film with heart, hilariously clever jokes, adventure, and superb animation.",10,0,0,19 June 2020
