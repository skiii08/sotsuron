The Blair Witch Project," Pretty scary, but...
","I went into this movie not knowing any of the (apparently quite extensive) backstory, or having been exposed to much of the (also apparently quite extensive) hype. The only reason I went was that my best friend who, unlike myself, actually enjoys horror movies, dragged me. I dislike horror movies; I do not enjoy being scared at all.That said, I found the film's execution to be extremely effective. It scared me a lot more than gallons of blood and incessant computer-generated special effects could have. The reason is that it had very little overt shock material. Instead, it built up a creepy atmosphere and let the audience' imagination fill in the blanks. The fact that it was filmed in a quasi-realistic manner, without any discernible production values, made willing suspension of disbelief that much easier. There was no soundtrack to remind you 'hey, this is a movie.' There were no special effects. The footage was not a perfect, obviously studio-polished product. It was essentially a 90-minute campfire ghost story.In short, I suspect that anyone with a functioning imagination will be frightened by this movie. Anyone who approaches it from a purely passive standpoint ('I'm not going to think at all while I watch this.') will not be scared, because the movie never actually shows anything scary; it just prods you into frightening yourself, which in the end is far more effective than if it had ended with some Lovecraftian horror popping out and devouring Our Heroes. There will always be someone out there who says 'Hmm... I always pictured Cthulhu as being more of a purplish colour.' However, by avoiding any direct encounter with the monster, no one is disappointed. Their imagination will come up with something that is frightening to them, without having to worry about what the filmmakers thought would look/sound/act scary.",8,0,0,12 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," About on par with the first Star Wars.
","Like the first Star Wars movie, The Phantom Menace lacks involved character development, concentrating instead on whiz-bang, gosh-wow special effects. The plot itself is much more sophisticated than that of Star Wars, with mildly convoluted political maneuvering taking the place of the first movie's straightforward save-the-world, fairy-tale type story. While still pretty obvious, the overarching plot doesn't reach out and clobber you over the head like those of the first three Star Wars movies.Special effects are quite well-done. The computer-generated characters, while still displaying the preternatural, almost gelatinous flexibility common to their ilk, are quite realistic and for the most part meld in well with their real costars. Other effects are at a similarly high level of excellence. You can't tell that most of the sets and vehicles don't really exist.Speaking of sets, I believe that sets and costuming were the strongest feature of The Phantom Menace. They conveyed very effectively an atmosphere of opulent, otherworldy decadence. If the court of Louis XIV were to be transported to a galaxy far, far away, I can easily see it looking like Coruscant or the royal palace on Naboo. Even those outrageous costumes that Natalie Portman is made to wear fit in with the film's ambiance.Now for the bad news. The biggest item of bad news has a name, and his name is Jar Jar Binks. This easily-merchandised virtual actor is easily the most obnoxious feature of the movie. His antics effectively defuse most any dramatic tension in any scene he's in... and he is in more scenes than practically anyone else. His accent (and that of the other Gungans) verges on the offensively stereotypical, and a lot of times is almost incomprehensible. Why not simply have him talk in an alien tongue, as was common in the first three films? The same question applies to the Trade Federation aliens, whose bizarre quasi-East-Asian accents were inexplicable.The humans have a pretty rough time of it too. Jake Lloyd gives a game performance for a nine-year-old, but the fact that he's a little kid means that he's not quite as good as his grown-up colleagues at delivering bad lines in a way that won't make the audience groan. Ewan McGregor is given hardly any opportunity to exercise his considerable acting talents; most of Obi-Wan's words and actions are nothing more than reaction to Qui-Gon. His imitation of Alec Guinness' accent is dead-on, though. Liam Neeson gives a fairly good performance as stoic Qui-Gon, and Natalie Portman is likewise pretty good as the Queen. All of them, though, have a common problem: awful lines... a problem which is common to the first Star Wars movie, before George Lucas started CO-writing the screenplays instead of lone-wolfing it.To sum up: a very entertaining movie. Also a movie that could have been made better in many, many simple ways. It sets the stage well for the next few installments in the series; we'll see if the next two pay more careful attention to character development and other non-computer-generated things.",7,0,0,23 May 1999
There's Something About Mary," Not quite what I'd expected.
","Yeah, a lot of the humour in this movie is in pretty bad taste. Most everyone knows about the hair-gel scene, the zipper scene, the dog scene, etc. If all the jokes had been like that, I would have walked away feeling disgusted and thinking 'boy, that was nearly as much of a waste of time as Kingpin.'Strangely, though, I found myself enjoying the film quite a bit. It was definitely not high art, but much of it was quite amusing. I believe that what did it for me was the singing narrator who just randomly pops up every so often to give a plot synopsis. That and the fact that the whole story was just so darn warm and fuzzy that I couldn't help liking it.If possible, watch this movie with a large group of college students. That should suffice to foster the mindset necessary to truly appreciate There's Something About Mary.",Null,0,0,11 April 1999
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," A masterpiece of modern comedy.
","I'll say right up front that this is one of my favourite comedies of all time. What's not to like? The heroes are cheerfully good-natured and amusingly idiotic, and the plot has enough clever historical references and parodies to make it enjoyable for those whose cognitive functions are more fully developed than those of the movie's eponymous dork-heroes. The jokes are funny and the characters are lovable.All in all, an enjoyable comic romp that remains light-hearted and funny right up until the end.",10,0,1,11 April 1999
The Matrix," Good action-packed fun.
","The Matrix is essentially a revised version of Dark City, with the noirish elements replaced by cyberpunk elements and the brooding suspense replaced by furious action. And, of course, with Kiefer Sutherland's overacting replaced by Keanu Reeves' underacting.The actors do solid jobs, but the film's real strength lies not with its (cardboard) characters, its (silly) plot, or its (derivative) ideas, but with its exceptionally well-executed action sequences, nicely enhanced by some impressive but not overdone special effects. It's not a movie to make you think, but if you're in the mood for some good, exciting action, The Matrix ought not to disappoint you. Turn off the cerebrum and rev up that adrenal cortex, and you'll do fine.",8,0,0,11 April 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Not great cinema, but good fun.
","Star Wars is not the greatest movie ever made. The plot is essentially 'the brave knight fights the dragon and saves the princess from the dark castle.' A lot of the characterization is pretty silly.However, it is still a very entertaining film. It's full of action, adventure, and good-natured heroism. The special effects now look somewhat cheesy, and a lot of the dialogue is just ridiculous, but heck, that just adds to the fun. Star Wars may not provide deep insights into the human condition, but it sure delivers good, swashbuckling escapism.The recently-released 'Special Edition' is in fact inferior to the original. While the special effects have been 'enhanced' by Industrial Light and Magic's digital whiz kids, these slick computerized FX look out of place beside the rest of the movie's more 'primitive' visuals. As for the much-ballyhooed added scenes... well, let's just say that there was a reason that they were cut from the original. Some other alterations are just foolish. It's still fun, but not as much fun as Star Wars' original incarnation.",7,1,4,23 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Best of the Star Wars line.
","Better than Star Wars. Better than Return of the Jedi. And do you know why? Because it spends more time on character development and dramatic buildup than either of its siblings. While The Empire Strikes Back does include its share of space battles and lightsaber duels, the big focus isn't on special effects, but on relationships between characters. The heroes and villains are both developed in interesting ways, plus there's that surprise twist which you probably already know about, but which I won't risk spoiling for you.The Special Edition of this movie is also the best of the three. Except for the dopey, fake-looking Wampa-eats-a-Tantan-like-a-corncob scene, and the bloodcurdling scream that's been dubbed in when Luke throws himself into the bottomless ventilation shaft, most of the added/retouched stuff is pretty good. I was very impressed by what was done with Cloud City, and felt that it added greatly to those scenes. Darth Vader has a somewhat silly-sounding new line, but I liked the way the final chase scene was intercut with him flying back to the Star Destroyer.Definitely not the popcorn-gobbling big-screen videogame that Star Wars and Return of the Jedi are, but certainly superior to both in atmosphere, characterization, and execution.",9,0,0,23 May 1999
