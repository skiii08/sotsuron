The Ring," a VERY good movie indeed ...
","Before seeing it, i happened to read some reviews about it describing it not very promising. After seeing the first time i was impressed ... in a good way really ... of course, one could endlessly argue over minor details there and here. But all the atmosphere created there (blue-greenish filter all over), small details and lots of left open ends with little unexpected twist in the end, ... ahhh ... mmmm ...Also had the opportunity to see the japanese version of it ... I have always wondered, what do these people see so scary in godzilla ... so naive and childish ...And today, I just tumbled over imdb and just out of interest reading the reviews about both films ... and i really do not understand - does it always have to be SO EXPLAINED with everything? Why one can't THINK and fill in the gaps himself? I take it as good thing when i can brew the movie i saw, another couple of days inside my heard and play with what-if's. The Ring does it pretty well - all these flashbacks and dead ends in it, these really create very paranoid feeling of terror of unknown source or direction ... And the ending was also quite nice - all that trouble and this scary little bugger is still loose :o))) i like that! The fact that our mother here was not some lame hero saving the world, but intentionally sacrificing someone for her son to live ... so mean and evil!  :o)))Best horror movie of 2002 definitely!",Null,0,0,20 January 2003
