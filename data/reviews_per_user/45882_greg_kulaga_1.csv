Miracle," Miracle? Far from it.
","I was not alive in 1980 when the United States hockey team played the USSR in this so-called 'greatest moment in sports history' so I don't know how accurately the events in this movie were portrayed, or if this movie truly captured the feeling of 1980.However, I do know and I knew almost immediately after leaving the theatre, that this film was no classic. Not that it was a terribly bad movie either. It just wasn't a good one. And that is by no means Kurt Russell's fault. He was great as USA hockey coach Herb Brooks. He had the midwestern accent and everything.I just don't feel that Miracle took care of its characters. It did little to develop them at all. It seemed like the entire movie was a race to get to that final game against the Soviet Union. All of a sudden in that final game, Mark Johnson was just so good! I didn't even know who the hell was supposed to be portraying Mark Johnson. The only players the movie really introduced the audience to were Jim Craig and O'Callahan. Mike Erruzione was introduced only long enough for the audience to forget what his face looked like. They totally neglected the rest of the team.If you lived through this 'Miracle', live with your memories, they're probably better than this movie.",Null,0,0,1 February 2004
