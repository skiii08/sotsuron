The Blair Witch Project," Overrated but very, VERY creative
","This movie should have not made it the big screen.  It's not made to appeal to the masses, and the media ruined it.  It's very creative.  It has it's effect for being made on such a little budget, and people I know who aspire to make notsodocumentaries like this do truly look up to it.  Sure it's not 'scary' or whatever.  Rent Suspiria if you want to be scared.  This is shear independent appreciation, and for what it is, it's very well done.",10,1,3,8 November 2001
Fight Club," #1
","I hate going to the movies.  I hate Hollywood and what they do to movies to make them appeal to people who don't like movies.  It's sad.  Just a disclaimer.  Fight Club is my favorite movie of all time.  Every movie has it's flaws, but I just can't find any here.  The cinematography is unmatched with hokeyless use of FX, the acting is perfect, the writing is top notch taken from a top notch novel by a top notch author (Chuck Palahnuik, read Survivor), the story leaves you with the feeling of coming down from a large trip.  Truly an emotional, confusing, yet satisfying experience.  A masterpiece.  Every line in the movie is quotable!!  People who trash it, don't like this type of movie, and that's fine, it's not for everyone.  But still, for what it is, simply perfect.",10,0,1,2 November 2001
American Psycho," Great idea, great book, not enough movie
","The concept behind American Psycho is an original one, and it is THAT concept that encouraged most people to see it, but it's just so underdeveloped.  There IS some development as far as our 'one' character is concerned, but most of his ramblings don't explain his strange condition anymore than his actions do (if that makes sense).  Those seeking explanation and understanding of the main character are left with much to be desired, while people just sitting through the movie are left totally confused (but forget those people, this is an artsy flic).  The last line of the movie tries to explain it all in a single blow cutting to the credits even before you really get a chance to consider what he just said.  American Psycho takes the format of a thriller or horror with lulls in between scenes of climactic events.  Basically, while most of these movies put the viewer through a series of situations furthering the plot making you think more, only to be resolved (or somewhat resolved) in the end, this feature sends the mood up and down while explaining nothing.  You never understand what the motivation is behind the murders at ALL, which is understandable if that was the intent, but NO motivation can sometimes translate to the viewer as NO plot, and that is simply the case.  The movie ends with a line that should knock you in the gut and make you love the movie and understand the character, but rather makes you shake your head and want to start the whole thing over to find something tangible.  It is beautifully filmed, and the confession scene is oscar worthy, but overall, the movie shoves itself across the boundaries of 'artsy' and right of the cliff into nothing. Definitely worth the watch, but it's not life changing.",4,0,1,22 October 2001
Evil Dead II," Nothing more than simply 'entertaining'
","Evil Dead II is one of my favorite movies but not for the quality of the movie necessarily.  Surely not for the acting and storyline.  People that tear it to pieces don't realize what was put into it, what movies were out at the time, and really don't have an understanding for what goes into low-budget cinema.  People that are in love with Evil Dead II have an undying appreciation for what is in the movie.  If you're looking for Oscar quality acting, you won't find it here, but the directing is amazing, and it's hilarious.  There's a reason they used green blood (MPAA), you can see the set and strings if you look hard enough, and Bruce Campbell is one of the best overactors in the biz (next to Jeffery Combs).  If you haven't seen it, check it out, just because everyone should, just know what it is ahead of time.  It's in my opinion, one of the most 'ENTERTAINING' movies of all time.  It never gets old.",10,1,2,26 October 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Not the best Coen movie, but one of the best of the year for sure!
","I'm a Coen fan.  Just as a disclaimer.  I love everything about this movie except for a few small points.  The cinematography was breathtaking! Extremely reaslistic and optically orgasmic (just to be silly).  The use of yellow was very soothing and added an organic and antique feel to the entire movie.  The music is well chosen, the acting was choice (it was good to see Holly Hunter again), and the parallels with Homer were well placed but not hokey.  I was not too into the last 30 minutes of the movie.  It appeared to me that the Bros had a good hold on the movie until close to the end, and were at least coerced to make for a little more tangible Hollywood ending. Other than that, I would say this movie is a very enjoyable movie, one of the most 'enjoyable' movies I've seen.  Very pleasing.  And I would say it's one to own.  It's nice to see a movie that appeals to so many different types of people as well.  My parents even loved it.  Great production...",10,0,0,22 October 2001
