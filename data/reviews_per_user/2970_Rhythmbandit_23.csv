It," A lot of fun in Derry
","If you're unfamiliar with Stephen King's novel 'It', you won't have a problem with this, whilst not overly faithful to the book, it does lift many aspects from it amongst new ideas. Most of which work, few don't.It follows the story of young Georgie, his brother Bill makes him a paper boat to play with in a very stormy street. Unfortunately for him, the boat falls into a gutter where he encounters a clown. The rest of the story follows Georgie's brother and his friends, their own encounters with the clown and other horrifying events. Like I said, some of the new ideas work, some don't and aren't explored enough.A solid cast, plenty of jump scares, plenty of laughs and the right amount of tension, if a slightly schmaltzy end, lead to a pretty solid horror film, possibly the best of the year.",10,1,3,22 October 2017
Unbreakable," Good, But...
","Unbreakable is not a bad movie, its not a great movie either. Its somewhere in between average and excellent. I would say good. The plot is quite good but at trifle confusing. I kept asking 'whats happening' and 'why is that happening'. When I left the theatre I could hear some people say that the movie was rubbish, i didnt think so. They might have thought it was rubbish because they were confused, like me. But, at the movie got on further I began to understand the whole plot of the story. If you like thrillers with a twist then this is a definate must.Rating: 8/10If you like this try:The 6th SenseAI: Artificial IntelligenceHearts in Atlantis",8,0,0,9 October 2001
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Screw The Sound Of Music - This is Much better
","This is one of the best animated movies I have seen in years. If The Sound Of Music and South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut were in a video store I would definatley pick South Park B,L,U. The plot is hilarious. Forget seeing the sound of music. This is much better. 10/10",Null,0,0,30 June 2001
Billy Elliot," Totally Awful
","How any boy would want to become a ballet dancer is beyond me. Billy Elliot is one of those movies which everyone loves and will be remembered for ages, I really hope that there is no Billy Elliot 2 in the pipeline!! It was nominated for 3 oscars and won none which was great. This movie was a real downfall in british movies. A better alternative to this movie is Dirty Dancing. Also Billy Elliot has way to much swearing, f**k this f**k that and s**t this and s**t that. They say its a family comedy but its not. Please, if you want to waste Â£16 on a dvd in the uk, you'd be better of buying bust a move for the playstation, its a dancing game much better than this. I rated this movie 2/10, i didnt rate it 1/10 because the only decent actor/actress was Julie Walters.",1,4,30,1 April 2001

X-Men," Superb
","X-Men should have one best picture at the oscars. It had a great plot and storyline and it was full of action.I cannot fault this movie one bit, it amazing.If you like action or sci fi movies you will love this.I think that it was a little underrated though.It should be a classic.The acting is great and Hugh Jackman is superb.10/10If you like this try:X-Men 2 (2002)SupermanStar Trek",10,0,1,23 October 2001

Roll on Terminator 3.If you like this try: T2: Judgement Day, Robocop, End of DaysOverall: 10/10",9,0,0,16 September 2001
Bridget Jones's Diary," Not as Good as I thought
","This is a very dull movie. Hardly anything about it was great.Some of it was good but I did not enjoy it. The acting was typically british....boring and very dull.Casting Rennee Zellwegger to play Bridget was a big mistake. It would have been better with someone like:Bridget FondaMiranda RichardsonThis is at best, an average movie with no plot or any big interest.Acting: **/***** Direction: ***/***** Plot: **/*****Overall: 5/10If you like this try:Billy Elliot",5,1,1,28 October 2001
American Psycho," Highly Underrated
","American Psycho is excellent but its a shame that the movie was mostly overlooked by the critics and didnt do that well in the box office, but if you are bothered to get up and go and see it then you get your moneys worth.American Psycho is excellent, the plot is excellent, the acting is excellent and I enjoyed every single minute of it. Its funny, but also serious. I'm glad I taped it from TV because I will not tape over it. I would call this movie a horror comedy thriller. If you like these three genres of movies then you will like this movie, if not love it.There are some great moments in this movie and it end on a surprizing note. There are some good references to movies and they are done great...in other words...do NOT miss the chance to view this piece of filmaking. Its up there with the best of 2000.10/10If you like this try:The Texas Chainsaw MassacreEd GeinAmerican Psycho 2The Cell",10,0,0,22 October 2001
American Beauty," Superb
","This movie is probably the best movie of the 90's. The acting and the plot are superb. The story is funny, witty, intelligent and most of all great. You must watch it all from start to finish in order to understand what is going on. You do find yourself confused at sometimes throughout the movie but you get over it. It fully deserved its oscar nominations and winnings.10/10If you like this try:MementoMagnoliaBeing John Malkovich",9,0,0,21 October 2001
The Exorcist," This is Scary?
","I saw this movie a few months ago on TV and I was not scared once, I didnt see what the fuss about it was. This is without a doubt one of the worst 'horror' movies I have seen. Well, it was made 28 years ago. The acting was OK if not bland. Good Points: Hmmm...no good pointsBad Points: Acting Not Scary Hardly a classic 4/10",4,1,7,25 July 2001
Pearl Harbor," One Amazing Experience
","Pearl Harbor is a must see movie despite the bad reviews the critics seem to give it, WELL, what do they know? Its a brilliant masterpiece which will certainly win best picture at the oscars. Uppers: Tiny snippets of comedy Kate Beckinsale Lots of actionDowners: Josh Hartnet Way too longalso in the theatre about halfway throught the movie people seemed to leave the theatre but didnt come back and some people (mostly young ones kept coming and going) From the start 10/10 at the end 9/10Overall 10/10",10,6,12,17 June 2001
Coyote Ugly," Piper's got Potential
","***Spoilers***This is a great movie and Piper Perabo is a great actress.The story is as follows, a young woman called Violet (piper perabo) moves to New York City to become a singer songwriter. She moves to New York and meets a guy named Mr o Donnell (i forgot his first name at the time i wrote this) and they fall in love, Violet/Jersey gets a job as a Coyote in a bar called Coyote Ugly.

She then gets a new job and overcomes her stagefright. This movie should hav one at least one oscar but sadly It didnt, the plot is great and the acting from everyone is spot-on. The girls are all good-looking which is an added bonus.Dont miss10/10If you like this try:CocktailShowgirls",10,1,2,13 November 2001
Meet Joe Black," Zzzzzzzzzz
","Meet Joe Black is the most boring film I have seen, Its not the worst film i've seen but it is boring. The plot is so dire you'll fall asleep half way through. Its way too long at just over 3 hours and should be at least an hour shorter. I thought this would be a good romantic drama but it wasnt. It was soppy and cheesy. 5/10If you like this try:The End of the AffairCruel Intentions",5,0,2,20 September 2001
Men in Black," Its poor
","When i saw this movie i was only 11 at the time and though I was young I still thought it was a little disappointing, I thought that the movie was too short and a little too imaginative, and now its just been shown on TV its even worse",6,1,2,7 March 2001
The Mummy Returns," Brilliant, MucH Better Than The First
","The Mummy Returns is a great movie, I recommend that you go and see it. Acting from everyone is great and I enjoyed the humor, everytime something funny came I Could hear people in the theatre laughing. The plot is good but not great and i found myself getting bored about 2 hours through the movie. Overall if you havent seen it I recommend that you do. 10/10",10,0,0,31 May 2001
Scream 2," Good but its not great
","Scream 2 surprizes me, not only does it come out a year after the original but it also has the exact same plot. The killer chases innocent teens and kills the off one by one, it may seem silly to some buts it is actually quite good all the way through. If you havent seen scream 2 i recommend you see it. The plot may be deja-vu but its is still great 8/10If you like this try:Scream Scary MovieI Know What You Did Last Summer",8,0,0,2 October 2001
The Green Mile," The Best Tom Hanks movie
","The Green Mile, a great movie starring Tom Hanks and based on Stephen King's best seller, is filled with several  special-effects sequences, some gruesome and some  magical. But none are as impressive as the flesh-and-blood spectacle of watching the enormous John Coffey Clarke make his arrival on death row in 1935 at Cold Mountain Penitentiary in Louisiana.
If you like Tom Hanks you'll love this and if you havent seen it I totally recommend you do because it is an amazing movie.",10,0,1,1 April 2001
The Lion King," Very Good Disney Movie
","I was 8 when I first saw this movie and enjoyed the movie and now, 7 years later I still think its great. The movie is full of wit and charm and with real emotion. This is probably the most mature disney movie so far. When i was 8 i cried once or twice in the movie and it still makes some people cry now. If you havent seen this movie yet, where have you been? Go out and buy it right now. This is the best disney movie also. I loved the way the storyline unfolded and the voice acting. Especially matthew broderick as adult simba.Overall this movie was probably the best movie of 1994, it still is the classic it was 7 years ago.",10,0,0,31 March 2001
Scream," One of the best slasher flicks out there
","Scream is amazing. The actors dont look stupid and the killings arent stupid. Its one of the best horrors of the 90's and its definately one you should see. Even if you dont like horror movies you should still see this. One of the best starts to a trilogy ever...               ...shame about the 3rd one though
If you like this try:Friday the 13thScream 2,3House on Haunted Hill",8,0,0,2 October 2001
Carrie," A Bit Dissappointing
","I heared about this movie a few months ago,  I watched it a few weeks ago, and was very disappointed with the outcome, everyone says its a good horror movie but, where is the horror? The only real horror is the fact the movie is disappointing, There is only one scene with any gore in and thats at the high school prom, there is very little gore in this scene and there are no graphic deaths.  I feel that Carrie 2 was better and had more gore.",3,4,19,7 March 2001
Shrek," Simply Brilliant, One of the Best Animated Comedies Ever!
","Shrek is a brilliant movie, it's animation is stunning and shows how much technology has changed throughout the years. The story is brilliant and well thought out. The voice overs are brilliant and the one-liners are a riot. Shrek is a definate must see for all the family.I was a bit surprized by the fact the word 'crap' was used. But its hardly noticable because the donkey talks really quickly. Everything about Shrek is brillaint and I have no complaints about it.Good Points: Voice overs, Animation, Plot, Story, loads of movie referencesBad Points: Its a tad too shortIf you like Shrek try: Toy Story, Toy Story 2, Monsters INC, Final Fantasy: The Spirits WithinOverall Rating: 10/10",10,0,0,12 August 2001
Jackie Brown," Rather Good if Not Great
","This deserved to win best picture at he oscars. It was an interesting movie and i couldnt fault it at all. Its a drugs movie, i usually hate gangster flicks but this one is great. If you like Pam Grier or Samuel L Jackson you will like this.
9/10If you like this try:CoffyShaft",9,0,2,22 October 2001
