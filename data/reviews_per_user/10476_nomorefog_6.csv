10 Cloverfield Lane," Movies should be about something.
","The first 95 minutes of this movie was pure exposition for the next sequel. The last 5 minutes, was a microcosm of the sequel.
These guys should take a script writing course on how to make a movie about something other than what they plan to make in the future. Or leave the movie business and take their money-making crystal ball with them.",4,1,2,3 November 2018

The Babadook," Yabba Dabba Do Not.
","The Babadook was released back in 2014, and I haven't caught up with it until now. There was a fair amount of positive vibe about it. However I have to say after seeing The Babadook for the first time, I was a little disappointed because I didn't think it was scary. It doesnt compare well to stuff like The (original) Shining, and other iconic horror films of the past that are capable of standing on their own and therefore can never be replicated. Frankly I guess, The Haunting, The Innocents, even The Sixth Sense can never be replaced. Part of the problem seems to be an anxiety of influence on the part of current practioners. They seem unable to create for themselves a style that pays homage, but at the same time makes a new and vibrant contribution to the genre.
I realise that The Babadook is really more a psychological thriller than straight horror. This has to be a fact, because nobody mentions ghosts, or paranormal activity being responsible for the events portrayed, when it seems obvious to the viewer that this is indeed what's going on. We receive a massive build-up, but the story peeters out due to lack of character development, or any explanation for these strange events occurring. The actors subsequently are left to get out there and do a lot of acting to push the story along, when there isnt much of story to begin with.
I also have to admit to an aversion towards films like this who are too coy to actually show the monster for anything longer than a couple of seconds. This may have worked for a horror genius like Val Lewton, but as far as I'm concerned, not many others. Even Jaws to me, was at a disadvantage because it took so long to get a decent glimpse of the shark. But I digress.
Just to mention a few good things, the young boy who plays Essie Davis' son is either adorably vulnerable or obnoxious, but he is wonderfully expressive in a difficult role. The interior of the house has a fascination about it that's very moody and sinister, and makes the claustrophobic nature of the events quietly unsettling. However the back story isn't explained very well nor the reason for finding the book, the reason for the haunting or the magical entrance of the dead husband at the end, which I found more bewildering than what was happening onscreen.
I guess I've been spoilt by the great titles, and directors who created modern horror. No matter what has come after I get into a tizz and can't wait to defend them against the New guard. But as you get older it's more difficult to rationalise your disappointments in life so I will give this a score based on the idea that at least they made an attempt.",5,2,4,23 January 2020

Catch-22," Simple but true.

Cube," Claustrophobic
","I hoped to get something out of Cube, since it was made in 1997, and has become, within the fullness of time a cult classic that supposedly everybody should take notice of. Unfortunately I am one of those viewers who can only register their negative response, but first a little encouragement. As an experiment its laudable enough, the low budget is obvious but doesn't detract, the players do their best with a talky script but that's as far as it goes. As a horror movie, it doesn't work because it didn't scare me.
The philosophical issues Cube presumes to address can be found in any quality 20th century book, from the writings of Dostoyevsky, to Franz Kafka, to Albert Camus in regards to the meaning of life or it's lack thereof. In which case frankly, I can see little point in watching this movie.
I found similarities to The Poseidon Adventure, Cabin in the Woods and Einstein's theories which sounds pretty interesting on paper, when actually the results on film are definitely not that.
Don't waste your time, I like genre films to stick to the rules. If I want intellectual stimulation I can always re-read my old Penguin paperbacks, they are elegantly written, and make far more sense than this pretentious malarkey.",4,0,0,25 June 2020
