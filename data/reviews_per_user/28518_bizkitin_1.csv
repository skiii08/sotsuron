The Incredible Hulk," This movie is in no way better than the previous one
","I really thought that this movie would be better than the last one which had Eric Bana but to my utter disappointment i was let down ! This movie was good no doubt but not great & had too many complications in it & to sum it up ,who appears in the end ? Iron man really that was not required & didn't make sense !Its true that there were a lot of corrections is this movie but over all it was not as good as i thought it would be . And what about the blood that fell on the bottle initially ? No point , here it is shown as if anyone who wants to be HULK can become one ! I have been a HULK fan all my life but the previous one was much better in every aspect",6,2,5,20 June 2008
