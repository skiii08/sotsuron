Blade Runner 2049," Ground Breaking Visuals, Set Design and Cinematography ran off course.
","This movie lacked heart, the script/writing was poor and the story wasn't very interesting.The original Blade Runner is my favorite movie of all time and while I appreciate what this brought to the table I really wish they took the time to match the script/writing/story to the amount of effort put in elsewhere.The acting was hit or miss.The visuals and sound design are some of the best I've seen/heard out of any movie but its let down by a poorly put together movie :(",Null,2,3,23 May 2019
