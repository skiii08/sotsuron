Casablanca," Casa de Bogart
","Whoever discovered Humphrey Bogart as an actor, was a genius; someone that noticed a great talent and persona when they saw it. If Bogart hadn't been introduced into the movie business, one of the greatest love stories ever filmed couldn't have been possible. Without Bogart, Casablanca as a whole, probably would have failed. 	 This is a movie for big love story fans, (which this reviewer is not.) A finely crafted plot with all the little bumps along the way, which modern audiences have become accustomed to. With a cohesive cast including the stunning Ingrid Bergman and the man himself, Humphrey Bogart, Casablanca makes a very believable romance out of the era's biggest stars. An original mold for the all too familiar `love triangle'. 	 Even though Bogart is the main star of the movie, he doesn't quite steal the picture. There are numerous other great performances, like that of Claude Rains as Capt. Louis Renault, and the slightly eerie portrayal of Ugarte, by the fantastic Peter Lorre. The direction isn't astounding, but it does well not to distract the viewer from the great story. Who really needs fancy camera tricks if you have some of the best actors and a really enthralling story? 	 Perhaps ranked a little too highly by critics, (AFI #2) Casablanca is still the original love story. It has been copied by many imitators for its tension, legendary wit and quotable quotes. Not the greatest American movie ever made, but is has been very influential upon the genre and on countless other films since. A must see for any film buff.

Citizen Kane," Imitators Idolization
","One major question comes to mind when watching Citizen Kane. How can a 25 year old newcomer write, direct and produce one of the greatest American films of all time? It's amazing, it boggles the mind. It may be unbelievable, but Orson Welles did this very thing. And, all the way back in 1941. Very few filmmakers have accomplished such a feat. Although directors like Quentin Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson have tried, they can't top the original. Citizen Kane is a technical masterpiece and for very good reasons. The cinematography is brilliant. The style is revolutionary and very engaging. Unique camera angles are sprinkled throughout the film, such as the very low floor shot angles and other great techniques. Also the special effects in the film are superb. All the effects that we take for granted today were created and used here. The lighting design is some of the best ever, playing with light and shadow to create a variety of moods. The shadows are used to great effect to convey emotion with the black and white film style. But the one thing that makes Citizen Kane a great movie even to this day, is all the symbolism. A conversation could last hours discussing all the hidden meanings in the film. What do all the aspects represent? What do the metaphors mean? Is it a semi-biography of W.R. Hearst? You know it's a great film when you can watch it multiple times and find different meanings with each viewing. Is it the best film of all time? Maybe. That's debatable. But it's definitely good. You'll have to find that out for yourself. But movie fans and newcomers alike will enjoy this fantastic piece of cinema for all the things is has to offer. A definite must see to all the aspiring film makers out there. See the original and then criticize the imitators. You don't know good film until you've seen Citizen Kane.Overall grade for Citizen Kane:  A+",Null,0,2,17 November 2003
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Phallic Symbols and World Domination
","It's the height of the cold war, and an accidental nuclear strike on Russia has been called by American forces. How is the U.S. going to stop the weapons from reaching their targets and avoid worldwide destruction? Why was the strike confirmed? And could Dr. Strangelove's plan work out just in case? These are only a few of the many questions posed by Stanley Kubrick in his 1964 film, Dr. Strangelove.	The full title; Dr Strangelove: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, aside from being quite unique, does a good job of setting up the audience for the premise of the film. It may not sound like a comedy from the title, but don't judge a film by its tagline. Here Kubrick has created a very funny black comedy that examines our fascination or `strange love' with power and military superiority. He smothers his film with symbolism and psychological metaphors, many that remind us of Freud's theories on the matter.	Those not interested in a deep and analytical movie will still enjoy this picture nonetheless. It is a great comedy propelled by perfect comedic timing and some of the best actors of their time. Two of the best actors, George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden, stray from their regular dramatic roles for a little comedy. Of course a little help is given by the hysterical Peter Sellers, who plays three roles, including the title character. 	 	Kubrick is a cinematic master and you can see why. The way he composes his shots and directs his actors tells you something about his genius. Very few people could take a topic such as apocalyptic world destruction and make it into a comedy, and do it so well. 	One word of advice though before you watch this movie; you will like it so much better if you really understand the feeling associated with that time in American History. You can feel the tension and the uneasiness that was extremely prevalent during the early 60's. Regardless of your historical knowledge, you'll still enjoy this hilarious piece on the insanity and weird obsession surrounding war and the struggle to become the best.	 	At the very least, you'll learn the proper technique of riding atomic weapons out of planes. Enjoy!

It's a Wonderful Life," Is it Really?
","What comes to mind when you think about wintertime holidays? Family? Friends? The endless airings of `It's a Wonderful Life' on television? I personally tend to think of the third choice, but that's just me, one-track mind and all. Anyhow, there's good reason for the constant showings of this movie during the holiday season. It has become a staple of the American holiday tradition. It's like having 4th of July without fireworks. Unthinkable! 	Over the years, Frank Capra's masterpiece has gained popularity and has now become a classic piece of cinema. It's a story that's timeless and well crafted. Much like a modern day version of Charles Dickens' classic work of literature, A Christmas Carol. The story could take place even during a different season; it's not just about Christmas. The thoughts about the value of human life reach everyone young and old. A perfect plotline for this type of movie.	Jimmy Stewart is the real prize in this movie. He's just one of those undeniably good American actors. He does great work here as the down and out George Bailey. A man forced to find himself and the values for which he stands. Should he follow through with his dream or is everything he wants right in front of him in his hometown? He tries valiantly to save the morals of society from the corporate America symbolism of the rich old Mr. Potter. Things eventually work out, with a bit of outside help.	This movie has some definite symbolic themes to it. Personal adversities, how people take their lives for granted, and what good can come from standing up for what you believe in. These themes are very important and not to be overlooked in this movie. Look past the façade of the average Christmas feel-good movie and see what this movie really represents. I don't think you'll be disappointed. Even if you're not a big Christmas fan, such as myself, you'll still enjoy this movie on some level.Overall grade for `It's a Wonderful Life':      B+",Null,1,5,12 December 2003
Psycho," Everyone's a little crazy
","40,000 dollars in stolen money, a beautiful woman and a lonely motel owner combine to create one of the greatest psychological thrillers ever created for the big screen. Alfred Hitchcock, the undisputed `Master of Suspense', does his best work with this film. After just one viewing, it's easy to see why this film is rated so highly on the AFI's 100 best list and countless other film review lists. 	 	Right from the opening shots of the movie, you can tell it's the work of a master. Well executed camera movements drop you right into the story and you're hooked from there on. Fantastic photography in classic black and white is accentuated by great lighting. The film style and lighting combine to create eerie shadows and an overall sense of uneasiness that's hard not to notice. In addition, composer Bernard Hermann lends one of the most chilling and well recognized scores to the film, adding even more to the thrilling layers of the story.	`Psycho' is more of a psychological thriller than a horror flick, contrary to what a lot of people think. It's a film that's comparable to Silence of the Lambs, if you can compare the two. The thing that makes this film such a thriller is the great acting from the stars, Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh. Perkins is evil at times and friendly at others. He pulls off one of the best schizophrenic acting gigs ever recorded on film. Leigh and Perkins have very good chemistry together, especially in the scene which takes place in the motel parlor. Very creepy.	`Psycho' is a well written and filmed piece of work. It's such a terrifying story that's made even more so by good technical execution. It's a gripping story with some good twists that leads up to a terrifying climax. It's a good thrill even for those squeamish few who don't enjoy blood. It's more of a mental horror from one of the best creators of suspense films. This is one of Hitchcock's best works. Check it out and you won't take a shower for a week.

Rear Window," Don't Mess With Perry Mason
","Who else in the history of cinema could create a more suspenseful environment than an overweight Englishman could? No one, that's who. And with 'Rear Window', that rotund Brit, better known as Alfred Hitchcock, displays a real knack for creating tremendous tension. With a very minimalist approach, Hitchcock builds up an atmosphere that rivals any other film in the genre, even to this day. 	 	The very first thing that you notice when watching Rear Window is the camera movement. Or, better yet, the lack of movement. Why this film is so original is that the camera never moves out of the main characters room. All the shots in the film are from out the window, the perspective of the disabled Jimmy Stewart. A sense of uneasiness is very prevalent due to the fact that you cannot really see everything that's going on outside the window. This is a major part of the story and is the catalyst for the actions of the characters. 	 	What makes Hitchcock such a master is that there's a deep meaning to his films. This film may just seem like a fun murder mystery to the untrained eye, but to those in the know, it's so much more. In 'Rear Window', Hitchcock studies and analyzes human nature and people's tendencies towards voyeurism in an interesting and engaging atmosphere. Questions about society are proposed in this film, like people's need to satisfy their curiosity and the ethics surrounding interfering with other's personal lives. Very interesting points are made, but are cleverly hidden within the dialogue and plot. 	 	This is a great movie, one that could only be done by a master like Hitchcock. One little piece of advice when watching this though; stick with it. It's a slow building, mainly dialogue driven story, but it has a great payoff. Now I like that sort of thing, others may not however. Trust me though; you won't be disappointed in the least bit. It's just the Hitchcock style of story telling that helps to build enormous tension and suspense.	 	At the very least, you'll at least have some ideas to slow down a would be attacker with little to your dispense. Enjoy.

The Godfather," The Goodfather
","The Godfather is arguably the greatest American movie ever made. A film with all the classic movie elements that's perfectly created and executed. Highly regarded by critics and thoroughly studied by film students and movie lovers alike, The Godfather is a masterpiece. It's such a classic that it is still a strong contender in the `Best Movie Ever' debate. 	 	No other movie has told such an involved story of the mafia. Only could a director like Francis Ford Coppola and writer Mario Puzo, create such an atmosphere of believability. By the end of this epic film, the audience has a newfound respect for some notorious mobsters and unexpected sympathy becomes apparent. Never has such a movie before or since told the story of important values among common criminals so well as here. 	 	Only with fantastic actors could you pull off such a reversal of feelings toward the mafia. Marlon Brando does a fantastic job as the lovable patriarch, whose swollen growl makes him feel like the `Mafia Santa Clause'. The always-good Al Pacino creates a deep character full of turmoil and ultimate greed. His role of Michael, `the heir to the thrown', goes through an extreme transformation of personality and values. Such superb actors like these, and others such as Robert Duvall and James Caan, create an environment full of complex and intriguing characters. 	 	The technical execution of this film is stunning. From the first frame to the end credits, this movie is film production at its finest. Unique and smooth camera movements pair nicely with the story; the score is the quintessential piece to such a gripping plot; and I have never seen a more entertaining murder than in this movie. 	 	A flawless piece of cinema throughout. Great writing, directing and acting make it a classic for the ages. Never have I felt more connected to such ruthless and villainous individuals than in this film. The `climax' of The Godfather sums up all the feelings in the movie: countless murders over the sounds of a child's Catholic Baptism. Outstanding.
