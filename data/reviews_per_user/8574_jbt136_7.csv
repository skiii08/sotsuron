Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," great movie
","based on other comments on this site, this movie should have been terrible. They were all wrong. Now to set a few things straight. George Lucas is not racist. The guy who did Jar Jar's voice was given the job because his voice was ideal for the character. Also, Jar Jar was not annoying. He was different that in other star wars films, but what about the elephant creature who played the piano in the bar? what about the Ewoks or the Jawas? None of them are what older people want in a movie- they are thought of as 'cute' and 'immature' but is there really anything wrong with that? Jar Jar lightens the film and adds a few slightly comical parts. He is not that bad and does not ruin the movie. Also, people complained about the acting. News flash! this is a Star Wars movie. If you want acting go see 'A Beautiful Mind' or some phylosophical movie like that. This movie is supposed to be an entertaining Sci-fi film, not an oscar winning film. One more thing, there was nothing wrong with the effects. I thought they were very well done. why don't you try to go home and make a sequence like the pod race. and no, the pod race was not to long. It was fun to see and the effects were dazzling. It was not a waste of film. The people who did not like this movie need to remember that it is a PG which should also appeal to kids, not an R that is targeted to adults. Lucas knew this when he used Jar Jar, and Anakin and other once again 'immature' characters. I enjoyed this movie and don't understand where all the complaints are coming from.",10,5,7,22 April 2002
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Great movie, best of the trilogy
","In my opinion, this is the best movie in the trilogy. some people complain about the Ewoks, but i don't see what is wrong with them. just because you find it hard to believe that some little furry creatures can plain out kick 'butt' doesn't mean the whole movie is bad. the plot was the most exciting of the three and the Endor effects were great. my favorite character of the series was Wicket W. Warwick, the Ewok first encountered by Leia. anyone who dislikes this movie has issues.",10,0,2,22 April 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Excellent action movie
","This movie is a very well done action movie. The visual effects are stunning and the acting is superb. I can find nothing wrong with it except for a few parts that dont quite fit with the book, but that is to be expected with a book like Lord of the Rings.",10,1,1,20 April 2002
Spider-Man," Decent movie
",This movie is in every way an average movie. The only thing done well is the casting of Tobey Macquire as Spiderman. He is excellent for the role and acts decently. The special effects are also decent. The one major flaw is the prolonged sappy scenes of Spiderman with MJ or his aunt and uncle. The movie would have been much better off without those sequences. The movie is overall very creative and fun.,6,0,0,4 May 2002
Titanic," bad movie
","this movie is awful. its only good because leo dies and the special effects are decent but just because it did really well at the box office because 100 teenage girls saw it 10,000 times, so i have to say it was horrible. the story was awful and i just wanted to see the effects, they didnt need to waste the first video on their 'love' over the course of a month... what garbage",1,3,10,22 April 2002
Ice Age," Fun and entertaining movie.
","This movie was an entertaining kids movie that I think was enjoyed more by the adults in the theater than the kids. It is extremely funny with a somewhat interesting but predictable plot. I think some aspects were childish, but that was the target audience so it makes sense.
9.0",9,1,3,20 April 2002
To Kill a Mockingbird," bad movie
","why would you want to see this movie when you can read the horrible boring book instead? this movie is slow, and dull. the only 'action' in the whole book is implied in the movie. everything just crawls and it was a waste of time, I only liked it because the acting was good. I know everyone says it is one of the 'gems' of American filmaking, but i disagree. If you want to see high quality movies, go watch Wee Sing movies.",3,12,46,27 July 2002
