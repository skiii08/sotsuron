The Avengers," Not for me
","Everybody seems to like this film. I don't. I respect everyone's opinion, but I must say I'm a little puzzled by the public response to what I consider to be just an average popcorn movie. The storyline is weak, but everyone seems to agree that it isn't the most important element of the film. Its major points are: 1) the action; 2) the relationships between the characters. With regard to the action scenes, I felt nothing but indifference. The main reason is that I can't stand CGI. Everything seems flat and unreal. And The Avengers is a CGI fest. If you like that sort of thing, you'll love it. If you are an old-school action movie lover, you'll probably be bored. As for the relationships between the main characters, I was even more disappointed. Dialogues in the film are just an endless series of supposedly funny jokes. The entire movie plays as very loud and expensive comedy. I can't stand Robert Downey, Jr anymore. Someone had said that he is Tony Stark, but the fact is that Tony Stark is Robert Downey Jr. He's not playing a character, he's just being a wise-ass. Actually, he does it in every movie he's in. It's unbearable. The other characters are equally bland, except for Tom Hiddleston's Loki (this man's a great actor) and maybe Mark Ruffalo's David Banner/Hulk. Overall, I was bored and even embarrassed to watch the movie, even though I'm aware that I have the minority opinion.",3,11,38,4 May 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," OK, but a little disappointing
","I loved the JJ Abrams' 2009 Star Trek reboot, so I'm not one the haters of the new franchise. I though Abrams had injected a welcome new energy and scope to the ST universe. The film was fun and inventive and had me looking forward to what they were going to do next. A sequel is always a difficult matter, because you have to deal with people's expectations and those are often impossible to match. It seems to me that Into Darkness suffers from the need of giving MORE of everything that made the first installment so successful: more action, more CGI, more noises, more jokes, more emotional scenes. There's just not any time to breathe in this film. The action scenes, for instance, are just too confusing and noisy. I would have preferred a more classic and less frenzy approach to the action shooting. This is Star Trek, not Jason Bourne. I also think that Abrams tried too hard create bombastic emotional moments for the audience. Personally, I think it is too soon for that. This is only the second film of the new franchise, and, since the first one was more of a pilot, we are watching the beginning of the adventures of the Entreprise. As the film starts, the whole crew is already falling apart. Too soon for that. It's too bad, because the plot had great potential and the villain played by the great Benedict Cumberbatch is one of the best I've seen in a ST movie. When he's on screen, the film grows. Overall, Into Darkness is a decent piece of entertainment, but one that would have benefited of a tighter script, more focused on the story and the villain. Please, forgive my English.",6,2,5,15 June 2013
