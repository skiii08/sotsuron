Captain Phillips," Grade-A Film Making!
","This Tom Hanks starrer and Paul Greengrass directed thriller is well crafted from start to finish! Excellent edge-of-your-seat entertainment.Based on a true story, Hanks stars as Richard Phillips, a cargo boat captain, traveling with his crew through the waters of Somalia where he and his fellow crew come face to face with Somali Pirates.Paul Greengrass delivers excellent direction and knows how to engage the audience, much like his direction in the fantastic film United 93, based on one of the fated airlines in the September 11th attacks. Tom Hanks is brilliant as Captain Richard Phillips and delivers one of his best on screen performances in recent memory. This film is a must-see thriller that won't disappoint.",10,0,1,25 February 2014
