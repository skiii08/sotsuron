The Devil's Advocate," Unlimited desire becomes devil
","Following his desire, Kevin works hard to win one case after another at courtroom no matter who his defendants are and what they do. Wining gives him more money, higher reputation and more power, and his desire keeps growing - devil appears. The consequence - his wife's suicide - wakes him up, and he kills the devil by killing himself. What a hero! Wait a minute, Kevin is trapped again by 'I'll make you a star' from a reporter. Temptation is everywhere and at any time because human's desire is unlimited.Definitely an underrated movie. It's long, supplicated, and well presented. Different people can have different interpretations and take away. Absolutely a fabulous masterpiece.",9,1,1,6 January 2008
