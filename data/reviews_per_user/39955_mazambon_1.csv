Casablanca," Marcelo Zambon - Brazil
","Casablanca is one of the three of the best films in all time. The fabulous cast, the unforgettable song and the amazing final fhrase. Humphrey Bogart is perfect and everybody goes to Rick. All we can do is to ask Sam to play it again !! My english is not very good ! but the film is wonderful",10,0,0,27 February 2000
