Spartacus," Better than Gladiator
","A more interesting, sensitive film than Gladiator. Kirk Douglas plays a blinder as the slave-turned-leader, and Stanley Kubrick directs. DVD has a few extras, including production notes. Great.",Null,1,2,9 November 2001
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Shockingly poor
","There has been so much hype about this film, but in reality (well, in my opinion anyway) it is seriously bad. Let me explain myself...Firstly, Johnny Depp, who everyone thinks has given some career-defining performance, simply hops around dressed as a woman and makes cliched little comments that really grate. Secondly, Depp and Bloom's swordfight near the beginning of the film is horrifically dull. They spend the first few minutes exchanging limp jibes (physical and verbal) walking indifferently around the set... one is left half-asleep. I know the action comes later, but this dull, empty screen-time is unusual for Disney. But the most laughable element of the film (so far) is this absolutely ridiculous idea that between the ragtag, thieving bunch that pirates were, there existed a 'code of honour'. We see in the film one of the characters asking not to be killed because, according to 'the code', she has the right to 'Parley' and can be saved from death and have a nice chat with the captain instead. When the captain later tries to distance himself from this and says that the code is 'less rules...more a set of guidelines' I was crying into my chips. This is Final Destination-quality craziness.Anyway...just thought you should all know this film really ain't that great.",1,20,53,22 December 2003
The Thing," Great slice of horror
","The Thing is an intense, claustrophobic horror film that is shot with an eye for detail. The music is fantastic (typical of John Carpenter films) and the whole thing is carried off with a style that's missing in many modern day thrillers. The beginning is top, and sets the scene wonderfully. The antarctic mountains, though snow-covered, seem dark and imposing, and you know that something evil is coming.However, the science-fiction elements seem contrived, and certain special effects haven't aged well, though others still look impressive to this day.Overall, it's an engrossing,  great film, and should be viewed by all.",Null,0,1,18 March 2002
The Shining," Captivating stuff
","This is great work from Kubrick, and has all the hallmarks of his films; innovative camera angles and movement, blocks of solid colour and structure, quality acting and just a dash of bizarre. The Shining is not for the easily scared, but for those with an open mind it is chilling, surreal and completely captivating. Some have said The Shining has not aged well; I disagree. If anything the *slightly* dated setting and structure of the film just add to the sense of surrealism and detachment, which is a good thing in this case.If The Shining had been made today, it would have been a turkey, because there are only four actors who spend any amount of time on screen, the dialogue is short and sometimes cryptic, and it would probably be too unsettling to stare at Jack Nicholson's 'psychopath' face for pretty much a solid minute as you have to do in the film.I love this film; it's excellent work.p.s. It bears some resemblance to The Thing (1982) with it's claustrophobic setting and copious snow - I won't go into more detail for fear of producing spoilers, but I recommend you watch that film if you like this one.",10,6,10,13 January 2003
Man on the Moon," My thoughts
","One excellent film that has been criminally overlooked by pretty much everyone. Ask someone in the street if they have have seen man on the moon and they will either mumble something about Neil Armstrong or say they've heard the song (which does appear at the end of the film). The Golden Globes recognised this film as great and awarded it as such. (always an indicator of a genuinely good film, unlike the Oscars...)If you think Jim Carrey is just about funny faces and toilet humour, you must see this film, and you will see he can play *slightly* more serious & complex roles too, though the film is still funny, there are less fart jokes than, say, Dumb & Dumber.I've got to get off the net now, so the bottom line is THIS FILM IS GREAT.:)",Null,0,0,23 April 2002
True Romance," Under-rated
","I've seen Reservoir Dogs, I've seen Pulp Fiction & I've seen Jackie Brown, but for me this is Tarantino's best crime caper. Completely engrossing from start to finish, the story of the two lovers who are on the run is not entirely believable, but seriously enjoyable. You get your fill of guns, sex, style and pop-culture, and the usual array of celebrity cameos in a film that seems a whole lot more 'close'. Whereas Pulp Fiction felt like one long trailer, with every line razor-sharp and a load of hip music that made the film go so quickly, True Romance offers you the chance to savour every moment, as the film moves at a (slightly) slower pace. Enjoy the blazing finale, and just wonder how it might have turned out if Tarantino had got his hands on the camera...",10,131,177,1 January 2003
