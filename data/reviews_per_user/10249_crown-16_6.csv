Men in Black 3," At last a good sequel
","Once again our favorite MIB agents Jay & Kay are battling it out for earth. Quick action, colorful villains, beautifully designed settings and CGI, comic relief in the face of imminent destruction, all those made the first two movies great as well as successful in the box office. Could they better the formula in the face of all the other bad sequels we have been seeing for years? This is one of the reasons I had stepped into the cinema with trepidation. (Good grief, was it 1997 when I saw the first and ten years ago the second? How time flies). The other reason was the pitfall of time travel.Time travel is one of the favorite themes in sci fi movies but it needs to be handled carefully. My humble word of advice to the script writers: Keep-It-Simple. Avoid overtly complicated jumps back and forth and paradoxes that confuse the audience. Remember the eventual mess in the Back To The Future trilogy? I was then so pleased to see that they kept the time travel relatively simple and easy to follow. There was a small part when they crossed the line juuust a tiny bit when young agent Kay meets a certain father and son (don't want to spoil it). Even if traveling back in time was possible, you wouldn't necessarily bump into everyone you know in the present.Will Smith is in his usual good form in his character Jay which however needs Kay to balance him. It is then fortunate that Brolin gives a great performance as the young agent.Was it better than the 1997original? It was as good, without the novelty value obviously. Was it as good as the MIB2? I would say that it surpassed the second.",8,135,188,26 May 2012
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," The return of the bad sequel
","After seeing the original Madagascar as few years back with the family, we all rated it as one of our all time favorites. Funny, fast, cute characters, the music, all tops.We had high expectations for the sequel but were disappointed. It wasn't too bad but had a. Too many references to the original - b. Unhinged slow predictable plot - c. That awful old lady and d. again that syrupy father-son relations issues that drag on and on.It should leave some of the old minor characters behind, get a quicker pace, some real plot and for crying out loud *a new song* Well, at least the animation was top notch as expected by major releases.",4,3,10,31 December 2008
Monsters vs. Aliens," Good times for all ages
","Overall really good. I would say the best so far this year.The animation is excellent (great faces by the way)plenty of laughs and a solid if slightly predictable plot.It starts a little slow but it picks up as it goes along. Understandably some time has to be devoted to how it all begun before the action starts. The door is open for a second movie, we'll see how that goes.Unfortunately I didn't see it in 3D so I cannot comment on that.My kids loved it, I had a pretty good time too. It is definitely worth seeing by young and old.",8,0,1,12 April 2009
Avatar," It delivers what it promises
","Flash back to 1978, yours truly a young 14 year old walks out the cinema awe struck. Star Wars had that kind of impact back then and I got the same feeling from Avatar even as a middle aged man now whom has seen lots of good pictures in between.So some call the storyline predictable, I would say it is just right. There is pace, action and it never gets boring (like for example the overcomplicated, pretentious, nonsense called Matrix Revolutions).I thought two and a half hours, wearing 3D glasses would be tiring but it wasn't. I was expecting an exiting time and thats exactly what I got.To summarize, it delivers what it promised and this is no small feat these days. It may very well be the (original trilogy) Star Wars of the 21st century.",10,2,7,26 February 2011
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," It had such potential
","Someone wrote: 'If you have no knowledge of Tenacious D, and their humor, do not watch it, because you will not like it.'. This was the root of the problems. I had no knowledge of Tenacious D and while I won't go as far as to say I hated the movie, it was made more for their fans than for the general public.What gets me is that it had such a potential. It had a great concept, it had Jack Black and the chance to rock (literally) School of Rock preceded it so here was a blueprint of how to make a great movie and even improve on it. Instead they went downhill.What went wrong other than being a movie for the T-D fans.First: Kyle Gass may be in the real life band but he is totally wrong for the movie part. It would work much better with a younger rocker who was really good but down on his luck, then with the help of Jack Black he would get his chance and shine. Now this character was a soft bald overweight kid whom grew to be a soft bald overweight adult. Doesn't work for the movie in my humble opinion. For example, instead of being a total loser at the Sorority party, a more suited actor/performer could have his first revelation and totally rock the place. Then while the girls throw themselves at him he would remember his buddy and mission and go find him. Wouldn't that work better? Second: The music. They have a specific number of fans already loving it. For the rest of the people it just doesn't work. I mean even at the final showdown with the devil the music was an anticlimax for me.Third: Humor or lack of it. It had its moments, after all you can't hide Jack Black's talent. I especially liked the chase scene being watched on live TV by Lee the car's owner. Other than that it was way below School Of Rock's.Fourth: The plot should be tighter. Some points were explained at the deleted scenes. Like why would Gass try to evade the police? (Answer he was so into the video game that he was actually hallucinating). How come the club's announcer is the devil? (Answer, before they changed the plot it was actually Lee, their only fan. It then makes sense, that's why he was helping them) And what about the mushroom induced hallucination with the Sascq... Saskua... oh Pooh, Bigfoot! Totally out of place, or was it a video clip within a movie? Fifth: I suppose fans of the band go for lewd language, sexual innuendos and drug use/humor. I suppose this is the producer's and director's choice but alienating everyone below 16 (18 in my opinion) is not a good business decision. Such a pity I couldn't see the movie along with my kids.Bottom line : Mildly entertaining but forgettable.",4,1,5,17 October 2010
Prometheus," Is this really Riddley Scott's
","After watching Prometheus I was in perplexed and in deep thought until it hit me: Riddley Scott has an evil twin with the same name. One Riddley Scott is directing Blade Runner, Alien and Gladiator and the evil one the Prometheus.Where to begin: the plot holes, the cardboard characters, the unbelievable scenario, the details that make no sense. I could have excused all that if there was good action to go along with the stunning visuals; if there was a strong message or a cathartic ending among the pointless running around. Alas no.**spoiler alert** At the opening scene we see a beautiful take of what we are led to believe was primitive Earth and one of the 'Engineers' while watching his spaceship take off, is apparently seeding Earth with his DNA. A civilization this advanced and he has to commit suicide for that? We then have a visual of his DNA being destroyed. If the idea is to propagate it then why destroy it? One possibility is that he could be rouge but why not suggesting that with a chase by the others in the spaceship? The two protagonist scientists keep finding drawings in early human civilizations of a star system. Those humans were separated by hundreds or thousands years. So the engineers keep revisiting Earth again and again to give humans that star map? Weren't humans impressed by 3 meter tall aliens to make any drawings of them? The huge ship that takes our motley crew to the distant system is actually capable of making a landing itself, not a smaller craft which would be more logical. No mother ship orbiting and scanning from above, no probes released in the planet. Then we have a Star Trek moment when they land right next to the alien 'pyramids' and how do they find them in this gazillion dollar ship with advanced technology? They look out the window! Charlize Theron is one more of the disposable characters and mostly doing the catwalk around the ship. Her performance is wooden and her character adds nothing to the movie. She is the daughter of the billionaire who funded the trip and while in his recording he specifically says that the two scientists are in charge, she acts like she is. Only that besides being a bitch she makes no leadership decisions. She is the apparent heir of a person that can fund such an expedition, something that would stretch the budget of the richest nation, and she wants to come along to a trip in space that takes years each way rather than stay home and hang out with Paris Hilton's granddaughter. Oh yes, talking of fun, out of the blue she has her way with the captain - another unnecessary plot dead end.Noomi Rapace's character is downright annoying. She is supposed to be the strong female character so well played by Sigourney Weaver in the Alien movies and fails. Not so much by the actress, it is the plot and direction that makes this character confusing to say the least. Combine that with a slightly strange expressionless face and an annoying voice with a forced accent and you struggle to find anything to like about her.Her fellow scientist and boyfriend while at a certain point and for no apparent reason is tainted by David the android, he starts to turn into a monster, not impregnated by the alien creature. He is sleeping with her and SHE is impregnated. How is this consistent with the Alien's ways I don't know.Then in the famous (or infamous) scene with the auto surgeon: She runs to the hugely complex and expensive machine that performs auto surgery and asks for a cesarean section; what happens then? It can't because it is calibrated only for males! OK, Meredith Vickers whom is beyond doubt a woman brings along this marvel of a machine half way across the galaxy and it is set for men only. It could be for her father but how difficult would it be to be programmed for women too? The list goes on and on. I don't want to forget to mention the music that is annoying at places and doesn't always project the feelings on screen. This is unforgivable in such a high budget film.I am afraid that I cannot recommend it to any scifi fan. Put one of the first two in the DVD and watch Riddle Scott at his best (The real Riddley Scott)",3,32,55,18 June 2012
