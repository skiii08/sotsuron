The Blair Witch Project," Amateurish Nonsense.
","The only reason for seeing The Blair Watch Project is to realise how the contemporary film     'criticism' is determined by marketing strategies. Plotless, clumsily edited and shot, fake and uninvolving. I was under the              impression that after The Shining,  Rosemary's Baby and Don't Look Now, 'respectable' critics would at least be able to tell a true horror movie from a                                                                cheap thrill sophomore flick. If you believe that cinema can still be considered a form                                                                of art, boycott this overhyped turkey.",1,2,3,8 November 1999
Finding Neverland," Finding Nothingland
","The only thing that the viewer would find after watching this pedestrian TV-style movie is unsurmountable boredom. The film portrays the pleasures of escapism in the most trivial and unimaginative way. Having Johnny Depp running dressed like an Indian in front of Kate Winslet's children can hardly introduce them to an alternative world created by the powers of imagination. Also the relations between the adults are too pat and convenient to provide any dramatic momentum in this movie. All the potential sources of conflict are glossed over in favour of a predictably lame happy ending. Adequate performances and crisp photography as someone would expect from a period piece, but not much else. For alternatives, the standard choice is 'Mary Poppins' and the superior choice is Terry Gilliam's 'Time Bandits'.",Null,1,3,8 October 2004
Collateral," Classy thriller
","Yet another stylish thriller by Michael Mann who is currently without peer in the neo-noir crime genre. It has a formulaic (lonely taxi-driver is trapped on a death ride with a lonely killer) but solid plot, a superb sense of time and place, well sketched characters whose actions raise the viewer's attention for other reasons than the usual action movie logistics , and some ultrakinetic and suspenseful action scenes which put most of the recent action movies to shame. The performances serve the crisp characterizations well and Mann ,expectedly, imbues the story with his unerring use of the L.A. locations and his impressionistic visual flourishes. It is a more straightforward genre piece, lacking the complexity of 'Heat' and the ambition of 'The Insider' and 'Ali' but, sparing the overstretched ending, it is a perfectly realized thriller from one of the most exciting directors working today.",Null,0,0,26 October 2004
Million Dollar Baby," Unmissable
","There is more than meets the eye, however ample this initially may be, in Clint Eastwood's astounding film. It is more than a gripping and brilliantly performed drama of the rise and tragic fall of a female boxer who is taking her last chance for success in life.The film is a perceptive portrait of social outcasts who, having failed for a variety of reasons to integrate into the society , try to survive in their own enclaved world. Frankie Dunn's (Clint Eastwood) gym is the focal point of this world, a place so untouched by time that seems outlandish. A place that harbours past dreamers who landed abruptly (Morgan Freeman) as well as those who like Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) want to put all their efforts for one last chance of success. For Maggie, unlike her predecessor who dumped once and for all the place and his mentor when he got his chance for the title, success does not necessary translate onto money, but it is more a form of recognition, acceptance and self-esteem or even survival, at least in her own mind. She is sneered and scorned by her family despite her generous efforts of proving her worth and showing her affection. Her actual family lies in the gym and her relationship with Dunn, who is estranged from his family and cannot find solace in the established institutions (Church), becomes blood relationship as time goes by.Boxing is treated in the movie in a matter of fact way - a last refuge for the underdogs and a savage route for survival in a savage world. Boxing itself is indeed peripheral to the movie's central core which is mainly concerned with how relationships evolve (or not) in that isolated world rather than victories.The story is told, unsurprisingly being a Clint Eastwood film, in a deceptively simple but extremely subtle and effective way. There are no high-pitched hammered out scenes to extract emotions from the viewer despite the fact that there were plenty of opportunities in the storyline. Clint Eastwood's directing style can be compared to going from one point to another from the shortest possible way, a method that allows him to go straight in the heart of the matter by separating the wheat from the chaff in order to achieve a genuine degree of representation. A 'Million Dollar Baby' represents movie classicism at its perfection.",Null,4,7,10 February 2005
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Potentially interesting but terminally flawed vampire movie
","This film begins on a very interesting premise: the intrinsic sadness of being immortal, having to live from other people's blood, aimlessly wondering through time and history. Definitely a more existential take of the vampire myth. Unfortunately, it falls short of portraying these issues in a dramatically compelling way. Despite the remarkable art-direction and the unnoticeably creative digital effects, Jordan's direction is clunky and episodic without an acute sense of pace that might have given some life to a drab charting of events on a vampire's 200 year life span. There is practically no focal point in the plot apart from a vague sense of seeking some meaning in a vampire life, something that is forced in the movie than developed, lacking decent scenes to support it. When the film tries to get serious, it becomes laughable mainly due to badly written dialogue and to catastrophic performances. Tom Cruise tries but fails to become convincing as a brash, hedonistic vampire aristocrat, Brad Pitt is totally inept in conveying any sense of existential anguish and Banderas is as usually monolithic. A truly missed opportunity for a compelling take on the vampire myth.",Null,1,4,8 April 2003
