Ford v Ferrari," Puts my faith in the movie business again
","This is what cinema is supposed to be! Amazing chemistry and acting by both leads, seamless CGI and practical effects to enhance the film, a firecracker script, a true story, pulse pounding soundtrack, booming sound mix, and edited so well that 2.5 hours flies by! Completely and utterly engaging . So good in fact I saw it twice within 24 hours . Once in Imax and once in Dolby cinema .",10,822,898,16 November 2019
The Irishman," Just amazing
","Classic Scorsese . De Niro is the best he's been for years . Pacino is really magnetic and charming . But for me, Joe Pesci is the standout. Quietly deadly, magnetic , loyal, complicated, its him that will get the Oscar . Saw it at the cinema ( sorry Netflix but I am not watching Scorsese at home ) and it was superb.
Oh Anna Paquin is used quite cleverly as well. Good actress . Decent performance
Go and see it at the cinema . You will remember the masters returning for one last ride",9,352,615,13 October 2019
