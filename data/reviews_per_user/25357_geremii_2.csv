The Avengers," Could be worse
","If you honestly love one of those heroes (Hulk, Captain America, Iron Man or Thor), this movie is will be a pleasure for you. However, if you want to see The Avengers because of thrilling special effects or tense action, you will be disappointed. First 2/3 of the movie is constant talking and staring at each other followed with clich√© super-hero-type lines and couple of fights between each other. If not R. Downey's Iron Man and his sense of humor it would be a pure pain. I don't know if it was because of too salty popcorns or because of lack of action on the screen, but after an hour of watching it I became really, really bored. I'd bet on the latter, however... :)The last ~1/5 of The Avengers is the battle in NYC. Fight scenes, humour, and CG looks pretty good. However, there is slight feeling that everything was just too easy. In any way you shouldn't search for logic in these type of movies - there isn't any.Bottom line: Good for fans, average for everyone else. But 8.7 - you have to be kidding!",5,11,22,23 May 2012
The Conjuring," Worth its rating
","I went to a surprise screening and was very happy to see that the movie was The Conjuring. I saw the trailer the other day and was pretty impressed, so I was keen to see the movie. However in the end I feel The Conjuring lacked something. There weren't many scary scenes, even though they were sophisticated. Still, you'll be able to find some scenes when you think 'Really???'. I liked the actors, especially Patrick Wilson's character who looked very reassuring throughout the movie and actually put some confidence in scary scenes. There are some jokes, some 'cool' scenes, i.e. when they are installing gadgets in the house and some our generation energetic electronic plays in the background. I think they should have concentrated a bit more on a horror part, because especially in the second part of the movie it becomes more like an action/adventure. Overall - a very decent movie that still could have been a bit better. 8/10.",8,0,2,27 August 2013
