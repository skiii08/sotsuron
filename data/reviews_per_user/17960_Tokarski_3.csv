Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The nay-sayers may now eat their words...
","With the weeks and days before the first episode of the Sat Wars saga was released, many critics who attained a preview of the prequel tore into the movie, claimed that it was a completely terrible flim and not worth the hype that it was given by fans.  As the summary line states...it is.  After seeing the movie the first day that it was out, I can firmly say that the cridits who did not like it must have seen a different movie than I did. The Phantom Menance is a wonderful film in and of itself.  The acting and story is always interesting and, at the very least, very good.  The special effects are back on the screen as everyone expected.  In short, this film is perhaps one of the best in the series, if not one of the most enjoyable films I have seen this year.",8,0,2,19 May 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," One of the greatest musicals of the last century
","The film is a masterpiece of comedy and music.  Fooled into it by it's hummor, the view quickly realizes that it is actually a comedy/musical, and begins singing along with the film's masterpieces.  Though, not for everyone, I did originally watch this film in a theatre in Indiana where a trio of late teenage/early 20 year olds where horified at the film, yet at the same time an elderly couple in thier late 60's or early 70's where laughing so hard I was fearfull that one of them may have a heart-attack.All together, a 10 out of 10 for a movie that should have been nominated for an Oscar Award!",10,2,2,23 January 2002
Elizabeth," Why did this film get nominated for an Oscar???
","Even before this film was realised, I wanted to see it.  After it was nominated for the Oscar, I REALLY wanted to see it...then I saw it.... This film is one of the worse things I have ever seen.  I spent half of the movie trying to figure out who the characters were (such as who Sir Robert and Sir William were in real life) and then the rest of it trying to believe why the film got nomintated.  The acting was good, but this film to so many poetic liberties that it became horridly disgusting save for most of the acting.  The plot became confusing for even me, who, I have to add, has read up on this period.  I fail to see how this film did so well.",6,0,0,15 May 1999
