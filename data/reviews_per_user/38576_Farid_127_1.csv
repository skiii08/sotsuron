First Man," A poetic interpretation of Neil Armstrong's life.
","All of his movies (Mr.Chazelle) are about men and women who has a big dream. Like himself. He had a big dream too. He got Oscar on 32. So his films have a common feeling. and I love this feeling. I don't think 'First Man' is lower than 'La La Land'. If it is not better, It's not lower. And what a Great interpretation. A Poetic interpretation of Neil Armstrong's life. At the end, I loved this. It will be lasting on my mind... And its AMAZING MUSIC!",10,1,4,3 February 2019
