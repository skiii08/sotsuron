Scarface," The greatest gangster movie ever made.
","When I saw Scarface, I was very impressed and surprised. I expected to see an action filled, mindless, formula gangster movie, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that Scarface was a very well acted, well scripted and well directed movie. I do not think that it is in any way a better movie than The Godfathers 1 and 2 or Goodfellas, but I do think that it is a better movie from the gangster aspect. It is a classic story of the rise and fall of a crime kingpin. Al Pacino creates one of the most memorable characters in the history of cinema, and Michelle Pfeifer and Steven Bauer, while not outstanding, are solid in their supporting roles.Do not be put off by the fact that Scarface is a very long movie. Tony will keep you glued to the T.V. and itching to find out what he will do next. While this movie does have strong violence, it is nothing compared to today's movies. This movie is heaven for fans of the gangster genre.10/10",10,2,4,24 June 2009
The Blind Side," What a Piece of Crap
","I walked into this movie with high hopes. After seeing a wave of violent, depressing movies, (Precious, Hurt Locker, to name a couple) I was finally ready to see an insightful, uplifting, intelligent movie.I was terribly disappointed.The Blind Side was not only bad, it was offensive. It is full of melodrama, stupid clich√©s and unrealistic events.Take the scene where Leigh Anne is looking for Michael and she is talking to the guys Michael just had a fight with, and she say, 'You listen to me, bitch,' and then goes off on an angry rant, and the guys just sit there and seem scared.Yeah, right.Another problem with the film is the way it treats black people. They are portrayed either as drug addicted monsters or as helpless, infantile idiots.Two thumbs down for Blind Side.",1,62,124,13 March 2010
The Truman Show," Dreamy, thought provoking, and overall wonderful movie.
","This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Has possibly the most original and thought provoking themes that I have ever seen on film. At first glance, this movie seems sloppy, confusing, and a waste of time. But don't jump to conclusions! As you watch, you will find yourself growing more and more excited. This movie carries you like a dream, with great acting and imaginative writing. Anyone will fall in love with Truman, wishing the best for him, as he sets out to conquer the makers of the Truman show. As you find out how more and more people in Truman's life are fake, you will eventually wonder if you're watching a regular movie or someone's nightmare. Ed Harris is smooth as silk and cool as a cucumber as he plays the directorial genius, and at the same time, you will see little touches of a madman. I would not doubt it if someone starts out saying that the movie is dull, pointless and absolutely dumb, and finishes the film saying that it was the best movie they have ever seen. The acting is totally different than anything I have ever seen, and the directing has the Kubrick feeling. Truly amazing accomplishment in film.",10,0,1,24 August 2006
