The Blair Witch Project," Finally a recent movie that requires imagination.
","Though it was billed by the media and the critics to be 'scary'... I found it not scary at all.  In fact, leaving the theater I turned to my friends and told them that the movie gave me this deep desire to go camping. While it wasn't what I expected, I found myself really enjoying this movie (which is why I gave it a vote of 8), because it really made me want to use my imagination on what really happened to three movie makers in the film.For a while now, movies just spoon-fed you everything... it's nice to see a movie that requires you to use a little of the gray matter in your head and draw your own conclusions.  And it shows that you don't need a grossly huge budget from a big-name studio to make a good movie.",8,1,2,13 August 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," It's nice to see South Park going back to it's... 'vulgar' roots.
","Ever since I first saw Spirit of Christmas (long before Trey and Matt got their deal with Comedy Central), I was a bit disappointed when I finally saw the first couple of episodes on TV.  Something was... missing.  Though it's far beyond the limit of good taste, I found this movie to go back to it's roots... and hilarilously funny.The musical aspect of the movie (with it's parodies of Sound of Music and Les Miserables) was refreshing and very nicely done, though I could have done without the whole Saddam Hussian number.  And the various puns and references to old South Park episodes (like the Mecha-Streisand poster when the kids first see the 'Asses of Fire' movie) made me realized that even after three viewings, there was still things that I missed.Trey and Matt should be proud, this is a wonderful attempt to bring South Park onto the big screen.  I, for one, know that I'll be one of the first in line for the DVD when it's released.",8,0,0,13 August 1999
Tarzan," Wonderful and beautiful animation, enlightening story... typical Disney.
","Now being an employee of the Disneyland Resort, I might be a little bias. But recently, with flops as the Hunchback of Notre Dame and Hercules (which I throughly detested) after some hits like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and the Lion King... it's nice to see Disney finally bringing itself up with Mulan and Tarzan.The animation, like that of Mulan, is just spectacular.  Though more computer animation is being used, it's getting really hard to tell what is hand-drawn and computer generated now.  The characters are refreshing, but the art is what did it for me.  I had the privilege of seeing the movie with a group of those who worked on the movie's animation and I could not stop praising their accomplishment.  The three years of work put into Tarzan really showed by the product that was released... it was a complete joy to watch.  I hope that the same effort that was put into Tarzan will be reflected in Fantasia 2000, Atlantis, and Kingdom of the Sun.",9,1,1,13 August 1999
