The Blair Witch Project," incredibly unnerving at times
","If your looking for something new at theaters, The Blair Witch Project is the ticket. The movie actually gives you very little information, only bits and pieces of a legend, but its what they don't say that makes your imagine what could of happened to these three young people while lost in the woods. Some might tire of the way the film is shot, by using two hand held video camera.  After awhile the constant motion of the filming made me feel sick and I had to look away from the screen. (especially during the running scenes).  However, this was an incredibly entertaining movie.  The last scene will leave you with a cold chill and will not be easily forgotten.  It just proves that there is some originality left in Hollywood, I hope to see more.",7,1,2,4 August 1999
American Pie," laugh out loud comedy
","What a nice surprise....this movie proved to be the best laugh that I've had all year! Sure to become a classic.  Old material presented in an original fashion, with hysterical moments that go from start to finish.  Can't wait to see it again!",9,0,0,25 July 1999
