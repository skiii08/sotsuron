Hereditary," Embarrassing disaster, don't believe the hype!!!
","As a horror fan, I have been waiting for this movie for months after seeing the very good trailee and all the hype from festivals. My favourite horror movies are The Exorcist and The Shining so seeing all these reviews comparing Hereditary to both I was hoping for a new horror masterpiece. Well wow. After an interesting but far from scary first hour, the movie descends into a ridiculous, over the top, laughable mess that was embarrassing to watch. Yes the acting is good, at least until **SPOILER ALERT** the 'seances' and it all goes downhill from there. The ending was so awful and stupid that I could not believe that was it. Really??? The stupid demon thing with the crown and everything, with the music volume turned to 11 as if it would make it scary??? It was laughable. And many in the cinema were laughing. I wasn't - spending Â£12 for such a turkey is no laughing matter. Avoid like the plague!!",1,47,92,17 June 2018
Constantine," A total disaster
","It's with a certain glee that I am submitting my opinion on this 'movie'. Once in a while comes a movie that is so atrociously bad that it becomes fun to hate. CONSTANTINE is one of these movies. It's easily (too easily) the worst movie of 2005, but it's also a strong contender for the worst movie of the last 5 years. Before you dismiss me as a Keanu Reeves hater, know that I love (and own on DVD) the full Matrix trilogy (yes, even Revolutions) and My Own Private Idaho, definitely his best role to date. I'm also a big horror movie fan. So all in all I was really excited when I went to see that film. The trailer was awesome, I couldn't wait! The film starts well, I mean the first 5 to 10 minutes. It's all downhill from there, culminating in the most unexciting climax of all time, with Peter Stormare as the most ridiculous and non-threatening Satan ever. Keanu Reeves kind of proves his naysayers right by offering one of his most awful and wooden performances ever, on a par with his 'work' in Brad Stoker's Dracula, but worse, as in that movie he didn't have such a long time on screen. Here, he's there constantly, non-playing. Ewww. Rachel Weisz is good (as always), but not enough to save the film. I lost any interest whatsoever after half an hour, and the only reason I didn't leave the theater was that I didn't want to be rude to my mate, who I had dragged to see this. I thought maybe he was enjoying it. However, when the stupid and absolutely unexciting climax happened, I turned to him and asked 'Are you enjoying this?' He replied 'Are you kidding??' 'Should we leave then?' did I ask... 'It's almost over, we might as well stay'. Well we shouldn't have. The ending was as bad as the rest of the movie. Oh, for those of you who think 'it might not be fantastic, but I'll watch it for the special effects'... a word of warning: the CGI looks like a cheap video game, absolutely not realistic. Rent it if you must, but don't make a blind buy, you will regret it bitterly!",1,3,8,22 July 2005
Silent Hill," Disappointing
","I took 2 friends to see this and none of us liked the film. Both said it was one of the worst movies they've ever seen! I won't be so harsh but still I was embarrassed to have dragged them into Silent Hill.I played the game years ago but I didn't remember much of the story, just that I enjoyed playing it. My friends did not now the game. This may be for fans only, judging by the other reviews.The good things about the film: it looks great, and Pyramid Head is excellent but has very little screen time. The climax is OK and ultra CGI-gory with some nightmarish visions, but what a drag to get there. I was bored most of the movie. The dialog was very bad at times, and the screenplay is simply go there, find clue, go somewhere else, find another clue... OK for a game, but for a movie? it sure feels like watching the game, but in a bad way.I loved Brotherhood of the Wolf and my main motivation in seeing this was to see if Christophe Gans could pull it off. Compared to Doom or Uwe Boll's disasters he did - it's probably the best video game adaptation I've seen, the only that vaguely resembles a real movie. But it never becomes more than that. Worth a rental at best.",4,1,4,23 April 2006
Insidious," An unofficial remake of Poltergeist - good for the first half only...
","Honestly, I didn't think it was original at all because it felt like an unofficial remake of Poltergeist. It's basically the same plot.**SPOILERS** **SPOILERS** Poltergeist: a little girl disappears into limbo after paranormal activity at the house. The parents ask a team of paranormal researchers, comprising of an old eccentric lady who is a medium and two younger male assistants, for help. The little girl is in danger as all the ghosts in the netherworld are attracted to her, so is the Beast, who wants to use her to cross over into our world. The mom, with the help of the medium, crosses over to the other side and brings her daughter back. All seems well but then all hell breaks loose in a spectacular ending that sees the ghosts take over the house.Sounds familiar?! Insidious: a little boy disappears into limbo after paranormal activity at the house. The parents ask a team of paranormal researchers, comprising of an old eccentric lady who is a medium and two younger male assistants, for help. The little boy is in danger as all the ghosts in the netherworld are attracted to him, so is a Demon, who wants to use him to cross over into our world. The dad, with the help of the medium, crosses over to the other side and brings his son back. All seems well but then all hell breaks loose in a spectacular ending that sees the ghosts take over the house.Of course there are many differences between both films, but as you can see it's basically the same story. I thought the first hour was great, then it became ridiculous and other the top. Poltergeist is much better in my opinion! THAT was the original one.",6,1,2,20 August 2011
The Descent," Oppressive and scary!
","***Slight spoilers*** I went to see this last night and I wasn't expecting much. I wasn't that impressed with DOG SOLDIERS, but a friend wanted me to come with her and I'm glad I did! If like me you are a bit claustrophobic in real life, I can promise you that you'll be squirming in your seat even before the nasty 'crawlers' are revealed. Just watching the girls go down such narrow wormholes sent my heartbeat into overdrive. There are a few nail-biting moments in that 1st part of the film. After that, the first shock is very effective and then the jumps keep on coming until the end. Well done Mr Marshall! I am a horror fan and I see almost everything in that genre, but the Descent managed to freak me out a few times, and that doesn't happen very often! Well recommended.",9,1,4,19 July 2005
War of the Worlds," War of the Worlds = WOW indeed!!!
","I just came back from seeing the movie a second time and after reading some of the awful comments here, I felt I had to add my own comment.First of all, yes, I am a Spielberg fan, mostly because I was 10 years old when I saw E.T. and ever since I've had a passion for his movies. That said, each time I see a new movie from him, I keep expecting to be as thrilled as I was as a kid or a teenager. However, even though I like his recent films, I never felt thrilled or awed watching Catch Me If You Can or the Terminal. I still enjoyed them, but they didn't seem very 'Spielbergy' to me. Minority Report was close, but not jaw-dropping.I went in to see War of the Worlds with HUGE expectations, and I was bracing myself for at least a slight disappointment. After all, I felt as excited for Revenge of the Sith, but came out bitterly disappointed. And just before War of the Worlds started, I was sitting in the theater reading a 2 star review from the Evening Standard, that was quite harsh so I got a bit worried as the lights went down.Well that didn't last. Spielberg fan or not, I was absolutely BLOWN AWAY by what was shown on the big screen. It's one of those movie experiences when you are glued to the screen in total awe, your mouth wide open. You can't believe what you're seeing because you've never seen anything like it - ever. For me it felt like seeing the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park for the first time, or seeing the first Matrix for the first time. It was that awesome, and my jaw was on my knees quite a few times. There are some incredible images in that film, that stay with you after seeing the movie. Classic Spielberg! As for the ending that lots of people are complaining about: well that's exactly as Wells wrote it, and as it happens in the original film. You don't like it? Blame Wells! If Spielberg had done it differently the fans of the book and the original would have been screaming for his blood. It could have been extended a bit, yes, but frankly this is a minor gripe when you consider the whole movie. How people can give this movie a 1 simply because they didn't like the faithful ending or because they hate Tom Cruise is beyond me. A 1 is for Catwoman OK? There is so much genius on display here... just go and see it and be awed. I can't wait for the DVD!",9,2,5,1 July 2005
Lord of War," Good, but not great
","I enjoyed 'Lord of War', although I was expecting more from Andrew Niccol. That said, this is an extremely interesting movie that took some courage to make. Nicolas Cage is believable and doesn't overplay for once. The script is a little clichéd sometimes but for mere details.The best thing about the movie is the really dark humour through its snappy dialogue. For instance when Cage describes the AK-47. As informative as it is shocking, and it brings uneasy laughs sometimes... proof that it works! The opening sequence following a bullet from its factory to the skull of its victim is well done and sets the tone for the entire film.Give it a try, worth watching.",7,0,2,8 March 2006
