The Perks of Being a Wallflower," the perks of being a wallflower
","before even seeing the movie i was excited for the because i heard that the sound track is brilliant and am a sucker for good music the movie is wonderful and brilliant in so many ways u, got to relate to the characters so easily and feel what they feel and what they are going through i mean even if u never been in such situation u just get in touch with them especially Charlie who gets u to be sympathized with and u feel his awkwardness and his pain. Sam and Patric are two brilliant characters who u wish to befriend them as they represent what anyone would look in a friend the movie accumulate to a stunning ending with the song ((heros)) like a cheery on a heart worming ice cream",10,0,1,2 January 2013
