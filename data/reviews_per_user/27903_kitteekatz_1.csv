Hereditary," Horrible Horror Movie
","This is a horrible, ugly, movie. Watch it only if you like to see children decapitated, fathers spontaneously bursting into flames and continuing to burn when the son comes upon his body. This movie has characters with no redeeming qualities. You do not like them and do not care about them. No redeeming value to this movie whatsoever. Disgusting events, characters that are not likable. I expected a decent movie with stars like Toni Collette and Gabriel Byrne. This leaves a very bad taste in your mouth. Ugh.",1,5,11,10 September 2018
