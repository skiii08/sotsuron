It," OK if you haven't read the book or think clowns are scary in themselves.
","Started so well I thought it was going to be a good re-telling of King's novel. Then it hit the bog standard horror, that's a very dark room with strange noises, I'll have to go and take a look. Pennywise starts well at the beginning, then seems to be the most inept creature of evil ever. What's really scary is the end credits label it as chapter 1, now we're scared of another franchise et infinitum.",5,0,3,21 November 2018
Detroit," Usual
","If you're Black this will be great, as it reinforces all your prejudices. If you're White it's usual black good / white bad. Get real, most blacks are killed by blacks, blacks kill more cops than cops killing blacks. Civil injustice doesn't excuse rioting for looting, don't respect the law, don't expect respect back. It's usual White bashing, without a real appraisal of the criminal & political black players who profit from this eternal conflict.",6,14,33,30 November 2017
Monty Python's Life of Brian," A great classic comedy
","This is Monty Python at their silliest irreverent best. Some tried and failed to ban this film on release, thank God we're not ruled by Taliban or Shia laws. The stand out moments are the stoning and what have they ever done for us.Add in the man who wants to be a woman and have children, can the liberation front call it oppression if he actually can't. The Judean liberation fighters are excellent satire on political parties divided and ruled by committees. There's so much more all the way through the film, this is a truly must see comedy.",10,1,2,31 January 2018
The Death of Stalin," Great black comedy.
","Really enjoyed it, which isn't something I say often regarding recent films. It makes fun of some of the most powerful, dangerous men in World history let alone Russian. The accents are all English & American which I feel added to the comic effect, rather than detracting from the dialogue.The cast were all very good, and seemed to be enjoying it, without over doing anything. I'd be happy to see a sequel or actually prequel French Revolution - The Terror. This team could do it well.",8,2,8,20 February 2018
Darkest Hour," Forget real history, it might be good
","Couldn't be bothered watching this through, if it was make believe it'd be very good I presume. Well acted, well shot, well off in everything relating to true events. Opening scenes in the House refer to the debate following the Norway fiasco, yet fail to portray the real actors in Chamberlains downfall, Lloyd George and Amery. Churchill's absence has more to do with the failures of the First Lord of the admiralty who was the propagator of that - guess who. Next we have Chamberlain at dinner with party friends saying he'll resign, everyone suggests Halifax, he declines ??? Reality - Chamberlain asked Churchill if he saw any reason why a Lord could not lead the house of commons, Churchill silently kept staring out the window, his time had come. He was a great inspirational leader, but Brookes his CIGS ( head of General staff ) was a real hero just reigning in Churchill's wild ideas. Churchill was responsible for the Gallipoli landings in WW1, the fiasco of Norway in WW2, and the soft underbelly which became the tough old gut - Italy. He was a great man as leader at that time, but we all have flaws. Footnote - Neville Chamberlain - the most maligned man ever took the fall when war broke out, before that he was popular for keeping the peace.",5,7,10,7 February 2018
World War Z," I thought zombies had been done to death, but it's ok waste of time actually.
","WWZ fans are going to hate this as it's not what they wanted or expected. The producers might have been better advised to use another title. Overall a decent film worth wasting time on. I'd rate this 3rd on Zombie movies, 5th if you include mutants. Truth being I'm still waiting for a film that really makes me think I'm seeing something new. We used to have them, they used to try, now it's same old franchise fodder.",7,0,1,19 October 2018
Zootopia," Great film for all ages.
","It's a great feel good film with lots of fun for everyone. Kids will love it whilst only adults will smirk at lines like ' only a bunny can call another bunny cute '. Some reviews refer to a political subplot, I.E. it's left wing all living together in harmony. It seemed to have that with a twist, it's not the obvious mean guy predators who are a threat. It's the outwardly meek proponents of this who seek division for their own political ends. It's clever in it's ambivalence, it's great to just watch and be entertained.",10,2,4,20 August 2017
12 Monkeys," Found it so Gilliamesque, dystopian 1984 and Brazil.
","For so long watching a modern and future World filled with old industrial settings, you get the feeling it's trying too hard to be Orwellian. The care in the community centre of 1990 looks like an asylum from 2 or 3 decades previously. The future World isn't even a joke it's so awfully caricatured. I give it 4 as Arnie in Terminator showed his bum once, Bruce gets to do it 3 times until I stopped watching. It's stupid nonsense getting away with Sci - Fi label.",4,1,3,12 August 2018
12 Angry Men," Great classic.
","They don't make 'em like they used too, obviously as you'll never have a jury composed of 12 white men ever again. But this is all about drama, no special effects, just a fine ensemble of actors. A story that has elements of a whodunnit after the trial ends, which seems watertight. Seems like a quick vote and let's get out of here. Then someone, 'there's always one' starts raising questions, along with the temperature. So you then get clashes of ego, culture and background, very entertaing film.",8,0,1,2 April 2018
Finding Nemo," A nice feel good movie, what do you expect from animation.
","Was this film made for lonely sad adults to appraise it's artistic or cultural impact. It's a great family with young kids film, especially when all we're left with is the new Marvel or DC comic action hero film. It's a nice film accept it for what it is.",8,0,0,23 March 2018
Constantine," Good start then truly comic book.
","The film is OK, managed to watch it all. But it started so well I was disappointed towards the end. It did become U.S. comic book stuff, take on demons, forget exorcism you need assault shotguns and dragons breath flame throwers. As to why the archangel Gabriel would wish to punish mankind by unleashing the son of Satan is beyond comprehension. I wouldn't recommend this, but can't trash it. Try Omen series or the Exorcist before this, stories that don't need to rely on CGI.",6,1,1,18 November 2017
Malcolm X," I couldn't take over 3 hours of white bashing.
","Can someone please write a history or produce a film that truly represents the history of slavery. White men enslaved white men, they were actually the last to get involved in the African slave trade. The Arabs were busy in trading on the Eastern Africa coast, the Whites arrived later on the Western coast. This is just trading posts before colonisation, one thing the powerful AFRICAN nations could trade was slaves. Look to your 'brothers' before accusing every white of slavery. None of my ancestors ever owned a maid / servant let alone a slave, yet we're all held responsible. We're sick and tired of this racial stereotyping, seems we're the only ones you can keep accusing of a crime we weren't complicit let alone guilty of. My family and ancestors have never been interested in colonizing foreign countries, so stop the scattergun whites to blame game. A few were, most were innocent bystanders of history. Stop blaming every one of a certain race, otherwise you just cause further antagonism.",4,9,24,10 March 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Finally a film with a new story, great.
","Really enjoyed this, it has everything, and all done well. It was refreshing to have characters who are new, not knowing if they were usual predictable sorts. There's drama, pathos and some really good comic moments. The cast are all brilliant, some great cameos from the lesser known. Of all the recent films I'd say this is the one to watch.",9,12,25,18 February 2018
Nightcrawler," Very good film.
","It's scary in a very real sense, it's about boundaries, crossing the line, like when did news become entertainment. How often do we see news reports that are nothing more than opinions because they don't have enough or any facts to report. It has moments of humour, our anti hero is trying to live the American dream based on some online business course. Problem being he treats life & everyone as a business deal, some of which is very funny. But then it raises the question have we forgotten morality and decency in a pursuit of wealth. Sometimes reviews work, I only watched this whilst searching through and found a highly rated film by viewers.",10,1,1,5 February 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Excellent in all respects.
","I say excellent but give 9, I just think the last part should have been given over to the original Live Aid recording of Freddie - the ultimate performer. This guy could rock a stadium with or without music.For all his faults of which there were many, which this film doesn't gloss over, he was an exceptional talent. Queen as a whole are part of a pantheon of bands of all genres whose music will out live us all.",9,2,4,18 February 2019
We're the Millers," Great fun movie
","Really liked this film, it was fun spending the time with this bunch. Plot maybe absurd or maybe not. But kudos to the writers and actors both pulled it off magnificently. Lots of laughs along the way, but also I liked these people. I wanted a happy ending, most films I want the hero to die because they bore me. If you just want to have a giggle watch this.",9,0,4,18 August 2017
No Country for Old Men," Was that really the end.
","Started off OK, got better when Tommy Lee Jones entered, always enjoyed his movies. It trundled along in fairly standard format for this genre, then the greatest anti - climax ever. I actually checked if there was an extended version or directors cut, but no it's the biggest cop out on an ending ever. It wasn't cleverly done as some new twist or sometimes bad guys win, it was pathetic. As for the bad guy, fair enough he played it well, but it wasn't that hard to do.",5,2,8,17 February 2018
Remember the Titans," Watched it all, even though I thought I wouldn't.
","8 to me is a good film, especially when the synopsis leans towards the usual Hollywood blackcentric or social commentary. Early on I thought how much more Black good / White bad can I take. Once you've finished with Getttysburg nonsense the idea that rank and file Union / Confederate troops were fighting for or against slavery it settles down to decent viewing.The Whites actually become human, some even showing more sensitivity than Blacks. Must be worth 5 votes in itself :-) Has the usual heavy dose of U.S. touching moments, but the star is the white coach daughter.",8,1,2,9 March 2018
Zulu," It is a great film.
","It's a very accurate depiction of those events, but possibly veers too much to the official line of the time. What happened there was incredible bravery on both sides, but proved what the Boers had learned long ago. Concentrated firepower within a fortified position can stop far superior numbers of less well armed assailants. Everyone there deserved a Victoria cross, but those awarded were basically due to a thankful government following the debacle of Isandlwala the day before. I love both films, but I'd rate Zulu Dawn as slightly better.",10,3,4,11 December 2017
I Am Legend," Rate the film, not the book
","If you've not read the books, watch the film. It's a very good film, bad reviews always come from those who've read the book. Authors create characters and scenes in the readers imagination, they're never satisfied with the cinematic interpretation. I rate this film quite highly having watched it the second time. Must admit the dog steals acting credits in some scenes, it makes loneliness a major factor in sole survival.",8,1,2,30 October 2017
A Quiet Place," Give it the 1 as I'm trying to figure out how the percentage rating works.
","I was about to watch this as it was rated as 8, looked at user reviews to see what it's basically about. Lo and behold a full first page of very disgruntled viewers thinking they just wasted a part of their lives. Have to sell films, downloads, air time, that's fine but don't massage the figures. We can still spot lies when we see them, and none of us outside of media and politics like lies. Give us honest scores from critics, but more importantly viewers, otherwise suffer the consequences.",1,7,14,30 May 2018
Event Horizon," Good actors - bad film.
","I sat through an hour of it and got bored with same old same old. I don't know if it turned into some blood gore fest, I really don't care. The story-line is leaden, the characters are uninteresting, I really hope they all died and the alien was worth waiting for. CGI, lighting, cinematography, NO I want a story that either grips me or draws me in, first 2 Aliens did that.",1,4,8,30 October 2017
From Dusk Till Dawn," It's a fun watch, scary only when ppl try to over analyse it.
","Watched it again as there's lack of anything interesting lately. It's typical Tarantino style movie, you're never really sure what if any genre the film should be placed in. It has violence, perversion and evil even before vampires are involved.Add in the comedic parts with possibly the most sensuous film dance ( IMDb needs a poll on this ), it's a good film.",7,0,1,22 May 2018
Green Street Hooligans," It's very funny, can't but laugh at most of it.
","Harvard or whatever Ivy league college student ends up in London and joins the ICF or GSE in this case. It also happens to be Elijah Wood, which if your not giggling already, proves himself in the most stupid hooligans fight scene I've seen. There was some research, either a few well known books or talked to some known casuals. Pubs and train stations are the preferred ambush if no arena has been agreed. It seems like some Yank has seen this happening and made a film with US interest, which is why it fails, except on laughs.",5,0,2,7 August 2018
The Shape of Water," Pretentious art school, and oh so correct apart from the story.
","I managed half an hour thinking it can't be as bad as some say. It wasn't, but it was nowhere near as good as some say. Great cinematography and what ? The craziest storyline possible, do the US military let alone the secret research and development agencies outsource cleaning duties. Then came the cliches of white racial profiling, all white men are bastards. Women and homosexuals are such wonderful caring people. I watched 3 billboards last night and was thoroughly entertained, if this thing gets anything other than art awards at the Oscars, it's a stitch up by the PC and art school brigade. It did show many clips from old movies, I wish I'd taken the hint and watched the Creature From The Black Lagoon instead.",3,4,22,19 February 2018
Black Panther," This has a rating of 7.6 at the latest count - HOW
","If this was white panther with white cast it would be slated to hell, it's awful. Most high ratings seem to be we finally have a black superhero, many of which come from the usual patronizing whites.You want real black superheroes watch Zulu Dawn or Long Walk To Freedom, This is pathetic in comparison.",1,5,7,6 May 2018
Trainspotting," Very good film, pulls no punches.
","At times funny, always intriguing rather than entertaining. This is a sad story of those wretched people caught up in the horrors and squalor of depending on drugs more than anything in life. It may be shocking to some, but it never glamorises this sorry state, there are no heroes they're all low life. The main character remains a thief and recusant druggie until the end.",9,0,1,4 August 2018
Fantastic Mr. Fox," It's OK but nothing to really shout 10 at.
","There have been some great animated films in recent times, this won't rank amongst them. But it's a decent waste of time, good enough to watch but not really remember. It doesn't match the best in the genre, an all star over voice can't make a story more interesting than it is.",7,1,3,2 September 2018
Munich," Great film, hard questions with harder answers.
","Really enjoyed this, one of those films that can have you arguing with yourself if two wrongs make a right. Can a nation, if it's politicians decide, rightfully take revenge whilst it's own citizens would face severe consequences if they did the same. The film handles this well, at the start you understand this desire for retribution. Then it throws up, we only did that because of this you did to us. If you've an open mind it leaves you even more confused as to who is right and who is wrong in this sorry state of affairs.",9,1,2,28 March 2018
Kingsman: The Secret Service," As good or as silly as any Bond movie.
","Didn't watch this to analyze the plot, sub-plots or characters. Just had a couple of hours to spare to hopefully be entertained and have a giggle now and then, it did it. It's a silly spy movie with ridiculous heroes and villains, with a lot of deference paid to the Bond genre. Not a must see or avoid at all costs, average = worth watching when you've nothing better to do for a couple of hours.",6,1,2,18 August 2017
Green Book," Very good film, mainly because it's something different.
","Now and again amongst the comic book franchises, the re- hashed horror and total CGI comes an interesting story that's truly entertaining. I don't know if it's just a blip in studio output but they have recently released some good films with different stories. The whole cast were excellent, the editing / pacing well done, all helped by a script that had a bit of everything. Furthermore it's not a PC preachy type, it just retells a story for viewers to consider. Very good, watch when you can.",9,1,2,22 February 2019
Alien: Covenant," Alien died a long time ago, nothing to see here, move along.
","Alien would rate as one of my top ten films, bear in mind I have some Western, Mob, Comedy and other Sci-Fi in there. I watched Aliens and thought that was great, it took the story to a new level, brilliant sequel. Then came Alien 3 and you knew there's nothing new, its just a brand now, put it out with this name people will buy it. Watched Covenant hoping they'd resurrected the corpse, they buried it even deeper. If you've seen the first two Alien films you'll hate this, if you can actually start from this and be interested you'll be OK. Because you can work your way back to the originals and enjoy the best made with less money and CGI. They knew how to make movies in the old days :-)",2,4,5,15 February 2018
The Godfather," It's the ultimate groundbreaker in mob films.
","Look at the cast, the director and writer, you know full well this is a film to watch, even if it's about an Italian pizzeria. Joking aside this was The Godfather of so many great mob films of later date. Certain well known Italians and Sicilians didn't like it, probably didn't run the studio and couldn't make an offer they can't refuse.Does romanticize these murderous clans somewhat, but does portray the Sicilian honour, blood feud and just business ideology well . This is a must see.",9,1,1,10 June 2018
