Catch Me If You Can," A Great Work by LeonardoDiCaprio
","The movie is yet another great one by DiCaprio.The title of the movie itself temped me to watch it at first.Its a great blend of con tricks that keeps you attracted throughout the movies.Though its a little old movie for now but its appreciably entertaining.The most beautiful part of the movie is that its based on a true story.The slight emotional blends in between that guide the storyline of the movie was real success.Personally,I am a lover of Drama,Thriller,or Action but this ,though completely different Genre,that I stated above was equally entertaining.Overall,I would call for this movie as a must watch in lifetime.",9,2,3,27 February 2016
The Shawshank Redemption," The movie is little bit slow and simple but highly original
","The movie ,though good,is relatively slow and simple than a movie should be of such a high rating.The major criteria of its high rating is its simplicity and the presentation of prison life in the movie which is actually quite convincing.Also the movie is quite emotional that makes you feel cry at some moments.The plot of the movie is simple and short enough.The director focuses much more on filming prison life than completing the plot which is quite good from critics point of view.We find this attitude among directors in very few movies nowadays.Freeman, as usual,out shows his impressive acting skills which adds a great flavor to its originality.But if you like action,drama,thriller movie this might not be able to cater your demands.Instead if you like to have a good time watching some fine stuff in terms of originality its a must watch.",8,0,0,26 February 2016
Deadpool," An Awesome Experience Watching this movie
","Guys,if you seriously want to have a good time watching a movie then this is it.That's yet the best entertaining movie I have watched. No matter what genre you like be it romance,action,thriller,comedy,and drama it caters all of it in a single piece.That's a rare combination in a movie we know that.Also the thing I came to know after watching this movie was that in the movie Origins:The Wolverine the one Wolverine fights in the last part of the movie was Deadpool only.So the movie basically derives its roots from XMen Series.Ryan Reynolds confirms through his acting that no one can replace him in this role.Seems like the guy has been made for this role.",9,1,10,26 February 2016
