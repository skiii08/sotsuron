Come and See," charnel house in occupied Belarussia
","I saw this movie many years ago and scenes still remain imprinted on my mind. Though it was still made in the USSR, in was made when the winds of glasnost were starting to well and truly blow. The movie whilst still sticking to the maxim that the Soviets were the good guys, nevertheless portrays the casual brutality of partisan warfare in a realistic unromantic way.The SS 'action' in the Belarussian village is one of the most disturbing depictions of the second world war ever directed outside of the real footage of these things. The SS troops are on a anti-partisan operation and enter the Belarussian village. The next 10-15 minutes remained in my memory for many years after. Though the suffering of the occupied peoples under Nazi's was often used for pro-Soviet propaganda in art and film, even if it was the case in this film, the sheer horror of these scenes transcends the political.2 scenes are particularly powerful in this section of the film:The scene were the SS officer lunches in a village hut, in front of a cowering peasant family, desperate to placate the soldiers, is quite terrifying and suspenseful and all the more effective for the violence that does eventually occur.Secondly, at the end of the slaughter,the Nazi soldiers are seen laughing carry out on a bed an old bedridden blind babushka lady from a burning farmhouse. They make some horrible joke about saving her to be a breeder, and as the village burns behind her she is observed blindly staring into the smoke filled sky full of incomphrehensible terror.From memory the movie does lapse into propaganda abit heavily at the end. Nevertheless at the end of the film the credits list the number of Belarussian villages destroyed (buildings and people)....I cant remember the exact number but it was hundreds and it is quite a sobering figure....regardless of the Soviet spin the film is valuable in shining a light into a dark corner of mans inhumanity to fellow man.",Null,42,66,8 March 2004
The Queen," The Monarch and the Moderniser.
","A well acted , well scripted gem. Mirren as her maj. and Sheen as PM Blair are both excellent. The contrast between the young Tony Blair and the staid monarch and how their relationship develops over the Diana crisis is interesting. While the film in no way is flattering to the royal family - by humanizing the lady, Mirren makes her a complex figure, we feel for her bewilderment and hurt as she totally misjudges the mood of the country in the week following Di's death. The mutual respect that Tony Blair and the Queen seem to develop over the crisis is also one of the pleasures of the film. Despite their very different world views one gets the feeling at the end of the film they have a regard of sorts for each other.Its all speculation of course, we will never know exactly what transpired between these figures in those August days, but its all been gloriously imagined in this film. I found it a great reflection on the loneliness of high office and the fickleness of power. The film reminded me how impressive Tony Blair was in that amazing week. It made it kind of sad comparing this with his impending exit from politics, and the high levels of cynicism regarding his political legacy. As Mirren says to the PM in the movie 'they all turn on you eventually'.",9,0,1,5 January 2007
Hart's War," Courtroom drama in POW cage
","I actually found this movie really good at first, it visuals , story etc really seemed to be going places. It concerns a young deskbound officer who is inadvertently captured by the Germans and sent to a POW camp in the final months of the Second World War. It is here he is involved in a court martial of a black airman accused of the murder of a fellow white inmate. Unfortunately as the action procedes despite introduction of some interesting plot elements it eventually waters down as a ultimately a routine mating between a courtroom drama/escape movie lacking any emotional depth from the performances.Having said this there are things to admire in it: The first 15 minutes are so are quite compelling. The capture of the American officer and the killing of his offsider are quite horrific. And the scenes of the chilly winter and the pows transit through it by train & march are quite evocative. I also found from an amateur historian point of view quite surprising for an Hollywood film about captured Americans that at least touches on the appalling treatment of the Russian Pows by the Nazis & the racist philosophy behind it, the Commandant berates the the American Pows for saluting 3 executed Russians saying they are saluting criminals and 'sub-humans'. Likewise the racism of the fellow inmates towards their black comrades is not sanitised. I liked some of the moral ambiguitues of the characters. The young Hart is not really a hero, though he tried he couldn't withstand the interrogation by the Wermacht and revealed information, The Bruce Willis character in spite of his Christ like sacrifice at the end of the film still didnt accord the black officers the protection or respect they deserved. I found most interesting the German commandant as a character, though it wasnt well developed.While his actions are generally brutal there are glimpses that he may not be the total party man- he listens to the bbc, drinks heavily and listens to Jazz (ie racially suspect ) music. Indeed I thought the relationship between him an Bruce Willis could have been developed more. I guess the problem is that the character is both the dedicated (and unlikeable) Nazi and the honorable (likable) military enemy officer and as such any sort of relationship based on mutual respect may seem tainted to the viewer.For these reasons alone its worth a look. But ultimately it runs out of steam. The old patriotic/self sacrifice ending I'm sorry doesnt wash with me as a film making device. To work I've got to feel some empathy with the characters, and the characters seem too bland, indeed Bruce Willis character inspite of some interesting early ambiguities seems to end up yet another strong silent type. Not enough ummph in the story or performances to qualify as a great film and not enough in it to qualify as an action film - an interesting and worthy attempt though.",Null,1,2,3 June 2002
