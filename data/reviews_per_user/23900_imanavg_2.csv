Skyfall," Very weak storyline
","This is one of the weakest storyline. Why did the criminal go through all the trouble, create all the havoc, if all he wanted to do was to kill M? I mean couldn't he just enter USA and kill her?If all he the havoc he created was to enter USA then I really doubt his capabilities as a computer hacker, because what kind of a hacker would someone be, who can't modify his records?Overall, a very weak plot with no suspense and just random useless action with very big holes in the storyline. I don't understand why people like this movie. May be I am missing something but oh well, I gave it 1 because I couldn't go any lower.",1,30,54,23 November 2012
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Boring, No story only Non sense action
","If you want to watch a movie with no plot, a huge set of actors who all get to say one line each, one by one and just non sense action, then this movie is for you.I am a big fan of comic book movies. I love movies like Iron Man or Winter Soldier. I was looking forward to this movie for a long time. However, this movie just had no plot at all. I am glad I saw this for free, complete waste of time though. I really hope Marvell focus on building a plot and try to create a story.I also don't understand why they keep adding more characters. Now they have too many characters with too little focus. If this is the future of avengers, then I guess I need to stop watching these.",1,62,148,9 May 2015
