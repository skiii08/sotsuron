Requiem for a Dream," The greatest work of art...
","When I first saw the movie 'Requiem for a dream' I went crazy. The music (which is the greatest part of my life), the whole plot of that movie changed my view on the world. It's one of those movies that make you think afterwards. Its incredibly complex and absolutely brilliant. I have been involved into drugs and I've known people who were involved in it too. For God sakes, my best friend died of heroin-cocaine overdose. I don't blame him , but I can see why he did it. I believe that people don't take drugs because of a pure pressure, but because they choose too. No one can tell us what to do. People can only tell us their ideas and we can either accept it or not. Thats what the movie tells us. We choose the way we would like to live our lives and no one can tell us different. 4 people who had incredibly good intentions but end up being trapped in their addictions, fears, dreams, and most of all hopes for a better life. I wish people could watch this movie and understand that. To really, really think about it and get it to the greatest extend. I hope you got it as well.",Null,0,1,29 March 2002
