Black Swan," AN OBLIGATORY WATCH
","FLAWLESS. PERFECT. FASTIDOUS. IMMACULATE. METICULOUS.This right here, is a masterpiece. Starting from the idea and the introduction, all the way to the very end. Absolutely breathtaking. My favourite thriller movie to this day, of all time. Natalie Portman outdid herself in this one. She was brilliant, divine and on point. Really made for this role. This is a must watch. It was intoxicating, and with this movie, I fell in love and awe of Mr. Aronofsky. I have such piety for this film and its cast, and that almost never happens. Growing up with psychological thriller books, I always end up knowing what will happen at the middle of the movie, but this film had me guessing all the way, and it left me flabbergasted and speechless, which definitely never happens. I praise this movie for its plot, goal, idea, cast, director, exposition and resolution. It was utterly disturbing and unnerving. A true psychological thriller movie, worthy of being number 3 on the top 10 thrillers and psychological thrillers of all time. You have yourselves a keeper here. It dealt with such disputing, yet unassailable society issues which we need to be more aware of.",10,0,0,6 January 2019
Mother!," OFF THE HOOKS
","Hmmm... well, this was...interesting? It is definitely an experience. Mr. Aronofsky is most absolutely the most psychotic director of our time, period. If you are a true fan of his, this movie will probably be on your repertoire, and you will end up liking it, more or less anyway. However, the second half of the movie is downgrading. The first half, is immaculate, a fastidious build-up, and then it just started going downhill from there. It was half-baked, the point, or rather the metaphor didn't stick, didn't hold up. He had it going for him regarding the idea, the goal, but when it came down to plot development....yes, lackluster much? It was of course disappointing, because this movie had and has such potent and perfervid potential, and it was such a shame it didn't live up to its full potential. I also didn't get the movie at first, I don't like that in movies and their directors, where the director and its cast and crew are the only ones who can comprehend, interpret and fathom the true nature and aspiration of the film, but I have to hand it to him, he knew what he was getting into when he had decided to take up on such a contentious, controversial and debatable issue: religion; which we all know is a very touchy subject for all. Mr. Aronofsky went overboard with the latter half of the movie, I think it was because he got carried away with the messedupedness, and trying to overdo himself, that he lost it, his train of thought of what the innate, inherent goal of the movie was in the first place. Jennifer Lawrence was astonishing, particularly and especially in this one folks. I was amazed by her sinuous and avid performance. She gave me a mature, adult professionalism in this film, that now I feel high reverence for her. She did not come to play, and you can see that she took this role seriously and gave her best. To sum up, in my opinion, the movie was overall good, despite it addling and discombobulating me a lot of the times throughout its runtime. I would definitely recommend it to avid watchers, who are looking for something thrilling and different. But do not have high expectations, because then you will be disappointed due to the fact that they will, most probably, not be met.",8,0,0,6 January 2019
