The Sound of Music," Its a big and joyous experience as long as you're not a hard a$$
","I never liked this movie much as a kid during my first 2 viewings of it. Probably because I was made to watch it with my family and it took ages to come to an end. As I got older I really began to appreciate it. Surprisingly, because it reminds me of my family and watching movies with them in the living room during my childhood. Go figure.Can this film be somewhat sappy? Yes. So what? Buddy Holly love songs like 'Dearest' are sappy and they are brilliant. Is this film anywhere near the real story that actually took place? No. However, as a story for the screen, it holds its own separate life. People say the songs suck. I dig them all.I think I like this movie cause I love music. I also think this film hearkens back to a more innocent time. Or maybe thats being a slight bit nostalgic. Either way, I suppose i long for the kinda innocence displayed here while i live in this day and age. I like this movie a great deal despite its flaws and inaccuracies. Actually, I love it.",8,2,9,12 December 2013
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Star Wars, TLJ - Missing Power
","I think Luke Skywalker was undermined. Due to the sensitive nature and like qualities of Mark Hamill, I truly believe some of the decisions made about his character in this film undercut his strengths as an individual, an actor. The way the whole thing plays out almost makes a fool out of him and Skywalker. I think its a damn shame, too. The guy more than held his own in this film and i was impressed. In the first films he had this aloofness, a sense of being far away. And this suited him well. It also added depth, perhaps meaning to the films. His sensitivity would have been a powerful vehicle if his character was handled less sloppily here. The writing decisions here make him come off as weak, unsure, even a bit unstable. Its too big and bombastic for his natural way and what he can bring with that to the role of Luke. Also, comic relief is one thing but this was a bit too much and in an over the top sort of way. I enjoyed the silly animated porgs, is it? and Chewy having problems eating one of them in front of the others. I thought the force training sequence with Luke and Rey where he busts out the branch and messes with her was totally in line with how Lucas might have played out some humor in the originals. Genuinely funny. I actually thought the the Momma joke that the pilot makes at the beginning to the commander was funny. Unfortunately, i dont think it works as a whole and i would have sadly cut it out if it would have been up to me. It works but doesnt quite considering it utterly undermines any sense of dread of adversary and leads to a complete undoing of the enemies plight shortly afterwards. Ive seen a great deal of die hard fans reviews and i completely respect their disdain. I actually agree with most of the extremely low rating despite not usually doing so. I dont like to live in extremes, typically. Some things said in reviews here that i agree with actually are so full of negatives that it seems there were hardly any redeeming qualities found in some peoples view. I think some of the negatives pointed out are truly too harping of certain aspects of the film. In conclusion, this film would have been better suited with a more spirited sense of wonderment as opposed to slightly resembling a parody in many parts. Its just that most of the decisions made and characters are so wish-washy that the whole thing is rendered as not all that meaningful. Hell, some of the main characters im stretching to remember the name of at this point. Thats not good.",6,0,2,22 December 2017
Mission: Impossible," Nostalgia
","I've read reviews on here from die hard fans who knock this film. Some have even gone as far to rate it a 1? Are you kidding me? Its insanely difficult to make even an okay movie I think nostalgia is winning the day with the old fans of the show. The show was cool but let's face it..its not all that its now cracked up to be by the fans. It hasn't aged well at all and is hokey at times. the sequels to this film are a fun watch but ultimately crappy. Ill agree with that assessment. This film is superior to the sequels, however.I'm sorry, I disagree with the people that have a heightened sense of nostalgia regarding this material. I can understand. At least be fair, though. Also, Tom gets a bad rap from the older gen born in the 60s. I grew up as a child in the 80s to early 90s. From my perspective he is a fine actor.. always giving it his all. I of course watched him as an impressionable child so my perspective will be different. I'm sure people are justified in their not being fond of him and even I was initially hungry to judge him down a notch when he went all nutzo in front of the nation. His ego I can imagine is quite huge considering he's been so privileged for so long. Just the same.. we don't have to be friends with him do we? I think its cool that perspectives can be so different and its very telling. I say tom is worthwhile from where I've been sittin and I refuse to pass judgments on the man. This movie is great. Id rate it a 7.8 or 7.9 easily if I could. I don't know about an 8 so ill put down a strong 7 as my rating. Maybe ill change my mind.",7,0,0,18 July 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Oh, what could have been!?
","The Stuff this film does right almost works against it as a whole. It left me wondering what could have been. Where they could have taken the story. The film evokes the spirit of star wars fairly well and brings me back with nostalgia only to totally leave me hungry for fresh plot that is also deeper. I agree with the 'haters' I suppose. How can you literally rip off 80 percent of the plot of 'New Hope' and run away with the reviews this project seems to be getting? I guess the last three installments were hated a great deal, huh. Some say the newcomers were bad actors who weren't engaging. Are you serious? Have you performed a day in your life? Get out of town. Aboslutely nothing wrong with the actors. The script is whats surprising. Id say that I think the bad dude being Han Solos son is ridiculous. That relationship development in the first series worked beautifully. I don't like how it plays out here. Star Soap opera. Come on. I think Ford would have been better served had he changed and not remained exactly the same. He did become a King of sorts being with the princess and all. Another reviewer mentioned his hair and how it would have been better served shorter or buzzed. As ridiculous as the gripe may sound, id say i agree. lol.The bad guy wears a mask but why>? Why? lol. He bickers with the other head of command and it only underminds his prowess and how sinister he needs to be. He throws hissy fits. My 10 year old daughter laughed and was amused when she saw him throw one of his fits. She said 'So, he destroys part of the ship! What an idiot' She also mentioned the fact that in his second little hissy fit, two of the guards turn and walk the other way and poked fun at it. I think it was meant to lend some humor but it only further discredits any potential of the main bad guy to be truly menacing. The force is not respected. It took Skywalker the course of three films to be a master. At least he wasn't a master by the end of the first outing. Rey can do great mind tricks and out saber fight the bad guy (he is hurt but, still) with no training. SHe could basically do the things an old jedi master like Obi can do in the first series. The guys practically a spiritual seeker and monk and she comes along and can do what he can do just like that!? Im sorry. Thats crap. I give this film a 6 because i would be lying if i said i didn't enjoy watching and feeling the spirit of Star Wars that it conjures up. The problem is that it does this so well that it leaves me truly wishing they would have gone to greater lengths to respect the world involved. And, by all means, come up with a better plot. Copy and Paste much?",5,7,11,19 April 2016
Heat," Heat stands out / Nay-sayers are pretentious laymen
","I am reading all the people here who have rated this movie a 1 and the sheer audacity of their two sense is simply ludicrous. Laymen have an opinion that is obviously valid to them but it carries no weight and is hardly notable.People are attacking this movie and finding a great deal of faults. You would think this movie was on the level of 'gigli' or something awful of that nature. If this movie is a 1 rating, then what in Gods name is 'gigli'...minus 5!? Some people talk of Pacino as if he knows nothing of what he is doing. Yeah, sure, lets reduce him to the level of Britney Spears entering into the world of acting. One reviewer went as far as to say a dog could have been cast in his part considering how he barks out his lines. What? I say to this person..there is absolutely nothing wrong with an actor being ON his voice. Nothing wrong. Others have said he is overrated and he overacts? I say to them..have you ever performed on a world wide stage a day in your life? NO, I didn't think so! People throw around 'Over-acting' or 'over-the-top' way too much.Over-acting is underlining the obvious. Over-acting is showing something in ignorance that is not there. Overacting is a trap something novice wanna be actors in acting classes throughout America fall into when they are nervous and have no idea what they are doing. Every negative jerk who is simply just tired of watching Pacino accuses him of being over the top. But, hes not playing the anti-hero here. He s not playing the introvert. Hes playing a type A personality cop. A very out going hardened cop who has a bit of a shell hes built up around him. Hes a serious minded cop who is on his voice and uses it to his advantage to get things done. Unfortunately, it bleeds over into his personal life even though it seems as if he doesn't truly desire this, ultimatelyCome on people. If you are tired of watching him, don't watch! But don't come on here and try to sound all smart and studious about the performing arts when you clearly have no effing clue what you are talking about! And, by god, don't attack a man who is serious and seriously good at his craft. Its his life-time work. How about I come as a laymen and attack you on your job when I have no clue what it means to perform a day in your shoes in that profession. Pacino overacting!? Get outta town. That's plain stupid. The man has proved he is among the better film actors we have had. Period.Heat is a very interesting movie. It has action as well as actors who make the story come to life with a touch of reality and truth. I think what is exceptionally interesting is that Pacino is the 'good' guy but he doesn't have his life together and he is NOT much of family man. De Niro is a 'bad' guy and he seems to be more pure at heart and has simplified his life with a nice lady. He has a much healthier outlook and perspective. I think those opposites alone make this movie head and shoulders above much other drivel for action movies.People rate movies a 1, I think, because they feel the movie is overrated and they take it upon themselves to balance it out. What pretense they must have to take it upon themselves (laymen) to play god and balance things. I really feel that these people completely skew the true rating of all the movies on here. A 1 rating for a movie should be relegated to something truly despicable and novice. Like, say, a student film that was slapped together at the last minute by someone lazy just to get a grade.If you want to get away from your day and you don't have your head truly stuck up your a$$..I think you will enjoy this film.",8,1,4,28 April 2014
