National Treasure: Book of Secrets," The first half was boring. The second half was almost as good as the first film!
","All together it was pretty good. Not as good as the first though.In this new adventure, Benjamin's great great grandfathers name is on the list of conspirators responsible for the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Benjamin wants to clear his name, but finds the only way to do that is to look for the real answers in a book. The presidents book of secrets, for presidents eyes only. So his plan, kidnap the president.This film has good acting, a good plot, and of course, some pretty good action.Some of the action worthy of being in a Bourne film, etc.And what I love about the national treasure films, is they have good humor, yet still keep it serious.All though, of all that. The pacing was terrible! I thought the pacing of the first could not have been better. But in this the first hour(i timed it) literally has you thinking to yourself, what the heck is the point of this film. All though after about an hour, when the film picks up and gets good, it stays good.The other down point, is some parts of the film, seem, just unrealistic. I didn't feel that in the first.It had a great ending though. Just one thing i would have changed in the end.Even though their are down points, its still a good, and if you liked the first film, the second half of this film is almost as good as the first film, not quite as good though. my point is though, if you liked national treasure, GO SEE IT!Hope that helps!",7,2,5,6 January 2008
The Mist," Where do i start?...?...?
","I expected a supernatural thriller, and it turned out to be a monster movie. Which I don't mind, just not what i had expected. Starts off good then goes downhill. A man and his son go to a supermarket after a freak storm to pick up some things, and a mist starts to rise. Then a few people see the mist take someone someone into the sky in the loading dock. We find out that the government had made a window to another dimension, but that window turned out to be a door, and now all of the deadly creatures from that dimension are wreaking havoc on our little dimension, or so it seems. The plot seemed solid, the acting was very convincing, and the place the movie was set in gave it a very claustrophobic feeling. Then without giving too much away i will tell you that the last 30 minutes of the film ruined the first hour and a half. So if you want to see it skip the last 30 minutes. Hope this helps Kris",3,0,2,16 April 2008
Happy Feet," Inappropriate!!!!!!
","This is to inappropriate for kids!!! We started this with our 5 year old and i really wanted her to see it. I turned it off after the first scene! It starts out with a song of a woman penguin saying she doesn't need a man to be rich or cool just to rock her world, and a man to make eggs with her. She then meets a guy, they kiss and it says song turned to love, love turned to an egg. It also got to scary for my 5 year old with stuff about aliens, etc. She left the room crying!!!!! I mean i don't know about you but i know i don't want to get a kids movie for a little kid and have her getting sexual education!! She mise well see farce of the penguins!!!!!! I don't recommend this for any child unless you do not care about them hearing about sex! I am very disappointed. :( Kris",2,1,3,28 March 2007
