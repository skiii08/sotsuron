United 93," Don't Miss This Recent Piece of History....
","Don't Miss United 93..an excellent depiction of possibly the worse day in American History.. a documentary which brings to life the confusion, the shock, the horror of 9/11/01.. Our country was under attack... our defenses were totally down Our President was in a grade school and refused to leave at once(when informed)..Those precious moments with decisions only he could have made caused thousands of lives..And where was Dick Cheney?? more precious minutes wasted..Our security failed us so did our Presidency and his administration..& those brave individuals abroad United 93 fought tooth & nail to save another major destruction on that horrible day from occurring and saved hundreds of lives !Dont Miss Not easy to take People were squirming, crying and visibly upset. in theatre today.Yes blame the terrorist they had and still have a mission to destroy us but blame must also go to our administration at the time which ignored warnings all summer long July/August 2001... we had no security that day.This should be GW's legacy... how he let this nation down that horrible day 9/11 for which he was forewarned.. A Riviting film.. Excellent direction Do Not Miss!!",9,4,8,30 April 2006

The Other Boleyn Girl," Outstanding New Historiacal film ..Go see
","I was truly impressed today by the film, 'The Other Boleyn Girl' for me its getting the new film year off to a very good start!! Weve known about Ann Boleyn and her beheading but this film gives new insight into reasons why ,and the amazing relationship between Ann and her sister Mary.. The plot line never gets dull and moves at a great pace..(usually historical films can be stodgy and boring) This one never lets up..The performances are wonderful , especially,Natalie Portman as Ann and Scarlett Johnansen as Mary... the entire supporting cast is outstanding..The sets and costumes are very authentic.,and the cinematography is beautiful Im not sure how historically accurate this film is ,but as a movie its well worth seeing Don't miss 'The Other Boleyn Girl'",9,43,83,1 March 2008
Brokeback Mountain," A Landmark film, Bravo, Ang Lee!!
","At last a real true to life love story about 2 gay men Macho Cowboys not swishy queens their love, their passion their real feelings for each other. their heartbreaks their problems etc It happens and will continue to happen in America and worldwide whether in Wyoming, Texas, California or New Jersey ,Paris France or Antartica Bravo Ang Lee & cast you've created a modern masterpiece!!! The settings are beautifully photographed and the performances are outstanding.The audience today was mesmerized no one made nasty remarks/ no one walked out and many were teary eyed leaving this theater! Gay lifestyle has never been better presented on the screen..Every detail of this film is perfection,... a bit slow paced but we've come to expect that from Ang Lee it adds to the mood of the film.. since The Ice Storm go see !

Jerry Maguire," I Disliked Jerry McGuire Immensely!!!
",One of the most over rated over Awarded movies of all time. I didn't walk out because I was with others who were moderately enjoying..No One Loved It..Maybe Cuba Gooding got noticed but didn't deserve that Oscar that Year.& Tom Cruise is one of the most over rated/ over paid film stars ever..OK Passable in Rainman & Born On The 4th Of July but all that other garbage. he's made since including this & Eyes Wide Shut & I cant tell you how much I disliked the War Of The Worlds *(2005 Yuk).. and it bothers me that much better and more attractive actors are struggling in Hollywood & Broadway too.... * please buy or rent the 1953 original with the far superior Gene Barry....and superior production as well,1,3,15,25 March 2006
Gangs of New York," Scorcese's best work since Raging Bull !!!
","Scorcese's best work since Raging Bull!!... & that includes many outstanding movies...possibly the movie of the year!!  was mesmerized!!what a production!!...what performances...Daniel Day Lewis is outstanding!! he's frightening!  he's despiccable!  but you cant get your eyes off him... what a bit of cinematic magic!  he should win every acting honor this year...an amazing performance....Leonardo Di Caprio is excellent also as is Carmen Diaz!! Violent! ugly! powerful!pulsating! rowdy!! a film which artfully depicts a very dark period in our history and in the creation of our greatest city, the big apple, NYC...a bit long... some difficulty with the broughs...but dont miss this film.. and don't minimize its importance, and its brillance... please seeThe Gang Of New York City...you will not be disappointed! Scorcese has entered the ranks of one of our all time great directors!! not only of this generation but the past as well...a directorial effort of DW Griffith proportions!!!",9,0,0,23 December 2002
