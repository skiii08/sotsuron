Blade Runner 2049," Some great ideas...dragged out for far too long.
","And there is an even longer cut? Yeesh. I get it. It needed to be atmospheric. But so much of it was like an endlessly looping Enya video. Long, slow tracking shots of thin people in European apocalyptic fashion walking through sandstorms and fog and rubble. The first and last three minutes of EVERY scene could have cut, and we still would have hsad plenty of this cinematography and mood.The science-y part. Good. The acting. Good. The props. The sets. The music. Good. Good. Good. What sporadic action there was. Good. The weird lab coat that Coco was wearing, Excellent. The dubious identity of the Replicant baby. And some memorable dialogue. Check. That horrible Luv getting hers in the end. Awesome. Editing. Non-existent.There is a good movie in here somewhere. I am sure some 14 yo with Premier and time after school will make a brilliant supercut of it.",6,1,3,28 December 2017
Hereditary," Two separate movies jammed together.
","The first half of the film is a haunting study in ever-mounting abject grief. It is sparse, yet lyrical. It is a spiral of mystery and pathos. Even the decapitation scene is both deplorably disturbing and artistically beautiful. Then the film can't decide whether it is a Rosemary's Baby, The Ninth Gate or a Wicker Man ripoff; so it just becomes an overly-muddled mess. Once Toni Collette meets the woman the filmmakers clearly cast because they couldn't get Character Actress Margo Martindale, everything goes by a very laughable book. Literally. Plot points might as well be telegraphed with giant neon arrows. All the subtle ambiguity and mystique from the brilliant first act and a half are laid bare and shoved in our face. Again, literally. The odd grinning man at the wake seemed sinister then. But his reappearance later in the movie (sans his funereal attire) elicits chuckles rather than the shock which was the obvious design for every one of the plot's four or five desperate climaxes. Each one a bit more unintentionally goofier than the previous. While the overall premise is fantastic, the bizarre shift in tone and misdirected execution of the second half just didn't work as well as, or with, the first 45 minutes. The huge diorama metaphor from early on is forgotten, only to be shoehorned back in at the last second for the final scene - which is more silly than it is disquieting, unnerving or scary. It was good until it wasn't.",5,4,9,31 August 2018
"I, Tonya"," Margot Robbie playing Emma Stone playing Tonya Harding.
","An absolute trailer park, trailer trash, trash fire movie of unredeemable people in ridiculous situations. And it couldn't be any more perfect unless John Waters himself schlocked its brains out. Margot Robbie deserves three Oscars for losing herself so deep in a wonderfully despicable role. As usual, Allison Janney is at her amazing best, proving herself the Meryl Streep of brassy low-rent broads. Sebastian Stan is uncharacteristically unattractive and downright sleazeball, This movie is an emotional romp. You'll laugh like your neighbor's meth lab is leaking; you'll experience terror like a new foster kid. You'll cry like it's the shotgun mass wedding of all of your first cousins. And you'll lose control of your bodily functions like that time Lynyrd Skynyrd's tour bus broke down in front of the Route 73 shooting range - the one with the Dukes of Hazard General Lee replica, not the one with the rats that tested for plague.Sonja Henie's mother gives it a 5.9 from the grave. Nancy Kerrigan and the fishermen of Massachusetts are not amused. Style points for denim jackets.",8,1,4,27 December 2017
Baby Driver," Starts off plenty strong; peters out in the third act.
","I liked about 76% of this movie - until right after the awesome cameo by the incomparable Swan himself. The film gets to that point at breakneck speed. Then it just sputters through moments like Wright didn't know how to finish things through at the same pace.Oh, and Jamie Foxx is intolerable beyond imagination. I know he was meant to be villainous. But it went from being apt characterization to cinematic teeth-grinding smugness without a trace of even devilish nuance. There is absolutely nothing redeeming about the portrayal; it is straight-up grating, one-dimensional and detrimental in every applicable scene.",7,9,19,15 July 2017
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino's attempt at an Altman or Coen Brothers movie.
","But it inevitably comes across as a series of cute ideas that eventually trivializes and exploits its subjects.Altamont and the Manson murders signaled the demise of the peace and free love movement that in 1969 traded daisy chains for butcher knives. The year was not the end of some golden era of cinema; it was the tipping point for culture as a whole. The Age of Aquarius was about to drown its folksy innocence in its own blood. In the following year, television would begin to purge itself of homespun shows and move to the edgier, darker and more urban. So yes, this film gets a small bit of its impetus right.I thoroughly enjoyed the scenes involving Rick Dalton's new villainous image. The young actress he co-stars with is a delight. But beyond that, so much of the film seemed like vignettes for the sake of what-if. 'Oh, Bruce Lee was alive back then. Let's throw in a bit with him.' Okay, now show me why. Oh, they broke that Australian lady's car. Um, right. The scene with Pitt going to Spahn Ranch was to state they got Lena Dunham, Dakota Fanning and Bruce Dern in cameos? Got it. Because it didn't affect the plot.For a Tarantino film, there were less and less truly iconic scenes than ever, and practically no quotable lines. This movie will be known for what? Flame throwers, Robbie's dirty feet and a tenacious pit bull? Ho hum.The performances are basically fine - mostly actors playing types not characters. Even the impersonations of actual players seem cursory and perfunctory. Robbie's Tate is just Robbie playing an actress. Tate had a glance, an aura, a way. Robbie doesn't capture any of that for me. Tarantino has specifically stated that the character was more of a symbol anyway. Oh boy, let's get to that now.The alternate reality ending was a concept that surely sounded good on paper to Tarantino. Yeah, who doesn't fantasize about going back and rewriting history, whether to save a million people, or a beautiful neighbor and her friends? The premise worked slightly better in Inglorious B*st*rds. Why? Because the intent was there: to stop the textbook definition of a genocidal maniac. Rick and Cliff bumbling into Tex and the Girls then having a farcical fight to the death doesn't save Sharon and restore some supposedly dwindling Hollywood period. It uses the memory then cheapens it, and eventually obliterates it. In so many sad ways, Sharon was the ultimate sacrifice of beauty and modesty. She had a fate that immortalized her. In this film, she is now the actress lady who lived next door to a couple of has-beens who beat up a bunch of equally goofy dirtbags who might have wanted to randomly harm her but probably would have messed it up because Tarantino has intentionally portrayed them as totally and comically inept. This would work in a Coen caper with randoms but Tarantino had to shoe-horn the Tate aspect in.The soundtrack is a joy. It plays over a lot of driving tours of historic LA - so if you like that sort of thing, there is nostalgic use of music. But otherwise, this movie was lacking that cohesive thread that held something like The Player or Nashville together. It's an ending with some stuff leading up to it.",5,8,16,29 July 2019
Parasite," Were the blueprints to the house never filed with the local planning commission?
","See, while the film is moderately entertaining, it is flawed. It certainly isn't a masterpiece in any regard.The massive issue is that there is not a single sympathetic character in the entire film. Because the Kims are poor, we are supposed to forgive their unethical and often malicious ploy? The Parks are just vapid stereotypes of the wealthy. The driver is underdeveloped. The housekeeper we feel bad for at first. But she and her husband quickly become as detestable as everyone else.So the Kims only means to finally making something of themselves is through dishonest work. All the energy and ambition they put into their scheme, they could have used to start something legitimate like their fake referral service. But their deception was always depicted as a means to a fatalistic end. Are the Park children any better for the tutelage they are receiving? No. Is the house any cleaner? The chauffeuring all that life-transforming? Naw. Perhaps if the Kims' presence in the Park household had had any positive aspect to the interaction between to the two families, the movie would have invoke some pathos at the same climax.And the 'wealth rock' symbolism. Got it. If they were so smart, they would realize simple living within your means is the key to contentment. So, yay, never hold your metaphor - as the writing rule goes.And the climactic punishment is not nearly sufficient. For the Kims, it's one dead, two on probation and one 'scot-free' after racking up a host of crimes including one triple homicide - only a third of which was of a different socioeconomic class. That is some good karma for railing against the rich and being utterly deplorable schemers but mostly killing their own kind. Yeah, yeah, the dad gets trapped under the house. How was this proper retribution? He was never the mastermind; his rotten kids were. And mainly, it was the son, who is the agent of everything. Without his friend, without him receiving the stone, without his foot in the Parks' door, there is no movie. The daughter gets what she deserved. But he gets 'lesson learned (maybe)'. And Mrs Kim is just along for the ride? A big fat no to that.I also found it hard to believe that the source of those flickering stairwell lights would not have been investigated by the fastidiously rich residents with their impeccably stocked wine fridge - especially with Neurotic Helicopter Mom no. 1 always home.I already was well-aware of the rich-stay-rich-and-poor-stay-poor cycle that was supposed to be the revelatory theme of this movie so it was not nearly as impactful. And with the characterization and outcome flaws, the film was okay but not nearly as evocative as it could have been. I really wanted to see some arc movement to any of the characters, even if ever so slight before the same ending. But they all start out and stay one dimensional. And it takes a bloodbath at a child's birthday party to get a couple of them to say, 'aw shucks, maybe this wasn't a great plan'. And then the final point of the movie, per the director himself, is to just accept your impoverished state because even years of honest work will not get your murderous father literally out from under the rich that you caused to begin with by seeking to be like them. 'The whole notion of 'why bother' makes no sense or point thematically in art.",6,5,6,12 April 2020
