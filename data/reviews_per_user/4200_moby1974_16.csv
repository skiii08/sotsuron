Iron Man 3," Fun yes, but not what it should have been.
","Hmmmm, not over happy with it. CGI is good but looks more like a film from a few year ago. Story is so so, its kind of meh! and the twists were OK apart from main one, that one made me laugh for a second or two the think WTF have they done. Acting is good, its more of what we have seen really. Humor is hit and miss, some very funny bits and some that miss the spot. 3D, its OK, nothing that makes you grip the seat. The main issue I have with it is that I don't think they sat down and watched past Iron Man stuff, because in this film the suits seem to be made of tin lol when you watch it you will see what I mean, the guy went toe to toe with Thor and yet....oh wait and see. There are lots of silly errors, most films have them but they spoil it when they standout so much (big cuts that the paramedics seem happy to leave untreated, and nor does the character seem to care) might seem silly to point them out but on such a big film there should be nothing that pulls you out of the film and make you think eg 'why does she' As it is the film is good but it is easy to score it lower than the first 2, although 2 was not a patch on the 1st one either. Worth seeing but but I hope they get another director/better story next time. 7/10",5,1,6,27 April 2013
John Wick," Great action, no holds, no PG13
","Others can go in-depth if they feel the need, but as it is the movie ticks all the right boxes for this sort of film.Yes story if comic book/80s style, and its executed in full force, no silly fast cuts or shadows hiding action, you get a fast moving visceral action film, no brains needed.The cast is great, many stereotypes but all played well, also nice to see Keanu is still able to pull off some old moves and a few new ones, got to say the gun fights and fist fights are some of the best I have seen since The Raid.If you want a real gritty/over the top/assassin/revenge/high body count/R rated/well shot and paced film....well this is it, give it a go.Oh and this is maybe the best acting from keanu reeves I have seen, odd I know but there are more sombre moments and he nails it.",9,8,20,17 January 2015
Lone Survivor," Great film, a must see.
","Not a long drawn out thing, I will leave that to others to go over every detail. The story moves at a great pace and yet spends enough time with the men to draw you and make you really feel for them. The acting is good, very good in parts, and for the most part feels as though the actors are really going through what those poor guys did (portraying that it) The gun fights are very good, again you get the feeling of been there with them and having the fear of danger. Stunt work is a standout point, some by actors (more than normal) but those brave stunt people really earned their paychecks. The location for filming is spot on, there is very little green screen, and again it helps you feel like you are there. My only dis of the film is the last 30mins, it starts to slip from a real feel to a normal action film, but its not enough to hurt the score of this film.",8,10,26,1 January 2014
Star Trek," Looks good, but thats about it, shame really.
","Well just seen it and thats kind of a sign right there, I waited for few days so it did not send out message of must see and NOW, and well I think now that I have seen it I think my sixth sense must have been working as for me its a 6 out of 10, just too many things that made me try and defend it for been different but really it left me thinking 'oh don't do that please don't do......oh crap they did' THE GOOD It looks nice and starts well, lots of big bangs and all moving along at speed. CGI is top notch. Script is not bad in parts.THE BAD Weak story, not another time travel thing No!and the bad guy.....is not all that bad really,how many stories were turned down for this one to win? loll Actors in this are hit and miss, they all try their best and I think thats the problem its just people trying and not acting, none of them hold the screen well and the added humour just goes OTT in places, yes there was some in the like of Trek 4 but this new film really lays it on thick in parts.I did hope it would be good, the trailer looked good and I did think back then that it be nice to get few more films, but after seeing it I feel its just a 'hey whats the new Trek film like?'....'It looks good'.....'Cool, but what else?'.....'It looks good' And thats all I got from it, nice way to kill time (no pun)few bangs and bit of action and few laughs but its all forgotten once I left the cinema, and sorry to say what I did remember was 2 trailers that look much better than Trek Transformers 2 and T4.",5,3,8,13 May 2009
Alexander," Close to brilliant but still missing some action
","Hmmm yet another good but could of been better film.GOOD story, acting, action large vision gritty bloody, one of the best soundtracks ever!!!!BAD lack of one more fight, don't tell us what he did show us.some casting main thing is if you can not do the voice to match where you are from just don't try it makes it sooooooooo badDone right this would of killed Troy off but its lack of some nice action and more on talk does not help and at 160 mins you need a break now and then and one more good fight would of been great, as it is you get one real big fight and a small one, the story is shown well enough and its maybe cost that stopped them from doing more huge fights? i have since seen this film a few more times and it really grows on you more and more, its a shame USA have not taken to it but i put that down to it been gritty and not all gloss like Troy, you need a few more braincells to enjoy this film lol, all i can say is well see it and you decide but for me 8 out of 10, one more fight would of made it a 9 even a 10?",8,0,9,18 January 2005
Constantine," Great film go see it
","Just seen the film and its good, not the be all and end all or award winner but much better than many other films made theses days, if you read the comic you will rip the film apart but changes need to be made for big screen films(Xmen-dress up changed/The crow-skull cowboy taken out/Blade-dress up changed)be it the look or something they feel is to deep or people will not get, all comic book films will never please everyone and even more so if you read them week in week out, if you have not picked up Hellblazer yet then by all means do but it might be best you see film first so you don't sit there saying 'that ain't right, hey he should be' and so on, the acting is fine and yes Mr Matrix himself is as he always is but he fits these kind of films and seeing as he is bankable they will use him for films such as this and Matrix kind for years. Just sit down tune in leave the comic at the front door and enjoy.",8,7,25,17 February 2005
Ocean's Twelve," What a shame so so bad
","What the hell happened?? how can so many good actors and director turn out such total crap?....... answer=the story, i am lost as to how this was there choice for a story after such a great 1st film and with these actors playing the parts, did no one at any point read through script and just say 'hang on guys, slight problem here' 'Whats up?' 'Well.....its crap' thats all it would have taken, the start is fine they have to pay money back but after 30 mins you start to feel that this is as good as its going to get no build up and no ending worthy of these guys.SUCH A SHAME",1,2,4,24 December 2004
Pacific Rim," Some ups and downs but a MUST see
","Too many long winded reviews, and too many trolls, so to put it in a simple way. Acting 6.5/10 Story 7/10 Script 6.5/10 Action 9/10 CGI 9.5/10 Sets 9/10 Entertainment 8/10. If it helps the Mrs was really not wanting to see this (she did not like Man Of Steel) but when we left Pacific Rim she said she enjoyed it and would tell friends to see it. It is a big screen film, the bigger the screen the better, and the 3D seemed good on the whole. Its not perfect but a MUST see movie, doing well with fans and even those been dragged along to see it like my wife. Will win no acting Oscars but it does what it needs to, and that's entertain on a massive scale.:-)",8,3,9,15 July 2013
The Thing," Sheer class
","To much to say, be here all day if i was really wanting to put all its good points down, story/action/horror/fx all great and the acting is top class to, another fine point is the music....................its so bloody good/spooky/chilling, one of the best i have heard and fits the film so well. I can not say enough about this film its a pure must see and puts many of todays films to shame, do yourself a favour go out and buy it now..................go on, go i said, stop reading this and go buy it, no go buy 2 copies of this film one for you and one for a friend as they will love you for it lol or hate you as they can not sleep well anymore....................still here i see look go buy it OK!Sheer class a must see film, watch it alone in the dark with TV up full",10,0,1,17 January 2005
U-571," Why Will Amercans Keep Trying To Change History
","Have i seen the film ....no, i will not watch something so made up when it does not honour the real guys who died carrying out this mission, come on how does the English dropping the 2 atomic bombs on Japan thus ending Japans involvement in WW2 sound for a film......no!, see what i mean, yes by all means make war films but do it right or if you care not for those that died so we might live keep making films such as this, take a leaf out of our history in films......not one WW2 film made by Uk has any changes in who took part and who died in the name of freedom.SAY WHAT YOU WILL ITS FACT LOOK IT UP FOR THOSE WHO CAN READp.s line above is only for those fools who will just write back saying blah blah brits this brits that, have no miss givings with people who know what i mean, we all did great things ENGLAND AND USA just show them as it happened.",1,9,16,24 December 2004
Castle in the Sky," One of the best films made ever its that simple
","I first saw this back in the early 90s on UK TV, i did like it then but i missed the chance to tape it, many years passed but the film always stuck with me and i lost hope of seeing it TV again, the main thing that stuck with me was the end, the hole castle part really touched me, its easy to watch, has a great story, great music, the list goes on and on, its OK me saying how good it is but everyone will take there own best bits away with them once they have seen it, yes the animation is top notch and beautiful to watch, it does show its age in a very few parts but that has now become part of it beauty, i am so glad it has came out on DVD as it is one of my top 10 films of all time. Buy it or rent it just see it, best viewing is at night alone with drink and food in reach so you don't have to stop the film.Enjoy",10,44,59,7 February 2005
Man on Fire," Geat Style/Great Film
","Another scott hit, fan of both the scotts and there is some style that Tony has taken from his brother and its no bad thing, Tony has always been the action brother with more main stream movies yet this film takes on added visual style to show what Ridley can do he can do, if only other people out there took a leaf out these guys books we would have many more great films such as this, and as for Denzel Washington well not a huge fan but i think thats down to the films he has been in rather than his acting(love THE FALLEN though)but in Man On Fire he is 1st rate and i can not think of anyone else who could of pulled the part off so well, loved his coldness as he dished out the needed vengeance.SEE THIS FILM",9,4,6,24 December 2004
Jaws," Keep out the water
","True, still find the art of horror is lost theses days, yes they shock you make you jump or they have gore and more gore but they soon die from your mind once you walk out movie, a good horror stays with you, plays on your fears and make you doubt even your empty house at night lol.Jaws/now its not known as horror as such but it scared everyone that seen it, people would just not go swimming, i don't just mean in the sea either i saw people scared to go in swimming pools how mad is that that people would think a bloody shark would be in there lol but thats what it did to many people.Time has passed and the film still holds up today and i think its in the top 3 best films made by SB, even films made today(Deep blue sea)don't hold a candle to Jaws its just a shame he did not have more money to make it back then as if he could do that to us with a small budget what would he have done with a big one but maybe that adds to the feel and look of the film. If you ain't seen it then shame on you...........go buy it!!!!",10,2,4,1 March 2005
The Dark Knight Rises," How would you rate TDK vs TDKR if Heath had lived
","Seen it and have my own views on the film but more keen to see why so many rate TDK over this one. For me TDK has one small issue and then very big issue. The small one was the actress change....not a good choice. The big issue was TwoFace, the film was great up to when I saw the FX for his face, it was way OTT, it should have been more in keeping with the real would (bad burns) Anyway the main thought is how would TDK rate if Heath had not died, I mean it pulled more press news and sad to say the awards given to him would have been fewer (Would have won some just not as many) I feel he did an amazing job but because he died you would never be able to top it because of people having extra feelings about the film that otherwise would not be there had he lived. I love The Crow, I went to see it 12 times and as much as I like it I know it would have not made the money or had the impact it did if Brandon had lived (film grabbed me because it was close to his life, due to marry in film and due to marry in real life at time of his death) its a sorry truth but a real death of a star helps sell the movie (also in music i.e. Whitney Houston) So if you could somehow overlook the sad passing of Heath and rate TDK against TDKR would you still put it above? for me TDKR although not perfect is a more solid film with less gripes about it.",9,2,11,19 July 2012
Cloud Atlas," Love it hate it.....I loved it
","OK its not perfect (few are) but its a great film. I am not going to write page after page as others have, I will just say it looks great, nice cast, story grips you for the most part of the film (the future future part is maybe a little weaker) oh and its a long film, but never really feels like a drag. It has laughs and action, i am also shocked that its just a 15 for UK, I would have said its more like a 18 due to some stuff in it. It will split everyone, you will either come out not understanding it or able to follow it, its not for everyone, but at the same time you might come out of it hugging your partner and wanting to change the way you live lol Be your own judge and go see it. 9/10",10,1,3,7 January 2013
V for Vendetta," Bold/Stunning
","Just back from seeing it and have to say wow! this was a film i thought 'hey trailer looks cool' and then when i started to watch it the thought of 'oh lots of Brit actors hmmmm!' kind of put me at a point of unease.......why? Well i am a Brit and its strange to see TV actors in big screen films that us Brits know so well running round on a flashy USA film, most of them i myself find hard to really go for because i see actors who do TV soaps 24/7 then once in a blue moon they turn up in a big film and its a case of 'hey look its him from......' well that was then but V is now and i can not think of a film in the last 10 years that has been mostly UK actors let loose on a big film and pulled of credible acting to match anything overseas, the film its self is a brave/bold/stunning/thoughtful/clever film, it has no real bad points to say of which is rare theses days though i do think its a love it hate it film, it does not conform to most films and goes about been the film that it is while sticking 2 fingers up at other films who toned down there adaptation of comics in the past. I can go on all night about what makes this film work and others before it fail but your the best person to judge that so all i can say is go see it and treat yourself to one of the best films of its kind ever.",9,3,7,18 March 2006
