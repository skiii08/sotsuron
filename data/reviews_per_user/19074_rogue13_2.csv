Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Better than I expected after reading early reviews
","After hearing/reading several press reviews of the film.  I significantly lowered my expectations.  Driving home at 2:35, I replayed the movie in my head.I believe Phantom Menace has all the basic components of A New Hope plus improved graphics.  There are a couple places were the actors are a little 'plastic' but otherwise the acting seems pretty solid to me.I was warned that the story was lacking.  In my opinion, it has all the requirements for 'Chapter 1' of any saga - character introduction, revelation of hidden agenda & alliances, glossary-like explanations of various unknown elements and a gratuitous car-chase scene (the pod race).Overall, I was very pleased.",8,1,1,19 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Possibly my most favorite ...
","I'm not sure which episode I like the most before seeing 'Attack of the Clones' - probably 'A New Hope' just because it was the most life-changing.On my first viewing, I disliked several bits of dialog.  Following my third time through, there is not much I would change in the film.  I don't like the dialog/scene with Shmi -- she deserved some better lines (or just forego them altogether and use visuals).Each time I re-watched Hayden Christensen, I became more convinced that Lucas chose wisely when making him the new Anakin.  His youthfulness lends innocence when it's needed -- and he has the eyes of Vader when the evil begins to show!Ewan McGregor's acting is flawless.  He isn't always given the best lines but he delivers them superbly.  Christopher Lee is the same -- his Saruman (LotR) is great and his performance here is just as well done.Yoda rocks.  I'm still not sure I like the CGI over the muppet but I do like the fact that Yoda is no longer confined to sitting down all the time.Samuel L. Jackson gets some nice lines and handles them well (of course). I want a purple lightsabre!First time through, JarJar was annoying.  He gets less noticeable with each repeat (thankfully).Boba Fett's segment was rather large - I'm not sure if this is simple fan-appeasement or if Lucas is planning to mold the storyline a certain way and is doing the prep-work to get things ready ...Natalie Portman is a goddess.  On first viewing, a couple of her lines seemed forced.  With repeated viewings, everything looked fine (and I do mean everything).The good lines are back.  C3P0 and R2 are back to being the main comedy-duo and they, as always, do their jobs well.I'm not quite sure how my four-year-old will handle a couple of the scenes (this one's a little darker than the others) but I'll own this DVD the day it comes out.Excellent movie!  Go see it.  Take your girlfriend/wife -- I think there's enough love-story there to keep them happy.",8,0,0,16 May 2002
