Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Miramax & QT are vindicated
","Having seen comments on vol 1, accusing Miramax and Tarantino of blatant profiteering by releasing KB in two parts, it's great to see vol 2 answering those critics with aplomb.  Vol 2 is such a different film from its predecessor, and for that reason works wonderfully.  As one film, such contrast would have been impossible!  Okay, I was a little skeptical about the decision myself, but am I glad it became two movies!KBV2 is a treat.  Vol 1 seemed to lack plot.  Vol 2 brims with it.  Okay, the dialog still doesn't burn like vintage-QT (I felt the Superman thing, although entertaining, was shoe-horned in and seemed incongruous with Bill), but you sense he's trying his hand at something else entirely. Uma's performance is fantastic, David Carradine's, even better. The supporting players aren't half bad, either. In particular, Gordon Liu as Pai Mei, the vindictive Kung Fu master, is hilarious - never has insane laughter coupled with vigorous beard-stroking been done so stylishly on the cinema screen!
As for the denouement, I loved it.  A noble and delightful end to a fantastic, stylish, and exhilarating ride.  Go and see it, even if vol.1 didn't float your boat - it may just make you reevaluate the whole thing.
And now a line from vol 1: 'It was not my intention to do this in front of you. For that I'm sorry. But you can take my word for it, your mother had it comin'. When you grow up, if you still feel raw about it, I'll be waiting.'There's the sequel, right there.  Can't wait...",10,1,2,28 April 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Stylish. Loved It. But...
","Kill Bill vol.1 is a truly exhilarating experience.  Very stylish and exciting stuff.  However, I did really struggle with some of it's elements relating to children.  As a parent, I was extremely uncomfortable with QT's treatment of some of the scenes.  Okay, I may come across as a tedious liberal parent here - but I was a little squeamish over Vernita Green's daughter witnessing her mother's last breaths (but what a way to set up God knows how many possible sequels - another Roaring Rampage of Revenge - Orphaned Daughter vs. Mother & Daughter (vol 2, anyone?) - hell yeah!).  I was very disturbed by the anime section, illustrating the Genesis of O-Ren Ishii (I suppose it's what makes her who she is).  All told, I accept that these scenes are there for a reason - but it still doesn't change my gut reaction to them.However, with all the seat-squirming, I still adored this film.  QT doesn't go for his usual dialog-riffing approach, but the action? Well, this goes up to 11!",9,0,2,28 April 2004
