United 93," Not enough emphasis on the bravery of the passengers
","I definitely thought this was an excellent film and one that truly and tastefully displays the events of that tragic day. However, I still felt that the filmmakers did not do enough in their depiction of the passengers on board and the true bravery that they exhibited in preventing United Flight 93 from becoming another weapon of terrorism. I think the film was a good overall look at the day as a whole, but you do not get a sense of who the passengers (read heroes) on the flight were, where they were from, and how much courage they had to have had to do what they did. the people on that flight selflessly sacrificed their lives so that others in Washington and the capital region could live, and I do not feel that the bravery of this act, nor the character and background of the individuals on board was adequately depicted.",9,0,1,23 April 2007
