Alien 3," Mysterious and dark
","When I first saw this movie I didn't like it. I thought it was boring and didn't like the effects too. I had already seen Alien Resurrection and Alien but I hadn't seen Aliens so I didn't understand it well. When I first saw Aliens I was excited. But, then, I was three years younger. A week ago I watched four of them, again, and I found Alien 3 interesting. It was dark and mysterious. I changed my mind for Aliens. It wasn't mysterious at all, I didn't scare, it was actually like an action movie. It reminded me of Terminator. Everybody had  a gun and was killing aliens. Anyway, Alien 3 reminded me of Alien. First of all, because there was only one and they couldn't kill it. I can't say I didn't like the end I just think it could be better. 8/10.",8,0,3,6 May 2000
Mulan," Good but not enough (good)
",This movie was OK -as every Disney' s movie- but even though I watched it twice (one myself and one with my younger cousins) I can' t say that it is one of the best Disney' s film. For example Aladdin was better. Anyway it is worthy to watch but don' t expect something very special! Little kids will definitely like it. I put 8/10,8,0,1,26 May 1999
X-Men," One of the best sci-fi movies
","That was a very good movie. It was exciting and colourful too. That's a must for sci-fi fans. It's not just a silly script made for children, it's more than this. I compare it to Matrix (even though you won't be able to find many common parts, but both are sci-fi and good ones too). So, if you are a sci-fi fan. If you used to like the X-Men comics or animated series, if you liked Star Wars, if you liked Alien series, this movie will be your next favourite sci-fi movie. 8/10 (-2 because of the genre-not a sci-fi movie is worth for over than 8-there are few exceptions as Alien-, so take this as a 10)",8,0,0,15 October 2000
The Terminator," Perfect action/sci-fi movie.
","This is a perfect movie made from my favorite director - James Cameron. I think this movie is even better than T2. It is scary, it is adventurous, very well done and original. OK, T2 had more and better special effects but it was only action, not so scary. In this movie I think the best scene is the final scene when they get in this factory (or whatever it is) and Terminator's after them. If you haven't watched it, do it immediately. Every movie made by James Cameron is top. 10/10",10,1,1,24 May 2000
Alien," The best sci-fi movie ever
","This movie is perfect. It is mysterious, dark, scary and most of all enjoyable. The script is very original. The direction and the acting are good enough. Perfect special effects for 1979. The worst thing the sequels made was that they made us know who the survivor would be, otherwise you wouldn't be able to imagine it. Another reason that makes this movie perfect is the fact that it reminds me of the place and of the period I first watched it. I was 13 then and I was in Lesvos (a Greek island). Since then, every time I go there I watch all of the Alien series. Madness! :-)",10,0,1,22 May 2000
Mission: Impossible II," AWESOME
","It is, definitely, better than the first one as well as more interesting. The story is original and has an ideal sequence, honestly, never met before. It has absolutely nothing to do with the first one. It has a new whole plot which would be even better if it was 'PART 1'. See it in a good cinema. This movie is awesome. 9/10",9,1,2,27 October 2000
Life Is Beautiful," Thank god there is America to save the world! (Now I can sleep at nights)
","Well, the fact is that when the tanks went to set Italy free most of them were Russians, but unfortunately Russia do not give any awards... This movie is great, I'm not sarcastic in this part, it is really touchy and full of (Roberto's special) humour. It's pity that the history is a bit changed but... that's the way it is...9/10",9,1,2,28 December 2000
Halloween," In one word - Excellent
",This is the best movie (not just horror movie) I have EVER seen. It doesn't have any gore scenes but it surely shows the terror scenes very truly and convincingly. It had everything a horror movie consists of and some great acting and a persuasive direction too. It wasn't that scary but the climate was fantastic since it was showing reality facts in a very nice way. The music is great and it can make you be scared even more. You should watch Halloween 2 and Halloween H20 ommitting the other sequels (the ones without Jamie Lee Curties were awful) even though Halloween 2 and Halloween H20 weren't as good as the the first one. I put 10/10 because it was a nice try that achieved to really scare people and give a whole new dimension to scary movies.,10,0,1,14 May 1999
The Sixth Sense," It was a surprise
","Before I watch it I was listening to the comments of this movie: Very scary, very original, surprising ending etc. This movie is absolutely perfect. It was gory in some parts (when the kid with the gun turns over and we see his skinless head with blood) but this movie manages to scare you because of its plot. I thought that this movie would just be another common thriller but I was wrong. It was 'horror' and it was brilliant. It was a non Scream-type horror movie (fortunately)and a very interesting one. The best ending I've ever seen! 10/10",10,0,0,28 May 2000
Final Destination," This movie ROCKS!!
","I compare it to Scream, it was actually even better. The plot is completely different. It's not about a serial killer the killer is supposed to be death. That sounds  a little bit silly but it's not. The whole story is about accidents, an accident in which some persons had to die and they didn't. But 'you can't cheat death'!. The first scene is completely exciting and the last is surprising (as in every new horror movie). There were plenty of laughs and chills. I don't want to describe any of the scenes, just go on and watch this movie, It is action, it is thriller, and most of all, it is horror. It rocks! 10/10",10,1,1,29 June 2000
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Nancy has nightmares. Freddy Krueger is trying to kill her in her dreams. If Nancy doesn't wake up screaming she won't wake up at all.
","Wow! This is the most scary movie I have EVER seen. For the first time after watching a horror movie I couldn't sleep. The other night I watched the first sequel and I was SO disappointed, it was so awful, my GOD!!(1/10). In the first Nightmare I put 8/10 because Wes Craven doesn't know when to stop the gory scenes, otherwise I would have put 10/10. I' m not that interested in a movie when I see so much blood!That doesn't make me scare that much. But, anyway, it was one of the best horror movies. Scary! Watch the second sequel and the New Nightmare omiting the others!",8,0,0,18 May 1999
