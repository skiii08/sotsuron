Angels & Demons," Who the *¤%& cast this movie?
","It is clear that one cannot make a film as explicit as the book. But still, one should strive to make it as close as possible.To make it as close as absolutely possible, the caster should read the book over several times. It is necessary to find the absolutely right persons to cover the various role, as I am sure most viewers are in accord with.However, the role of the Camerlengo, couldn't have been cast worse. THIS IS NOT A ROLE FOR Ewan McGregor. He was so bleak portraying this character, that it is difficult to see any defense for this casting.BUT THERE IS ANOTHER CASTING that is equally worse, and It is clear to see that somebody chose Nikolaj Lie Kaas to play the Assassin, is so far off the mark that even Ewan McGregors role in the film can be defended - - - The Assassin is described by Dan Brown in vivid colors of personage. And none of these colors are present in Nikolaj Lie Kaas' character.That such a potentially exciting film should be destroyed by such traits, is sad... so, so sad.",6,3,8,21 July 2009
The Incredible Hulk," Good picture - with interesting philosophical worm-cans
","Compared to Ang Lee's version of the 'Hulk'  this version is far, far better. The story is superlatively better  and of course, no matter how good Eric Bana is as an actor, Edward Norton  is better to the extreme.The plot is better too, though I will not say much about it.About Tim Roth's unnamed monster  it must be said that it had a certain potential to be improved. Something uncertain was missing  to say the least.One thing that makes everything worth seeing the film  is the interesting philosophical discussion opened when General Thaddeus Ross first  at an early stage of the movie  says: «As far as I'm concerned, that man's whole body is property of the U.S. army» and somewhat later, after Bruce Banner has been treated by Dr. Samuel Sterns: «If you've taken it from me, I'm going to put you in a home for the rest of your life.» The can of worms opened here, is the general understanding that man is not his own master (not delving into any religious conceptions here), but the notion that the 'state' as such can own a human being.That is of course not in any case true. A man is and remains his own master, with his own free will, and can not be sold  in the same way that a man cannot sell his soul to the devil  because it is not a saleable commodity.This even remains a vital part of the American Declaration of Independence, quoted in the following: «We hold these truths to be self-evident, that ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL, THAT THEY ARE ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN UNALIENABLE RIGHTS, THAT AMONG THESE ARE LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS.  That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, DERIVING THEIR JUST POWERS FROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED,  That WHENEVER ANY FORM OF GOVERNMENT BECOMES DESTRUCTIVE OF THESE ENDS, IT IS THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO ALTER OR TO ABOLISH IT, AND TO INSTITUTE NEW GOVERNMENT, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. BUT WHEN A LONG TRAIN OF ABUSES AND USURPATIONS, PURSUING INVARIABLY THE SAME OBJECT EVINCES A DESIGN TO REDUCE THEM UNDER ABSOLUTE DESPOTISM, IT IS THEIR RIGHT, IT IS THEIR DUTY, TO THROW OFF SUCH GOVERNMENT, and to provide new Guards for their future security».Since the views presented by General Ross absolutely belongs under the characterization of 'despotism', I'd just as well wish, this would have been stated clearly  in the movie, as an explicit answer to the theories of General Thaddeus Ross",9,8,13,2 November 2008
Skyfall," Yes! Yes! and No, not quite.
","Make no mistake. Daniel Craig's purveyance of the hero above all heroes, the man above all men, since the days of our youth is by far the best of all purveyances of James Bond.Daniel Craig even dethrones Sean Connery and George Lazenby, effectively putting David Niven and Roger Moore on the absolute bottom of the ranking list (well, that's not quite fair, because they were on the bottom of the list from before!) Roger Moore only barely surpassed downwards by David Niven (whos version of Casino Royale was more pussyfooting around the theme of James Bond, than a real James Bond movie.The problem with Skyfall, that doesn't raise it above an 8-eight- is that the villain, seems like picked straight out of Roger Moore's stuporous line of films.The best description I can give of Javier Bardem's villain is a mixture of 'Mr.Big' (Live and Let Die) and 'Hugo Drax' (Moonraker), two of the poorest excuses for villains ever portrayed on film.I am still happy to see that Daniel Craig has signed for two more movies, which will appear in 2014 and ????, because I am sure he will keep up appearances, and continuously paint a better Bond, maybe and 'All Time High', if you get my drift.I Just hope the villain will be better next time. Developed further out of and away from the 1960s and 1970s.",9,1,4,30 December 2012
Underworld," Interesting religio-philosophical allegory.
","The Underworld Quadrilogy is an interesting row of films. The plot and the stories with sequels and prequels aren't all that bad, even though highly illogical. The writers could, though, have scored a few pointers in studying fairy-tales somewhat closer. What really makes this series of films interesting is the religio-philosophical and allegorical idea that lies behind. Now, I will not go deeper into this realm in this review, lest I open the door to a Dantean inferno that I am not willing to enter, nor let others enter into. Thus I will just leave it to others there. Maybe others are willing to pilpul the matter further, and deeper - and end up with some kind of final halakha at some later date in the future. As a final conclusion to this review, I will give the complete series of films an evaluation of 7. And add that most of that seven comes from a combination of good dramatization and equally good special effects.",7,1,2,16 January 2014
Passengers," Food for thought
","The first thing I read about «Passengers» is that it was a poorly made movie, with an equal poor plot.After seeing the movie I can only tell the so-called professionals: Pure Hogwash.Passengers is actually a good movie, with a good plot. Morten Tyldum has done a good job, and John Spaihts has written a good script full of suspense, intense and interesting ideas and questions.The many philosophical questions raised in the plot are highly interesting and are well worth pondering.Most important is not whether it could happen or not, but of course What would you have done in this situation. It is not a question of whether it is possible – but if it was possible, what would the solution to the various quandaries be.If you want not only good entertainment, but also food for thought, this is two hours well worth spending in the darkness of the theater.",8,4,6,7 February 2017
The 13th Warrior," This must be Michael Crichtons worst...
","A very unrealistic movie indeed.Maybe it is my Norwegian background, but I get irate when I experience the Vikings portrayed as savages like this. The Vikings had very high cultural values, in fact. They were not a mixture of new-Guinean cannibals and Wall Street brokers.Furthermore, the historic realism could have been done much, much better. Vikings learned early to make soap, from the Celts whom they both traded with and raided. Unfortunately soap-cooking disappeared with the replacing of Celtic Christianity in Norway by Catholicism.The special effects however makes the film look more accurate than it in reality is. But the truth is that even Kirk Douglas' 'the Vikings' is better.",4,3,6,13 September 2000
Spider-Man 2," Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
","I had high expectations for Spider-Man 2. I really had. And I wasn't - for once - let down. This was stupendously exiting, breathtakingly funny, and most of all an amazingly good story - at points even better than it's prequel.Now I can start looking forward to the next one. The triquel. Who will be the big bad guy in the next movie, wonder? Professor Connors? Or will it be as many no doubt suspect - Harry Osborn?My mother tends to say that men remain kids until 40, then they grow worse, and some other woman have said that the difference between men and boys are the price of the toys.But hey, it's fun to be a boy, ain't it?",9,0,0,9 July 2004
Concussion," Important movie
","It's almost as if I would say, how dare you give this movie less than an 8? Aren't you ashamed of yourself?This is what America has become because of so-called 'Democracy' (i.e. socialism) and bogus capitalism, rather than true/real capitalism.The comparison to the Tobacco war of the 1990's is clear and concise, and it is truly scary that the people behind it refuse to see it.Stop playing Football? No, that's not what its about, It is a question of minor changings - respecting even the Declaration of Independence. 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness'.That in itself means that anyone who treats people unequal are criminals. And when one denies indisputable facts like this the dr. Bennett Omalu presented one remains a criminal.Of course people are free to play football anyhow, but they also have the right to know about all impending dangers.This is being denied the American people and the players through Democracy and Bogus Capitalism, rather than A true Republican rule and true capitalism (The American Way). The Democratic Party has stolen America from under Americans bottoms, and the GOP has blindly accepted it.America truly needs people like Bennett Omalu.",8,3,9,1 January 2016
Ocean's Twelve," At least the prequel was good.
","That was the major problem with Ocean's Twelve. Not the actors, they were the same and they were quite good, but the script sucked! And not only the script, but the plot sucked too.And as if that was not enough, the direction sucked deep. And why did it sucked, because it was only made to make money. The supposition that we, who watch movies, are stupid cattle - or sheep, may of course be right, but then again: Not all cattle and sheep are dumb.Better think about that next time. Even the series of Police Academy made better work out of the sequel, than this one...Sometimes planning a script and making a good story - not only rehashing old stuff that has been made up with fancy gadgets and special effects. There is much more to a great film than that.",4,2,4,30 October 2006
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious Editing!
","I just finished watching the latest edition for DVD of the first Star Wars Trilogy, and I got two expressly great surprises in the 'Return of the Jedi', both of which came within the last few minutes before the credits. Maybe I shouldn't have been surprised though, after all George Lucas is a GREAT FILMMAKER, and this was GREAT. The first comes about 2:02 into the movie, after the fireworks on the forest moon, when you see the crowds gathering at Coruscant to rejoice that the Emperor is dead and the evil Empire is dissolved. You can clearly hear: Wesa Free! (and if you use subtitles, you'll see it too!) which shows us that JarJar Binks is still alive and kicking! Fun! What's he gonna do in Episode 7...And just a few seconds later... back at the forest moon, when Obi-Wan, Yoda and Anakin shows up, spiritually, it ain't the figure of Sebastian Shaw that shows up... but the face of Hayden Christensen... Absolutely supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!",10,0,2,25 September 2004

Rush," Ron Howard Amazing Yet Again
","Yes. It is true. It is an amazing movie.There may be several reasons for that. The story is good. The idea behind the plot is more than decent, and the actors are more than suitable for their parts.Of course Ron Howard should take his part of the honor for the film. After all, he is main source of it. But one should be allowed to ask: What is it that makes Ron Howard's films so on the edge? Why is just he making so good movies?I can't answer that question. But I am sitting on the sidelines watching, expecting more. Looking forward to the next great Ron Howard adventure.Now, I have to say something about the technical side of the film. I like the camera angles. I like the vibrating strand of grass vibrating while the F1-cars are swooping past them. It really made me believe.The make-up of Daniel Brühl in the role as Niki Lauda is superb. Really superb. At least for those of us old enough to remember Lauda in the late 70's.Something else? The scene from the hospital where the medical staff are vacuuming Lauda's lungs, almost made me puke. It feels so real, that I could almost feel that pipe going down my throat.Well worth a 9'er.",9,1,1,4 May 2014

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Sorely needed: An extended version
","I had been looking forward to Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban, since I saw the Chamber of Secrets ... and as the story goes, I was sorely disappointed. Having read the comments from 'movie specialist' and critics in papers and on various TV-channels I had really high expectations - but I was let down. Why? Because although the movie had much better acting skills (at least from Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint I was grieved to see Emma Thompsons characterization of professor Trelawney. Not good enough by a long shot. The editing was so so. The direction was probably very good from a movie technical point of view - but ...and it is a very big BUT:The film was not by a mile dark enough. The film was not by a hundred miles long enough. And the details were to scarce to get a real idea of the story.A personal message to Alfonso Cuaron? Make an extended version. At least 45 minutes longer. And the next time, if possible - make the werewolf believable. It was also a shock to see that the grounds of Hogwarts had changed as much as it had. Too much. This is lack of respect for those who've watched the first two movies. Continuity is vital. Even in such small matters. And it is vital to put further details in the plot... there is so much more to get from it than this.",6,1,2,12 June 2004
X-Men: Days of Future Past," The best of the Franchise
","Yes it is. Truly. The very best of the X-men franchise that has been made. It remains to be seen whether X-men: Apocalypse can top it.Not merely because of the plot.Not merely because of the acting.Not merely because of the special effects.But most of all because of the philosophical ideas included in the plot. There are so many viewpoints here, that it is almost as watching a chess game between two world champions. Both of them may be several possible drafts ahead in time, awaiting the next move from their competitor.Yet we, as viewers, do not know what will happen next.Remember Queen? «...sitting on the edge of your seat?»This is it.Enjoy.",9,4,8,30 August 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," A crappy movie unworthy of Tolkien
","Finally part two of ' The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. I have waited one year for this --- and all I get is this crap?To put it mildly. I am really disappointed. IT's almost like a heartbreak.The first part of the movie is about when the Hobbit and the 12 dwarfs Oin , Gloin , Ori , Dori , Nori , Fili , Kili , Bifur , Bofur , Bombur , Dvalin , Balin and Thorin Oakenshield has been put down on the Carrock fleeing towards the house of Beorn. And it is a blow in the face. Beorn is almost non-existing. This vital piece of information cut away with a machete? Sure, I understand that one can not follow a book to the letter , when to retell it in a movie , even a third movie where every part is about two and a half hours . But when you cut the important parts from the story while writing new plots into the film it detaches completely from the book.When saying that Jackson has written new plot , I do not mean the presentation of the female forest-elf Tauriel . I have nothing against that . Nor Gandalfs trip to Dol Guldur - and the meeting with a familiar evil - which we in the ' Lord of the Rings ' gets to know as Sauron.The unnecessary editing of orcs into Esgaroth and the wood-elf-realm, is merely stupid. There is no excuse for it. Certainly there are great special effects with the dragon Smaug - but unnecessary . Smaug never chases the dwarfs inside the mountain , and there is never any question about rebooting forges in the mountains. And what happens to the significant debate between Smaug and Bilbo?This is an appropriate place to end this chapter on, which Jackson also understood . But why on earth he let one of the dwarfs ( Fili ... or was it Kili ) be hurt by a Morgul arrow , which requires that he must have king's foil - athelas to become healthy again just makes a silly point - this is part of the story that belongs in the ' Lord of the Rings ' when Frodo is wounded by a Morgul blade from one of the ' nine ' ringwraiths . The whole thing is just sad . [ He did the same in King Kong by mixing bullshit monsters into the action and have not learned from the mistakes he made then​​] .The only thing I can hope for is that any extended version of the film re-edit can undo damage by removing nonsense - and get the real story in place. Sorry , Peter Jackson, I can not and will give you more than a five ( 5) for this chapter.",8,30,64,11 December 2013

Sometimes rebellion is justifiable, me thinks.Of all the Jack Black movies I have seen, this is by far the best. So I'd wish he keep'em coming for several years.Can he do it again? I believe he can. So what matters most now, is good, no! great! scripts and excellent directors. Jack can do it again and again, if you just let him run loose.Of that I am sure.",7,0,1,7 January 2005
The Imitation Game," Good, but with a serious flaw
","The Imitation game, by Morten Tyldum and with Benedict Cumberbatch starring as Alan Turing is an incredibly good movie. A movie that anyone interested in war-time-history ought to see. And ought to see not only once, but twice and maybe even three times.When that is stated, it does have serious flaw. Alan Turing's creation of 'Christopher' - the machine that was used to break the Enigma Code, did so because he was an incredibly good mathematician, a sincere genius with mental connections that most of will never have.He didn't however, manage to create this machine because he was a homosexual. And that is the explicit message I get, after watching this film. When that is said, I don't think that homosexuals are in any way worse that any other of us, nor are they less worth. But their sexual preferences doesn't produce intelligence or genius. Their sexual choices merely makes them different.I've had several friends through the years that have chosen a homosexual life-style. One of them committed suicide, sorry to say. He was an overtly creative human being. And as said above, neither less or more worth than any of us. Just a human being - like us, struggling with his demons.When will people start raising homosexuals to something it is not? Don't they realize that they by this makes more problem for those that suffer from it, just as The Imitation Game actually will cause problems for an unknown number of homosexuals.Because of this, I cannot give more than 7. The movie was destroyed by its own propaganda. That's sad.",7,0,5,8 January 2015

It still was labeled 'The best movie ever made'.Now being aged a bit since the last time I saw the movie, I do not consider myself stupid, even though I still have some ways to go before I am complete both in wisdom - and knowledge, but I still cannot say that I understand this movie.The only thing I can state as a fact is that it reminds me of women.

","'Chamber of Secrets' were much better than the first attempt to portray Harry Potter on the Silver Screen. Mind you, we should expect as much, since the actors have become older, more experienced and even mindful of what they are doing. However, I do miss a wider perspective on who Gilderoy Lockhart is, just like I miss the lack of exposure of Snape in the first movie. These are vital persons that would need a wider exposure in the story. Neither movie would lose in becoming a few minutes (10?) longer. The evil Lucius Malfoy, however, was great! This guy could really give you the creeps! Totally Arian, nazi-like, bad-dude... I look forward to seeing more of him in the movies to come...

Ever since I watched Robert Altmans Short Cuts I have had a thing going for all the small stories weaving into one. Like that Love Actually can compete with Magnolia and several other.Why? Probably because it gives space for thinking. The stories are spinning, and the viewer isn't forced to just be a mindless spectator, but may weave into the story, he may do something that is more worth while than just pouring out his money. Now of course the actors do great jobs do.Especially Alan Rickman... who gets to show that he really is a great character actor.

Munich," Not as good as the original
","In my view, Steven Spielberg has not done a good enough job with this film. Actually some parts are sloppily made, and the casting is by far perfect. Several actors are not suitable for the character they are portraying. Considering rather the original dramatization from 1986, titled Sword of Gideon, with Steven Bauer playing the lead role is by far better than this one. Of course there are weaknesses in that too, and this is where Spielbergs version gains momentum - through the special effects. However, the part about 'pffum-pffum' is clearly lacking in Munich, which gives less depth to the believability of the story. Maybe a Directors cut with certain scenes shot over again could be a potential solution?",6,0,3,2 October 2006
The Thin Red Line," Unreleased power
","I can't put my finger on how many war movies have been made. What I do know for certain is that this is one to many. To begin with, the film is extremely boring.This mainly because the incredible amounts of information given, but without enough drive and move forward to release the information into valid information.Speaking from a dramatic viewpoint, the amount of information that aren't released, but merely ends up more like debris, just cluttering the moral of the story.Thus the final message of the movie just hangs there, without being able to give anything of substance.",5,1,2,7 January 2005
Alien: Covenant," The best of the series
","Most people consider the original, Alien, from 1979 the best. This would be natural, since the original almost always is the best. Speaking from the view of intense thrills, they would be right.However, when seen in a broader, and more philosophical light, trying to understand the philosophical depths of the franchise, there can, IMHO, not be any doubt that Alien: Covenant is the deepest, and best of them all.In Alien: Covenant we are presented a much deeper, through-thought ideology, both philsophical and religious. One can even use it to understand more obscure parts of the Bible, though I wouldn't recommend that as such.The search for deity among humankind is incredible, and is needed to understand this franchise, just as the story of Frankenstein is.Enjoy!",8,2,8,9 July 2017
V for Vendetta," Extremely interesting, but with a serious flaw
","V for Vendetta is an enticing piece of work. It has inconspicuously clear parallels to Europe in the 1920s through 1940s, but also very interesting parallels to our own time. However, there is a major problem - and that is the falsification of historical realities - as is seen in the portrayal of Lewis Prothero, posing as a conservative Christian - while being somewhat of a Nazi stooge, in reality. The ideology of naziism having anything to do with the Christian Right is a gross distortion of historical realities, as naziism/fascism actually worshiped the ancient Germanic deity Odin - and praised the ancient Roman system as perfect. The Greek pantheon also had a central part of the role within the system. Furthermore, naziism as such was a leftist-center movement, not a rightist movement. As such V for Vendetta falls short of being anything more than simple propaganda.",7,2,4,2 October 2006
