Kill Bill: Vol. 2," why Kill Bill is a 10 (spoilers)
","I was fortunate enough to see this film at a private screening the day before it was released. When i first rated it, i gave it a 9. After a couple of days to think about it though, I had to give it a 10. The reason I thought i should change this vote, was because when I thought about it, there is nothing I can think of to change this movie to make it any better. Mr. Tarentino has done something with these two films that is unique in the midst of most film-making today. When you first see Bill, (or rather, hear Bill) He is the most despicable of the despicable. You can't wait to see The Bride get to him in the end. But when she finally does in vol. 2, Bill is easily the most likeable character in the two films.Uma Thurmans performance was excellent and David Caradines was all the more incredible. If you havent seen this movie yet, go see it twice.",10,1,2,17 April 2004
