The Blair Witch Project," Not Good
","Some people say this movie is good because itÂ´s scary without special effects,but when i think that the movie was a big disappointment, i did not saw the 'scary' in this movie, now maybe it was meant to be a kind of 'mysterious' movie but it did not felt any mysterious when i watched it",1,17,33,5 November 2002
