Blade Runner 2049," Wow...this was bad.
","Boring from start to finish and all with a confusing story, good looking effect and actors, but what does that matter when the movie in itself is boring.",1,4,6,29 December 2017
Ready Player One," Really liked this one!
","Didn't have high expectations before watching it, thought it might be too ridiculous, but it was really good! It's the kind of movie you can go back and watch many times over, just like 'back to the future' movies.Not much more to say...just watch it!",10,3,6,18 June 2018
