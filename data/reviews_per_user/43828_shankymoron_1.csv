Black Swan," How do you make something just 'perfect '?
","Aronofsky comes out with a splendid piece of movie-making yet again! Black Swan is dark, spine-chilling and a magnificent piece of demonstration of Aronofsky's ability to portray emotions on the celluloid. The plot is dark, portrayal of a ballet dancer (Natalie Portman), whose life is all about ballet-dancing. Portman scored on all fronts as she depicts the lead ballet dancer to inch perfection. Unlike many other directors' works, Aronofsky's demands a strong portrayal on the part of the actors and surely the cast does not disappoint. The storyline is wicked and often needs you to look out for deeper meanings; but that is what you expect from a director of Aronofsky's caliber. That is what you pay for. And you never feel your money got wasted. Though not as intellectually challenging as 'Pi' or 'The Fountain', this one is an artistic masterpiece and he makes sure he brings it to a awesome finale. Some scenes just make you ponder over the hard-work the actors and the director might have put-in, but the realization of the director's genius does not come until you have entered the final moments of the movie. I will not put any spoilers , but will give you reasons why you should go and watch this movie on the big screen-1) Its a typical Aronofsky (fans would not want to miss this at any cost). 2) Natalie Portman - Seldom do you see an actress this powerful in her portrayal of a role. And finally, 3) A rare mix of art and intellect - Aronofsky, as always makes sure that he does not make a movie complex just for the sake of making it complex (sorry David Lynch fans-but had to say it!)- but his works are a genius mix of a strong touching storyline and a mind-boggling depiction of that story.So go ahead, have an artistic chew from one of the masters of storytelling- hats off Aronofsky!",9,3,5,7 March 2011
