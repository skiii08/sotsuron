The Monuments Men," No Masterpiece
","Have you ever had that feeling that something is terribly wrong, but you cannot put your finger on it? You analyze it, try to find the reason, and end up like a marble statue of indecision. That's how I felt with The Monuments Men.As far as the storyline, I had no idea that Hitler amassed such a monumental collection of the world's masterpieces while conquering Europe. When I initially saw the trailer for the movie, I thought it would be an interesting flick of war intrigue. To my horror, about half way through I kept fiddling with the stop button on my TV wanting to escape.I cannot put my finger on any one thing as to why this movie doesn't work. Since George Clooney and Matt Damon star in the film, maybe I was hoping for a WWII version of Oceans 11 where the gang steals back valuable artwork from the bad guys. There are great actors, but mediocre performances. Even George Clooney had little spark, like the landmine that barely blows in one scene. The film lacks conflict and intrigue. The only thing that did ruffle my feathers were the Germans stealing, stashing,and destroying the masterpieces from great artists. As the war is ending, The Monuments Men take on the task of finding, salvaging, and returning the stolen treasures.Of course, there are undertones of more being destroyed than art. There is the terrible confiscation of Jewish property, even down to barrels full of gold fillings taken from the mouths of victims. It is a sobering reminder that more than art had been lost during the war, and perhaps we should care about human lives rather than a Rembrandt.Nevertheless, it is true that our greatest achievements as human beings should be preserved. Hitler wanted to conquer more than land and human beings, he wanted to conquer and own all of the art created by master artists of centuries past. Two men gave up their lives to preserve and reclaim the artwork. The only question left for the audience to ponder, is whether the price of a human life is worth the preservation of a Rembrandt.",5,0,0,22 May 2014
Gone Girl," Meet a Psychopath
","After a stressful day of work, I decided to go to the show and see Gone Girl. The reviews after release were strong, and I was intrigued. I will be frank that Ben Allfeck has never been one of my favorite actors. Nevertheless, I relented and found myself sucked into an intriguing plot about a story I knew nothing about. In a way, I like being surprised having not read the book before seeing the movie. I think had I known the outcome it wouldn't have been as interesting.Unfortunately, I can tell you NOTHING in this review beyond the superficial gist of the movie. It would be a crying shame to spoil it for you, so I won't.The story starts out on the truthful fact that marriage is hard work. Marriages can fail. People can drift apart. However, it's how the husband and wife of a marital union handle the challenges that determine the outcome of sticking together or getting a divorce.We've all been privy to true-life instances in the media where a man has killed his wife. The plot is like watching the 6 o'clock news of the latest missing spouse. Nick Dunne returns home one day to find his cat wandering outside and his front door open. When he enters the house, he finds a scene reminiscent of a struggle and his wife has disappeared.Of course, when the police get involved, Nick is the first person they attempt to eliminate in this strange disappearance of Amy Dunne. Nick is far too nonchalant about her disappearance, which sheds suspicion upon him. Everyone thinks he murdered his wife. As the story progresses, more evidence mounts against him making him look quite guilty of bludgeoning her to death. Nick, on the other hand, is playing a game of anniversary clue with his missing wife and decides that she is staging an elaborate prank.Needless to say, the movie's first half is riddled with the question of whether he did or did not kill Amy. You are left with the evidence to sort out on your own until suddenly the story takes an 180 degree turn in the opposite direction. I will confess that I had this sneaking suspicion it was going to play out this way. Even though I was correct in my assumption, it certainly did not prepare me to see the outcome that leaves you speechless, questioning, unresolved, and unsatisfied. It's quite a void after the credits roll, which haunts you on the way out to the parking lot.Even though Ben isn't my favorite actor, I will say his performance in this movie is well played. He was the droll and unconcerned husband at one point, worried at another, and mortified toward the end. As far as Rosamund Pike's performance, she was so disquieting I hope I never meet her face-to-face. Outstanding performance that will define her for years to come.Somewhere in this story lurks a narcissistic psychopath that will make your skin crawl. The film doesn't have any fright factor, except for one horribly disturbing scene that will make you gasp as it plays out. However, like any good thriller it does a good job of leaving you inwardly distraught as a result. In conclusion, it's worth a movie ticket, a medium popcorn, and two and half hours of sitting in a dark theater. Though I read there was a scene of frontal nudity of Ben Affleck's prize possessions, I'm here to report I never saw anything. I mean that too! I'm not sure if they cut it out of the film or if my eyes just glazed over. Maybe I can get a partial refund since I didn't get my money's worth.",8,3,12,3 October 2014
Jersey Boys," A Baby Boomer's Dream Sherry Baby!
","Today I saw The Jersey Boys, which is the newly released film version directed by Clint Eastwood. I took in the 1:05 p.m., Saturday afternoon showing, and sat in a nearly full theater of baby boomers, or those not far from that generation. At my age, you do have to chuckle when you are clearly placed in the demographics of those who remember the heyday of The Four Seasons as part of their teenage years.I have no idea what it is about those songs of the 60's and '70's, except that they remain in your memory and are a part of your DNA. In my case, it is especially true because I was born and raised Detroitâ€”the home of Motown and doo-wop. I danced to those songs at sock hops during junior high and high school. I suspect that many who attended the movie came because of the music, which is the highlight of the film.The movie is based off the Tony Award Winning Jersey Boys, with three of the stage stars reprising their role in the film version. John Lloyd Young, who plays Frankie Valli, is fantastic. He won the 2006 Tony Award Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical. He carries that talent and performance well onto the screen, frankly making the movie what it is. The others in the cast who played members of the band were no less talented. Clint Eastwood keeps true to the stage version, from what I've read, in that the performers narrate directly into the camera in various spots. It works well and did not distract from the film.Of course, behind the music are the lives of those who perform. Like most bands of that era, they started under humble circumstances. Much of the beginning of the film depicts their roots in Jersey and rise to stardom. Thanks to the songwriter, Bob Gaudio, who joined and wrote hit after hit, they quickly rose to fame flying out of the gates with 'Sherry.' I'm sorry, but every time I say the name Sherry, my brain starts singing:Sherry, Sherry baby Sherry, Sherry baby Sherry, can you come out tonightThe cream of the crop of their biggest hits are performed, such as 'Big Girls Don't Cry,' 'Walk Like a Man,' and many others. A lighthearted moment in the film is when Bob Gaudio comes up with the idea for 'Big Girls Don't Cry.' I'm not sure if that was true, but it sure was good for a laugh.Of course, like other groups, The Four Seasons were not without their problems, most of which focused around Tommy DeVito. Though he was the founder of the group and the one who encouraged Frankie in his early days, he also brought about the group's breakup by incurring a huge debt with a loan shark. One member quits, and Frankie and Gaudio spin off on their own, which led to other memorable songs, such as 'Can't Take My Eyes Off You.' That performance in the film is undoubtedly my favorite not only for entertainment value, but mainly because they sung it at the Roostertail Club in Detroit. Boy, that place was the hub-bub of entertainment and a common household name when I lived there. Long before the current city went bankrupt, in the fifties and sixties Detroit had the handle on music in its heyday.All in all, I enjoyed the movie, even though it did have a few slow parts. There is very little about Frankie Valli's personal life, though it is touched on briefly throughout the film. The music, of course, transports you back to your teens if you are from that generation. Frankly, I couldn't stop tapping my foot to the beat a few times. The audience seemed just as enthralled and lost in nostalgia.I'm sorry that I never saw the stage version, even though I had an opportunity while in Vegas quite a few times. I have no idea why I didn't go see it. From what I read online, it's going on tour in the UK in the fall of 2014. Even though I missed the experience of live performances, the movie is a good replacement.Will the younger generation like the film? Probably not as much as the baby boomers. If you are 40, 50, 60, or a bit older, it's right up your alley -- Sherry baby!",9,18,24,22 June 2014
The Reader," An Affair of Generational Differences
","First off, I will admit I did not read any reviews or synopsis of the movie beforehand. I hit play in total ignorance when I recently streamed it online. Yes, it's a bit shocking that a woman, who was probably in her early 30's, had an affair with a 15-year old boy. However, had I turned it off, like so many disgruntled reviewers, claiming it was nothing more than a sickly and vile movie about pedophilia, I would have missed an intriguing story that turned out to be quite a surprise.I will give a few insights as to the story, without spoiling the ending. It starts out with Ralph Fiennes, who plays the adult version of Michael Berg reminiscing about the past. Set in 1958 post-WWII Germany, it tells the story of a teenager who is helped by Hanna Schmidt, a young woman, when he becomes ill with Scarlet Fever. After his recovery, he returns to thank her, but to his surprise she seduces him and an affair ensues.Hanna is a woman that at first you really know nothing about, other than she enjoys two things with Michael - sex and the fact that he reads books to her during his visits. Strange as it seems,they fall in love until one day she mysteriously disappears without a word and breaks his heart.Fast forward to Michael's days at university as he studies to be a lawyer. His professor takes the class to sit in on the the war crime trials. To his surprise, Hanna is a defendant, along with a group of other women, for her participation as a guard at a Nazi concentration camp. Day after day he attends the hearings, listening to the crimes she committed during the war and then realizes something about Hanna that no one else knows. The fact could lessen her sentence, but Michael cannot reconcile the horrors of her actions in helping to kill the Jews. What he knows, he keeps silent, and her sentence is life in prison compared to a paltry four years for the other women involved in the same crimes.The movie is one of conscience as the younger generation deals with the guilt of the older generation and the crimes committed to humanity in WWII. Michael takes a sobering visit to Auschwitz to see for himself where she worked as a guard. Hurt and brooding for the woman he once loved, he makes the choice not to help her avoid her punishment regardless of the secret she has held from everyone, which Hanna refuses to admit to even at her trial. Her shame regarding that one fact is greater than the shame of being a guard during the war and her participation as a murderer.In the end, the story reverts to Michael as an adult and the guilt and feelings he has wrestled with throughout his life regarding Hanna. The movie is an interesting and thought-provoking story that reaches far more than the risquÃ© first half of an older woman having sex with an under-aged boy. David Kross looks very young in the part, but the sexually explicit scenes were not filmed until he turned 18 years of age.If you're looking for a sobering movie regarding love, morality, secrets, and consequences of one's actions, this is a good flick. It touches the lives of those who participated and those families who were victims. Kate's achievement in winning an Oscar, Golden Globe, BAFTA, and many other awards for her portrayal of Hanna are well deserved.Interesting post note on this subject, I did a Google search wondering how long the war crime trials lasted due to the timing in this story. To my surprise, I stumbled across an article in the Independent from September 2013 regarding Germany's continued prosecution. Even now they are pursuing former guards at concentration camps, stating that arrest warrants would be issued for, '40 men and six women suspected of having worked as guards at Auschwitz.' Some of these men and women are now in their 90's, but the trials continue.",8,1,1,14 May 2014
Godzilla," Godzilla, Our Hero
","This evening I went to the show and saw Godzilla. The theater had an 80% male population and 20% female population. So much for the demographics. I guess guys like monsters. Now onto the movie.Having lived through the big screen release of Jurassic Park and T-Rex, who scared the living daylights out of me, I was really looking forward to another OMG moment of closing my eyes out of terror. Unfortunately, I think I only had one 'holy crap' pop out of my mouth during the entire movie. Perhaps I'm too old to frighten with make-believe monsters. The movie itself wasn't what I expected. The trailers are pretty spot on setting up the basis for the story. Whatever is down there, it's going to throw us into the stone age again, or so we are led to believe. As it progresses, other monsters emerge who received more screen time than Godzilla. After a while, I felt a bit cheated because I didn't come to see two other creatures get it on and lay eggs. I mean, they're not even that good looking. Sort of leggy, if you ask me, leaping buildings in a single bound. Of course, there's not much left after they leap from rooftop to rooftop.There were a few odd bits in the storyline, one being the captain of the naval ship who seemed to be calling all the shots and making the big decisions to save the United States. Only once did he get on that important red phone to confer with the President on nuking those nasty building stomping, lay egging monsters. Of course, he didn't listen to the guys who knew what they were talking about, telling him the chosen course of action was a bad one. No surprise there.As far as gore and blood, you won't see much. I don't think the movie carries the scare factor enough to leave nightmares behind. Of course, the special effects are a far cry from the 1954 version that I grew up with on television. Godzilla looks like the original big body, small headed monster we've always known. Only, you don't cringe when he shows up. In fact, the audience was cheering the big lizard onto victory. Instead of the terror, he is hailed as the 'savior' of San Francisco. Hum, I think the religious right may balk over that thought.In any event, it's mildly entertaining. Godzilla sort of sounds like T-Rex, but without the bite. I did not see it in 3D - those progressive lenses I have just ruin the experience for me. The big screen without the 3D was just as much in your face with monsters, falling buildings, and roaring creatures.All in all, it's an okay remake with the cool new technology we have for film making. No complaints with the actors, they all did a fine job of saving the world and showing that they were at least scared to death over the nuclear eating monsters. San Francisco is a pile of rubble, and Las Vegas will never be the same. Such a shame all those casinos were flattened. Oh, well.",7,8,15,15 May 2014
Her," Connected to Technology and Disconnected from the Human Race
","If you haven't seen it, you might enjoy it - then again, you might not. It's a movie about the human need to connect.Set a few decades ahead of 2014, HER is about a society that is in touch with technology. If you think it's bad now with everyone's telephone in their face, you've seen nothing yet. Society is technology hyped, though I can't say that the fashions have evolved much in the movie.Basically, it's about a man going through a divorce, who is lonely and broken. His dating endeavors have not been going well. Theodore finds it hard to connect and open up to anyone - even his former wife. However, when he's given the opportunity to buy the latest technology - an OS (operating system) - his life changes.Just think about it. A perfectly programmed mate for your life made just for you. You can choose a male or female voice. The system grows, adapts and learns everything about you. And while doing so, it evolves to discover what it means to be human by getting in touch with its own electronic 'feelings' if you will.Theodore finds Samantha (his OS) easy to talk to. They go places together. He walks, she's in his shirt pocket. They explore the world, talk, keep each other company, and have make believe sex. She tells him that she is in love, and Theodore has fallen in love with HER.Well, it's a complex relationship. At one point he almost walks away because of the absurdity of it all. It's obvious he has trouble with human relationships, so should he pursue the electronic ones instead? After a brief struggle, he throws all caution to the wind. However, even like real relationships, it ends in heartbreak after he learns that Samantha is not a one-guy OS. In fact, she has over 8,000 other companions and declares love to over 600. Talk about fickle! Of course, the news devastates Theodore, and in the end, the OS's evolve and abandon humans for their own kind (or at least that's what I got out of it).It's a strange movie, but it is filled with the honesty of struggling to be a single and sole individual who has a deep need to connect. If one can't connect humanly, then companionship can be found electronically. However, I strongly believe that our society is becoming disconnected because of technology. Our phones are in our faces, along with computers, iPads, Kindles, and every other device that we use to get lost in, so we can depart from the human race. Rather than giving us a stronger society, it is giving us a society that connects through electricity, but cannot connect humanly.If you're single, I think you would enjoy and relate. Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant. Absolutely brilliant and heartfelt through the entire movie. He's a man who wants to be loved and accepted. And if that love comes from an operating system named Samantha that understands him more than any other thing on this earth, then so be it.That is HER. Now, if I could only have a HIM with a voice like Jeremy Northam, I'd die a happy woman with my OS next to me in bed.",8,0,2,25 May 2014
