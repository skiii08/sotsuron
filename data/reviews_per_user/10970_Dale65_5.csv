The Blair Witch Project," if it looks like S%#t, and it sounds like S%#t, then it must be S%#t!
","If you thought that 'Star Wars Episode 1' was the most over-hyped letdown of the year, get ready.  'The Blair Witch Project' is so shockingly bad it could have been made by your ninth grade brother's friends on their first camping trip this summer.  Shot primarily with a poor quality video (which appears to pre-date steadyshot), 'Blair Witch' should have had a hard time getting into student film and video festivals based on the poor visual and sound quality alone.  Instead, it has won prizes and accolades at both Cannes and Sundance, and has become the new indie darling of film critics most everywhere. But, 'Blair Witch' is far scarier than many of the critics have even begun to hint at.  It's basically 80 minutes of watching amateurs stuck in flat woods, running in circles, with no concept of shot composition, no script, no performance talent, and absolutely no idea of what the hell they are doing.  This is the movie that puts the 'horror' in horrible.'Blair Witch' is supposed to be about the making of a documentary.  Is this supposed to represent a documentary film crew? A girl who is a complete bitch, and two dweebs who act like whiny versions of Beavis and Butt-head. The interminable fits of yelling and screaming will have you bored stiff. Do stick figures made of wood, and the sounds of nearby 'filmmakers' making funny noises in the woods give you the creeps?...if so, you might actually find this frightening.Well, as audiences everywhere are finding out (as Cinemascore is indicating), 'The Blair Witch Project' is not a good film, and certainly not what they were told it would be.  Shame on critics making comparisons to horror classics like 'The Exorcist' and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. Those were bold masterpieces of terror in which the scripts were solid before production began.  Jeez, even 'I Still Know What You Did Last Summer' was scarier than 'Blair Witch' (if Jennifer Love's breasts get any bigger...) Any dolt can do what the makers of 'Blair Witch' have done, just look at the worst home videos your neighbor Larry has in his collection (but Larry knows how to use that tripod his wife bought him last Xmas).To quote Bart Simpson from that great Halloween episode with Poe's 'The Raven'; 'Do you know what would have been scarier than nothing?.....................ANYTHING!!'",1,88,162,5 August 1999
Erin Brockovich," Soderbergh, what were you thinking?
","The only reason I went to see this schlock was because of Soderbergh. Yes, as impossible as it is to believe the same man who gave us SEX, LIES AND VIDEOTAPE, OUT OF SIGHT, KING OF THE HILL, SCHIZOPOLIS, and THE LIMEY is responsible for yet another dumb Julia Roberts movie.  Uncannily bad acting, and a script that feels like a bad TV movie from the 70's.  One of the worst films of last year, so of course it's nominated for best picture.  Turns out the real Erin Brokovich is even dumber than the fictional version.  She just went bankrupt spending her entire $2 million on a dream house and drug rehabilitation.  God bless America.",Null,0,1,16 March 2001
Blade," This film gets better with a second viewing
","I really did enjoy watching 'Blade' in the theatre at the end of summer.  I had resisted it at first, having been burned by New Line's other recent comic hero film, 'Spawn'.  But 'Blade' is a true treat.  Having enjoyed Stephen Dorff in 'City of Industry', it was fun seeing him portray another bad boy.  The casting in this movie is wonderful (has Traci Lords ever been more suited for anything than her walk on here?)  Wesley Snipes simply won't settle for any one genre, and it's great to see.I really must agree with some of the others who've commented here about the New Line Platinum Series DVD--it is exceptional. I haven't seen or heard a better film for a home system.  DVD owners everywhere should be supporting New Line's incredible series which includes 'Boogie Nights' and 'Dark City' special editions.  Also, as a point of interest, 'Blade' was directed by Stephen Norrington, who also made the low-budget science fiction horror film 'Death Machine'.",7,0,1,25 January 1999
The Green Mile," Rip-off
","Doesn't anyone else remember the episode of Amazing Stories called 'Healer' which starred Patrick Swayze?  Stephen King must certainly have had this story of a death-row prisoner who can heal with his touch.  It was a great half-hour, and there was a memorable shot of Swayze touching the hands of other inmates on his march to death row in order to 'heal' them.  That was a half-hour in 1986.  Why does Stephen King take 6 novellas and Frank Darabont over three hours to tell the same story with less impact.  Suckers who bought into the shameless 'Shawshank Redemption' will no doubt place this film high on the top 250.  Well kids, one thing it sure is not--original.",2,5,14,15 December 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," Get real everyone
","I wait for the day when this film is no longer in the top 200 of IMDb, as it deserves.  Please, if any film was passed over in favor of Gump at the 1995 Oscars--it was the best film of the nineties--PULP FICTION.",5,2,9,3 January 1999
