Vertigo," Hitchcock's Best
",This is Hitchcock's best film. By far.A compelling film about obsession. Jimmy Stewart has never been better. Stewart shows just how flawed and broken he can be.Kim Novack is simply stunning.Barbara Bel G's almost steals the show as Stewart's wounded best friend who has feelings for him. Most people remember her from Dallas. But this is the performance to see.Vertigo is one of those movies that you have to see a few time to appreciate.Bernard Herman is also at his best.Great credit sequence by Saul Bass.The film has often been duplicated but never matched.,10,2,6,4 May 2010
Kick-Ass," Brutal and Funny
",This is a brutal and funny movie.A clever take on the super-hero genre.Well done and smart.Figured it would have been a bigger hit at box office. Guess the R rating kept a lot of the target audience out.Fun and playful in an odd way.Nicolas Cage does his best Adam West impersonation.Music keeps your feet taping all the way through.The little girl steals the show. She's foul mouthed and tough.Downside is it felt a little reminiscent of Watchmen and Wanted.,8,5,15,10 May 2010
Iron Man," Downey baby, Downey!
","Downey is very, very good in this movie.He's taken the superhero movie and turned it on its head.Most superhero flicks don't really care about the alter ego. In this one, because it's Downey we want as much of Tony Stark as we can get!Favreau has done an excellent job finding the right tone! Light and fun. Doesn't bog down the character.Very un-Dark Night-ish. A movie I also loved. But this film is the exact opposite of Nolan's brooding masterpiece.",8,0,2,2 June 2010
Casino Royale," Best Bond film in Years.
","I loved, loved this Bond movie.I had low hopes for the new Bond. I had seen him in other movies and he didn't really make much of an impression.I had always likes the original Fleming novel.This film is really an origin story.Shows how he became Bond. How he got his Double 0-number.Bond actually falls in love for the first time since On Her Majesty's Secret Service.Craig plays a very credible, lethal, tough Bond.This is easily the Best Bond film in a few decades.",10,2,5,1 June 2010
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Perfect Movie
","After all these years this movie still excites and inspires me. This movie transports you. You easily get caught up in the story. And the plot is rock solid. I love the acting. I love the dialog. There's nothing about this film that I don't love. Alec Guiness is great as the wise old wizard. Harrison Ford is divine as the pirate,smuggler Han Solo. I have no idea why Harrison Ford didn't like play this part. The music still excites. Every time I hear the theme it takes me back to when I first saw the movie. I have nothing but praise. Love it. Love it. Love it.",10,0,0,5 May 2010
The Bourne Supremacy," Best Bourne
",This is the best of the Bourne series.Big improvements over the first film - which was interesting but a little shaky.Better than the third film too - which was pretty good.But this movie completely altered the aesthetic of big action flicks. I wouldn't say 'revolutionized'. I think Greengrass built on what Spielberg did in Private Ryan.Damon is very good.Great fight scene -- with a magazine as deadly weapon!Movie digs deeper into the character and history of Bourne.Top notch writing.Witty film.Aggressively shot. Deftly edited.,Null,1,3,7 May 2010
