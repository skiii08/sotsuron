The Mask," Classic
","The Mask is, to put it simply, awesome. This movie still makes me collapse on the floor laughing at Jim Carrey's silly antics after watching it maybe 20 times. My personal favorite bit is when Stanley Ipkiss aka The Mask (Carrey) spontaneously turns into 'Cuban Pete', a singer/dancer/one-man band whose catchy music gets the entire police department dancing to avoid arrest. Although I generally enjoy more clever, witty humor, Jim Carrey's slapstick is no less than brilliant, with incredibly funny impersonations and perfectly timed gags. Equally good is the film's plot, which remains funny, interesting, and engaging to the very end. 10 out of 10 stars, no questions asked. If you haven't already seen it, rent or borrow it.",10,0,0,7 June 2005
