Blade Runner 2049," One top notch sequel.
","Oh, boy... one very solidly built movie and sequel. It really brought back to 1982 when the first Bladerunner aired and made such impact that became classic immediately . Everything is top notch: story, acting, soundtrack. P. K. Dick would be impressed himself. I am glad H. Ford finally redeemed himself. After Inidiana Jones, Star Wars sequels he really needed one good move (which Blade Runner 2049 certainly is). The same can be said about later works of R. Scott.",10,1,8,7 October 2017
