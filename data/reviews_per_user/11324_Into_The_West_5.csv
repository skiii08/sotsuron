Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Just which toon was Judge Doom?
","'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is one of those rare films ('The Rocky Horror Picture Show' and 'Cannibal! The Musical' come to mind) that create their own genres for the simple reason it's impossible to fit them into anything existing.Raymond Chandler meets Tex Avery?  'Chinatown' with a twist of 'Red Hot Riding Hood'?  Or even hidden commentary on racism in mid 20th Century America? (What the cartoon characters are called, 'toon,' rhymes with a racist term.)  Arguments could be made regarding all these things, but I'd just rather sit back and enjoy the damned film!I don't think animation ever looked so full and rich, even in the days of classic 'full' animation.  The cartoon characters interaction with humans seems credible because the toons cast shadows and are drawn to have depth. The beauty of the animation is another factor making this so wonderful a movie.The range of voices doing those characters is also remarkable: David L. Lander, June Foray, Mel Blanc, Pat Buttram, and Frank Sinatra, not to mention the three main ones, Charles Fleischer (Roger and Benny the Cab), Lou Hirsch (Baby Herman) and Kathleen Turner as Jessica.  And, lest we forget, perhaps the most memorable turn, Mae Questyl in the last time she'd ever voice Betty Boop (and the first time she'd done so in over 50 years).Of course, the human actors are no slouches, either.  Despite the light nature of this film, Bob Hoskins's performance as Eddie Valiant ranks with his best work.  Christopher Lloyd is also the very embodiment of evil as the appropriately named Judge Doom.  And Joanna Cassidy voices the most 'un-family film-like' line in the movie ('Tell me, Eddie, is that a rabbit in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?') with all the world-weary non-chalance it deserves.Speaking of Judge Doom, I'd like to voice my own opinion about a mystery of the movie. At the end of the film it's revealed that Judge Doom is the toon who killed Eddie's brother in disguise, but which toon he is isn't ever revealed. 
I think Judge Doom was supposed to be Popeye.Why?  When the steam-rollered Judge Doom re-inflates himself with compressed air, his fake eyes 'pop' out.  He also has the ability to morph his fist into dangerous things like anvils and buzz saws, much like Popeye does after eating spinach.  Popeye is also one of the few classic cartoon characters absent from the film, making him a prime candidate to be Doom.  Of course, Doom's toon has a high-sqeaky voice and _two_ red eyes, but I think these are miscues to get one off the trail.Why would they make Judge Doom be Popeye?  My understanding is in the original script of 'Roger Rabbit,' Popeye was supposed to appear along with Bluto as one of Marvin Acme's pallbearers.  But Kings Features Syndicate, who owned the rights to the character, wanted too much money to let Popeye to be added to the film, so the script was changed.  Did Zemeckis want to sneak Popeye back in, especially as a villain, to show his displeasure with Kings Features' uncooperativeness?Just a theory, and one that doesn't have to be accepted to enjoy this unique, masterful, and endlessly lovable film.",Null,1,2,5 June 2004
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," The Animated Musical Grows Up
","The South Park movie has always been one of my favorites. A major question would be why. One reason is the successful translation of a TV show into a film, with the film being far superior. Another is this is an animated musical where you actually like the songs. Another is this is a very mature animated feature whose mature elements don't seem there just for shock.But this is also an insightful view of society in the late Clinton years, people wrapped up in battles to maintain 'family values,' and in doing so promoting hatred and prejudice. But this displaced perspective on right and wrong seems to stretch all the way up to Heaven (where Kenny is rejected) and Hell (where George Burns and Gandhi are accepted).Satan also is sympathetic, something that drives evangelicals crazy. But the fact is this movie is strongly about Christian ideas in the compassion and self-sacrifice of Kenny. In what seems a not too hidden analogy, Kenny goes to Hell to redeem the world. He also is so compassionate, he can even care about the pain and suffering of Satan, himself.Indeed, amidst all the profanity uttered, one might miss that this film ends quite sentimentally, with allusions to the 'summer of love' end of Yellow Submarine and with Kenny reprieved from Hell and getting his wings as he flies into Heaven. And perhaps that is the point. As Cartman notes 'it doesn't hurt anybody.' Along with this view, there are other favorite targets of Parker's, such as the American love of seeing people executed. How far is 'Tomorrow night we'll be entertained/An execution, what a sight!' from 'Cannibal! the Musical''s 'It's as nice as a day can be/won't you come to the hanging with me?' There are, however, two sad things about the film. One is in many ways the United States has become very much like it is in this movie, acting, as Gregory says, 'as policeman for the world.' It almost feels chillingly prophetic to see Saddam Hussein's country attacked by the US (Note: in the South Park Universe, Saddam is Canadian, as evidenced by his flapping head).The other thing is that thing film is a testament to the genius of a cartoon voice artist who belongs up there with Mel Blanc, June Foray, Paul Frees, Mae Questyl, and Jack Mercer: Mary Kay Bergman. Not only does she do the speaking voices of all the mothers, but the singing voices, too. In the great 'Blame Canada' number, she does 16 different voice parts. In the final reprise of 'Mountain Town,' she can be heard at the end hitting a High C.Sadly, only four months after the debut of what had been her greatest achievement, she took her own life, having suffered with crushing, but unrevealed fears. It is tragic to see this film as her swan song, but on the other hand, she managed to give ample proof of her greatness before she left us, and in a movie I think will become (if it hasn't already become) a classic of animated cinema, and cinema in general.",10,0,0,7 May 2005
Ed Wood," Is there such a thing as bad?
","'Ed Wood' is unique among Tim Burton's films in that it is the only one of his films based on a true story, and in being that, it is devoid of fantastic elements (other than those in Wood's films, which, admittedly, weren't that fantastic).  This is because, I think, Burton is making the sort of observation with this film he doesn't in the others.
One way this film does fit in with all the others is that its protagonist (indeed most of his characters in this film) is an outsider.  Characters from other Burton films like Beetlejuice, Pee-Wee Herman, Batman, Ichabod Crane, and especially Edward Scissorhands are all individuals with special skills or attributes that set them apart and end up, in some way, foiling their attempts to be accepted by others.  Ed Wood is the same, but in this case the problem isn't his skills, it's the lack thereof.  He is, as fan polls have noted, the 'worst director of all time.'Therein lies the paradox of 'Ed Wood,' because despite a total lack of ability, Ed Wood firmly believes he is as multi-talented a genius as his idol, Orson Welles.Burton, however, uses a unique approach to portray this.  Although we get film moguls and audiences clearly showing their distaste for his films throughout the film, Johnny Depp, who plays Wood, consistently displays such confidence, even in the face of genuine doubt from his assistants and actors, one is given a curious feeling he, and not they, are right, to do things like leaving in shots where tombstones are revealed to be false.
Indeed, when Wood is making what has been voted elsewhere as 'the worst film of all time,' 'Plan 9 from Outer Space,' Burton cuts together the sequence, and adds triumphant fanfares, to give the impression Wood is indeed creating a masterpiece.The clue to this is when he actually does meet up with hero Orson Welles, in their conversation, Welles bemoans how after 'Citizen Kane' he lost all control over his films.   Welles then tells Wood, 'Ed, visions are worth fighting for.'  Burton is saying for a creator it doesn't matter what others think, but what the creator thinks.  If Ed Wood (or anyone) thinks their vision is worth fighting for, it is.Unfortunately, Ed Wood, like most comic heroes (and despite some serious moments, and the fact this is a biopic, it still is a comedy), lives in a universe where he must fail.  As he watches the world premiere of 'Plan 9' in a veritable trance of ecstasy, he whispers, 'This is it.  This is the film I'll be remembered for,' and the irony of how he was remembered for this film is, perhaps, the film's greatest moment of pathos.  In it, we are brought back to the realization that regardless of a vision, regardless of the fact there may be no real thing as bad or good, Hollywood is merciless to all its visionaries, even to Orson Welles.",Null,0,0,6 September 2003
Edward Scissorhands," In the end we dislike him although we know it's wrong
","Edward Scissorhands was a film that confused me the first time I saw it, and many times afterward. The problem was simply this: if Edward was such a kind and gentle soul, how could he skewer Jim at the end? There are lots of logical reasons. Jim was trying to kill him. Jim was endangering Kim. Or Burton's own explanation, that even someone like Edward has a breaking point. None of these, however, satisfied me.Tim Burton has a tendency to have protagonists he has an ambiguous relationship with. Beetlejuice is a villain, yet he's the most likable person in the movie. Ed Wood is an absolute hack, yet it's hard not being sucked into his vision that he's brilliant. Jack Skellington of the Nightmare Before Christmas is the hero but we really kind of loathe him. Ichabod Crane of Sleepy Hollow is the hero, but he's a pompous dork.The thing these characters have in common, however, is that they are creators, people who produce their own realities, sometimes literally, as with Ed Wood, or sometimes magically, as with Beetlejuice, or sometimes just in his own head, like Ichabod Crane.Edward Scissorhands, too, is a creator, and of Burton's characters, the closest to being a pure artist. He does hair styling, pet grooming, topiary and ice sculpture. This is relevant to why Edward does everything he does.The author James Joyce contended that an artist is a person who reacts to a woman neither by lusting after her or loving her, but wanting to capture her essence on paper. This distancing factor is what makes artists perpetual symbols of man's sense of isolation. But the artist's vision is clearly more isolating than that of a average man, because if the average man could create it, it would seem less like art and more like hackwork.Artists are often portrayed as tragic loners, doomed to ultimately gain satisfaction only through the products of their imaginations. The problem with Edward Scissorhands is that he clearly is _not_ a loner. He desires the company of other people. He initially enjoys the adulation he receives. Even when he knows he is being used, he still allows it to happen because of a love of people, especially Kim. He is so very lovable and Johnny Depp accentuates this. So can he kill? His scissor hands, of course, are what ultimately distances him from the people he wants to be close to. They inadvertently destroy property, or hurt people even when Edward is trying to save someone's life. The scissor hands are also the symbol of the artist: they are what permits him to create. But they also permit him to kill.In many ways, murder is the thing that ultimately, permanently takes the perpetrator away from society. It is the highest crime, and when no justification, such as self-defense, can be found for it, it is often punished with death or life imprisonment. Having Edward kill Jim erases our vision of Edward, the gentle, lovable soul, even if we say Edward was totally justified in doing it. Edward is capable of more than just hurting people accidentally.The contradiction of Edward, the lovable and Edward, the homicidal caused horrific conflict in me. The first time I saw the film, I disliked it, precisely for this reason. How could I even feel sorry for Edward if he killed someone? And isn't that the point of the movie, that Edward is a tragic character? Hasn't Burton defeated his own purpose? But a tragic character is a person of great abilities with one flaw that brings him down. Edward is exactly this. His flaw, however, is not his scissor hands; it is, rather, his need for human contact. But Edward is not just a tragic hero, but also a tragic artist. He is a person we must ultimately dislike, even if we don't want to, because that is the only way he can do the thing he _must_ do, avoid human contact, and achieve the distancing from human reactions Joyce talked about.This is the true genius of the film: the tragedy of the artist. Burton wants us to feel conflicted, to view Edward as something far worse than we ever thought he could be. We cannot truly love the artist, only what he creates. It is one of the great paradoxes of life, and Burton wants it to be under our skins.Many famous artists, like Gauguin, Wagner, or Hemingway, were detestable people. Yet what they produced is enjoyed and will continue to be enjoyed. And at the film's very end, we don't see Edward, but the 'snow' he creates by sculpting the ice. Kim's final line, 'sometimes you can still catch me dancing in it,' tells us in the final analysis, the artist is the insignificant part; the art is what is important. The art imparts joy.And in the art is redemption: ours and Edward's.",9,0,0,1 April 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," The 'Greatest Film' Game
","Rather than just enjoy movies, critics like to play 'The Greatest Film' game.  A few years back, it was rare that a contemporary film was picked as greatest.  'Citizen Kane,' 'Le Grand Illusion,' 'The Gold Rush' and other pre-1950 films usually got the nod well into the 1980's.Then, for some reason, most likely the Internet opening up a voice for the average person to rate film, contemporary films started getting in. 'Schindler's List' was one that comes to mind.  'Shawshank Redemption' is another.While picking the same old, stale films year after year doesn't seem to be logical, picking newer ones has a certain risk.  Many films amaze and beguile audiences when they come out because they are geared to what currently sells.  As years passed, the flaws become apparent and they drop out of sight, while timeless films initially received lukewarmly, or even critically, such as 'The Wizard of Oz,' 'The General,' or 'Intolerance' soar.  Will 'The Shawshank Redemption' drop into obscurity, too?  I don't think so. Why?  One can try to explain.Two possible reasons are Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.  I don't know if either are underrated actors or not, but I rarely hear people remark how completely they transform themselves from role to role.  This is certainly the case here. The two performances, and the chemistry between the two men is the core of the film and reinforces one of its primary messages: never let anyone make you lose hope.  The fact the setting, prison, is alien to most filmgoer's experience, doesn't matter.  'Shawshank' could never be considered a 'prison' film.  It contains a story as archetypal as 'The Odyssey,' a long journey, through many dangers, that ends with the traveler (this time, two travelers) seen to a safe shore (literally!).Another great strength of 'Shawshank' is how it operates on different levels.  Like Jon Avnet's 'Fried Green Tomatoes,' it has its most obvious message--about not losing hope and surviving--set highest.  But as 'Tomatoes' had a gay subtext that could be acknowledged or ignored, so does 'Shawshank,' that prison is a dehumanizing experience that ends up ruining people for life rather than just letting them pay their debts to society and move on.Given this country's conservative bent, it is somewhat bizarre that a film that carries this message is so adored.  All I can say is the other aspects of the film allow one to ignore it and still enjoy it, which is probably fitting since films where the message is the most important thing, such as those of the '50's and '60's, now show their age badly. 
In the final analysis, though, regardless of what elements we pick at, we ultimately can't say why 'Shawshank' is so great.  We just know it is by how we feel and how others feel.Two final examples of the latter.    The moment in Andy's escape when he stands in the sewage lagoon outside the prison and holds his arms up in jubilation as the rain pours on him is always a part of trailers and coming attractions.  Indeed it was part one of the film's original ads.  Why should the filmmakers give away the ending?  Because there is nothing to give away.  One can see the film 100 times knowing Andy will escape and still want to see it, because it isn't about an escape plot.  It's about Andy and Red's journey and what they teach each other.The second example is that the Lifetime Channel, which generally shows either classic 'Chick Flicks' like 'Thelma and Louise,' or made for TV things about unfaithful or homicidal husbands, showed this as their feature presentation one evening and this is a film that really has no women in it at all.Of course, one can argue a 'Chick Flick' is really just a film that values exploration of deep human feelings and relationships more than car chases and explosions.  If that is the case, then 'Shawshank' is the greatest Chick Flick of them all.And I think the Greatest Film Game never fit more than here.",Null,0,0,23 June 2004
