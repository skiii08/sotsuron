Hereditary," good new type! i think that is enough
","The movie 'Hereditary' is a new and wonderful type of horror movies
A good step in the future of horror movies, especially what we see today :(
We can divide the film into two important parts
A tragic drama and a horror one
first let us see the ingredients of the main location 'the house' and thank god it is not an isolated house in the forest :) the good thing of this location that it is big in somehow calm town and this leaves a great space for the director(Ari Aster) to create and make some good tricks.
the characters were really good designed as we see the main 4 are Annie,Peter,Steve and charlie as the plot was full of a wonderful the cast did the same 
the film somehow looks like 'get out' the story starts with the death of Annie's mother funeral and some symbols were shown
Toni Collette and Alex Wolff were incredible maybe this the best acting i see in horror movie after the shining
this was the first experience for Ari aster i think in a horror movie and i think that we will a good young director in this type and i am waiting for his next film
the film had some little problems like the soundtrack and the shortage for horror i need more Ari
 s*** you gave the first part a lot of its requirements and the good flow of the story and finally i got only 20 great minutes are you kidding but at all this a really good unique horror-drama film 
but if he gave the end scene some more time i would be great
i think it deserves 8.5/10",8,11,20,30 August 2018
Mother!," mother!
","Mother is a symbolic deep Controversial film despite its genre, it is not a boring movie on the other side it raises questions and curiosity for the viewer.the plot was very good the tempo of it was getting higher and higher to the peak scene that the director did very well like a master piece going from a room to another
the acting was very good from jennifer and bardem and thier reactions 
harris, and michelle Their performance was terrifying especially michelle pfieffer 
the film was well-directed especially the last 30 min
the script gave mother (jennifer) the space to show herself and she did it
it was a truly great piece of film-making",9,7,12,23 July 2018
