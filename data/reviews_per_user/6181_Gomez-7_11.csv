Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I've seen it a second time...a good albeit flawed addition to the Star Wars universe
","The first time I saw Episode 1, I was uplifted by the incredible action scenes and special effects whilst being constantly annoyed by some of the dialogues and the acting of some of its casts.The second time around..it left more or less the same impression. However, the critically lambasted acting of the cast was more of the result of some badly written dialogue (eg. 'Bye Threepio') and Lucas's uneven directing.Some highlights: - The 'combo' finale of lightstaber duels, space dogfight, ground battle and palace inflitration) will take your breath away. The pod racing scene, whilst exciting, was a bit too long though... - The scenes at Coruscant, in my opinion, are higlights (ie. the Jedi council, the 'incredible' conference scene, with a brief cameo by ET, Palpatine's manipulation of the Queen). - Other highlights include Darth Maul, criminally underused but still one of the coolest character since good ole' Vader. - Portman's portrayal of the queen was quite good, as well as Neeson's and McGregor's.On the downside, the film was 'paced' just like the original ie. slow in spots, especially the sequence at Tatooine. Lucas' overly focus on special effects doesn't really help either. Overall, it's not as good as the original trilogy, but still a good albeit uneven 'summer' flick. (7/10)",7,0,0,6 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Flawed but great fun
","One thing for sure: The Phantom Menace is  not the greatest film of all time...what it is though is a flawed but exciting summer blockbuster with dazzling special effects and thrilling action  sequences.  OK, taken as it is, it has some weaknesses, namely inane dialogue and mediocre acting from some of the world's finest: a consequence of 'placing' special effects in front of the actors. It would surely won a dozen of Oscars on the technical side of things that's for sure. Anyway, I do consider the Phantom Menace as one of the 'best' summer blockbusters in recent years and something which I'll  see a couple of times.  (7.5/10)",7,0,0,10 June 1999
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Made you think of the good ole' days (sigh)
","Raiders of the Lost Ark is a perfect example of a 'blockbuster movie' done right. It has cool stunts, incredible, Oscar winning FX AND...good characterisation; clearly  something that is clearly missing from today's so called 'blockbusters'. (Hellooooo...Lost World, Armageddon,etc.etc) One of Spielberg's finest (9/10)",Null,0,0,5 February 1999
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," 11 years and the f/x still astonish me...
","Who Framed Roger Rabbit will always be recognised as a landmark film, along with the like of Terminator 2, Jurassic Park, the Star Wars Trilogy, etc. It also has elements that current blockbusters seemed to lack...an interesting, somewhat original concept (toons and humans, living together)and an enganging story, which combines noir, thriller and comedic elements. I love the underlying theme (ie.the 'cost of progress') that permeates this film. It's one of those rare gems that kids and adults would enjoy. (8/10)",8,0,0,18 July 1999
The Mummy," Indiana Jones and The Curse of the Pharaohs?...
","Before I begin, let me get this straight..The Mummy by far is not a bad movie, it is pure and unadultered popcorn..nothing more and nothing else. The plot does not hold under much scrutiny and there is no substance whatsoever or any underlying 'messages'. It is an adventure/horror/comedy flick which tries to emulate the Indiana Jones experience with some great special effects. It did not exactly succeed but...hey...it's a good try. It is still a good movie to spend your two hours in. (7/10)",Null,0,0,11 July 1999
Notting Hill," Good, but it's not as brilliant...
","Notting Hill is a delightful comedy which falls a bit short of its potential. It undertook a very similar motif to its 'prequel', Four Wedding and a Funeral with a dash of the 'romance in the spotlight' that was introduced in the American President. Further focus on the 'actual' romance instead of a series of 'brief encounters' would have been great....Alas, it's just another Hollywood style romantic comedy... (*** 1/2 out of *****)",Null,0,0,6 June 1999
Aliens," Still one of the best...
","Aliens is one of those few blockbusters that every action/ sci-fi flicks should look up to. It has three dimensional characters and an excellent story on top of its incredible f/x. It cemented James Cameron as one of the best...and in my opinion, is one of his best work since the Terminator series. For those who have not seen this...take my advice. Save your money from going to the cinemas and watching mediocre blockbusters that are out there such as the Mummy...Rent this flick and enjoy!! (9/10)",9,0,0,24 July 1999
Mission: Impossible," An exercise of style over substance.
","Three things came to mind when I first watched this flick: great action sequences, flashy direction (courtesy of Brian DePalma) and an otherwise impenetrable plot that does not make sense.  Nevertheless, I was gravely disappointed by the true identity of the main villain...C'MON..it's like having Batman as the main villain. Granted, implausible they may be, the film does have the most exciting action sequences in 1996. But I just can't help the feeling that the film is more of an exercise of style over substance than anything else. (7/10)",Null,0,0,5 February 1999
The Matrix," An interesting mix of anime, Hong Kong style film making and sci-fi
","One of the more interesting sci-fi outing in recent years, The Matrix took the best from all different genres, mix them all together and came up with essentially a film which satisfies both the eye and the mind. Enough things to think about afterwards plus astounding visuals, a rare occurrence in this over-saturated genre...Today's so called auteurs should take note that there is a difference between homage and a straight rip- off...The Matrix is a 'homage'....films like Godzilla are a 'rip off'..",Null,0,0,23 May 1999
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The trilogy is still one of the best..
","Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is still one of the best action/ adventure film around. After seeing the Mummy last weekend, I felt the urge to revisit the old classic...and it still has that 'wow' factor. Unlike the F/X fest that is the Mummy..there is actually characters that draws you in. Indy's relationship with his father, interwined with the quest for the Holy grail signify the importance of family and sacrifice, and underlying message within the film. The humble will be rewarded.  Superb action scenes and frenetic pacing, reminiscent to all of Lucasfilm's trilogies are prevalent. This is still one of Spielberg's more successful foray into the genre and something that all blockbuster films should look up to. (9/10)",9,0,0,19 July 1999
Jurassic Park," Hey..I've seen it for the fifth time now and it's still a chiller
","When it first came out in 1993, I had such great expectation of the movie that disappointment was unavoidable. Okay..it has some great special effects but some of the characterisation are two dimensional at best, with plot holes and an abrubt ending that left a lot to be desired.Subsequent viewings (and lower expectations) gave me a more balanced view of the whole experience...Spielberg has apparently trimmed the book, like he did in Jaws, merely to its content. JP is at heart a thrill ride, with some 'philosophical underpinnings'(which were more prevalent in the novel). More or less, JP deserved credit for giving the most astonishing special f/x ever, which surprisingly hold up pretty well with everything that Hollywood has come up with until now. (with the exception of The Phantom Menace...which still failed to 'astonish' as much as JP did.) (8/10)",8,0,1,8 July 1999
