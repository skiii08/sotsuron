Black Swan," Natalie Portman, lost herself in the aura of her own perfection
","Most of us, live our lives, just for the sake of it. Even more than most of us don't even know, what is driving their existence. But there is a minority in us, who actually live for a reason. That reason, can be anything. But when that reason is PASSION, it can transform us. Natalie Portman is just another sweet, pretty , soft ballerina who wants perfection in her passion, and that is the role of Swan Queen. Then, we saw, one of the most powerful leading performances of modern day cinema. There actually was a point, when we are practically floating in the air with Natalie and shedding a tear or two when she sees her mother in the crowd with tears in her eyes. Its very rare, when, you don't really notice the sound track of the movie, don't really care about the direction, or the lighting, or the acting of side actors, or even the movie itself, but the only thing that has captivated you is that one lead actor, who has lost him/herself in their role in such a way that your own emotions are swaying with his. (since ledger's Joker)Brilliant and i will not be surprised one bit, if Natalie Portman takes home the Oscar.10/10",10,2,6,21 December 2010
District 9," Brilliant Cinematography, Marvelous Movie
","I was lucky to get an early BLU RAY of the movie. Although , i was expecting full 1 and a half hours of just Aliens, it proved to be a lot more than that. The story was captivating and the acting was as natural as it could get. I am expecting a serious Oscar nomination for sound effects and cinematography. Not only is this a brilliant blend of Sound Effects and graphics, it also has an emotional theme in it which makes it a complete movie. Its budget might not be as big as that of T:S or Transformers ROTF, but in my opinion, its miles better than both of them Highly recommended. I am giving it a 9 and i expect it to move further up in the IMDb top 250. ONLY 2nd, worth your time movie , this year. (after PUBLIC ENEMIES)",9,2,5,19 November 2009
Paranormal Activity," the HYPE................is in fact TRUE.......
","First of all, the movie is a ride, which takes you places. Places of your deepest emotions, from heart racing n pulse jumping to actually looking around your sitting area, time n again. Movie is a master piece.Master Piece in the sense that i have spent my adult life, laughing at every next horror movie, just like you guys. Some due to the terrible music, some due to laughable faces, some due to anemic girls climbing out of wells ...But after a decade or so, finally there is a movie, which actually gave me the creeps. I said it before n i say it again, when the vision of a director is coming out of his own life, or his experiences, he makes something special. Oren peli actually did portrayed, that with that little a budget , if you know what will actually move your audience, you can do a better job than the normal, who put horrific make ups and gore in every other scene.highly recommended....the fact that i wont be sleeping tonight....not at least in my bedroom.....and nothing ever did this to me.....I am giving it a solid 9..",10,0,4,30 October 2009
Rockstar," Nargis Fakhri ruined what could have been an Epic !
","I just finished watching the movie the 4th time in a month. Just because i am an intense person and i like intensity in life. i loved the movie because of Ranbir's portrayal of intensity. Ranbir is brilliant. no words for his praise. Music is outclass. Direction and editing is wonderfulBUT .....Imtiaz, the director, chose the absolute worst option for the lead female. The intensity in the female role was nearly as important as the male one. there was a lot of room for emotion and acting. but Nargis Fakhri ruined it. she can not act. she is horrific. In scenes where everything is intense, Ranbir is on his peak of emotions, music is outclass, this young lady will make you laugh. She has ruined every scene she has been in the movie. She should never be allowed to act in front of the camera after this. She is better of a model.Had it been any good actress, (and there are plenty) who should have complemented Ranbir, the movie would have been even better and much more popular than it is now..8/10..*continues to shake his head*",9,4,5,24 January 2012
