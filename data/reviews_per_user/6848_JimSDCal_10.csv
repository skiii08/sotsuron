Frost_Nixon," An Oscar worthy movie
","Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) was the most corrupt President in US history and was forced to resign before he was tossed out of office by the US Congress. Because he resigned and was pardoned for any possible criminal offense by President Ford, Nixon was never officially questioned for any of his possible crimes. David Frost (Michael Sheen) noted there was a hunger in the US to have Nixon question about his improprieties and convinced the disgraced former President to agree to a 4-part interview, 1/4 of which would be questioning about the Watergate scandal. The best scene in this film occurs not during Frost's questioning but when a drunk Nixon calls Frost in the night before his Watergate interview. Nixon delivers a drunken rant which reveals the type of personality he truly had. He rails at the elite institutions of the nation which never fully accepted him as an equal and informs Frost that he sees their interviews as a battle between two men, only one of which could be the winner. This is one of Ron Howard's best movies, it is the equal of 'Apollo 13' and 'A Beautiful Mind' and should be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. It gets a grade of 'A' and a very strong recommendation.",10,4,7,12 January 2009
Batman Returns," A good movie with 2 very good villains
","'Batman Returns' is the last good movie in the original 4 part series. It is not as good as 'Batman', because Jack Nicholson's Joker is better than either the Penguin (Danny DeVito) or Catwoman (Michelle Pheiffer). Christopher Walken is very good as Catwoman's abusive boss, who is partially responsible for her transformation from meek office worker to villainess.Another reason 'Batman Returns' is the last good movie of the original 4 is because Michael Keaton is so good in his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman. He captures the darkness in Batman's personality without being somber. Neither Val Kilmer, or especially George Clooney (I think Joel Schumacher is largely to blame) every really captured the spirit of Batman. Clooney is almost a parody of Batman.I try not to comment much on the plot of movies, because I don't want to ruin the story for anyone, but this movie is well worth watching, and while not a classic, it is a very good super-hero saga.",8,0,0,20 December 2005
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," A great film about a fight for freedom
","This film is one of Hollywood's great films about an individual's fight to find freedom in an oppressive environment. Randall MacMurphy (Jack Nicholson 1975's Best Actor) is a prison convict judged to possibly be mentally ill and sent for evaluation to a mental hospital in 1960s Oregon. In the hospital he is under the 'care' of Nurse Ratchett (Louis Fletcher in an Oscar-winning role) who is cold and unsympathetic to MacMurphy and all the other inmates. She desires order and obedience from the men in her charge. This immediately sets MacMurphy and Ratchett at odds as MacMurphy is not about to be anyone's lackey.MacMurphy demonstrates his desire for freedom and individuality in many ways . He gets Ratchett to OK a vote to decide if the inmates will be able to alter their strict work schedule and watch the World Series. MacMurphy thinks he has won when all the cognizant inmates vote to watch the game. But Ratchett stifles Randall's bid when she insists on counting the catatonic members of 'the group' as 'No' votes so MacMurphy is frustrated in his effort.MacMurphy desires to prove to his minders that he is mentally ill and should not be sent back to prison, so he escapes from the hospital with Cheswick, Taygor, Harding, Martinia and others and absconds with a charter boat so the men can go fishing. This effort surely puts Randal in hot water with hospital officials, but it accomplishes MacMurphy's goal of being kept in the mental hospital. What he does not know and no one told him is as an involuntary committed man, MacMurphy, unlike most of the other men in the hospital, who are voluntarily in the hospital, MacMurphy can be held as long as the hospital officials desire.MacMurphy and Ratchett are at odds throughout this movie. This film shows the down-side of this country'r mental health system where under-paid and overly officious health workers like Ratchett can use their power to abuse those supposedly in their care. This is shown best in Ratchett's treatment of teenager Billy (Brad Dourff) whom Ratchett controls by threatening to tell his mother of Billy's encounter with a woman MacMurphy brings into the hospital, at night, for a party. Billy is terrified that his mother will find out that he was with a woman, and Ratchett knows this, but nevertheless makes the threat to him.There are vociferous critics int the United States of the psychiatric profession and of the use of medication to control the freedom of mental patients, the Church of Scientology being the most prominent. I don't agree with the critics' point of view, but this movie, in which several people are hurt in the oppressive mental hospital strengthens the case of those who dislike the mental health system in this country. This movie does a great job of showing MacMurphy's fight against oppression, to remain an individual in a totalitarian system, so I grade this film as earning 9 points out of 10. This film is deservedly among the top 100 ever according to the AFI and I encourage everyone, especially Jack Nicholson fans to watch it if they get the chance.",9,1,3,15 July 2007
The Reader," Not Oscar worthy
","'The Reader' directed by Oscar-nominated director Stephen Daldry should not have been the 5th film to earn an Oscar-nomination as Best Picture. That honor should have gone to 'Doubt' or 'The Dark Knight'. But, Holocaust-themed pictures are popular with the Academy so this film was nominated. However, this is not a great movie like 'Schindler's List' but only very-good, like 'The Pianist'Michael is a high-schooler in West Germany in the mid-50s when he is afflicted with scarlet fever. When he gets sick on the streets, Hannah (the very good Kate Winslet) comes to his aid. After months of convalescense, he goes to Hannah's house to thank her for her assistance and soon the pair starts a romance. It mostly consists of Michael's reading literary classics to Hannah and then sex. This tryst lasts a few months and then peters out.Almost a decade later, Michael is a law student and as part of a seminar on the legal ramifications of the Holocaust he attends a trial of several women charged with war-related crimes. Michael is very surprised to see Hannah on trial and has crucial evidence about her possible complicity. He must decide whether or not to bring it up.I like this film but do not feel it to be one of the year's 5 best. So it gets a grade of 8 and a positive recommendation. But, do not expect a truly great movie when going to see this film.",8,2,5,30 January 2009
The Wrestler," A very good movie
","This is easily one of the top movies of 2008. In a comeback role, Mickey Rourke gives an award-worthy performance as a fading wrestler, Randy 'The Ram' Robinson who has a very shaky relationship with his daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood) and a tenuous relationship with a stripper, 'Cassidy', played by a very good Marisa Tomei. Randy has health problems, he suffers a heart attack after one performance and wants to get out of the wrestling game altogether. But it is from his loyal fans that Randy gets his only committed emotional support.This movie was named by At the Movies Ben Manckiewicz as the best film of 2008 and while that may be a bit much this film is one of the year's finest. It tells the story of a man unable due to circumstances to move beyond his 1980s glory and as he is no longer young he can no longer perform as he once did. He wants a relationship with both his daughter Stephanie and 'Cassidy' (Tomei's stripper name) but neither woman can commit to him how he would like. So, Randy continues to do the one thing he knows and loves, wrestling, even so doing so puts his health at great risk. This is an excellent film so it gets a grade of A- and a very strong recommendation.",9,0,0,27 January 2009
Music and Lyrics," A decent romantic comedy
","Alex Fletcher (Hugh Grant) is the washed-up former member of a 1980s WHAM! like group called POP. Alex is well past his heyday and is reduced to reproducing his past glories at reunions and amusement parks. Out of the blue he is asked to write a song for a current pop star who is a fan of his past work. Serendiptiously, Alex, who does not write lyrics, finds a collaborator in Sophie Fisher (Drew Barrymore) who is a natural lyricist.Most of this movie is fairly predictable. Alex and Sophie find romance as they work on their song and then face difficulty as Sophie objects to being asked to commercialize her work while Alex, who is very grateful for his second chance, takes the request as merely being about business and is fully prepared to bastardize his effort.This movie is only pretty good, Grant and Barrymore share a good chemistry but the material is only average and proceeds in a manner that is totally predictable and done better in other romantic comedies. So, this movie gets a grade of B- and a moderate recommendation. Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore fans will like it but the average fan might not like the expense of renting it.",7,0,0,25 January 2009
Munich," An intelligent film
","'Munich' is not Steven Spielberg's masterpiece; that would still be 'Schindler's List'. But, it is Spielberg's most intelligent film. Without providing answers, Spielberg accomplishes what most great artist do, uses his art to make his viewers consider the real world. In this case that is by posing the question, 'what is the most effective way to deal with terrorism?' There are two basic choices, avenge terrorism with violence against its perpetrators, hoping it will deter future acts or accept that violence begets more violence and vengeance merely further fuels the anger that spurs terrorism. These questions are mostly posed in the last 45 minutes of 'Munich', the first hour and 45 minutes is a very good thriller.The movie starts with the terrorist attack at the Munich Olympics of 1972. Israeli PM Golda Meier decides on the first tack in responding to the terrorism, saying at times a nation must compromise its values and that Israel must appear strong before the world. Avner (Eric Bana) is recruited to lead the team that is assigned to locate and kill the 11 leaders of Black September that planned the attack on Israel's athletes. Avner is provided with a team of 5 with various skills, such as bomb-making, clean up and documentation. The team starts upon its mission and begins to kill the terrorists. (not said, but note-worthy is in appearance the Palestinians killed all appear to be middle-class, middle-aged men. It is possible by killing these people, Israel inadvertently allowed younger, more radical and violent men to take their place).It is after about 1 hour and 45 minutes that the movie changes from mostly straight-forward thriller to questioning the effect of the killing. Various men of Avner's team have various reactions to participating in killing others. Then, having attracted attention, members of Avner's team start to be killed. Avner becomes almost paranoid about his own safety. By film's end, Avner fantasizes that he is both a member of the Black September attack and a member of the doomed Olympic team.Spielberg also portrays both Israeli and Palestinians as defending their actions due to their desire to have a home. This is a familiar Spielberg team. The unanswered question, which having seen the film one must consider is: What do you do when 2 people want the same home. Can they ever reconcile these desires and find a way to live in peace? The Cold War, South Africa and, hopefully, Norhtern Ireland found peaceful resolutions, maybe one day this can also happen in the Middle East.",9,15,32,27 December 2005
300," A Pppular but not very good movie
","'300' is a popular movie but not a very good one. There is little plot and a lot of violence. It tells the story, not well, of 300 Spartans who battled hordes of Persians seeking to destroy them and to te Greece. It is not so much the violence I object to, I really like 'Braveheart' and the 'LOTR' movies, but the fact that there is lo little drama in recounting the Spartans story.Spartans, the movie informs its audience, were trained to be warriors from an early age. They are constantly drilled and tested so by the time they reach maturity they are able to encounter any foe with a good chance of being victorious in the encounter. Leonidas (Gerard Butler) is the king of Sparta and like other Spartans was trained to be a soldier and to never give in to his enemies demands. This training is put to the test when King Xerses of Persia comes to Greece intending to conquer the nation-states of that region. Xerses' forces vastly outnumber the Spartans and is certain, because of his superior numbers, to defeat the Spartans in battle, no matter how valiantly the Spartans fight. But the king of Persia turns out to admire Sparta's warrior mentality and all he demands of Leonidas is that he kneel before him, acknowledge him as his God and let Persia control Greece. But, this Leonidas will not do and he recruits the 300 best Spartan warriors to got to war against Persia. After this development, the movie is filled with battle scenes and mayhem as the 300 heroically oppose the vast Persian army.So, with very little plot development behind it, the movie moves on to several very graphic battle sequences as the audience sees Spartans stab, impale, sever and behead their opponents. For a while it seems the Spartans are going to make the cost of victory so high that the Persians might give in. But, in a sub-plot a hunchback, whom Leonidas would not let fight with the 300, turns traitor and the Spartans are outflanked, leading to their doom. This sub-plot, like the one involving the Spartan queen and a council member only slightly ups the dramatic ante as both are very predictable in their outcomes.Some people might be squeamish about the graphic violence of this depiction of a graphic novel by Frank Miller. But the battle sequences are the best thing about this movie. The action is almost all done with CGI as actors fight scenes that were filmed in front of 'green screen' with backgrounds later added digitally by computer whizzes. It all seems very realistic and it is hard to tell what action is computer enhanced. But good CGI effects lacking a compelling story is a hollow victory for the movie's makers. I get the point that Spartans were warriors, more than willing to die to defend their nation. But this is a thin reed to base a 1 3/4 hour movie. I like the action of this film but not the story so I grade it 6 points out of 10.",6,1,6,17 March 2007
Slumdog Millionaire," A great movie
","This movie is rightly considered the front-runner for this year's Best Picture. It is easily the year's best and one of the best of the whole decade. It is directed by Danny Boyle, who should win the year's Best Director Oscar, and is about a young man, Jamal Malik (Dev Patel, who should have been Oscar-nominated) who is a contestant on India's version of 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'. Jamal does very well on the questions of the show, which are very difficult, and the police believe to have gotten so many questions right, Jamal must have cheated.But in telling the story of his life, amidst grinding poverty and oppression, Jamal tells how he was able to know the answers to the questions that were posed to him. Jamal's story is mainly about how he combated his dire circumstances with his brother Salim and how he has always loved a young girl named Latika. In fact Jamal went on the game show hoping Latika would see it and that the two might be reunited after years of separation.I went to this film expecting a lot and was surprised to see that it was better than I hoped for. It tells an uplifting story and mixes gritty drama, of how Jamal used his wits and courage to get by in a world designed to grind him down as he is only a 'slumdog', with romance as Jamal never forgets Latika and only dreams that against all odds that the pair can get back together. So, this film gets a grade of 10 and the highest possible recommendation.",10,0,2,30 January 2009
Valkyrie," A very good movie
","I am always surprised to learn how little I know. I knew there were murder plots against Adolf Hitler during WW II, but I did not know that there were large conspiracies against the evil dictator and that there was an attempted coup after Von Stauffenberg's (Tom Cruise) attempt to kill the Nazi leader. This is a good movie and like with 'All The President's Men' and 'Apollo 13', knowing the result of the action before seeing it did not diminish my enjoyment. Cruise and cast do not employ German accents (a few actors like Tom Wilkinson sport British accents) but they are believable as WW II era German officers. The best thing about this fine picture occurs after the bomb attempt when Von Stauffenberg and his colleagues attempt to pull off a coup and topple the Nazi regime before it destroys all of Germany. I give this movie a grade of 'A-' and a strong recommendation.",Null,1,3,2 January 2009
