The Blair Witch Project," A Complete Waste of Time!
","The Blair Witch Project is for those who do not like to think. Any true horror fan will be let down by this complete piece of garbage. For one: Don't bother seeing this in the theater, it's completely filmed in 16MM and has no widescreen ratio. Secondly, the acting is truly the worst I've ever seen. Lastly, the film is about as scary as Disney's 'Watcher in the Woods!' Filled with nothing but profanity, this film offers little else. I was in line with the rest at the movie theater demanded my money back, thank GOD I got it.",1,1,3,27 August 1999
