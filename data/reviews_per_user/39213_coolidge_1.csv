The Blair Witch Project," A good concept lacking in the execution, few scares.
","Blair Witch was a good concept and overall does credit to those involved, but it suffers because the factors which make it unique and original at times also detract from it. It is perhaps a double-edged sword, but it could have been better without sacrificing the good points. The un-steadycam was a little too shaky, the hysteria a little overplayed, the camera work in general could have been better without spoiling the whole 'reality' concept. Beyond this, a little more effort on the sound effects and a few more good scares would have made it so much the better.In the end, full credit to those involved for what they did with what they had, unfortunately to me Blair Witch is yet another movie that suffers under the weight of its own hype. I'm afraid the whole 'true story' concept failed to capture my imagination. I have found two schools of thought on the movie, those who were terrified and those who were fairly unimpressed. Like all movies, you have to see it to find out the truth for yourself.",5,0,2,12 January 2000
