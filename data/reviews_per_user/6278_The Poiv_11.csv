Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Nice movie...
","The best is the fightscene with Darth Maul. They really kick ass, multiply. Extremly good movie. The alliance between Darth Sidious and those green guys is good, all the action is as good, and the politics of the jedi council is very good. Finally you get to see these things. The best of it all though, is the ending of the film: They ask themselves who this Darth Sidious is and the picture floats in over Senator Palpatine. You just shrivel. ++++ 1/2.",Null,0,0,10 December 1999
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Where? Why? How?
","Well, first of all, i should say that I gave The Holy Grail, Meaning of Life and The Hollywood Bowl 9 points on the IMDb. This got an eight. Not a masterpiece like the others but not far from it. Some scenes is HILARIUS!Hilarius scenes: The Spelling Lecture, The Stonethrowing, The Aliens, Biggus Dickus, Pilatus Speech To The Crowd, and, not to forget the best Python songs of them all, Always Look At The Bright Side Of Life. Everytime I hear it, you just go gay and happy. ***** of *****",8,0,4,24 August 2000
Fight Club," David Fincher is Tyler Durden!!
","*HEY, THIS HAS SOME SPOILERS IN IT* *SO SPOILERWARNING*I liked Fight Club as much as everybody else. But what really took me to give it a ten, was not the movie itself, it was Mr. Finchers very smart inmoviejokes.When Tyler Durden is presented, you get to know that he works as a waiter and a cinemaprojector dude. He lapses in a small piece of porn into the childrens movies. Well... little did I know that the devilishly Mr. Fincher did the same...At the end of the movie when Ed Norton and Helena Bonham Carter hugs and watches the Armageddon of the creditcardscompany, suddenly the movie flicks! Was that what I think it was? Push the pause button repeadately when the movie starts to pan out and you´ll see it. A slice of nuditity... It's only going to last one press of the pausebutton so take care.Another thing is when Ed Norton talks to some of his groupleaders - press the pausebutton and Tyler Durden will stand there hugging him for a half a second!Hey, if anyone finds anymore tell me. Damn Good movie!",Null,0,1,13 September 2001
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Well... not midevil but midterrain perhaps?
",This wasn't any great sequel. The first movie is much better. Though some good scenes and some scares it won't get more than +++Fun facts: Peter Stormare (the thug that get's killed by the little nasty dinosours) swears in swedish when getting killed.,Null,0,0,30 April 2000
Dumb and Dumber," Best film I have ever seen.
","I first went to see Dumb and Dumber, when it came to the cinemas, and brought my entire family along. I had already seen Jim Carrey in the Mask, and Ace Ventura, and loved him in those films. The review of the film was quite good, so I looked forward to this. My father wondered if it really was a movie in his taste... and then the movie started. I have never in my movie infested life had such a journey as I did that day. The atmosphere in the theathre was amazing. From the first moment (when you see Jim Carrey ask a lady about the way) to the final moment (the two dimwits walks away on the freeway), I cried of laughter. So did every member of my family. And every soul in that theathre. The humor was low, witty, crazy and, yes, dumb! This movie is on my top ten list and has deserved it ten times a round.Don't miss the following scenes: the Toilett scene, the beerdrinking scene, the one where Jim pours poop-potion in Jeff Daniels coffee (the result is seen in the toilett scene), and the final scene when the goofballs turns down an offering to become oilrubbers for beatiful models. Love this movie!! 11/10, simply",10,0,0,10 May 2000
Dumb and Dumber," My stomach hurts, my legs are shaking, and my mouth goes like a automatic gun: I´m dying of laughter.
","First time I went to the cinema and watch this, I had the luck of coming to the premiere - which makes it´s part to the cake. I was in good company since everyone (and I mean everyone) Laughed uncontrolled through the whole piece. It was an experience unforgettable to mankind.First things, first: I LOVE Jim Carrey!!! That´s why I went to see the movie in the first place. And I must say, it´s his best movie ever! So be sure not to miss this jewel.Best scenes: 'The camel', 'The Dreaming', 'The Toilet and the ass', 'Playing in the snow' and 'The snowowl'.What to say? I LIKE IT A LOT! 10 of 10 or ++++ of ++++.",10,0,2,5 August 1999
The Truman Show," 'I here now proclames this planet Trumania in the Burbanks galaxy...'
","Jahoo! Its not often you get to see a film that touches you in the melankolic part of your heart but here´s one that does.The Truman Show is one of my top ten movies of all time; why? Well, because its got all those elements that keeps you going: Fun, sad, and a guy in a fake world.Carrey's my favorite, no doubt about it. Rates 10 of 10 or ++++ of ++++.",10,0,0,5 August 1999
The Matrix," Thrilling, stunning effects that just wont stop!
","Well, so I went and saw the Matrix. I prepared for a dose of action and jokes that is the normal outcome of a normal US movie.  I got that.  But, to my surprise (and joy) there was some other stuff in the movie?  Effects, plot, script and more effects...The effects strictly dominate the movie (how about Keanu Reeves flying as superman and stopping bullets with his hands) but there is some real action too.  Still, the plot is similar to Terminator - but is much better.So the outcome of it: Massive, action spawned movie with effects that'll get you to believe you've landed on Mars with a pair of 3D glasses.  Good fun. Rates 9/10 or +++ 1/2 of ++++.",9,0,0,16 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The best film ever!
","Script, actors, setting... All great. I am a Star Wars fan, no doubt about it. I get tears in my soaking eyes about every time I see it again, but I cant help it.  What is there to say about the best film ever? Darth Vader rules! 10/10 or ++++ of ++++.",10,0,0,16 July 1999
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," The Pythons pestering of the Arthur saga: Brilliant.
","Monty Python is one of my favorites, least to say. And this is actually their best movie. Gags and spoofs are hilarious (check out my favorite scene with the black knight) with scenes like: 'The Killer Rabbit', 'God', 'The Frenchmens fort' and 'The bridgekeeper'. Can it be any better? Yes, sadly to say. The ending is lousy . We didnÂ´t even get to see the grail (except when God is showing off). Score? +++ 1/2 off ++++, or 9.",9,0,0,5 August 1999
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," If you cross a parakee with a lumberjacker you get great Python - just as this is!
","Wooooh! is all that comes to mind when the credits roll down. First of all, I must calm down and let my poor senses return to the everyday - boring! - life, and while doing that, give off a broad smile.Okay, it's a good experience, this movie, and everybody with a slight sense of humor should go see it immediately. Not all is fun, but you already knew that didn't you?Well, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Graham Chapman, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam and the rest in the Monty Python gang is my all-time favorite tv-program of all times, and in their first 'real' movie they score.There isn't much use of telling the plot, since youv'e already read it (They embark on a quest for the holy grail), yeah, that's it! But what they encounter on their way towards the grail is a pure hoot.No one will forget the magically scenes; The Black Knight, The Killer Rabbit, The Bridgekeeper, The Knight's Who Say 'Ni', The Sorceror, Sir Lancelot's Brave Rescue, The Castle Of Horny Ladies, The Castle Of The Frenchmen and The Giant.Let me sum it up: SEE IT! ***** of *****",9,0,0,24 August 2000
