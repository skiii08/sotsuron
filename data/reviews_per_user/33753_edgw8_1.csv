The Benchwarmers," you know what to expect
","I love senseless comedies like this. So the first thing I would say is if you don't then don't go and see this. But at the same time I hated Napoleon Dynamite, because I felt that that just went way to far in the direction of stupid comedy. So I was skeptical when i saw that Napoleon was going to be in this movie, but his character was much stronger in Benchwarmers. Rob Schneider was another actor that worried me. I can't say I have ever been a big fan of his movies where he simply plays a girl, or a male prostitute, or something else stupid. In this, however, he has a more believable role yet still succeeds in making you laugh. Because this movie was directed by Adam Sandler you can expect classic comedy much like Happy Gilmore or Billy Madison. If you're in the mood for a good laugh, and you aren't going to try and critique acting and/or plot then you will have a great time.",8,0,0,12 May 2006
