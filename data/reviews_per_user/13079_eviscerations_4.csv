Skyfall," average at best
","i'm old enough to have seen all of the bond movies - minus the first few - as they've been released. i would say that at least up until casino royale that they'd followed a similar path in their setup/plot/etc, however this film is basically a step in the other direction for the franchise.i didn't find it particularly good. when you compare it to other bond films of the last 15 years, it's definitely one of the 'poorer' films.daniel craig is good as usual, but the storyline itself is just meh. the only instance of cool bond gadgets is like a 10 second cut of the car doing it's thing near the end, and it's just parked there - no fancy chase scene or anything to lure you in.overall, i'm pretty disappointed by this movie. save your twelve bucks and wait for it to come out on DVD. IMHO.",5,11,24,14 November 2012
Oblivion," this movie was better when it was called the matrix
","obviously many of these ideas are ripped off from other screenplays/IPs. this movie is 50% the matrix trilogy, and 50% insert random dystopian flick.i have a real hard time taking anything tom cruise does seriously, given his association with scientology.his performance - IMHO - detracts from the highlights of the script and supporting cast. would've been better with someone else having the lead.if you liked the matrix, i'd suggest not watching this, because this is a poorly re-written variation of that.",6,2,4,29 April 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," cinematic equivalent of toilet paper
","this 'movie' is terrible. the story is congested - as if trying to cram aspects of the previous 3 spider-man films into 1, newer and incredibly mediocre retooling. peter parker is suddenly a super smart Ã¼ber nerd with math skills that rival professional geneticists? and a tough guy skateboarding hipster? really? well, i have a bridge i'd like to sell you...there went 2 hours of my life i desperately want back.this cinematic suppository is not worth your money, at least certainly not in theaters. personally, i'd rather watch paint dry.if you really want to watch this steaming pile of garbage, wait for the DVD release. something tells me it won't be in theaters for long.",1,28,69,13 July 2012
Zero Dark Thirty," very over-hyped, doesn't deserve the accolades
","other reviews i have read have stated that argo was better. it is.the acting, particularly that of the lead, in this steaming pile that has been nominated for so many awards is terrible at best.i tried to pay attention to the details while watching this, taking into account all of the press coverage that the film received - you know, all that crap about torture and blah blah blah. i really didn't find anything about this film to be 'great'. not the acting, not the writing, not the cinematography, not the cast, not the soundtrack. nothing.it's pretty obvious that typical Hollywood types want to latch onto this and shower it with praise, when there are better films that deserve the attention.frankly speaking, i've taken dumps that were more enjoyable.i can only hope that this ends up on DVD sooner than later, so as none of you have to suffer the 14$ admittance fee to lose the 2.5 hours of your life this movie just cost me.save your time and your $, and wait until you can get it at a red box or something.indeed, argo was much better.",5,22,45,14 January 2013
