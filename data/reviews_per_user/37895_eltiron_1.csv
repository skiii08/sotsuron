Moneyball," Most deserved Academy Award
","Okay, I'm european, so baseball doesn't mean anything to me. But I love sport films, and this is one of the finest one. The acting is incredible, script is awesome, and we can see Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill... I don't know. Acting together? The chemistry between the two guys is awesome. It's not like they playing, they live their roles. Huge kudos to these guys, and don't forget Kerris Dorsey and the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Huge favourite.",9,0,0,25 April 2020
