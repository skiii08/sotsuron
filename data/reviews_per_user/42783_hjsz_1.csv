Requiem for a Dream," Drugs
","This is a very upsetting movie.  You should know this before you rent it! BE WARNED!!!!!!!! Requiem for a Dream is about the toll that drugs takes of people's bodies and lives.  It focuses on a family, mother and son, and where drugs leads them. It is though a bit exaggerated, very honest, if that makes any sense.  I suppose it was very well done, and it was, but it is very hard to take. This is not a light fun movie to watch with your friends on a Saturday night, be warned!",1,3,11,5 August 2002
