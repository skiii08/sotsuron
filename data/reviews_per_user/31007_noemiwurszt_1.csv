Walk the Line," For me it is the best film I have ever seen.
","Excellent!!! That is one word that describes the whole film. The actors and the director did a magnificent job. Joaquin was incredible and he played Johnny perfectly, he even looked like him and made the same facial expressions, I think it's ridiculous that he did not get an Oscar for this . Reese was beautiful and delicate and very heart warming. The chemistry between them was sizzling. Its everything a film should be. I don't know what else to say. Truly amazing and something you never forget. Touching, moving and engaging. Loved every second of it. I never expected it to be this good and it's a shame that film's like that aren't being made so much any more. Thank you",10,0,0,3 October 2010
