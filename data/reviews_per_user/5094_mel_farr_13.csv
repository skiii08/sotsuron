Requiem for a Dream," Yet another pathetic attempt to glorify drug abuse!
","This movie follows in the long history of movies such as: Reefer Madness, Assassin of Youth, and Star Wars which attempts to glorify drug use by painting it's users and the long term effects in a positive light. This movie is disturbing and disgraceful in the way it seems to suggest to impressionable young minds that if you do drugs you will be cool.  The movie stars Judd Nelson as a young man who can't seem to get along with his mother. He begins shooting heroin and suddenly they have something in common vso she gives him her tv. When he watches tv he sees Patrick Dempsey and Lil' Bow Wow and wants to be just like them. Soon he is an actor and hollywood with a nice haircut, all thanks to heroin. The mother meanwhile has always been doing heroin, but decides that her life will be even better if she begins popping pills. She does, and soon she is young, think and sexy enough that she can go on a game show and win. The  message here is that: drugs make you smarter, sexier, more successful. Judd Nelson's girlfriend, Jennifer Lopez, does less drugs then him, but she likes pot. So she leaves him to go get stoned with a mathematician. They smoke and then do important secret work for the government. Again we get the message: drugs make you smarter & more successful. Finally Judd's friend, played by Damon Wayans smokes cigarettes, then dresses up as a clown who is also a detective. He is really good at busting people by nocking them out with a sock and shouting 'homie don't play croquet!' Again, same message: drugs make you successful!'Youth of America: This movie is a lie. Drugs are not cool. Do not think for a minute that if you do heroin you will end up rich and famous like the people in Requiem for A Dream! If you do heroin you will end up face down in the dirt with charlie firing his ak-47 up your a** like in full metal jacket.2.43/10",9,0,1,24 December 2002
The Big Lebowski," A triumph of cinematic style and the Coen Brother's best effort.
","Many people have commented on this movie, so rather than review it in the typical fashion I will simply make some points that I feel are of interest:1. The Coen's are cinematic genuiuses. When watching this film, realize that everything in it is done for a reason. With that in mind you might realize what a masterwork this film is.2. Long have I lamented the fact that every stoner comedy ever made has looked like it was made by stoners. So many movies involving potheads are idiotic and unrealistic. Finally, here is a movie that accurately portrays drug use, it's effects and does not underestimate the intelligence of the viewer. Call it the intelligent stoner comedy.3. Set in the early 90s, this movie was made in the mid 90s sparking the obvious question: why set a movie only a few years back? Because for the Coen's it is a launching pad for cinematic brilliance.4. The Maude character is great. I think she intimidates a lot of us men, but it really is nice to throw a deconstructionist-feminist in there.5. Philosophically speaking, this movie really touches some bases. Example: When the police officer calls the Dude a loser and the Dude replies 'well, that's like, just your opinion, man?' Is morality simply an opinion? Does with authority come the right to pass judgement on others? To what extent? These and other questions are raised, although perhaps not solved in this fine work of art.10/10",10,0,1,5 December 2002
Akira," I'm speechless.
","Ahh, the elusive 10/10 (aka 5/5 or 4 stars etc) given to something typically for being perfect. But what about something flawed at times, but yet so transcendently glorious at other moments that it seems to deserve the 10 as well. If a case can be made for the later (and I do think it can) then the extant corpus of Catullus and AKIRA certainly fall into that category.This movie was often breathtakingly brilliant and beautiful. It also portrayed it's themes in a sort of muddled vague sense..go figure. At first I thought meaning was lost in the translation. But look at a film like mononoke. Nothing lost there. Anyhow. I was moved. But maybe I'm a sucker for sci-fi.What.",9,0,1,15 March 2003
10 Things I Hate About You," Fun with Dates!
","Come round, come round all ye' princes and Barons of the Colonial Manor for a tale twice told is one none-too old!If you enjoy such anachronistic witticisms along with a hip high-school setting, than perhaps 10 things I hate about you is the film to see! WHo does not love updates of the classic William Shakepeare play Oedipus Rex, where Caliban, falls in love with the lead singer of journey. All is well in the Kingdom of San Francisco, until he is told (dishonestly) by that scoundrel Nero (played brilliantly by Hugh Grant) that the lead singer of journey is his mother. Fearing incest (and bigamy!) he takes up with Mr. Big (from Sex & The City) in Big's north-east side condo.That's the shakespeare story, the movie is a little different. Julia Stiles stars is the older sister of Laris Oleynik, even though they were only born 5 weeks apart. Her on-screen romance with Heath Ledger sizzles, but in real life she dated Joseph Gordon Levitt!! Why god why! I am not the self-pitying male type who every time he sees a cute girl with some doofy guy wonders what went wrong but this is really ridiculous. Joseph Gordon Levitt is like a step down from Brad on Home Improvement. Ok 'whatever, Garrett' I don't think it's such a big deal except that if I see one more teacher rap shakespeare, I'm not going to stop until I hear rappers writing plays. Do you hear me Ice Doggie Stylez?This movie features an excellent scene of Larisa's best friend Chastity (played by the ever-perspecacious Gabrielle Union) logging onto the internet so she can spy on her crush, Mr. Stratford. Weird, sure but in this kind of movie, you can't take yourself to seriously, or you will end up like Kat, all feminist and stuff. I mean I believe women should have equal rights and all, but don't you think asking to be taken seriously is a little too much?8/10",Null,0,0,29 June 2003
LÃ©on: The Professional," Ludicrous & ridiculous effort from Besson
","How is this movie in the top 100, let alone the top 250?I will answer my own question and say that apprently most filmgoers do not find the idea of a 'perfect assassin' turning out to be a good guardian ludicrous.On one hand we have 'Leon' the 'perfect assassin.' An assassin is someone who kills people for aliving. This is not a nice, responsible adult. Portraying him as a supportive caregiver is insane. Why would he ever take in a 12 year old girl? Because he's lonely? Don't you think this would get in the way of his work? I like the scene where he tells her not to smoke cigarettes. This guy kills people but he's got a problem with cigarettes.I also like the cliched portrayal of his two-faced boss. That's original.Or how about Gary Oldham as a psycho d.e.a. agent...don't get me wrong I think the government is full of psychos, but really would a complete raving psychopath get this far up in the political machinery? I kind of doubt it. His outbursts have to be bad for p.r. And then we come to Natalie Portman's character. A 12 year old orphan thinks it'd be a good idea to move in with an assassin? I guess her parents never told her not to talk to strangers. And then she's going to become an assassin? If your parents had just gotten killed by people you don't even know, would you want to move in with an assassin and become one? Doesn't she have relatives? This film is completely ridiculous. What is even more unbelieveable is that so many of you liked it.2/10",2,25,61,10 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A worthy epic successor
","I anticipated this film like none other, and was not disappointed. I believe the LoTR trilogy to be the greatest of all time and of course this movie was brilliant in all of the same ways that the first one was. In this review I will not list all of the good things about this film because there are too many, although the adapion of Gollum was breathtaking and wonderful. That said, I did have some complaints.1) In my opinion the battle scenes were not as cool as they could have been: too much hacking and slashing not enough impressive feats of strength and dexterity.2) Gimli was turned into a walking punchline. While it was very funny and provided moments of comic relief, I think he should really be more of a badass than a comedian.3) Distorting the book. I know this is bound to happen but Jackson did it less in the first movie.That said, it was an incredible experience seeing this movie. Not a perfect masterpiece (like the first one) but an absolutely worthy successor.8/10",8,1,3,18 December 2002
Empire Records," A happy medium between sweet and excellent
","Not since Frederich Nietzsche proclaimed 'God is Dead' have the petty bourgeoise in German/central-Europe felt so much fear and trembling. Folks nihilism is nothing to frightened of...and this movie is a perfect example. When Rory Cochrane says 'I wish that I was born blind so that I could look upon your face but once and spit in the wrong direction' you know that it ain't no jive talking. Everyone else is excellent. When I comb my hair it creates a natural pompadour similar to Rex Manning, who has a sort of priggish charm. Pat Nebetar reprises her role as Pat Benetar while the rest of the cast fawns nervoulsly and Liv Tyler looks good. True that.9/10 An excellent film.",9,0,1,8 December 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Surpassed Expectations or Disgusted Patrons?
","What is going on with this movie? Honestly, I'm unsure.This movie is neither as good as those who type with caps lock down insist it is (U HAVE TO GO SEE THIS FILM OR U R DUMB!) nor as bad as the cynics claim. It does seem to diverge significantly from the first one, but more on that later.Ebert is right. The 'philosophy' is far too shallow to try to analyze. They seem to touch on a lot of free will/determinist issues somehow aligning free-will with humans and determinism with machines, than questioning those notions, than questioning those questions. As Plato demonstrated, dialogue is necessary in the search for wisdom, but I think we need better lines than 'you mean...programs hacking programs?' It is bizarre how for the first half-hour of the Matrix Neo was portrayed as very intelligent, until the brother's W decided making him an idiot would force the supporting characters to have to explain everything to him, and thus stripped him of his intelligence. Somehow, though, I feel as if the first movie was genuinely intelligent for at least the first two acts.I agree that the political intriguing in Zion seems pretty unnecessary, though we will have to see what sort of effect it has when the third movie comes out. It might prove to be worthwhile after all.The Link backstory however there is no need for. Where was the backstory for Apoc or Dozer in the first movie? It wasn't there because it detracts. Oh, and message to the W brothers: consciously acknowledging how stupid Neo looks flying doesn't excuse presenting it in such a ridiculous fashion.
CGI does not look real. Does anyone else think that special effects peaked with the original Star Wars trilogy? I would have much rather seen a stunt double.Was Monica Bellucci attractive in this film or what? I have trouble believing a woman like that could have difficulty finding a man who would be passionately attracted to her. The 100 Agent Smiths. What a great idea on paper. Really, imagine sitting around a room and one of the Watchowski's goes 'let's have Neo fight an infinite number of Smith's' it must have sounded hilarious. But yes, it does look very boring.I generally liked the Architect scene. That alone was worth at least a couple bucks.As far as the 'cliffhanger' ending. It was not a cliffhanger at all. What is left unfinished -- that we don't know the fate of zion? The third movie has to be about something. Also, consider the first movie which quite obviously leaves even more unfinished. Some people do not understand the function of the middle part of a trilogy. It has to leave room for a third movie. Go check out the empire strikes back. It has virtually the same ending! The claim that this is the first half of a two part movie is ridiculous. It attempts and succeeded at fulfilling its story arc.The love scene & the rave scene. Gratuitous? Pandering? That certainly seems to be the case. I have heard that the dubya's threw it in as an attempt to appeal to the female population. I have to question anyone's intentions who simultaneously seeks to appeal to 10 year old boys and adult females, but really is this not symptomatic of a general trend towards more skin in our culture? Is this really anything new? Are we not already living in a civilization where sex sells and money is the body line? I suppose now is not the time or place to discuss such nevertheless pertinent issues.
So, to rate the Matrix on a scale of 1-10 I would point out that it is a matter of perspective. It is neither an all out masterpiece (A La Jesse Ventura's Abraxas Guardian of the Universe) nor a complete bomb (Jean Luc Goddard's Leon).On a scale of 1/10 I give it a 'vague'.",8,0,0,6 June 2003
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Secrets, secrets are no fun.
","I gave this movie a 6 because it is at times spectacular and at other times idiotic, in a word: uneven. As a kids movie it is most certainly a 10, but you could say the same thing about that Star Wars prequels. Is it fair to compare this movie to the vastly superior Lord of the Rings? Probably not, but I can't seem to resist.What Works: the general Harry Potter schtick is appealing and Rowling has constructed a well-thought out world. Everything looks good. Also I may have a crush on Emma Watson. I also like the name Tom Marvelo Riddle...would make a great post-punk band. To bad post-punk is dead. Long live klezmer!What Doesn't: Dobby is not nearly as bad as Jar-Jar Binks but its the same kind of character: he manages to simultaneously annoy and screw things up for the hero and the audience. Also Harry seems to lack a certain emotional death in this movie. He reminds me of a passenger in a car, just sort of doing his thing, not really concerned with what is going on...all the way up through the climactic final scene. He never seems to be truly phased or frightened and we don't either. This series needs to make things more difficult for Harry. That is something Tolkein is much better at...giving his heroes seemingly insurmountable obstacles. For Harry, being a hero is more like a day at the office.",6,0,0,4 December 2002
Bring It On," As good as a movie about cheerleaders can be
","As a straight male with a modicum of intelligence i looked the other way when I heard about this movie. I think that was because it was about cheerleading. When female friends told me that it was 'seriously, the best movie of all time,' I was pretty skeptical. When one convinced me to watch it with her I was wondering what I had gotten myself into. Well here is the truth about this so-called 'classic'...it is definitely worth watching, especially for other straight males. Here's why:1) Kirsten Dunst and Eliza Dushku. An entire sub-plot in the movie seemd to be a battle to determine which one was hotter. It was very difficult. In the end I had to award both of them for 'bringing it on.'2) Girls who watch this get really...'inspired'  by this movie. This movie is really a gift to mankind.and..don't tell anyone, but:3) It's actually kind of a good movie. If you accept the fact that it is not realistic the script & the acting are good. It is entertaining in it's own right.
It's a good thing IMDB allows anonymity8/10",8,1,1,18 December 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Another great snot-based epic!
","Of all of the space-adventure/snot-metaphor movies of all time this one might be the best. As a depiction of man's fight to not be subdued by his own allergies it is really without parallel (accept for maybe the Godfather, or some say Citizen Kane. Now I do think Citizen Kane is a great movie, but it has nothing to do with allergies). Back to Star Wars.Consider the setup, a young boy lives with his aunt and uncle, after his parents died mysteriously (of asthma?) when he goes to by some robots. These robots don't breathe, but nonetheless they are being chased by the empire, which is like the great snot in everyone's nose. The empire seeks to 'tighten it's grip' on the solar system the same way snot constricts your nasal passages and makes it impossible to breathe. Consider the scene where Darth Vader, the Emperor's right hand man constricts one of the royal governor's breath. This is exactly what allergies at their worst do! You Can't breathe.Ok so Luke goes to hang out with Obi-Wan who has been fighting allergies all of his life, by a pattern of correct breath, very zen-like known as the force. By getting in touch with the force you can control your allergies and hopefully subdue them. However the empire is constructing a 'death star' which fires a giant green 'death' ray, more like a giant green snot ray if you ask me.Things get even worse when they try to rescue the princess, who is really snotty. This bothers Han Solo, who thinks some technology and luck, as in anti-allergy medication (symbolized by his reliance on a good blaster) will prevent the empire from stickin' it's slimy tentacles on him.
The garbage dumpster scene. Do I need to say any more?Another thing about this movie: lots of rockets. Snot rockets. Also, consider the noses on many of these alien races. They're crazy! How do they deal with snot.The movie ends with a climax where luke fires a quick snot rocket aimed directly at the nostrils of the death star. Plugged up an unable to breath, it explodes, sneezing out darth vader to a fate unknown to those who plot the ways of snot.10/10",10,0,1,17 December 2002
Hustle & Flow," Hustle & Flow
","Hustle & Flow (2005) **** (/4) Starring Terrence Howard & DJ Qualls Sublime cult drama focusing on the relationship between two rent boys in Memphis, Tenn, USA. Howard (in career-best form) plays DJay, a narcoleptic, quiet homosexual searching for his mother and for some kind of meaning. Qualls (inevitably overshadowed by his outrageously talented co-star) is Shelby, the son of the Mayor, slumming it as a hustler.Despite its flaws: a few lines that miss the mark, the ill-advised, poorly executed diversion into Henry IV territory, and the distracting appearance of Richert which accompanies it, it remains one of the key films of the 21st century.Well-acted and scripted and brilliantly directed (with fine use of color, recurring motifs and bold credits), Hustle possesses a rare, dream-like quality. The music too is excellent, particularly in the perfect first and final scenes: you'll never listen to The Pogues' 'The Old Main Drag' without thinking of this movie and of its central figure: of Howard appearing from the left of the frame with only a black bag and a stopwatch... of the fireside scene, and of the final line: 'This road will never end. It probably goes all... around... the world...' Added to that, it's funnier than most comedies (Terrence's simple 'Thanks' when his pleading with a fat naked man named Walt finally gets him 10 more dollars, the sight of him hurdling fences as Reeves tells a policeman: 'I guess he doesn't like cops', and the superb dialogue by the fire: 'So, you didn't have a normal dog?'), and exists as one of the most honest and moving depictions of love ever seen on the screen. Having said that, of course, it remains a film that polarizes audiences: it will either go straight into your Top 10 or your dustbin after you've finished it; and most reviewers acknowledged this, giving it middling reviews: '**1/2: Many potent scenes... Howard is excellent. Cult status is assured'. Even so, you simply must see it, to decide where you stand. Whether you love it or despise it, you will never, EVER forget it.Needless to say I stand in the former camp: I've seen about 800 movies from the '20s to the present day and this is my favorite: tremendously haunting and affecting and endlessly quotable (though few great films are): it simply works on ever level.One final note: Some people criticize this movie for being very similar to Gus Van Zant's my own private Idaho. I personally don't see that as a bad thing. It is like criticizing a man for being 'handsome.'",9,1,7,22 July 2005
The Godfather," The greatest movie of all time!
","The big problem with this movie is that people do not seem to realize that a movie is an illusion. It is pretend. It is make-believe. For some reason people think this movie is a historical document. People want to lock up Marlon Brando and Al Pacino for crimes their characters, not them committed. Ok let me try to break this down for all you people: The Corleone's are imaginary. They are not real. Someone made them up. They don't exist. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando are real, but they are law-abiding actors. They are not criminals (as far as we know) Those things they do in the movies are not real. IS EVERYBODY CRAZY!#!!# I must be the only person who understands the difference between fiction and non-fiction. No, my 3-year old son understands that as well. As for the rest of you loonies, you can go hang out in Cleveland with all the other heathens, Osiris be damned!3/10",Null,0,1,17 December 2002
