Angels & Demons," A gripping thriller that falls on deaf ears.
","I think Ron Howard did a great job, but the script brought the film down like a dead weight. Whenever an interesting relationship or element pops up, it's left and we continue on, and with the film being pretty fast paced and 'OMG NO TIME LEFT, Wilson' this does work most of the time, but I found myself wanting a break from the primary action about 2/3 of the way in.But, here's the reason I decided to write a review. The freaking dialog, it's awful. Probably around 95% of the dialog is just exposition, a history lesson or a cue for the people who didn't pick up the visual tell. It is a deeply historical film and therefore needs the contextual underpinning, but we don't need to know every detail about everything that gets mentioned. It drags the plot and at times, can be frustrating.Lastly, I think there was a female actress in there. I don't know. I think she popped up every time needed a translator or the heroic professor was left by the police. All she seemed to do was answer questions or give Langdon an excuse to think out loud. Which is a shame, because the relationship between science and theology is one of the key topics of the film, and this ambiguous female character - a scientist at CERN - could have been the link between these. But no, all the seemed to do was act a medium for Langdon's thought.Other than the script, it is quite a well-made film and is definitely worth a watch if you're up for a bit of gung-ho church-hopping.",6,1,3,21 July 2013
The Theory of Everything," Underwhelming and uninteresting
","I went to see The Theory of Everything with my girlfriend, expecting a biopic of Stephen Hawking with particular focus on the relationship with his first wife. That's not what we got.Instead, we got a film which couldn't decide who's story it was telling, acting by Redmayne that at points was utterly cringeworthy and uninspiring, and a repetitive soundtrack that sounded as if it was ripped straight from a charity advert. Felicity Jones, however, was utterly amazing and deserves all the awards she has been nominated for. There were a couple of excellent lines of dialogue in there, but on the whole the script felt as if it was still in the drafting process. The camera-work was above average, yet at times felt like an Instagram submission. On top of this, I now feel guilty for not enjoying a film that's supposed to be awesome. It was a huge let down and I can't see why Redmayne has been nominated for so many awards - must be because he did a questionable job at pretending to have a disability.",5,3,13,9 January 2015
Evil Dead," A bad film with the odd good bit
","Here's what you should know.STORY - It felt like a first draft. Underdeveloped characters that I'm supposed to care about, a bucket load of questions left unanswered, dialogue that had no thought put into it - it added nothing new to the Evil Dead story, so why remake it? ACTING - Some good, some bad. The poor man's Mila Kunis was great, but the archetypal stoner was unbelievable and felt like a read-in.CAMERAS - 'Let's just make a 90 minute tribute to Instagram!' Nope. You've got a huge cinema screen: use it. Don't disregard 90% of the shot by using pull focus that goes so far as to cover up important details. Some of the imagery such as the burning bush and the angel's descension were pretty impressive, but they were so scarce that they felt as if they didn't fit.SET & EFFECTS - Probably the film's strongest point, forgetting the cherryade vomit scene. For me, the lighting created the mood. It made you feel damp and uncomfortable by bringing the forest and cabin to life.THE ENDING - Without spoilers, this was great to watch, but nothing else. I didn't care about what was happening, who was what, who the hell that person is. But hey, it was so over-the-top it was impressive. More visuals like this would have been great.CONCLUSION - If you're wanting heat-turning gore, step right up. But if you want to see a good film, best go somewhere else. I'd wait for the DVD release if I were you.",5,4,10,13 May 2013
