Angels & Demons," Surprisingly Fun but not what i expected
","I went to see this movie without any high expectations(since The DaVinci code did not impress me that much). I haven't read the book so my comments are strictly about the movie and it's script. To be frank i love the subject matter and all kinds of conspiracy theories related to the Church, the Vatican,secret societies etc. Well, the movie did not amaze me in this aspect, since it was more of a fast-paced action-thriller then a real conspiracy movie. If you expected a rich storyline which would interweave facts and fiction about the Illuminati, their secret acts and their hundreds years old struggle with the Vatican you might be disappointed. However, if you can enjoy a quick-paced thriller which is not trying to be the smartest movie you've seen and you can enjoy a movie that would require some suspension of disbelief for the sake of entertainment you might find that this is an above-average movie. All in all that was not what i expected but it was a fun ride - better then the most movies of it's kind that Hollywood keeps pumping out every year. I would rate it somewhere between 6 and 7 for the entertainment value.",7,0,1,2 July 2009
