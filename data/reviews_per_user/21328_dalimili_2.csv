The King's Speech," The King speaks. Long live the King!
","Kings speech left me speechless... well not really because I wanted to tell everyone how great this movies is, but it did left me speechless as a cinematographic, visual masterpiece.I have to admit I had no background knowledge of King George VI life. I probably wouldn't even care much about it if I was seeing the same story as some black and white documentary on Discovery channel. Because it just wouldn't be able to carry over the story so nicely as it did here.Yes, the movie does last almost 2 hours but by the end of it you are actually wishing it was a series and that the next week there would be another episode...What really surprised me is that this movie had more comedic moments than many of those that label themselves as comedies! Some scenes were just dead funny - of course most of them were between Bertie (Firth) and Logue (Rush) which were able to transcend the plateau of human emotions so gracefully onto the screen.I always believed there is a difference between actors and stars and when one watches Kings Speech you can easily spot where that difference lays. So big kudos to all of the actors that made this movie and absolute moviegoers delight.And because of the all of the above, and the wonderful connection between all of the actors, the actual kings speech, the one that whole movie revolves around, becomes an experience in itself and not just a king addressing the Nation. The king can speak! Long live the king!",9,2,4,1 February 2011
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," This does not Kick Ass!
","This is one of those movies I read about a lot. Also it's one of those movies I really wanted to see badly. But in the end it became one of those movies that I turned off after 37 minutes of watching.It was just too hectic, but yet so very boring movie. Oh my god! There was a bunch of totally annoying pricks as leads, there was a love interest who was just too obnoxious to be even cute... there was a main star, Scott that is, who was just lifeless piece of human creature... a Shaggy in disguise...OK, OK, I don't know if it's fair to rate or review a movie if one has seen only 37 minutes of it, but after all it does say something about the movie itself, doesn't it.I hear lots of praises, lots of wowzas about Scott Pilgrim against the world, but I am left with a feeling that most of those people are really young. So it's a movie aimed at younger population who grew up watching flashy MTV videos and always insanely hectic National Geographic documentaries...If you liked Kick Ass, that doesn't mean you will love this one, because in fact this does not Kick Ass.P.S. The only surprise of this movie was Kieran Culkin.",4,5,11,1 February 2011
