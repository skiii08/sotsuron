Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," All hail;Sherlock Holmes,the comic book sleuth!!
","'Elementary my dear Ritchie',as Sherlock Holmes would say!!!The best thing about the 2nd installment of the Sherlock Holmes flicks from the Guy Ritchie stable is that director sticks and remains true to Holmes as we know him from the novels(read the awe inspiring deduction prowess of Holmes); besides invigorating the film with awe inspiring CGI effects and power packed action sequences to take to it dizzying heights of awesomeness.Set in the mystical environs of the Victorian era(I'm a bit partial towards flicks set in that era)the characters,their actions as concocted by Ritchie are far cry from the ones originally depicted in Sir Arthur's novels.Our new age Holmes & Watson,punch,they kick,dodge bullets in uber cool,jaw dropping slo-mo action scenes,but its hard not to fall in love with this adrenaline joyride of a movie.What else can you expect wen Ironman himself is playing the protagonist.Surely Conan Doyle will be jumping out from his seat in heaven,cant say the same about the Sherly purists though.In the most intriguing of scenes, Holmes and Moriarty lock horns over a game of chess ;we also have Watson dancing with gypsies, his wife thrown off a train, Holmes in various disguises (as a chair,as a woman,lol) and yes we have a naked Stephen Fry hitting on Watson's wife.Very Richtiesque and stamp of the director of Snatch,RocknRolla written all over it.Only the director of Guy's caliber nd finesse cud have pulled this off.The dual b/w Holmes nd his arch enemy,Prof Moriarty and the mesmerizing chemistry between Law and Downey Jr. who hit off like a house on fire,are well and truly the high points of the movie.Just the right mix of a shrewd script,subtlety,mind boggling action sequences,Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows goes one step above its celebrated predecessor and transcends into an exhilarating joyride that packs quite a punch and how..End your year on a high,Go for it!!!!",8,2,4,1 January 2012
Rush," Rush, The Movie: Personal Review of an Exhilarating experience
","I had zeroed in on Rush as one of the movies that I was going to watch on the big screen (the Ron Howard & F1 union factor), here in Dubai and was waiting for it eagerly. And boy it was the worth the wait. Rush is not your run-of-the-mill movie in the sporting drama bandwagon which caters only to F1 enthusiasts.F1 fan or not, the way Howard has showcased the legendary rivalry between F1 greats, Niki Lauda and James Hunt makes for compelling and intense viewing. The banter and the doses of humour interspersed throughout the flick form the crux of the 'foe-mance' between Hunt and Lauda (played exquisitely by Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl respectively) & are the high points of film. Howard is spot on with his depiction of the events surrounding this fabled rivalry. His portrayal of the 2 legends, with contrasting personalities who are poles apart and yet are driven by equal love for the sport and ambition makes the flick, an interesting and exhilarating ride. The movie is crisply edited and moves along at just the right pace for a biopic.Apart from all this, in my opinion, ultimately what clinches it for Rush and catapults it into the 'bench mark' shelf of movies; making it one of the great sporting drama movies of all time, are the parts just before the climax and the climax itself. The miraculous & awe-inspiring recovery of Lauda(after the life threatening crash in Nuremberg) culminating into the final race of the dramatic 1976 season in rain soaked Japan(with the stunning Mount Fuji in the backdrop) has been shot and executed 'jaw-droppingly' well. It's a spectacle to say the least. Expect cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle to win a few accolades for his staggering work, as Howard's team on the whole excels in executing & pulling off breath-taking F1 set-pieces to perfection.In Rush, we have a film which Ron Howard & his team have managed to steer just about correctly at every corner/chicane of movie making. The flick has almost everything, right from the movie score to the acting, working for it, like a well drilled F1 car. In the end what it all boils down to; the essence of Rush, the movie, lies in its two protagonists. It's thrilling, funny and unpredictable just like Hunt and meticulously filmed, is blunt but with touch of emotional and inspirational edge to it just like Lauda.Formula 1 buff or not Rush to the nearest movie theatre to catch this un-missable adrenaline edge of the seat ride.",8,4,6,28 September 2013
The Woman in Black," Dan the Man in 'The Woman in Black'
","So finally the wait is over. The question that has been eating every Harry Potter movie franchise fan,hollow, is finally laid to rest. The question in question is 'What happens to our boy wizard post Hogwarts School of witchcraft and wizardry'. It's a natural question because, over the years people have literally grown up with the trio of Harry, Ron and Hermione. So, more than the excitement about the celluloid adaptation of the horror novel 'The Woman in Black' ,it was this childish curiosity which drew me to catch Dan Radcliffe's next outing on the big screen. Set in the Edwardian era (my 2nd favorite era after the Victorian one) the movie opens into foggy and murky environs of the city of London. Radcliffe portrays the role of Arthur Kipps, a widower and the father of an angelic 4 yr. old boy. It's as if the foggy weather outside is the depiction of the turmoil and murkiness in his life;Kipps an emerging lawyer is sent to a seemingly harmless assignment to handle the estate of one Alice Drablow, owner of an English manor known as the Eel Marsh House. The manor is located on a desolate island in the marshes as opposed to verdant locales of the English countryside, which just enhances the clouds of eeriness that shroud the movie throughout. As fate would have it, this harmless assignment turns out be a perilous one and one which tests Kipps to the hilt. As if a village run over by superstitions and small kids committing hara-kiri weren't enough, he has to lock horns with the curse of a mysterious lady in black and in the process muster all the courage deep down in labyrinth of his mind as a part of a plot which finally becomes a fight to save his child. What provides him solace throughout the movie are the visions of his wife every now and then in her wedding gown, his lady in white,if you will. The director James Watkins maintains a solid hold on the movie and the final product, if not edge of the seat stuff, is gripping enough to grab the attention of the viewer. The whole movie has the look of a good old fashion horror flick. Be it the macabre environs of the haunted and dilapidated mansion, or the scares conjured in good measure by the mysterious lady in black who sneaks up on you every now and then for some seat popping moments .Add to the above, creepy toys, toddlers walking away in deep trance, the rocking chair and above all the indispensable black crow and you have one hell of a chills inducing department. Now coming to the performances of the cast. First up is our protagonist. As stated earlier, Radcliffe carries a sombre and pensive demeanour throughout the flick. He shows just the right amount of understatement and restrain demanded by the role and boy does,Dan emerge with flying colors in the end. He fits into the shoes of a difficult role with ease just like an experienced campaigner (well with 8 HP films behind him,I shouldn't call him that). It's very easy to over do your part in such a role and appear wooden when it comes to showing a glimpse of those hidden emotions, but with his grimness and pensiveness in culmination with scattered outbursts of emotions one can't help but take away an image of Arthur Kipps and not harry potter when you finally exit the movie hall. As for the rest of cast, nobody else has enough screen time to make an impact except for the woman in black(Liz White) who sans any dialog manages to make an impression, a shuddering one at that. You wish the Dailys(Ciar√°n Hinds as Sam Daily and Janet McTeer as Elizabeth Daily) had more screen time; otherwise they carry out their parts with panache and in sync with the demands of the film. So, in the end what you have is a satisfying enough horror mystery which I must say is good adaption of the novel. Adapting a novel to screen is a precarious task and difficult to pull off and the final product as conjured up by Watkins looks good. Credit to the able screenplay and direction, Watkins and his team concoct a 'just about there' flick and upliftingly enough for potter fans Radcliffe packs quite a punch with his commendable performance, but still looks too young to play a father. In my case I couldn't help but wipe a tear a or two off my eyes as I left the theatre brimming with emotions and sighing 'our lil wizard has finally grown up'",7,1,2,29 February 2012
