Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Uh, can Lucas redo this one?
","I remember how much I could not wait to see this movie.  Star Wars was always my favorite movie as a kid.  Suddenly, I was in the theater, the lights dimmed, and the movie began.  And just as the first lines were spoken, my heart sank.  The dialogue was THAT awful.The movie seemed uninspired; un-Star Wars.  Once you got past the lines, you then noticed the movie was too choppy and didn't flow together.  This picture really came off as a cheap kids movie, and even the kids thought it wasn't all that good.Unfortunately, this movie nearly killed the franchise's popularity.  So whats next?  Well as an avid (and now closet) Star Wars fan, I have checked up on the next installment, 'Attack of the Clones.'  All I can say - without spoiling the movie - is don't get your hopes up. Episode 2 may be simpler, but it still shares the weaknesses of its unpopular predecessor.",Null,0,1,14 January 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," This is the Star Wars I wanted to see 3 years ago!
","Attack of the Clones was one heck of a movie.  I'd put it up there with the likes of 'Empire' and 'A New Hope.'  I went into the movie theater with very, very low expectations.  Folks, this movie plays out just like 'Empire,' and thats a good thing.  The love story isn't as flawed as everybody says, it's kind of like Han & Leia's fling in 'Empire,' but ends in a different fashion.Casting in this movie was excellent, and previously flat characters got to show some human life, such as Portman's Amidala and MCGregor's Kenobi.  I really didn't have a problem with any of the new characters; no weird accents or speak here.  The acting and dialogue was a lot better, and I actually got used to it and -gasp- appreciated it, as I'd compare the acting/dialogue to Episodes 4 + 5.  There is no cocky Solo here, but Anakin is one heck of a character.  He's very unstable, and when you see this movie, you'll find out how much so.I'd definitely recommend this movie as it's one of the few movies I've seen that I couldn't stop talking about once it ended.  4.5/5P.S. Hey, Lucas, now that you can make a good movie again, can you redo 'The Phantom Menace?'",1,0,1,16 May 2002
Saw II," Great Sequel, A Must-See for Horror Fans
","Saw II is a fantastic follow-up that improves on the low-budget original while maintaining themes that made the 2004 hit so popular.A major improvement this sequel contains is the acting. While still not Oscar-worthy or even critic worthy, the characters are more believable and less noticeable as 'fake' this time around. But that's what happens when you hire Cary Elwes ;-).The grit, the twists, and the suspense are all there. Even the smartest of minds and moviegoers who 'have seen it all' (like myself) will admit to being tricked by the time the credits roll. And that's good film-making.Saw II takes what everybody liked about the original, and keeps the idea fresh while making improvements...a rare, quality sequel. Definitely rent or buy this for a great movie night.",8,0,0,20 February 2006
