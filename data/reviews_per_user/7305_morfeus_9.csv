Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Realism rests, commercialism rules...or does it?(Possible Spoilers)
","Quentin Tarantino made 'Kill Bill vol.1'... After that his style, filming methods and unrealistic tendences became..unsound... Every man has a breaking point.I have it, you have it...And Quentin Tarantino has reached his...And very obviously, he made Kill Bill vol.2... Then he has crossed to Cannes with an army of his fans and festival jury who worship a man like a God and follow every order however ridiculous it is... Well, I have other shocking news...Quentin Tarantino was about to be charged with eliminating realism in his movies and stocking them with unmotivated violence... He had authorised filming of totally unrealistic and ridiculous 'Bride-hellrising' scene and remarkably repulsive 'eyeball-popping' scene, although he was advised to stick to stylish 'ear-cutting' sequences...He put all viewer's faith in ideals of Akira Kurosawa and Takeshi Kitnao in jeopardy...You see,out there with these fan crowds it must be a temptation to make a semi-mainstream film...So your mission is to go to the nearest mall, pick up Tarantino's path, infiltrate the movie theatre by any means available...and terminate you faith in Tarantino... If you will be able to infiltrate the movie theatre and sit through the whole movie you won't need to prove you courage ever again...",7,2,6,29 June 2004
Dawn of the Dead," Excellent B-grade movie
","'Dawn of the dead' quite a good movie. it has a good budget for FX (there is not much to watch in zombie movies except for FX, is there?, however it keeps the unique atmosphere of the 1978 original. The plot is naturally bad, but it's unlikely that a zombie flick will ever produce a decent drama or room for character development. There are fixed standard characters, like a cop, a black guy with a gun, redneck security guard and so on. Most of them die in quite entertaining way, so the audience is never bored. Casting is good, however, it doesn't really matter, since most characters are quite flat. IMHO, they should have replaced Sarah Polly with more...ehm...typical nurse:) So, to sum up - a good piece of commercial entertainment. Not a Lynch movie, but it's never been positioned as such.",7,1,2,9 June 2005
Alien: Resurrection," Brilliant
","Well,as all the Alien saga series, this is a masterpiece of sci-fi/black comedy. Movie is full of existentianalistic ideas and good humor. Unlike other Alien movies Weaver at least is displayed in a quite unusual (and sexy) badass image. The only bad thing about this movie is that after watching you realise that is the end of the brilliant series , but after I guess Weaver is getting too old for this fun stuff. 10/10.",10,5,12,27 June 2003
American Psycho," Playful, but mysterious little movie
","Do you like Mary Harron?Her early work was a little too TV for my taste, but when 'I Shot Andy Warhol' came out in '96, I think she really came into her own, commercially and artistically. In 2000, Mary Harron released 'American Psycho', her most accomplished movie. The whole movie has a clear crisp '80s look, and a new sheen of social satire, which really gives the movie a big boost. In terms of writing craftsmanship, the sheer scriptwriting, this movie hits a new peak of professionalism. The movie is so catchy, most people don't even try to understand the meaning, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity, importance of trends, hollow yuppie lifestyle and murders, but it's also a personal statement of a director herself!Do you like Christian Bale?I've been a big Bale fan since the release of his '94 movie 'Prince of Jutland'. Before that, I really didn't understand any of his work. Too artsy, too intellectual. It was on 'Prince of Jutland' where Christian Bale's presence became more apparent. I think 'American Psycho' is Bale's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding movies. His acting is as positive and affirmative as anything I've seen in any movie. The brilliant ensemble of other actors makes 'American Psycho' great,great movie, a personal favourite. You can practically sense the empathy between Bale, Justin Theroux, Josh Lucas, Jared Leto, Reese Witherspoon and Samantha Mathis.So, to sum up, the movie is extremely uplifting, it shines with hope that it's not too late to better ourselves, and contains a crucial message - since it's impossible in this world we live in, to empathise with others, we always empathise with ourselves. It's beautifully stated in the movie. And now excuse me, I have to return some videotapes.",10,2,4,11 December 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Tarantino lost his bite?
","One thing I knew to be sure after 1992 and till now - all Earth could go to hell, bet Tarantino never had lack of realism. Now with Kill Bill vol.1 I can tell that he has lost his bite. The film itsel if flawless - directing and acting is great, and tarantino 'chapters' resemble the famous PF. But the problem is with the plot - the best way to kill Blll could be ten times easier and less risky that one Black Mamba had chosen. Why rush into the Copperheads house when she sucpects nothing and could be easy shot through window with a sniper rifle? If Black Mamba wanted to have her fun with Copperhead using knife, why not didn't she use soprofic ammo or something before?(And then repeat the famous scene from Reservoir Dogs:))) Considering the fact that she was a pro, this whole attitude lacks motivation.Of course, you can motivate it with the post-coma shock, bet not the whole movie!(She had at least 3 months to recover, basing on the plot). Another stupid thing to do was to get into fight with all the 88 elite guards, 'cos in real life noone could really take on so  many enemies using only sword and win. And if those guards were elite, why none of them has a gun? What kind of protection are they? If a team of 3-4 guys equipped with machineguns entered the building in real life the 'mad88' would make an easy thargets. But even with swords they could easlily chop Mamba only because they were to many, and you just can't move THAT fast unless you are the ONE:) So here comes another drawback - lack of originality. Tarantino definetely tried to copy both The Matrix Reloaded and classic Takeshi Kitano (even by having actors from Battle Royale in his movie)  scenes. It's not that bad at all, considering that the Reservoir Dogs were fully based on Kitano's 'Violent cop', but QT failed to give the blood and gore fest (which I greatly appreciated) the charm and style, which ruled in R.Dogs. And some corny anime and huge ammount of Japanese dialogue(which is organic in Kinatno's movies, but pointless in Tarantino's) are terrible. So the only REALLY Tarantino-styled scenes are some dialogues (like between Copperhead and Mamba), catchphrases (like I'm Buck, I'm here to f***) and so on. 8/10 because of lack of style and realism.",8,1,2,19 December 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Incredibly stupid
","Well, as all of the Tolkien's books are nothing more than some dumb fairy-tales , any movie based on  Tolkien's book is gonna...(well Jay and Silent Bob fans, you know the quote).I don't like, but I tolerate fanatsy in gerenal, but this is by far! Anyone who likes sitting and watching orcs and goblins speaking single-minded lines about some trashcan-worth ring for 2 hours are welcome. Any sane person KEEP OUT! 0/10",1,3,28,24 December 2003
Casino," Great gangster movie!
","Stylish, realistic, violent, perfectly written and directed, this movie has the power to attract and capture attention for almost 3 hours. The plot is just as good as in any other gangster movie, but excellent script and superb acting make the movie a masterpiece. Robert DeNiro and Joe Peschi do an excellent job portraying complicated characters, and creating a unique atmosphere of presence while watching the movie. The only considerable flaw is Sharon Stone, who's performance cannot keep up with the rest of the cast, but since she's just an average actress, this is a mistake of those who gave her a leading part in the movie. So to sum, up this is a great movie by one of the greatest directors of all times. 9/10.",Null,2,3,26 September 2004
Jackie Brown," Excellent movie!
","This is one of top-notch Tarantino films, which takes you several hours of concentration to find a single flaw. Work of Tarantino as a director is great as usual, actors are excellent (especially Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson and Michael Keaton), script is brilliant, and the whole atmosphere is very realistic. Although there is almost no action, the movie captures viewer's attention from the first minute. Soundtrack is brilliant as always ( 'Strawberry letter' especially excels), the famous Tarantino attitude and humor appear through the whole movie in vast quantities, so the movie has all he characteristics of a cult film. 10/10.",10,2,5,20 September 2004
Sin City," Superb!!!
","This is truly one of the greatest modern movies, and without a doubt the greatest big budget mainstream project ever. Rodrigues is a true genius, he was able to satisfy both producer's needs for a big gross and to manage to make the movie as stylish as possible. Since the movie is based on a comic book, the plot is unbelievable as best, however, it gives actors huge space for character development. And so they're doing their best. All performances are equally flawless, and it was especially nice to see Mickey Rourke in his old character. Special effects are also used very reasonably, creating fictional, but totally believable world. So, to sum up, the movie itself is flawless, acting, directing, and FX are great, so it's a masterpiece!",10,2,5,27 April 2005
