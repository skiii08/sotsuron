50 First Dates," So this is Love ?
",Ladies !!! Do you want this man to be your lawfully wedded husband ? Isn't Henry Roth the most romantic guy? I wonder if doing this film made Adam Sandler think of his own relationship and improve on it. I felt very challenged by his persistence and determination for the sheer fact that this might be what women expect. Or is it? Is this the mark set by women for all men? Does watching this make single women feel that 'I know he is out their somewhere'. Do you think Henry would have gone through all this if Lucy was not attractive? It was amazing to see Lucy's father and brother going through the routine everyday just to keep Lucy happy. Does dads and brother like Lucy's exist? They actually do. The love and care of the family structure is one thing realistic about this movie. Have you ever thought how hard it must be to look after a disabled child or a child who is mentally handicapped? tendency is to identify with Lucy and wish that someone would love us but isn't it the other way around? Lucy however finds a husband to love her and take care of her but aren't their so many like Lucy who are waiting to be accepted by society and waiting to be loved by someone? Does the movie challenge you to be sensitive to people like Lucy?,7,2,2,25 April 2015
