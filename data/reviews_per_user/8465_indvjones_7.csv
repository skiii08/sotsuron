10 Cloverfield Lane," Chilling!
",I never imagined John Goodman could creep me out so much.,7,1,1,24 May 2019
Hereditary," Didn't expect to love this film so much!
","Wow. If you like horror/thriller movies, you have got to watch this. I waited far too long to do so. It has all the perfect twist and turns a movie like this should have. Definitely a classic added to my horror collection! Oh and if you're like me, don't look too deep into the meaning/the ending. Some things are better left a mystery!",8,0,3,23 May 2019
Us," Peele is doing something right.
",Everybody I know who has watched this film has only left room to hate on it. I don't get it! I left the theater still on edge. Very unsettling story and overall idea that Peele has laid out so beautifully. The acting was fantastic which only added to the horror element that needed to be there! I can't wait to own this movie.,8,0,5,23 May 2019
The Shining," So close to perfection.
","I love this movie with all my being. My first time watching it was several years back on the big screen. I am so glad that was how I experienced Kubrick's take on King's chilling novel. Chilling, gripping, unnerving, you name it, The Shining has it. Nothing compares to the performances and the overall execution in this film. Every time you watch it you find something new you never saw before. It's one big puzzle that might always be missing a few pieces!",9,1,3,24 May 2019
It Follows," Still so much love for this movie.
","I never add a movie to my DVD collection that I do not like. This film was creepy in the best way. Cool story, cool concept and a great cast to tie it in a perfect horror bow!",8,0,2,24 May 2019
Sinister," Great movie!
",Still scares me every single time. Ethan Hawke was perfect in this. So many scary scenes and such an interesting story line!,8,0,0,24 May 2019
The Silence of the Lambs," Quid Pro Quo.
","I cannot believe I haven't watched this movie sooner. It's probably because I knew it would terrify me and it sure as hell delivered. What a work of art, truly. The acting, the sets, the overall mood established make this movie an instant classic. Anthony Hopkins' performance as Hannibal gives me goosebumps and who better to play Clarice than Jodie Foster? If you haven't seen this movie, watch it. I'll be watching it over and over to make up for all that time I lost.",8,0,0,27 May 2019
