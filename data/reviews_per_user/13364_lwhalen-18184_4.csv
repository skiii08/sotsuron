Sucker Punch," Just not very good.
","Slow-moving. Boring. I thought I was still watching a preview until ten minutes in I realized It was the feature.Negative. Dystopian. It didn't seem like there was even a reason to be concerned for the characters, despite their circumstances. Just not my cup of tea. I wouldn't recommend it...",4,2,5,8 September 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Had to remember it was not a documentary...
","Bohemian Rhapsody plays out well in just about all aspects, except for chronological consistency. Seeing how many others have covered this, I will not delve any further into the plots inconsistencies. When watching, one simply has to remember it is not a documentary. It is a rock n roll film made by 20th Century Fox. This was a fun movie and if you are a fan of Queen, or rock music in general, you will never cease to be entertained.",7,3,3,3 November 2018
Die Hard 2," Worth two hours of my life.
","To put it quite simply, this is a fun, entertaining flick. I have it the same exact rating as the original, due to the fact I was just as entertained whilst viewing this gem of a sequel. While at times the dialogue seems forced and derivative, most likely to try and capture the banter and wittiness of the first film, the plot and action of Die Hard 2 makes up for any shortcomings it may have if being compared to its predecessor. I had a smile on my face during this whole movie, and even for a little while after. Go ahead and watch it. It's worth 2 hours of your life.",9,1,1,18 August 2018
Heat," Astonishing. Fun. Epic.
","I'm not going to take up much time. This film is the reason why movies are made. Entertaining to its core. The ending sucked for me because I didn't want it to happen that way, but that was all because of the characterizations of the protagonists (Yes, there are two protagonists in this movie). Unbelievable. Go watch it (again).",10,3,3,15 September 2018
