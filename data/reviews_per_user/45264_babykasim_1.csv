Angels & Demons," the eyeball part ...
","i find the movie good though it diverted a bit from the book. one part which i found amusing is when Victoria went to the lab and had her retina scanned. there she found drops of blood and when she entered the lab she saw the eyeballs. she was shocked, yes but she looked further and saw her lab partner lying on the floor with his right eye missing.this only means the murderer is inside the lab, took his right eye out and then what? use it to enter the lab again (as there are drops of blood at the scanner?i find this part a little bit strange...",7,1,4,18 May 2009
