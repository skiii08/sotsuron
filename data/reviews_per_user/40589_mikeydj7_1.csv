The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Exciting and Enthralling: A Review From a Non-Fan
","I hadn't seen any of the Twilight movies before a few months ago, only watched the first and some of the second. Thought the first was okay, kinda annoying at times, and a little weird. The second was boring, flat out.Breaking Dawn is like neither in those ways. It is tense, emotional, and enthralling to watch with a crowd full of eager fans.There are definite throwbacks to the first movie which fans will (and do) appreciate, there are little Easter eggs which they'll pick up on immediately, but that's not what this review is about. This is a review for the common movie-goer who's only ever heard the hype or the hate about this series. I'm here to tell you, Bill Condon has made a fun and exciting movie that is worth your admission, regardless of your feelings on the rest of the series.The first thing to note is that the acting, dialogue, and editing are all far, FAR superior to the original three. In short, this is due to Bill's team and the effort he puts into making the best movie he possibly can. Beyond that, the production value shows in the effects and in the staging of certain shots (one of which is in the trailers as Edward catches Bella's head before it hits the ground). This is a professional, crisp-looking movie that still manages to channel the style of the first Twilight.Now, I won't say this movie is 'one of the greatest ever' because that's just nonsense. But as far as romance or popcorn flicks go, this is a great, emotional movie and is well worth your viewing. The wolf scenes are all exciting and awe-inspiring, particularly the first one, which sent chills up and down my spine for a solid 30 seconds.The humor in the movie is also very well done, and every line and beat gets its laughs. Our audience was loving it, especially a reference to a particular piece of art in the Cullen's house.The best thing I can say is that when the emotional moments come in this movie, they deliver in spades and leave you feeling it. This is due in no small part to the excellent score, written by Carter Burwell. The wedding scene was incredibly touching and so very well done, from start to finish. It may be the best scene in the movie (and this is from a 20- something male who doesn't really buy into the wedding/romance stuff). It is touching, romantic, humorous, all at exactly the right times in exactly the right way.I do not fit the demographic for this series, and I'll probably never see the second or third Twilight movies in completion, but Breaking Dawn Part 1 was the most fun I've had watching a movie in a theater. Period. The energy in that room was incredible to feel, and just seeing and hearing all those people who were so into everything on the screen was enough to make me smile, much less to know that with every passing frame they were having everything they hoped for delivered, and then some. Congrats to Bill and the team, the fans will adore you, and maybe you'll even get a few converts to the series. You've got one in me.",Null,26,57,15 November 2011
