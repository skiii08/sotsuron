Hereditary," Toni Collette should've been nominated for an Oscar! Brilliant!
","I get it, but so many don't want to. This was a fascinating performance by one of my favorite leading ladies. She got screwed from an Oscar. But it's a horror film nonetheless, yet nothing like most have seen. Yes it is often classified as a film about mental illness, which it's not. It's a film about otherworldly things, but I love that it doesn't tell you that right away. Her chemistry with her son is gut wrenching, and really cuts you emotionally. It's not an easy film to watch, but it's worth noting I haven't seen this originality in forever. This film will stay with me...",9,0,2,20 April 2019
Mother!," What the Hell!?!
","Watched this twice unfortunately, but had to make sure it wasn't a fluke or my mood the first time. I don't get it. Actually I do. Trying to be clever with religious undertones, whatever. This movie is TERRIBLE, and if anxiety is an issue for you, please don't watch this trash. Just awful...",1,5,6,17 May 2019
Annihilation," Beauty and horror rolled into a spectacular optical display!
","This film is something new and different, hence it's appeal. I love Natalie P. but her as a soldier seemed forced. Other than that, it's an extremely disturbing, yet such beautiful visual display. Loving the females in this, all strong with their own demons. It definitely keeps you guessing as to what is really going on, and the tension is certainly felt. If you love Sci Fi, a good story, strong cast, and feast for your eyes, this movie is it!",7,4,7,20 April 2019
