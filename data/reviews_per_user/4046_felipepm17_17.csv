First Man," First Man Review
","Beautiful and well done movie. But the story seems to drag on at some point, especially in the first half of the nearly 2h30min film.",8,1,4,10 July 2019
Source Code," Source Code Review
","Until halfway mark everything seems pretty confusing, not on an Inception level, but it makes the viewer a little uneasy for not understanding much. The repetitions also seem a little pointless at first, but then you get used to it. The plot doesn't have many twists, but the story and the characters end up holding the audience for 95 minutes.",8,0,1,11 November 2019
A Star Is Born," A Star Is Born Review
","The performances and songs are good, but the pace with which the story unfolds is a bit too fast, things just happen one after the other.",8,0,0,10 July 2019
Captain Marvel," Captain Marvel Review
","Well done, colorful and fun. Goose is the star of the movie.",7,1,1,10 July 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri Review
","I was so happy that this movie is not Manchester by the Sea this season! The beginning is tense, but then the film shows that it is much more than a crime movie, which happens before the story begins. The movie is even fun! Frances and Sam are great.",9,0,1,11 July 2019
Salt," Salt Review
","Overall a good action thriller, but leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to the ending. A few extra minutes would be welcomed.",7,1,1,11 November 2019
Dunkirk," Dunkirk Review
","This movie has a nice mix of fairly unknown and big name actors, but you don't feel an unbalance because the story hold itself up. Saw the movie in IMAX so I have a hard time to imagine how it'd be at home in a small screen and normal sound",8,0,1,23 January 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Avengers: Endgame Review
","I 100% didn't feel that this movie is 3h long, Though this will be good to watch at home, Endgame is one of those movies that was made to be a cinema experience, in 3D or not (but it was better in 3D). I believe in most of the developments and paths the characters chose. For a movie with so many characters and converging plots, Endgame doesn't feel too packed.",9,42,67,10 July 2019
The Favourite," The Favourite Review
","This movie can be summed up in one word: Complete. The cast is good, the photography is good, the costumes are good, the soundtrack is good and the direction is good.",9,2,4,10 July 2019
The Lion King," Lion King
","I'll start with the best part: Timon and Pumba are fantastic. Now I want a whole movie just of them.
The cast was well selected and I feel that Beyoncé and Child Gambino don't bring anything special to the characters, any voice actor that can sing would do the same job. Beyoncé's original song didn't amaze me too, the song is beautiful but doesn't blend well with the rest of the movie.",7,1,2,25 July 2019
Call Me by Your Name," Call Me by Your Name Review
","I love the soundtrack to that movie. I think Armie is a bit too old to be Oliver, which makes the difference between the characters look monumental, and not just 7 years. The film is extremely faithful to the book, with the exception of the end (fortunately we do not have the long and tedious chapter in Rome, which is of no use). With a continuation planned, it will be interesting how they will tell the end of the story, needing to develop things that are not in the book. Timothée is fantastic, that fireplace scene is another level, but Michael deserves more recognition, especially for the scene where he talks to Elio in the library, which is exactly like the book.",9,2,6,11 July 2019
Silence," Silence Review
","This movie is very long, but it's very good too. The film has a very slow pace and the progress is very linear, but nevertheless never got boring. Andrew is amazing again. The ending is interesting, although not happy.",9,1,2,11 July 2019
Into the Wild," Into the Wild Review
",As close as possible to an instant classic and near perfect.,9,0,1,11 November 2019
La La Land," La La Land Review
","I liked (not loved) 70% of the movie, it was fun, it was charming and the characters were great. But those other 30% destroyed my experience with La La Land.",5,3,9,23 January 2020
The Shape of Water," The Shape of Water Review
","For me it is the best movie of the 2017 - 2018 season, because it is very complete. The story is nice, the movie is beautiful, the direction is fantastic. I understand that it's not a movie for everyone and that it has a different vibe, but, for me, it's a work of art.",9,2,8,11 July 2019
The Fighter," The Fighter Review
","I watched this movie in 2011 but can't remember anything about the story, so I'm taking one star from the original rating.
Original review from 2011:: Honestly, I was expecting just another boxing movie, but it's a lot more than that. The casting could not be better. It's early to bet, but I'd keep an eye on Christian Bale for best supporting actor. Everyone is talking about Amy Adams for best supporting actress, she was great, BUT I think Melissa Leo stood out more.",8,0,0,11 November 2019
Up in the Air," Up in the Air Review
","If this review had been written 2/3 through the movie, it would basically consist of compliments and the movie would have received 9 stars, but the last third is weak. The main idea of the movie is original and the cast works; but what's the difference between the Ryan from the beginning and the one at end of the movie? None. Okay, he hit his mileage goal, and helped Natalie with a new job. But beyond that, I see no change. Besides, was it just me who expected something else between Natalie and Dave ?! He seemed to fulfill all the prerequisites cited by her minutes before the scene where they met. I can't complain about everything too. Anna Kendrick deserves credit for her character, she is probably the best, and not by chance this earned her an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress.",7,1,1,11 November 2019
