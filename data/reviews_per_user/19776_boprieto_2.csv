Mission: Impossible III," What Movies Are All About
","This movie gets everything right. The action is fast and furious, the characters are interesting and engaging, and even the love story is effective.Nobody shows the spy game at it's most fun, dangerous, and emotionally gripping as JJ Abrams. This guy is a genius. In his feature debut Abrams revitalizes the disappointing MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE series. Tom Cruise, who can be hit and miss, knocks this one way out of the park. He definitely brings his A-Game to this show. He is a movie star of the first order. It is a testament to the great actors around him and the strong script that Cruise doesn't monopolize the screen. He is THAT magnetic in this movie. Philip Seymour Hoffman offers a more than worthy adversary. Hoffman's Owen Davien is hands down the best super villain since Alan Rickman nearly stole the show as Hans Gruber in DIE HARD. He is always a step ahead of Cruise's super-spy and is scarifyingly ruthless. The scenes between Cruise and Hoffman snap like a live-wire. The action is supercharged but most importantly the characters and story are gripping. You truly care about Ethan and his goals this time around and that gives the action scenes immediacy, energy and intensity that was lacking in the first two missions. A GREAT MOVIE THAT WILL LIVE LONG AFTER IT'S OPENING WEEKEND.",10,0,1,9 May 2006
Once Upon a Time in America," Bloated, Indulgent, Boring
","Sergio Leone is one of my favorite directors. So, it pains me to say it, but I hate the movie. It has a few memorable scenes (Jennifer Conelly's dance, the murder of the cop), but I can't vouch for this movie as a whole. I hate all of the characters not because they are bad people doing bad things, but because they are so goddamn uninteresting. DeNiro is wasted. Only James Woods is given a chance to shine. The story is rambling and the movie is long; which I wouldn't mind if I had characters I was invested in to follow on the journey, but I don't. Leone is a brilliant visual storyteller and he stages many scenes and sequences with his trademark flair, but the story as a whole is no good. It is bloated and indulgent. Leone focuses much time on mundane aspects of these kids' lives to give us a view of their world and invest ourselves with them and their journey, but really, who wants to watch a kid eat a cupcake for five minutes?It's a funny thing, because I'm gonna give this movie a four star rating. I hated it yet I'm still giving it four stars because I feel there is something about this movie that is special. It is a master filmmaker doing a bad movie as only a true genius can. If some hack had made the movie I wouldn't have even written this review.",4,5,12,30 December 2005
