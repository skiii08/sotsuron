Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Incredible!
",All of the reviewers were wrong!  This movie is amazing! The interaction between the live-action and digital characters is extremely realistic. What the critics don't realize is that you can't attach some deep-seated psychological meaning to every breath the characters utter. A definite Oscar winner!,9,0,0,20 May 1999
