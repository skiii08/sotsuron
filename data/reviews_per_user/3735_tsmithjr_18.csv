The Rock," Lots of action, a sit on the edge of your seats thriller
","Nicolas Cage, Sean Connery, Ed Harris and more.  This action thriller is filled with stars and will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Did I say lots of action?  It's one of the best 'pre-computer generated effects' action movies ever made.  A definite must see, if you like that genre.",10,1,2,22 January 2004
The Ring," Absolutly lousy movie. A complete waste of time
","This has to be one of the worst movies I've seen.  The acting was great. The concept behind the movie was great.  The writing/screen play was baseless, totally senseless and lacking of any imagination or quality. The writing/screen play made the difference between a good movie and a bad one. 'The Ring' was bad.  It had no substance and was a complete waste of my time.",1,1,5,8 January 2004
Deja Vu," Great flick until the last few minutes
","I really liked 'Deja Vu' until the last few minutes (more on that later). The acting (Denzel Washington, Val Kilmer, etc.) was great as you'd expect. The story was creative and very different, in a good way - a totally different perspective than anything I've seen or read before. Special effects were good and surprisingly fewer that I'd have expected (or at least that I noticed).Basically, *everything* about 'Deja Vu' was brilliant until (drum roll please) the last few minutes. Then, all of a sudden, all good deeds were undone - and exponentially so, to boot. *Everything* good, all the way from the writers to the director to the actors, to the towel boys etc. it was all simply obliterated in a few brief minutes with a really lame and poorly executed ending that wasn't fitting to end a pre-schooler's first film (sorry if I insulted any pre-schoolers). I was just *so* disappointed in the ending that only writings the size of an epic novel would fill my despair. I'll give only one example - so I don't spoil anything. And that is... Since when can a blazer type vehicle get from 0 to 'flip over at spectacularly *high* speed' in about a 5 foot distance? This is just one of a multitude of sins we observed in the final minutes of 'Deja Vu'. Many other, more serious flaws can't be mentioned without introducing possible spoilers.Seriously, I loved the movie until very close to the end. I would have debated between a 7 and maybe a 9 out of 10. But the ending was so poorly conceived (did I say that? - it was never conceived, they just took some old 'Dukes of Hazzard' footage or something like that and used it - sorry 'Dukes of Hazzard' fans, no foul intended) after a brilliant first 100+ minutes of film, that I just couldn't give it better than a 6, and I wanted to give it even less, I was so mad.My bottom line final thoughts - I just can't get over a movie being so brilliantly conceived and executed by so many people. And then at the very end, everyone said 'hey this has worked in other lame movies'. Did they not understand what they had created? It was genius up until the ending. I really believe that whoever was involved with the first 100+ minutes of the movie plot/storyline must have had absolutely no involvement in the last 10 minutes or so of the movie.The ending was a disgrace! But the overall movie was a success!",6,0,1,10 October 2007
Pirate Radio," Rock and Roll rules!!
","Pirate Radio is a great comedy/drama and is fun to watch. If you like classic 60's rock you'll be sure to reminisce as you watch. Pirate Radio is a cool story about a floating 'pirate' radio station off the coast of England (apparently ships like this existed back in the 60's) which is broadcasting to about half the British population. The authorities don't like it and plot to stop them from broadcasting. It has the cool DJ, played by Rhys Ifans, the young kid, played by Tom Sturridge and I have to say, the entire cast is fantastically cast. There's GREAT music from the 60's such as 'My Generation', 'A Whiter Shade Of Pale', 'All Day And All Of The Night' and soooo many more excellent songs! And during the credits the album covers are worth watching. They're like watching a greatest hits of the past forty or so years and sample the entire spectrum. Those shown include U2, King Crimson, Santana, The Beatles, The Black Eyed Peas, Eminem, Paul Simon, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Duran Duran, James Taylor, REM, Stevie Wonder, Nirvana, Meat Loaf, Inxs, the Kinks, Kraftwerk, Guns N Roses, Abba etc., etc., etc. There are so many more but you get the drift. You'll probably see some of the album covers and remember when.Pirate Radio is a great story and will keep you in your 'happy place' while watching it. You'll have fun watching it.",9,2,2,1 November 2010
Ed Wood," An inspiration for anyone who wants to keep on fighting for their goals.
","Tim Burton and Johnny Depp hit this perfectly.  Ed Wood is an inspiration to anyone who has a goal and wants to achieve it.  In brief, the movie is about a movie director who is a complete failure.  And despite it all, he keeps finding a way to finance and make his next movie (again and again) despite the fact that they're all horrible.  We could all take a lesson from this movie.  Never give up, keep on looking for a way to accomplish your goals. Excellent movie.  Well done Tim Burton and Johnny Depp!!!",10,0,0,22 January 2004
The Last Song," A really poor storyline and poor acting
","Miley Cyrus fans might hate me for saying this, but the makers of 'The Last Song' should have hired a real actress for the lead role. Miley obviously doesn't have the talent or know how to act. I had nothing against her, but in this, the first role I've seen her act in, it seemed like she was just playing herself and not playing any part that was written for her.That said, 'The Last Song' is a bust. It's a set of tired old recycled and clich√©d experiences and really isn't worth the 107 minutes it takes to watch it. For the most part the storyline is so tired and old. And after watching it I was also disappointed that Greg Kinnear had signed up for it. That I can remember, I've always liked his acting and the roles he chose. But in this case, the writing was so, so poor that even if the makers of 'The Last Song' signed up the best actors in Hollywood it couldn't save this film. They'd have to find some writers who were at a minimum mediocre-ish in order to improve this story.All I can say is save yourself and watch something else.",4,36,53,31 January 2011
Final Destination 2," Excellent sequel a great thriller
","If you liked 'Final Destination' you'll really like 'Final Destination 2'. I remember the commercials for this one and was afraid they were ruining the thrill of this sequel.  So I didn't see it in the theaters.  I was wrong. If anything the commercials used the film footage to mislead you, so that the surprises were even greater.For what 'Final Destination 2' is trying to do, they do it perfectly.  From the script, to the acting to the directing.  This was a tough score for me. While it doesn't rate up there with the the best films of all time.  In every aspect, they perfectly accomplished what they set out to do.  It's a Thriller, full of a lot of unpredictable turns and surprises, and with great action.  They wasted no time, the movie starts, they get right into it, and it keeps on at pretty much full pace until it's done.",10,26,40,15 February 2004
"I, Robot"," The plot is a complete joke. What a waste!!!
","I marked this a a 'SPOILER' because it contains 'potential' spoilers. In my opinion, they're not really movie spoilers.There are great parts to 'I, Robot' but the plot, in general, is really poor and full of holes. You're left with tons (literally) of questions as to how the movie got to where it was. For instance, *potential SPOILER* what motive would Bruce Greenwood have for, in effect, ruining the name of the company (he just took over) is running and everything it stands for.Definite *SPOILER follows*... You can see a mile away that Greenwoods going too die by the hands of his creations. Your only hope, which is against all writing of every part of the movie, is that Greenwood will be around at the end to answer some of the many questions as to WHY!!! The CGI in the movie is very good, and Will Smith as always, is a good actor. But too many questions are left and in the end, after watching the movie, you're left with a huge void to fill...Definitely not a movie I would watch again.",4,1,1,24 September 2005
Ratatouille," Ratatouille was fantastic!!!
","I loved 'Ratatouille'!!! What a great movie 'Ratatouille' was/is!!! The animation was outstanding (as it could be for 2008) and the story, writing and acting/voice work was fantastic! As for the 'movie futures...', what a great movie for the ages 'Ratatouille' will be/become!!!Everything about the movie 'Ratatouille' is outstandingly done. Through the ages there have been many innovations. We've seen the stellar improvements from 'Snow White' (which was innovative in itself) to those in the form of 'Beauty and the Beast', 'Roger Rabbit', 'Toy Story', 'Cars', 'The Incredibles' and many more as Pixar only begins (in 2005 - 2008) it's future roll towards prominence.The actors are terrific, Brian Dennehy is fantastic as 'Ratatouille's' dad. Janeane Garofalo (I never would have guessed it was her), Peter O'Toole, Patton Oswalt and Ian Holm (again, I couldn't have guessed it was him) were outstanding in their work! All the writing, sound effects simply everything is 'spot on' as the Brit's say. I can't give this film a 10 out of 10, but I can easily give 'Ratatouille' an 8 out of 10.Without my possible rant, I fear that my words can't possibly come to match the quality of the work which was put into making 'Ratatouille'. But that being said, 'Ratatouille' was a perfect hit in the making of movies in the 2007 era.",8,0,1,24 April 2008
2012," After all the buildup 2012 is very disappointing.
","I was really looking forward to seeing 2012. Unfortunately the film didn't live up to its billing and was instead a disastrous 'joke' of a disaster movie. There are a large number of spectacular special effects throughout the movie and they are fantastic! For those we were truly grateful. And there's some great acting as John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Thandie Newton, Danny Glover and Oliver Platt are all terrific.But while sure, there's potential devastation if something like what's premised in 2012 occurred. The ridiculous story line with the ludicrous number of over the top last minute escape sequences and close calls that even Indiana Jones couldn't survive make this film very hard to swallow.There are too many preposterous calamities and forced 'sit on the edge of your seats' events like telling a plane that they don't have clearance to take off while the airport is being annihilated is foolish.After all the buildup 2012 is very disappointing",4,1,2,18 July 2010
The Hurt Locker," Kathryn Bigelow did her usual great job!
","'If I'm going to die, I'm going to die comfortable.' ‚Äì Sergeant First Class William James.The Hurt Locker was a great 'suspense, action, war, drama'. It does a very good job of showing us the 'unsung' inside of an American bomb disposal squad in Iraq and the 'craziness' of Sergeant James in particular, as they count down the number of days left in Bravo Company's rotation.In comparison to past films such as 'Point Break', 'Strange Days' and 'K19: The Widowmaker', which were all excellent films, Kathryn Bigelow did her usual excellent job of bringing us to a point of view we hadn't experienced or maybe considered before. Can you imagine wearing one of those bomb disposal suits every day in what's probably over 100 degree heat? The sad part of watching The Hurt Locker was that it had been so built up, that by the time I viewed it, nothing could have met my expectations. Kind of like Avatar, which I didn't see for a couple of months. By the time I saw it, I loved it, but it couldn't meet expectations.The Hurt Locker is a great film about an American bomb disposal unit in Iraq. It has all the features you'd expect in a movie focused on a singular aspect of a war (in this case bomb disposal). It has all the intensity, suspense, personal tragedy, stress, male bonding and personal conflicts you'd expect if you were in a tight unit who eats, sleeps and breaths each others 'everything' for 365 days.Kathryn Bigelow did a great job of showing us the inner workings of a bomb disposal unit in Iraq where every day is a new problem, but also the same old thing¬Ö Every time that they go out, it's a life or death struggle. Had any of us considered the concerns of a bomb disposal unit before? Basically, for them it's a loop, the same old same old. But if they make a mistake it means someones life.",8,5,10,25 September 2010
Transformers," Outstanding!!!!
","I was not prepared for what I saw. I really had very low expectations for the Transformers. I thought it was a 'kids' movie, so I waited until it was on DirecTv (in this case, Cinemax). That said, the Transformers was outstanding!!! I want to give it a '10' but I can't justify that. That said, it's the best SCI-FI/action with CGI that I can think of. And yes, in a different sort of way, it beats 'The Matrix'. HOWEVER, that said, I'd easily rate 'The Matrix' higher. But, depending on what you're looking for, the Transformers rules! The CGI for the Transformers is ridiculously perfect. It's better than anything I've seen. It's so realistic. Yes, I've seen many of the 'great' CGI efforts, but in total, this is right up there with the best. And the acting, which almost takes second stage, is absolutely flawless. Shia LaBeouf is terrific, Rachael Taylor is a great new find and does a perfect job, Megan Fox is also perfect (as is the rest of the cast). I hope this isn't a spoiler (I'd mark my message as such, if I thought it was) but the music is perfectly timed - in a 'Michael Bay' sort of way. I'm really falling in 'like' with Michael Bay's stuff. All I can say is that you'll enjoy and are in for a pleasant surprise with the Transformers. It's a great family (older) and adult film.",9,1,3,13 May 2008
Alice in Wonderland," Alice In Wonderland is wonderful!
","Tim Burton's adaptation of 'Alice In Wonderland' is wonderful! Knowing it's a Tim Burton, Johnny Depp movie, which gives you an idea of what to expect. The first 10 minutes are a warm up before we started to see Tim Burton's vision of 'Alice In Wonderland'. After that, the talents of Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Crispin Glover, Anne Hathaway and the voices of Alan Rickman, Christopher Lee, Michael Sheen among others are unleashed. This was my introduction to Mia Wasikowska who played Alice and she did a great job. I look forward to seeing her in the future.I have to say, it must be fun working for Tim Burton, imaginations must run wild! Tim Burton did a good job of keeping to the main points of this version of the Louis Caroll story. 'Alice In Wonderland' was fun to watch, with great music and outstanding CGI. While there is some animated violence, I'd think this movie is safe for almost any age.",8,1,2,6 October 2010
Drag Me to Hell," If you like horror with some occasional humor, see this
","'Drag Me To Hell' is a very good horror/drama flick with a little bit of smart humor. Drag Me To Hell is fresh, exciting and frequently has you jumping or on the edge of your seat.Quite frankly it's not hard for a good horror film to keep you on the edge of your seat. That said, yesterday I saw the 2009 remake of Halloween II (a complete disgrace compared to the original 1981 version) and it's sad how poorly that remake was executed (I would have expected at least a minimal effort from Rob Zombie).The creative forces behind Drag Me To Hell did a great job of intertwining a new(?) couple's lives with a spell cast on her, with her efforts to defeat the evilly conjured beast, with a meeting of the folks and more. There's suspense, good acting and very good special effects in store.If you like horror films, check out 'Drag Me To Hell'. And I guess you can say that you'll have to drag me to hell before I see the 2009 version of Halloween II again.",7,1,2,18 October 2010
The Last King of Scotland," Very good movie, but paints too humanist a view of one who ordered hundreds of thousands killed.
","This movie was great. But it used too much 'license' in the story. As always, Forest Whitaker was outstanding!! However I was disappointed that a lot of the historical aspects were glossed over in the movie. Granted, you probably have to be over 40 to remember Idi Amin, but everything in the news at the time indicated that he was a brutal dictator. And the documentary included with the DVD does capture some of that (it does a better job than the movie of spelling out what he did).This movie did try to paint a more humanist view of him. But from following the news in the US (in the late 70's), Idi Amin was in effect, the murderer (or ordered the killing) of hundreds of thousands of his countrymen. While I don't need to see the blood and gore that he invoked. The movie glossed over many over the important brutal aspects which portrayed his rule. It barely mentioned the mass graves which are his legacy.One thing I did learn was that the British put him in power. And for that I can thank the movie. But both my wife and I were left still wondering what drove him to order the killings of so many. Even if it had been speculative, we would have been left with some 'educated guess' as to what drove Amin to have hundreds of thousands killed.Most of the story just took too much 'film/story makers license' for me to be left satisfied with it. I could rant on about that but it happens too often now so I won't. I'd still buy the DVD again, it was a good story. But I'd make sure to watch the documentary, it's not that long and gives a more accurate picture of what happened in Uganda during that period.",8,1,3,6 July 2007
Inception," Outstanding! The writers, director and cast had to have a blast making Inception!
","All I can say is the writers, director and cast must have had a *LOT* of fun with Inception. Some of the creativity was really out there and just so much fun to enjoy.Very few movies are worth a 10 or even an 8 or a 9 (in my book). But Inception was easily worth a 10, it was fantastic! So many movies waste time with filler stuff that has little or no bearing on the movie. Inception didn't waste a single minute, needing every one of it's carefully crafted 148 minutes.Inception started off a little slower as it needed to build its back story. Basically a little better than an average movie to start, but not an overwhelming beginning. But as it went on the pace picked up and the movie slowly built to a fantastic and fast paced crescendo.I'm not normally a DiCaprio fan, but he, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe and the others all helped make up a great all star cast.I was lucky enough to see Inception in the theater and I'm so glad I did. I'd have hated to have had any 'home' interruptions or distractions while I was watching it. A job well done to everyone involved!",10,2,6,22 September 2010
The Blind Side," A wonderful heart warming story.
","What a fantastic and heart warming story The Blind Side is! It's based on the true story of Michael Oher. Michael had no advantages as he grew up with his drug addicted mother. When the story begins he's homeless and is taken in by the very kind and giving Tuohy's. Michael has few skills and appeared to have a bleak future before meeting the Tuohys. The Tuohys support Michael in every way as Leigh Anne, played by Sandra Bullock, spends caring time with Michael and helps him grow and expresses his interests. They even hire a tutor for Michael.I've always loved watching Sandra Bullock act and she didn't disappoint as she earned the Best Actress Oscar in this very convincing performance. She plays the incredibly charitable, nice and yet strong willed Leigh Anne. And in the movie Leigh Anne is definitely a handful. This was a standout performance you'll love to see.",9,0,2,10 October 2010
Am√©lie," The little things in life matter.
","The little things in life matter.Amelie is a terrifically heart warming story about a young woman who leads a very ordinary life and of those ordinary people surrounding her. And Amelie has a nice romantic overtone to it as well.As a young woman Amelie doesn't have a lot going on, other than a VERY ACTIVE imagination. Amelie is naive but very kind and giving as she tries to make others in her life happy. But don't treat badly anyone she cares about. If you do, you may have an unpleasant surprise or two in store for you.I confess I was a little concerned when I saw that Amelie was 100% subtitled. So many times the people doing the subtitling fail to make it easy to read. In this case, Amelie's subtitling was very easy to read, which helped make the movie that much more enjoyable.One lesson to take away from Amelie is there's a lot going on around us. Maybe it's time to smell the roses.",8,1,4,17 November 2010
