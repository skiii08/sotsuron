Source Code," Say: 'Life if beautiful!' with the 'Source code'
","'Source code' is shocking film. The shocking in all senses of this word. So high-quality movie that grasps the spirit. This film - individuality, bright stain gray weight cinema's plankton. It's especial, unique, with a highlight. Exist many movies in which follow the idea: 'life is beautiful, and we have to accept it as it is'. But in the 'Source code' this thing is showed somehow in especial way, ambiguously, if I can say so. This is very important because when you watch this idea is expressed simply and it's banal, the idea don't take rood to you. After watching just this movie I understand that life such amazing with its failures and successes. Life is life and any program like source code won't come back it. You can make its illusion but not real. This is because we have to appreciate it. This is sense.The movie haven't made to trifles but it doesn't matter. Jake Gyllenhaal is unbelievable. All the film turns around him. His performance forces to feel unusual emotions and things. Duncan Jones is amazing and all people who made film.",9,0,3,3 April 2011
