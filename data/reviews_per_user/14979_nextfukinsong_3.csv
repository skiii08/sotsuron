The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Before, after and during its time
","A movie that I can start at any point in my life, as long as there's a point to be made. I have gotten to the annoying point where I know the lines before they happen, but I usually have the respect to only whisper them to myself. This movie swallows up what it feels like to be in high school and spits it into a mirror. When being nothing feels like everything. When you thought there was no one cool left to meet. And in some time where you haven't heard the best David Bowie song ever. The time in life where there are no answers, but if you're lucky, the questions at least become more interesting. And we are all infinite.",10,4,6,7 September 2018
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Write about us...
","I have put this movie on and fallen asleep to it at least 47 times. It sticks close enough to the original book, I can't complain about that. This movie feels like I'm sharing the greatest and most horrible secrets with my best friends, every chance that I get to watch it. The music may have been different, the truck almost the same, but we have all stood up in the back of a truck going 100+ MPH and feeling infinite. I'm just glad someone was able to put it into words, then a movie. I also think the acting is superb. The violence is also too real at times, but it can't defeat us.",10,1,1,22 May 2019
Garden State," Have fun exploring the infinite abyss
","I thought nothing of this movie after about 10 minutes. Luckily, it plays out like a beautiful r.e.m. dream, lasting about an hour and a half. A fresh take on death of a family member and the pain that it brings up at the wrong times. Enter the imperfect perfect girl, Natalie Portman. Watch this movie during a rainstorm. It brings me back to being a child and sneaking into the attic to listen to raindrops falling on the roof. I always leave feeling cleansed and ready to face normal life of being a waiter with dreams. I'm so glad I gave this movie a chance. It's now one of my favorites.",10,1,1,8 September 2018
