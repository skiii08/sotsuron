Skyfall," Promising
","Skyfall ..... Somebody told me it's not all that great ... Fr tat person ----> Bond Fan always overlooks the Flaws.... Well that doesn't mean I'm going to give a biased opinion ... But i think Skyfall is a transitional phase for the Bond Series. It changes the course of Series. Let me start From the beginning....' Let the sky fall, when it crumbles, We will stand tall And face it all together ' Adele has done wonders with Opening song, fascinating. Oh !how can we forget the Director, 'Sam Mendes' .... He showed the vision to make the Bond realistic, emotional, vulnerable. The Oscar winning director, according to me has made the way fr Skyfall to get into Oscars. The Plot gives us betrayal, revenge, Destruction, Pace and Edge on the seat .... The movie goes beyond just another mission ... It goes into the past and reveals more of Bond's back story and traumatized childhood. Daniel Craig gave Justice to the character so did Judi Dench as 'M'. Ralph Fiennes is noticeable even in his short role. I hope he carries the Legacy of such important role. Now the villain, Silva (Javier Bardem)..... He portrays the complexity of psychopath with such ease, 'HATS OFF' ! What a dialogue delivery and cold blooded killer eyes, Quite Memorable...... The locations are spectacular, picturesque. The Art Direction and background score r satisfactory. Cinematography is stunning whether it is skyscrapers of modern Shanghai or the bleak, ancient moorland of Scotland. The movie never loses the pace neither the grip on the plot. Rest assured ... movie gives ample of stunts and thrills, Beautiful Women and the Hope to return with the BANG !!!",8,2,7,26 September 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Remarkable
","'The Dark Knight Rises' ... **** Very Good Movie ... The Bow to d legend Christopher Nolan for his work as director and screenplay writer ... Hats Off to Hans Zimmer for his Ambient Background score ...The movie has exceptional visual and sound effects ... a true bonanza for d senses .... The Batman Movies r intriguing Mostly becoz of their Villains ... This movie also provides for the Powerful, more psychopath and in his own words ' not pure but necessary Evil' ..... 'BANE' ... Fascinating Acting and body language nd d freakish voice ... credits to Tom Hardy .... He broked d soul of our Batman ..... The Bruce Wayne is mostly in d Introspection nd Guilt becoz of d Tragedies of the past ... But he has to rise nd Thou shall he Rise ... The plot and story goes Beyond the boundaries of comic adaptation ... It provides for d deeper philosophy of Resurrection of d Gotham City and social crisis of the city ... D 'Bat' mobile and Gadgets have shown their charm again ... The Climax is Surprising ... Christian Bale is d best batman till date, undoubtedly ... The List is long but Michaeal Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman and Chicks in d Flick have acted exceptionally ... Joseph Gordon Levitt is promising and memorable too ... Movie has tremendous Pace ... Indeed this is d End of the Trilogy. Not extraordinary like The Dark Knight but still remarkable .",9,3,5,26 September 2013
