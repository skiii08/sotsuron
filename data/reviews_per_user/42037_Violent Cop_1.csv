Scarface," One of the greatest crime epics of all time!!
","Brian De Palma's brutal but epic masterpiece. This film will drain you of every emotion you have, I literally felt tired after watching it, easily Pacino's best performance!!!This a must see for any fan of the genre.",10,0,0,28 November 1999
