The Blair Witch Project," Decent... but empty
","Like most others I saw this... I had to debate between Bowfinger (which from what I heard I'm not upset I missed it), Detroit Rock City, and this movie. We flipped a coin (deciding Bowfinger out) and it landed heads... off to Blair Witch.  Definitely original.  Got you into their minds, you felt like you were there with them.  They should get an award or something for originality and execution of it all, because it was definately good in that aspect.  But around halfway (the more I think about it), the dumber the kids got (not unlike other movies *cough*anyhorrormovie*cough*) the less scary it was.  Taking the camera everywhere with them?  How stupid is that?  She's scared to death yet she can film it all.  And EVERY time there is a scary noise outside the get outside and look at it (and film it!).  I don't know about you, but anytime I hear something scary like that, I keep my butt inside and pray it doesn't come for me.  And I don't scream at it... I shut the heck up and don't do anything.  Three horror movie cliches.  Then there is the house.  They suddenly find this house with their friend Josh screaming inside it.  They've heard the legends.  They decide 'hey I'm scared to death, let's go inside and FILM IT!'  I'm not gunna ruin it for those who have seen it but go ahead and think up your line for talking to the theater and asking for your $4.50 back.  I hate to say it but maybe with more money or maybe a better more hollywood company :( would have made it better.  I just say that because maybe with more money or a more experienced group, it would have been better.",4,0,3,15 August 1999
