Blade Runner 2049," Ambitious, but flawed sequel to a well deserved classic
","As someone who was around to see the original Blade Runner in theaters back in 1982, it is undeniable that it was a classy box office bust buried under the onslaught of the more emotionally accessible E.T. It did, however, even at that time have a strong critical and cult following. I myself found the noir-ish sci-fi effort initially beautiful to behold, but rather slow. It improved dramatically for me on subsequent viewing as both its screenplay and characters proved to be more intellectually revealing with each visit, until I came to regard it as an undervalued classic. A view that many seemed to reach as well.The sequel is suitably set decades after the original and focuses on Ryan Gosling's K, a blade runner/replicant who hunts down and kills older models who apparently do not know their place. In the opening mission, he stumbles onto a secret that threatens the very fabric of the dystopian society in which the action is set.There are many commendable things about this sequel and also suitable reasons to carp. Director Denis Villenauve recaptures some of the tone and feel of the original and kudos for taking a stab at branching the universe out. However, as visually captivating as the sequel is, it never captures the breathtaking kaleidoscopic awe of the original. The original set its action in a nightmare neon-filled landscape, while too much of the sequel just seems to be set in white and gray foggy daylight. Villeneuve also abandons the noir detective tone for something more philosophical with decidedly mixed results.The length of the film is almost absurdly self-indulgent. While I was never bored, there were a lot of snoozers around me and people checking their watch. Entire passages are wasted on misdirection and stabs at universe building which are hit and miss. This is also the first film since Meet Joe Black where there are so many pauses between lines that you want to shout at the characters to speak already. Also, I get that the relationship between Gosling and Ana de Armas as his virtual reality consort that he gets to take around with him is supposed to hint at his loneliness, but both the character and subplot take up too much time for too little payoff. Those looking for edge-of-your seat action would do well to look elsewhere.Gosling is adequate in the lead - solid yet unspectacular. Too much time is wasted on him brooding. We already suspect from the start that there is more to him emotionally than the surface dictates, but need it take so long to reveal it? The supporting cast is largely strong, even when not used to the best effect. Robin Wright is pitch-perfect as Gosling's no-nonsense human boss. Jared Leto overacts ridiculously in two lengthy scenes as the villain of the piece, but Sylvia Hoek is first-rate as his kick-ass majordomo. Ironically Ford, who was accused by many of sleepwalking through the original, kicks the film into high gear with a rugged, droll and sympathetic performance that comes late in the film (perhaps a bit too late?).Some of the motivations seem murky to me. I get that Leto is a loon with a God complex and I have a hunch that he would like to dissect the film's McGuffin, but I was never sure what Hoeks intentions were towards the same. I think some of this could have been developed more and other things could have been eliminated entirely without impacting the film.Also, I was less than thrilled over the depiction of the majority of the female characters in this film. The original featured a smidge of nudity from Joanna Cassidy's replicant stripper, but both Sean Young and Daryl Hannah are captivating and iconic in their parts. The sequel is awash in gratuitous female nudity from start to finish and it seems that most of the women are some kind of pleasure fembots or underlings onhand to do the bidding of the male characters. Ironically, when Gosling showers twice, the camera is very careful to stay above the waist and there do not seem to be any male pleasure bots for the female population. Are human women largely extinct in the future? This sequel is ambitious and sometimes fascinating, but I never felt the wonder I did when watching the original film, so I am uncertain that this sequel was necessary. It says something that the most inspiring moment is when an iconic character from the original film makes an unexpected appearance for a brief cameo and literally jars you from a stupor.",6,2,5,31 October 2017
Vertigo," Not one of Hitchcock's best, despite its 'rediscovery' in recent years
","Bring up the title Vertigo now and no doubt cinema elites will immediately fall into rapturous descriptions of its brilliance. This is interesting largely because for many years, Vertigo did not even rank very highly in the Hitchcock milieu until its re-evaluation as a 'classic' in the past two decades.For those unfamiliar, Vertigo tells the story of John 'Scottie' Ferguson, a police detective whose brush with death while chasing a culprit over San Francisco rooftops results in another police officer falling to his death while trying to save Scottie and Scottie's now being afflicted with a paralyzing fear of heights. On leave from the department and struggling with his recovery, Scottie is offered a detective assignment by a former college acquaintance Gavin Elster to shadow his wife Madeleine, who he fears is losing her mind and may be suicidal. Scottie falls in love with the enigmatic blond Madeleine, but finds himself unable to stop her when she races to the top of a convent bell tower and takes a swan dive off. Emotionally fragile and psychologically shattered, Scottie develops new purpose when he runs across shopgirl Judy Barton who physically resembles the late Madeleine, and he starts to remake her in Madeleine's image with tragic results for all involved.Strangely, for many years, if you asked anyone to name their favorite Hitchcock films, there was a strong chance that Vertigo would not even crack the top ten. Now, it seems marketing makes it essential to include it at the top, but I am uncertain it earns this newfound glory. Certainly the film contains some of Hitchcock's hallmarks and some notable elements. The cinematography is gorgeous and Bernard Herrmann's haunting and menacing score is one of his best. Hitchcock also includes some memorable dream-like sequences. That said, I find little else to recommend the film.The film starts off well enough and it seems that it is gearing up to be one of Hitchcock's trademark mysteries, but then the mystery element is completely dropped midway through and the film becomes an overview on unhealthy obsession. There are no real surprises on the road to the film's tortured climax. Anyone familiar with prior Hitchcock work and genre conventions will know exactly what is going on long before Scottie lumberingly figures things out. Hitchcock lets the cat out of the bag on the Madeleine/Judy connection fairly quickly (in fact, almost immediately after introducing Judy), so there is no chance for the viewer to play around with various views on it.Hitchcock's work with the actors here is more miss than hit. James Stewart is an actor I normally love, but I find him a real endurance test here as Scottie. He is sympathetic enough in the opening as a man trying to conquer his fears and get his life back on track. Unfortunately, he starts to grate once on the tail of Madeleine. His stab at conveying his increasingly unhealthy interest in Madeleine largely has him glowering at the camera and furrowing his brow much like someone combating intestinal discomfort. There are endless scenes of him behind the wheel of his car with this fixed expression. The fact that there is several decades age difference between Stewart and leading lady, Kim Novak, is made even more uncomfortable by the fact that Stewart often looks old enough to be her grandfather rather than her romantic foil. Novak is beautiful, but stiff and undoubtedly directed by Hitchcock to be the embodiment of his trademark blonde ice queen. Barbara Bel Geddes has little more than a cameo as Stewart's girlfriend, who sticks by him through his rehab and then disappears without a mention.Another problem with the film is that it is hard to be emotionally involved or have sympathy with the players. Scottie is initially sympathetic and focuses as our entry into this world of voyeurism and obsession. By contrast, Madeleine is so calculatedly weird that the narrative purposely never allows one to get a handle on her solely so that Hitchcock can manipulate the viewer (and Scottie). After meeting Judy later on, Scottie turns into a rampaging and unlikable jerk. Judy clearly likes him, but balks at Scottie trying to turn her into a replica of a dead woman, and Scottie demonstrates no remorse about forcing this woman to bow to his will. Worse, we are made aware fairly early on and Scottie ultimately learns that there was indeed a well-orchestrated murder plot in play, yet both Hitchcock and Scottie seem completely unconcerned and ambiguous about justice for the victim or bringing the perpetrator to the law. Instead, Scottie (and Hitchcock by extension) seems far more obsessed with bullying and terrorizing the increasingly frightened Judy, who now elicits more sympathy than does the unbalanced unappealing Scottie.I also have a real problem with the conclusion. Even many of its most devoted fans will admit that the conclusion is unsatisfying, downbeat and absurd. The murder plot is not resolved at all. If the underlying theme is that all men are beasts underneath, then Hitchcock undermines that by taking too much delight in the psychological and physical abuse heaped on Novak's Madeleine and Judy characters. Perhaps we are to be impressed that Scottie's acrophobia is cured, but the fact that it takes a needless and ridiculously staged further death in order to cure it makes that a bitter victory - especially considering that Scottie lost our respect long ago so that few will even care.No - I have to say that Vertigo does not cut it as a classic. As for Hitchcock, Vertigo falls well short of some of Hitchcock's many lofty peaks. I would go so far as to say that it pales in comparison with Rear Window, Rebecca, North by Northwest, Psycho, Strangers on a Train, Shadow of a Doubt, The Lady Vanishes, The Birds, Foreign Correspondent, Saboteur, Spellbound, The Man Who Knew Too Much and Notorious.",3,6,13,29 June 2017
Gravity," Nice try, but sublimely overrated
","Take a compelling concept, a fairly convincing representation of things that can go wrong in outer space, a first-rate lead and noted director and you get Gravity, arguably the most overrated film of 2013.The film opens with some astronauts, including Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, doing some repairs in outer space. When a shower of space debris leaves two of them adrift and the rest dead, they must try to make their way to a close by space station against the odds and in the inhospitable environment of space.I enjoy good science fiction and with the reviews and pedigree on this film, I really wanted to love it. And there are certainly some very good things it has going. Its convincing visual splendor for one. It also hammers home the constant danger of space travel and will undoubtedly cure anyone with fantasies of such to think twice.Additionally, it features a truly marvelous central performance by Bullock. Because Bullock is known notably for comedies, it often takes people by surprise when she turns up in a straight dramatic role and hits a home run, but despite some career missteps Bullock is a reliable actress. She makes her character here sympathetic, intelligent and gutsy even when quivering with fear, and even manages to gloss over some of the story's annoying aspects regarding her character. By contrast, Clooney is on screen so little and basically plays himself that it seems pointless to even judge his performance.The film sports a brief running time, but feels like its double. The first time chaos hits and we get a diversity of vertigo inducing shots of gloved hands desperately reaching out to grab hold of flimsy objects to prevent them reeling off into the void of space, it is disorienting and scary. Unfortunately, the film repeats this same theme over and over and over again. A character will reach the next safe haven, only to have the debris shower show up again and force them to vacate for yet another safe haven, complete with lots of grunting and desperate grabs for flimsy pieces of metal. It gets old pretty quickly.While director Alfonso Cuaron has successfully created an outer space that is intimidating, he is far less adept at choreographing what happens in that background. By the time our central character is on her third failing haven and must again escape while disaster erupts around her, you have seen the steps so often that they no longer hold much suspense. In fact, the film becomes ever more ponderous with each repetitive set-up.As intelligent and courageous as Bullock's character is, she is still stuck with a rather familiar and irritating back story. We find out during the course of the film, that her father wanted a boy, she was a single mother and her daughter is dead from an accident. The film distributes these tidbits from the character in such a way that its veiled implication seems that if she does not safely make a return to earth, at least she is only a scientist without a family. Her character even grudgingly seems to imply such a thing herself at one point. It is pretty annoying to hear such bilge come out of a character's mouth and one could be sure that they would never have written lines for a male star - like Clooney - in such a way. The fact that they were likable and in such dire straits should be enough to wish them to escape, but positing a position where one laments that she failed as a wife and mother (and was a disappointment to her dad), so maybe her not being saved would be alright.The worst decision is one that sacrifices what realism the film has in a sequence that stops the film dead and removes the viewer completely from it. At the two-thirds point, a 'ghost' shows up at an opportune moment to advise Bullock on how to solve a tricky problem. The sequence comes from out of so far left field that jaws will hit the floor. I think filmmakers of this brand of sci-fi really need to address whether they want to be scientifically authentic or whether they want to include faux-theological overtones and affirmations of spirituality sops to be thrown to the faithful, but they cannot do both and maintain an undisturbed air of science fact. The film never really recovers from this segment, which reminds us in no uncertain terms that we are watching 'only a movie'.",5,2,5,12 October 2015
As Good as It Gets," Uneven dramedy with overrated performances
","I have to admit that I find this film absurdly overrated. Another of director James L. Brooks' 'dramedies' the result achieves no where near the success of Terms of Endearment nor even the middling charms of Broadcast News. Obsessive-compulsive author Jack Nicholson goes into a panic attack when the one waitress (Helen Hunt) he can tolerate at his favorite restaurant is missing time due to her ill son. He gets involved in her personal life and develops romantic aspirations for her. Meanwhile, the gay artist next-door (Greg Kinnear) that Nicholson lives to belittle is beaten to a pulp. In dire straits, he asks Nicholson to accompany him on a road trip home to beg for support, and Nicholson agrees so long as he can make Hunt feel beholden to accompany them in an effort to further his tentative romantic impulses. Kinnear is likable and one cannot possibly become invested in a road trip which will logically lead to him humbling himself at the feet of people who have spurned him in the past (whether or not that actually happens is irrelevant, it still is the initial goal of the trip). The biggest problem with the film rests with the depiction of the Nicholson character and the central relationship with Hunt. He is intermittently funny with his caustic remarks, but he targets everyone indiscriminately. Cutting humor can be funny when it is puncturing holes in pompous characters a la The Marx Brothers, but far less so when it is used to figuratively eviscerate a fragile battered man. Although Nicholson does end up helping people, it is usually a by-product of his own selfishness. Further, a romantic relationship between Nicholson and Hunt as presented here is ridiculous. Not only is Nicholson old enough to be her father (an element which is not even commented upon), but they legitimately seem to have nothing in common other than her tolerance of him. Her last-minute change-of-heart at the conclusion seems ill-advised and one can easily see her changing her mind again 5 minutes after the conclusion. The fact that Nicholson and Hunt have non-existent screen chemistry apparently did not deter filmgoers and critics. Nicholson can be a great actor, but in the decade prior to About Schmidt he was largely coasting on his laurels and continually reverted to playing a glorified nut. He does so for the umpteenth time here and for some reason watching him do this yet again prompted an Oscar win. Perhaps conceivable in a weak year, but when his co-nominees included Peter Fonda, Dustin Hoffman, Robert Duvall, Matt Damon for Good Will Hunting, and strong contenders such as Leonardo DiCaprio and the male leads of L.A. Confidential were overlooked altogether, the win smacks of laziness. I am not a fan of Helen Hunt. I consider her to be the most mundane and uncharismatic of the modern crop of critically lauded actresses. She is an incredibly boring foil for Nicholson. She is believable as a put-upon waitress, but far less so as his romantic interest or as an unexpected muse for Kinnear's artistic resurgence. She inexplicably won an Oscar against the likes of Judi Dench, Julie Christie, Kate Winslet and Helena Bonham-Carter  all having a banner year. Ironically, both of the leads are out-acted by the dog next door. Kinnear, stuck in the all too familiar nice sexless gay guy role, provides the film's only natural performance. An overlong, unevenly acted and conceived mishmash that fails to gel together into a satisfying whole.",4,2,7,29 November 2006
The English Patient," A romance as dry as the desert in which it is set
","First off, this movie is certainly one of the most beautifully shot that I have seen in a while. The desert vistas and gorgeous Italian scenery are beautiful to behold. Then again, there are far better films that provide these same elements.Director Anthony Minghella puts together all of the elements which should have resulted in a haunting romantic spectacle, but someone forgot to strike the sparks required to set it ablaze. Nurse Juliette Binoche (whose bone structure contributes her performance) stays behind at a secluded abandoned monastery in the waning days of WW2 in order to care for enigmatic burn victim Ralph Fiennes, who slowly conveys his sad tale of illicit love, betrayal and tragedy which led to his current predicament.There are a number of problems which plague the film. First, is its self-indulgent length. I have nothing against lengthy films or miniseries, so long as there is a suitable amount going on to require the length. Nearly every subordinate character is given some sort of clichÃ©d back story to enact in addition to the central romance - be it the nurse, her Sikh paramour who defuses bombs, or his friend. The film is already grossly overlong before Willem Dafoe (in a weak performance) shows up for no purpose whatsoever other than to introduce the concept that Fiennes may be a spy. The Dafoe character could have been easily excised and his function added to Binoche. Naturally, Dafoe's entire back story gets to be enacted in a series of tedious flashbacks. Ironically, no back story/flashbacks are reserved for Colin Firth, who is responsible for setting the climactic events into motion but previously is all but forgotten by the screenplay.Where the film really fails is that it must be the most deadly romance in recent memory. Fiennes and Kristin Scott-Thomas, as the married woman with whom he dallies, can be amazing actors singularly. However, they are both known for their cool, aloof reserved performances. You can certainly have a fine romance with two outgoing actors in the leads; you have a good shot with opposite-style actors (one vibrant, the other reserved), but casting two self-contained cool personalities at the center of a film that is trying to be a classy romance for the ages proves to be a disaster. They have all the appeal of being pelted in the face with cold wet sardines and even the inclusion of full-frontal nudity (courtesy of Scott-Thomas) fails to raise the heat level above a frozen tundra. Their total lack of chemistry is hardly helped by sporadically groan-inducing dialog like when Fiennes asserts lustily that 'I can still taste you.' This a not a romantic pairing to enlist your sympathy or set flight to your heart or imagination. The end result is a film that is a feast for the eyes, but starvation for the heart and soul.",3,15,29,25 April 2006
The Hateful Eight," Better than expected, but self-indulgence does it in
","I have always found Quentin Tarantino to be an overrated wunderkind. Critics and fans rabidly sing his praises, but I find his cinematic output a mixed bag. On one end of the spectrum, I find Pulp Fiction to be an overrated mess, while I think Jackie Brown is a bit underrated and Kill Bill has some incredible moments and performances in it. Inglorious Basterds, is two-thirds a great film (actually the film takes flight any time the Basterds are not on screen) and one-third amateur hour. Still, Tarantino has enough cache to ask for and get concessions that many filmmakers only dream of.Case in point, The Hateful Eight. Tarantino released some prints in 70mm format requiring some theaters to revive a now-dormant format to accommodate him. His film rings in at a whopping near 3-hour running time and some prints feature an intermission. To say that The Hateful Eight is a tad self-indulgent would be an epic understatement. People seem to either passionately loathe or love this film. I am in between. One must give Tarantino some point for chutzpah in combining a western homage with an Agatha Christie-style mystery - and given that I am a fan of both genres, I should have loved this film. But I did not.The setting is wintry Wyoming, where bounty hunter Kurt Russell is in the process of returning fugitive criminal Jennifer Jason Leigh to the hangman in Red Roch via coach. Along the way, they encounter first Samuel L. Jackson's legendary bounty hunter who begs a ride and then Walton Goggins, who claims to be the newly hired sheriff of Red Rock. The coach stops at the expected destination of Minnie's Haberdashery for a respite, only to find some strange characters in place rather than the much-discussed Minnie and her usual crew. These include embittered former Confederate Bruce Dern, Mexican barman Demien Bichir, soft-spoken cowpoke Michael Madsen, and the British hangman of Red Rock Tim Roth. When an intense blizzard strands everyone and people start dying off one by one, the questions raise as to who is responsible, who is next and is anyone who they truly claim to be.On paper, it sounds like a great concept. Unfortunately, Tarantino's self-indulgent, heavy hand too often botches it and prevents it from reaching much higher than a curio piece. Considering that Tarantino went for the 70mm prints, it seems foolish considering that after the opening moments, there are almost no outside scenes to make it worthwhile. Pretty much all of the action stays in the claustrophobic cabin that comprises Minnie's. I would also argue that Ennio Morricone's Oscar-winning score is immensely better than the film in which it resides.Ditto, the running time is ludicrous considering how slight the story is. Tarantino tries to distract from this with minor flashbacks, camera tricks, coy voice-over narration by Tarantino himself, and - at the two-hour mark - a lengthy flashback which introduces a completely new set of characters to discuss what happened at an earlier point at Minnie's. You will either find these conceits inventive or frustrating.Equally frustrating is that Tarantino seems to think that he makes his screenplay edgy by packing it with streams of needless profanity and racial/sexist insults. This does not make it authentic, it just makes it difficult and unpleasant to listen to. I think this film may well break a record for how many times the 'n' word is utilized and that is followed by the use of the 'f' bomb. It becomes wearying fairly quickly and undermines any genuine ingenuity present. It also becomes apparent quickly that none of these people (with the exception of the bystander coach driver James Parks) are worth any rooting interest, but the flashback sequence where one character goads another with an on screen memory (or lie) about sexually violating that person's dying son is pretty repellent. Ditto, the constant scenes of male characters beating and brutalizing Leigh's sole female become a bit much. There were times where I thought that Tarantino must be getting back at every woman that would not date him with this character.The actors try their best and succeed on varying levels. Jackson and Russell are both solid, if a bit predictable, in their performances. Dern conveys the simmering tension of a racist Confederate cooped up with a black man in authority well. Bichir, Madsen and Roth are underused, while Goggins fares better than expected. If any performance stands out though, it is Leigh's. She seems to be the linchpin holding everything together. We are never told what crime she committed, but Leigh convinces us that it must have been pretty heinous. Her character suffers beatings and indignities galore and yet comes through it all with a malevolent smile. She is ultimately no better or worse than her fellow travelers, but she seems to be the only one having fun with her role and the only one who projects menace even when being victimized.Finally, the film is not very engaging emotionally. It is a tough obstacle to become involved in the plight of people, who are almost immediately revealed to be ethically beyond redemption and capable of mind-numbing atrocities. The best one can summon is an intellectual curiosity to figure out what is happening and who is in on it. But still by the end, I found myself not caring who lived or died, which does not make for a very fulfilling film experience. I would recommend this solely for Tarantino fanatics and the mildly curious. Anyone else should probably go elsewhere.",5,1,4,1 September 2016
The Bodyguard," A real bore
","Critically ravaged action/mystery/romance has a cult following among viewers of little discernment, but it is difficult to see why. Stoic bodyguard Kevin Costner is hired to overhaul the security for pop star/actress Whitney Houston in light of some death threats. Naturally the two clash and then fall in love. Yawn.The clunky screenplay had been growing mold around Hollywood since the days of Steve McQueen, who was the first star sought for the title role. Costner is oddly made up to resemble McQueen here. Costner's bodyguard, who is described as the best in the business, holds himself personally responsible as he was assigned to Reagan's detail but had a day off when the attempted assassination by Hinckley occurred. Thus ends the character development.Naturally, since Houston is being threatened and Costner is there to make sure she remains out of harm's way, she will be cooperative...NOT. Truly there would be no movie if Houston's character reacted in any credible manner to anything that goes on around her. She talks tough to Costner in a few scenes and tries to order people around, but she reveals herself to be such a clueless ninny that she cannot even finesse an overly exuberant crowd during one of her concert shows - and she has purportedly been in the business for quite some time. In short, she exists solely to place herself in some form of conspired danger at every opportunity and then wilt.Truthfully, the film is unsuccessful at whatever it tries its hand at. The mystery elements are half-hearted and even snoozing viewers will pinpoint the person behind the threats. Then again, Houston receives so many threats throughout the film - from audiences, from nuts, from people close to her - that it becomes difficult to keep track of who or what has her in their sights at any given moment.The action scenes are a bust. Everything unfolds in such a plodding manner that even the most obvious and clumsy of scenes are related as though they are of monumental importance and dripping with relevance. Houston never seems to be seriously in any danger, the assassin seems almost foolishly clumsy, and there is zero sense of urgency to anything that unfolds.The romance is deadly. To say that there is a lack of chemistry between Costner and Houston would be an understatement of colossal proportions. I can imagine frozen cadavers generating more heat. Costner is devoid of personality here and every line reading is flat. His pulse never seems to rise above resting. A bit of humor would have helped, but other than a mid-movie quip to an unwanted pass from a female partygoer, Costner remains a glum and uninvolving performer.Houston is every bit his equal on this front. Playing a pop star diva/actress should not be much of a stretch for her, but the woman has no energy or life onscreen. Even her concert moments are lifeless. There is no warmth or excitement to her - even her attempts to be diva-esque are pitifully weak. The conclusion set at the Oscars is unintentionally hilarious because it is impossible to imagine Houston being seriously considered for any acting awards given her emotionless line readings herein. And listening to her relentlessly wail 'I Will Always You Love,' which quickly became grating after endless plays on the radio is no selling point either.Costner and Houston are singularly bad, but casting them as a couple on which to hang a film their combined effect is a virtual primer on how never to cast a romance. They are the antithesis of chemistry.So we have a romance populated by leads that have no chemistry, an action film with no action and a mystery with no surprises. To say this is a huge failure would be kind. It does not even have a camp element to make it unintentionally fun. In short, it honestly has nothing to recommend it.",1,0,3,16 September 2019
Forrest Gump," Minor plot completely runs out of steam by midway
","Conventional wisdom back in 1994 stated that one must either be a huge fan of Oscar nominee Pulp Fiction (which purportedly signified the new cinema) or of its polar opposite, Oscar winner Forrest Gump (which signified old school film). Truthfully, I am a fan of neither film and of the Best Picture nominees for that year, I would most assuredly have picked The Shawshank Redemption over both without hesitation.Forrest Gump is a simple story about a simple man - expanded over an arrogant nearly 3 hour running time. A Southern man of low I.Q., whose good intentions and well-meaning heart allow him to triumph over the obstacles and adversities life throws his way. The film opens with Forrest sitting on a park bench regaling others with his exploits, such as his outrunning bullies and becoming a football hero, his tour in Vietnam which led to a successful shrimping business and his enduring love for his childhood friend, Jenny.Director Robert Zemeckis can be a great director and the first hour of Forrest Gump is very good. It establishes a tone of bemused whimsy that the material requires. Unfortunately, bemused whimsy is a hard tone to maintain, especially when your film has such a slight plot, a running time that would be a strain with the best material, and a central character that is, let's face it, not particularly fascinating. By the midway section, the film starts to stumble and then completely implodes right around the time that Forrest starts running back and forth from coast to coast for no apparent reason.For comedic measure and a degree of relevance, the story tries to shoehorn Forrest in with historic figures, fads and events, some of which work well and some not at all. The tie-in with Watergate and Forrest showing his wound to Nixon are amusing, but his scene on the National Mall at an anti-war protest where the microphone cuts out so the crowd can remain clueless that he is an imbecile is ridiculously coy. And the sequence with John Lennon, where it is obvious the words do not match the lip movements is downright embarrassing. The Oscar for special effects here is a real stretch.Tom Hanks can be a great everyman actor (like James Stewart). He can also be overrated and it is to his misfortune that the two films for which he won back to back Oscars are two of his most overrated efforts. One can see politically in Oscar circles why he would win for Philadelphia, but the win for Forrest Gump the next year is most puzzling. Forrest has very little range emotionally or intellectually, and he largely reacts to everything the same way.Sally Field seems oddly miscast as Forrest's mother, who apparently gifted her son with his low-rent fortune cookie advice. Gary Sinise provides the film's only really great performance as Forrest's Vietnam superior and later friend - providing some of the grit and emotion that the remainder of the film lacks.In the pivotal role of Jenny - the girl who Forrest has loved since childhood - Robin Wright is a complete wash-out. The film keeps returning to her character, who has become an embittered drug addict and it founders every time it does. Jenny may have her reasons for her addictions, but she is often played as a shrewish selfish person, who takes Forrest's help when convenient, and shuns him when she is finished with him. Hanks and Wright have no chemistry together and because of her shoddy treatment of Forrest, I cannot imagine anyone rooting for them as a couple. A foolishly lengthy mid-film sequence with Jenny on a ledge contemplating suicide actually had one witty film-goer in my audience begging her to jump - I concur. Her final moments in the film are especially absurd - as she once again shows up to prey on Forrest's good will - this time announcing that she is dying from some mystery illness which seems to be AIDS although the filmmakers refuse to say and she wants Forrest to care for her son, which she assures him is his (although we as an audience are not really sure given the characters chronic dishonesty). This strange disease seems to have been borrowed from Love Story, as Wright's only major symptom seems to be that she gets more luminous and has better lighting the closer to death she gets.The final hour of the film is near unendurable. The whimsy has been lost and the events surrounding Forrest just seem to get sillier and more pointless. As a character on which to hang a film, Forrest is largely a slow-witted blank. He ends the film almost exactly as he starts it. He has had no great epiphanies or insights or much in way of growth - he has been largely a passive passenger riding the wave of life. The film's meme that good-hearted people will always get what's coming to them is beyond naive and a tad insulting - as there are many good-hearted people who have the opposite happen. Ironically, we never get to see the expressions or reactions of the people Forrest victimizes with his tales, which may be intentional since they may have run screaming from the park bench or just passed out in bored apathy.",4,2,5,27 December 2014
The Thing," A stomach-turning mess
","A motley band of Americans stationed at a lonely outpost base in Antarctica inadvertently find themselves sheltering a monstrous shape-shifting alien, which can assume their identities, leading to rampant showdowns and paranoia.The 1951 version of The Thing does not just rank as one of my favorite horror films, but one of my favorite all-time films period. So watching director John Carpenter take a glorified crap on it does not rank highly on my entertainment scale, but alas that is exactly what he does. Amazingly this fetid remake has some sort of cult following that has developed over the years, but I am at a loss at to why, unless they are gore-seekers salivating over the next slimy effect to splash across the screen.I gather that this film version adheres more closely to the source novel 'Who Goes There?', but that only serves to show that original filmmakers Howard Hawks, Christian Nyby and company knew what they were doing when they abandoned it. Other than the bleak snowbound setting, there is nothing especially notable or compelling about this film. Fans seem to be reading much more depth into it than ever appears on screen or in the writing. The 'are you human or a monster' bit had already been done to death long before this film hit the screen and was fully realized in far better films, primarily Invasion of the Body Snatchers, which had also received an effective and chilling modernization just a few years previously.A big part of the problem with focusing on this paranoia approach is that in the Invasion films, the characters were developed capably and were sufficiently sympathetic enough to warrant concern when they succumbed to the Body Snatchers. Here, the characters are humorless, dull and unsympathetic. We cannot tell who is human or alien because none of them seemed particularly human from the start. Whereas the Hawks original populated the base with a believable, appealing and often amusing gallery of people to be terrorized, Carpenter provides us with paper-thin monuments to testosterone that test patience. None of them are likable or worth investing much concern in. Perfectly solid actors like Wilford Brimley, Keith David, Donald Moffat, etc., have little to do but glare at each other and pose in manly fashion.Lead Kurt Russell can be a solid actor as well, but director Carpenter never seemed able to bring out his best, eliciting performances that either seem to be tiresomely buffoonish (Big Trouble in Little China) or a catatonic rendition of a low-wattage Clint Eastwood (here and Escape from New York).With the story and characters completely underwhelming, Carpenter tries to make up the difference with a repellent cabinet of curiosity gore effects that do nothing but demonstrate that energy that should have been directed to more meaningful areas was squandered in trying to make the viewer puke. The budget for blood, pus, ooze, slime and innards must have been astronomical.Even worse, Carpenter's direction itself is inert. The film has virtually no suspense or forward momentum - it lurches like a drunk from one set piece to the next, scored by yet another one of Carpenter's overly synthesized dirges. I cannot recall one extended suspense sequence in the entire film that raises the pulse even minimally. And anyone waiting for a blow-out climax will be surprised by the vague, low-key final moments in which Carpenter caps the film. A more unsatisfying climax is hard to imagine.The film also provides evidence of why it is a blessing that Carpenter has refrained from directing for a number of years. After first-rate work on the deservedly legendary Halloween and the underrated The Fog, Carpenter repeatedly provided ambitious concepts done in by almost spectacularly lackluster execution, to the point where it seemed as though a rank amateur was responsible. The Thing and Escape from New York certainly marked the beginning of this decline.Misguided fans like to say that this film was overlooked in 1982 (like the similar Blade Runner) because it was lost in the success of E.T. Sad to tell them, but Blade Runner had a following as early as 1982. The Thing, at the time, was a box office dud and critically dismissed as a botched remake that functioned as little more than a effects freak show. That description still holds true several decades later. Genre fans can keep this stinkbomb, I will head back to the company of original and its much-deserved classic status.",Null,1,4,25 October 2011
Being John Malkovich," Just because you haven't seen its like before, does not make it great
","A prime example of just because you have not seen anything like it before, does not make it a cinematic masterpiece.  Scuzzy puppeteer John Cusack and snide co-worker Catherine Keener discover a portal into the mind of actor John Malkovich (playing himself) in their bizarre office and decide to profit from it.  Marketed as a comedy, the film is inventive, most definitely original, but the laughs virtually dry up after the first 40 minutes.  The strange plot takes one bizarre turn after another, incorporating lesbianism, spousal abuse and cults into the mix.  Events become more and more sinister, disturbing and serious during the running time.  Unfortunately, the main characters, including an unrecognizable Cameron Diaz as Cusack's frumpy wife, are so odious that it becomes impossible to identify with them, and by the climax one really does not care what is done to whom.  Keener is initially terrific as the reprehensible profiteer, but she is given limited notes to play.  Malkovich may be a good sport, but he is a pretty dull character as envisioned here.  It is hard to recall Cusack ever being this unappealing.  Director Spike Jonze has definite potential, but his ambition spins out of control far too quickly on this project.  Even the look of the film, with everything in drab blues and greys, is a downer.  For all of the hype, the film is an amazingly empty experience.",1,58,129,17 December 2002
Saving Private Ryan," Clichéd, tedious and incredibly unpleasant to watch
","In the aftermath of D-Day, Tom Hanks and his platoon of soldiers are sent off on a glorified PR-mission into harm's way to 'rescue' and bring home the last surviving member of the Ryan family.Steven Spielberg can be a truly great director, but Saving Private Ryan is an increasingly tiresome and nearly unwatchable trudge through war movie clichés. After the harrowing opening recreation, the film slides inexorably downhill into a rut from which it never emerges. For all of the heralding by critics and fans of what a great film this is, it is predictable, mind-numbing and finally butt-numbing.A minor history lesson. While it is true that in events where an entire generation of a family enlisted and all but one died, there were efforts to extract and return the soldier in question home. However, extraction often meant waiting for the soldier or his commanding officer(s) to be in contact and then make appropriate arrangements for said soldier to be removed as soon as possible. Try as I might, I can find no historic evidence that documents what happens in this film, in that an entire platoon of men are placed in constant life-threatening situations in order to extract a single private for a glorified PR stunt.Spielberg often has problems with conclusions, especially in his more serious endeavors. That is definitely the case here, which features a wraparound, which opens at Arlington Cemetery with the aged Ryan and concludes there as well. The entire segment is badly directed and heavy-handed.The script itself is almost ridiculously slight, particularly for a near 3-hour running time. The men in the platoon are all marching clichés reduced to types seen in a thousand other (and in many cases much better) war films. Each actor pretty much fastens in on one character trait and allows that to suffice for a performance. Hanks fares best as the everyman leader and Tom Sizemore is adequate as the second-in-command, but they have given very similar performances elsewhere. Worst performances come from Jeremy Davies, who overacts hysterically in the final third, and Edward Burns, who somehow manages to make his character supremely unlikable.For the duration of the film, it hits the same tedious notes. The men trod through the ugly war zone, one of them confides something personal and is then subsequently obliterated in an often painfully protracted geyser of gore. The platoon's slog resumes, someone else confides a personal story and then said person is annihilated shortly thereafter. Over and over again and again...until a handful remain to find their quarry. Given that their losses do not endear the survivors to their quarry, it comes as no surprise when they finally face Private Ryan (solidly played by Matt Damon), who is such a congenial, aw-shucks, Middle American nice guy, that not only are the surviving men immediately charmed by him, but when Ryan refuses to leave his post, our survivors defy their orders to extract him immediately and stand by him in the chaotic final onslaught.There is pretty much nothing in the way of surprise in the film and everything unfolds in a slow and tortuously predictable fashion. About the only surprise is how needlessly and relentlessly brutal Spielberg is with the violence. After the opening moments of horrific carnage, I think everyone gets the whole 'war is hell' scenario. Unfortunately, Spielberg never ratchets back the violence - releasing free-flowing blood, gore and body parts at the camera.Worse, the film is incredibly ugly to look at. Many WW2 veterans recount the beauty of Europe during their service, yet the entire color palette of this film consists of mud brown, bleak greys and depressing blues (and of course dark red blood). Spielberg also over-utilizes the now too common place Shake-cam 4000, in which the camera jitters all over the place like its got palsy or is afflicted by St. Vitus's Dance, which I gather is supposed to provide a 'you are there' authenticity, but instead generates motion sickness, migraines and frustration.A really tiresome and criminally overrated viewing experience. By the climax, when the elderly Ryan questions whether it was all worth it, you may well find yourself responding negatively.",3,3,8,10 February 2016
The Grand Budapest Hotel," An improvement over Anderson's other efforts, but still overrated
","Full disclosure: I have sat through two films from Wes Anderson and despised them both. I detested Rushmore and The Royal Tennenbaums is one of the few films I have ever walked out on. So needless to say that I am fairly immune to his 'charms' as a filmmaker. It was with great trepidation that I approached The Grand Budapest Hotel - which seemed to have much of the same ingredients that made the first two films unendurable for me. However, I was curious based on all its Oscar nominations and it was on cable, so I did not have to spend extra for it.The story is related to a young writer by the mysterious owner of the hotel and centers on a legendary concierge played by Ralph Fiennes, who particularly specializes in flirting, wooing and bedding rich elderly guests. When one dowager (Tilda Swinton in old age make-up) dies she leaves a priceless painting to Fiennes, which awakens the ire of her extended family (primarily Adrien Brody and his nasty assassin Willem Dafoe). When it turns out Swinton was murdered, the family attempt to frame Fiennes, who sets out to prove his innocence with the help of naive lobby boy, protégé and confidant Tony Revolori.There were a couple of things that surprised me about the film. First, that it was watchable at all. Second, that it actually appeared to have something of a coherent central story despite Anderson's strange trademark flourishes and flights of fancy. I was never bored with the film, although I was never on the edge of my seat either. I also never laughed once during the film and recognized fairly early that this was obviously going to be a funny peculiar film rather than a funny HA HA film. The film itself looks amazing. The art work, the camera work and model work are inventive and eye-catching. Fiennes central performance is wonderful even though there is not much evolution in this character.Unfortunately, Anderson's film mannerisms are much in evidence. I have yet to figure out how one makes a film seem self-impressed, but Anderson has perfected the tone and it is on full display here. One is always reminded that the film seems to believe it is much funnier and more clever than it truly is. His tone comes off as Woody Allen crossed with Tim Burton with a healthy dose of pretension and nastiness.Outside of Fiennes, the acting is uniformly unimpressive. A steady parade of familiar faces march past the camera, but most have little or nothing to do and no real point in the story. The wrap-around segment with the author, young writer and the adult version of the lobby boy, which employs Tom Wilkinson, Jude Law and F. Murray Abraham, could have been completely omitted from the film without consequence. In fact, the casting of Abraham seems absurd since Abraham looks nothing like the young Revolori and actually appears to be of a completely different ethnicity. With the exception of Fiennes and Brody, everyone reads their lines in a humorless deadpan that begins to grate after a while. I swear young Revolori, the only cast member to qualify as a co-lead, did not change expression or tone of voice in the entire film. And Edward Norton seems especially out of place as a foreign policeman with a jarring American accent.Anderson also has the ability to hit on something minor and milk it to death. The sequence where Fiennes contacts a society of concierge's to help him would have been amusing if it stopped after one or two concierge's, but it continues on to where it becomes tired. And why does Bill Murray keep showing up in these films in completely pointless, unfunny and undramatic forgettable cameos? I am also a bit weary of Anderson using pointless death as a punchline. When Brody gets angry at an honest lawyer, goon Dafoe throws the man's cat out the window to its death. Later, a character has his fingers chopped off and murdered and a woman has her head chopped off. The film could have easily ended after the resolution of the dowager's fortune, but Anderson and his fellow writers feel compelled to inform us that one main character was subsequently executed off screen and a third was killed with her child in an outbreak - all of which is delivered in the deadpan whimsy that preceded the most minor of scenes.In the end, the film is a step up from Anderson's other efforts and nice to look at, with a strong central performance from Fiennes. However, it is overrated, ostentatious, definitely not Oscar-worthy and terminally self-impressed with itself. And for a comedy, it is also not especially funny.",5,4,8,19 January 2015
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Pretension thy name is Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon
","Yet another feverishly overpraised film that critics needed to invent superlatives to describe.  While admittedly I am not a fan of martial art films as a rule, I have enjoyed a handful of them and thought this may fall within similar parameters.  Alas the film is a debacle on nearly all fronts. After a promising start, which introduces a wise warrior (Chow Yun-Fat), a female bodyguard who pines for him (Michelle Yeoh) and a coy young woman (Zhang Ziyi) staying as a guest in the home where everyone initially intersects, the film bogs down into lumbering tedium.  Much emphasis is initially placed on a sword, which during the course of the film gets stolen, returned, stolen again, but it really has little to do with the fragile plot.  In fact, so thinly conceived is the storyline and dialogue that one becomes frightened that a slight breeze may shred it to pieces. Characters are introduced as if they will be important and then are seemingly forgotten in the following scenes.  Headliners Yun-Fat and Yeoh (who actually manages a touching performance) seem to embody potentially interesting characters, but are shoved into the background and forced to play second fiddle to Ziyi, whose character is quickly uncovered to be a spoiled brat with a penchant for violence and destruction.  Definitely not the kind of character to enlist sympathy and carry the film.  Yun-Fat spends the majority of his minimal screen time trying to convert Ziyi from the Dark Side so that she can become the first woman to receive official training in the arts.  There are lots of gravity-defying fight sequences that would be borderline ridiculous if the film did not treat everything with such grave solemnity.  Instead, they just become boring.  Ironically, the fight sequences do not even make sense within the context of the film  (i.e., while the film explains the aerial acrobatics as being an effect of the mysterious 'training' and is careful to explain how Ziyi and her mentor have achieved it, how then can Yeoh also manage the same aerial feats when the film tells us she has never had said training?).  The desert romance sequence seems to come from another film and the set-up with Ziyi and her 'kidnapper' beating each other, then resting, then beating each other, etc., all over a comb, grows wearisome quick.  A friend that I saw this with waxed wistful over the drapes, tablecloths and costumes, which pretty much indicates how engrossing this will be to the average viewer.  The running time seems easily double what it is and should you be awake for the jaw-dropping 'symbolic' climax, you will know first-hand pretension to the nth degree.",1,6,14,17 December 2002
Frozen," Beautifully looking and mature, but a tad overrated
","Latest Disney animation feature is very loosely based on Hans Christian Anderson's The Snow Queen and opens with two royal sisters, Anna and Elsa, playing as children when Anna is accidentally hurt by Elsa's magical power of turning things to ice and snow. As a result, Elsa is convinced to suppress her powers and isolates herself in the castle from Anna. When Elsa must take the throne and appear publicly, her powers become apparent and she flees the kingdom, unwittingly leaving it in eternal winter. Determined to bring her sister back to reverse the curse, the flighty kind-hearted Anna leaves her spur-of-the-moment fiancé Hans in charge, coerces mountain man Krystof and his pet reindeer to lead her into the wintry wilderness to save the kingdom and help redeem her sister in the process.Credits claim this film adaptation is 'inspired' by The Snow Queen, although other than Elsa's magical power, there is not very much else in common with the source. The film itself is beautiful to look at, almost painfully mature in its thoughts and insight, and more than a tad overrated.The central characters of Anna and Elsa (voiced by Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel, respectively) and the dynamics of their relationship are fascinating and in ways not usually found in Disney animated features. There is a large degree of intelligence and imagination at work here. If the story worked as well with the supporting characters, this would probably be a masterpiece. This is most definitely a female-driven film (although this will not prevent young boys from enjoying it), so it is probably not a surprise that the male characters get short shrift, but the film falls short in other areas as well.Much like Bond films, Disney films are often only as good as their villains. Frozen quite simply does not have oneor not until the final moments when it conjures one up out of its butt crack. Much of the conflict in the film is internal, with Elsa desperately trying to suppress her powers so that she does not hurt anyone and the public does not regard her as some kind of freak. When she finally flees and embraces her powers, she does so at the cost of isolation from everyone and everything. This is all very interesting and adult, but cannot take the place of a good old-fashioned villain. As the film heads towards its climax, it seems even the writers must understand this because a here-to-fore perfectly amenable character is drafted for villainy and it just fails to ring true based on the character's behavior throughout the film. This is not just a minor problem, but a large problem from which the film never completely rights itself.While Elsa and Anna are incredibly delineated roles, the other characters fare less well. Hans is introduced in a rather amusing 'meet-cute' with Anna, but does not have much to do other than be goofily handsome, hold down the fort and then rush into the wintry landscape to prevent Elsa from being harmed by vigilantes storming her winter fortress. Krystof is introduced as a child, but has minimal contact with the sisters and nothing to do with the story until Anna drafts his help. Since his specialty is ice, we anticipate he might melt Elsa's heart when they meet, but they never actually meet and his character basically feels like a time-consuming fifth wheel that gets dragged or inserted into certain sequences because there 'must' be a guy there. The asides the film gives him with his reindeer are mildly amusing, but should have been better developed – indeed the film could use a larger jolt of humor. And it is perfectly inexcusable that Jonathan Groff (as Krystof) and Santino Fontana (as Hans), two Broadway stars with terrific voices, are given nothing of worth to sing. I don't think Groff even has one number. I also find the magical snowman Olaf (voiced by Josh Gad) to be incredibly irritating. Perhaps it is Gad's voice or mannerisms incorporated into the character, but Olaf goes from harmless to fingernails on the chalkboard at warp speed – and the film never does explain how Elsa inadvertently manages to bring him to life anyway.Other than the anthemic power-ballad 'Let It Go,' I don't find any of the other songs (what few there are) to be anything special. 'Do You Want to Build a Snowman' feels no better than minor filler and neither the number given Olaf nor the number with the trolls prove memorable or advance the plot in any way.That said, it is really hard to dismiss the film, thanks to its animated beauty and its fascinating central characters. The message of the importance of being true to oneself and not suppressing one's abilities, nicely limned in 'Let It Go', is a good one and one that can be universally appreciated by anyone (child or adult) who feels they are being kept down. All combine to make this a thoughtful and worthwhile Disney entry, if not the classic its fans would quite have you believe.",7,1,6,10 October 2014
The Game," Interesting concept that becomes preposterous and dumb
","Director David Fincher has developed legions of fans that praise his every move and now try to go backwards and rehabilitate his mistakes. Fincher truthfully is an uneven filmmaker. For every Seven, The Social Network and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, you have the indefensible Alien 3 and this little ditty, The Game.The Game starts out well enough. Millionaire businessman Michael Douglas is given a gift for his birthday from ne'er-do-well brother Sean Penn to participate in an enigmatic game. Out of sheer curiosity, he investigates and is put through a battery of physical and psychological tests, before being told he does not qualify, which miffs him a bit. Then strange things begin to occur. Weird gifts show up, Douglas becomes certain that he is being watched/followed, and attempts are ultimately made on his life. He initially thinks it is 'the game' but as the stakes rise he comes to believe something more sinister is at work.Fincher provides his trademark dark brooding tone. The Game has a nice set-up and there is a fascinating idea at the core of the film, but it begins to fall apart in the execution by the one-third mark. It also requires us to suspend our belief and then brings out a jackhammer to shatter that suspension. As a result, it becomes increasingly foolish and stupid as it progresses, until it reaches an out-of-left-field climax that is not just preposterous, but requires the viewer to remove their brain completely and have Fincher stomp on it.Douglas is not the most sympathetic or emotive of actors in the best of circumstances. Even in his Oscar-winning role of Gordon Gekko, he is basically an icy individual. Here is no different. Douglas should elicit our sympathy fairly quickly, but his central character is often so distant and aloof that it becomes difficult to care for him at all. Penn is unlikely cast in a glorified cameo as his brother (wouldn't you have loved to see their parents?). He brings nothing to the film. The remainder of the supporting cast is fairly irrelevant.Prior to the big reveal at the end, the film has already evolved into a preposterous series of attempts to terrorize the main character. When the end comes and the big reveal is laid out and then the central character gets to react to them, your jaw drops to the floor because in no possible way could this have unfolded. Any attempts at realism have been slaughtered and left by the way-side. We have watched Douglas for a lengthy period of time be chased, terrorized, have his life placed in danger, driven into the ocean, made to think he has had his millions stolen and left a pauper, bamboozled by friends, acquaintances and family, worked up into hysteria, made to believe he has murdered his brother, and then driven to such extremes that he attempts suicide by jumping off a building...only to find that everyone has been in cahoots to convince him to enjoy life and stop and smell the roses! Huh? The film hits a new realm of idiocy in the sequence where Douglas takes his swan dive off the roof of a building and miraculously lands in air bags right outside of a swank dinner party for his birthday where all his family, friends and the people responsible for terrorizing him sit with champagne glasses in hand to welcome him. Miraculously, Douglas' response is not to hold everyone accountable for what he has been through, but to laugh it off, thank them all profusely and then try to pick up the femme fatale that the game's agency has had leading him on a merry chase. This is a shaggy dog twist that even M. Night Shyamalan would not touch. This is a real time-consuming mess and it is inconceivable that it has the high rating on IMDb that it does.",2,4,10,2 June 2015
Ghostbusters," Rare successful blend of comedy and visual effects
","Watching the trailers for Ghostbusters back in 1984, one could be forgiven for dismissing it as a silly looking, overextended Saturday Night Live or SCTV sketch. One would have been wrong. Which is why when the film actually came out, it unexpectedly became the surprise smash of the year and a much beloved comedic classic.The film opens when three parapsychologists (Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis) are dismissed from their cushy positions at Columbia University and decide to go into business for themselves as Ghostbusters, ridding Manhattan of its problematic paranormal denizens. Their first client is classy high society concert musician Sigourney Weaver, who is dismayed to find a Sumerian deity living in her ice box. This ultimately builds into an apocalyptic battle atop her bizarre apartment complex.Given the number of productions completely unable to meld the combination of successful comedic bits and dazzling special effects, the fact that Ghostbusters seems to flow so effortlessly and hits the mark so often is really quite astounding. People not interested in the comedy can actually enjoy the light-hearted action and effects, people not interested in the action can enjoy the comedy, and those who like both will have it made here. Plus, watching the film more than 30 years later, it manages to entertain new audiences as well as keep prior fans coming back for repeated viewings.That is not to say that the film does not have a couple of minor nuisance issues. While the cast is by and large great, that is not to say they get equally funny material, which is a shame. Murray pretty much plays his usual persona of smug smart-ass in the lead role and he has a lot of fun material to back him up. He and Weaver have some amusing banter and chemistry, although the latter is largely forgotten for much of the middle section, before being allowed some fun comedic moments near the climax. While one must give a nod to the generosity of Aykroyd and Ramis in handing over nearly all of the funny material to Murray, I am not sure it was the wisest maneuver to give their own characters so little to do. Ramis (always an underrated comedic actor) at least doubles down on his world class deadpan as the most techno-savvy of the men, but poor Aykroyd really suffers for this sacrifice. Although no one comes off worse from this than Ernie Hudson, who is a late arrival as the last Ghostbuster, and literally has nothing to do other than be the token black guy.Oddly, while the other three Ghostbusters are busy allowing Murray to steal the film, supporting players Rick Moranis (as Weaver's nerdy neighbor drawn into the mayhem) and Annie Potts (as the Ghostbusters' acerbic receptionist) make some really strong impressions. As do some of the bit players, with my personal favorite being whoever that old woman was who comes out of her apartment to investigate the racket made by the creature trashing Moranis' apartment and her reaction to it. Priceless! The film could have benefited from a central villain. The late arrival of a pasty William Atherton as an EPA agent out to close the GBs down just does not cut it. Largely, because Atherton essayed so many similar roles at the time and the thought of the EPA, which was a de-fanged government agency even in the 1980s (moreso today) as having any kind of clout to do much of anything is in itself a comical notion.Director Ivan Reitman has never been as assured behind the camera as with this film. The special effects are amazing and do not forget to be comical as well. It would have been so easy to just go for broke and ride out solely on the visual effects at the climax, but the film remembers to even keep the effects comical. Who can forget the first appearance of the destroyer of the world - the hilariously deranged sight of a giant marshmallow man laying waste to Manhattan? Or, for that matter, the introduction to the legendary Slimer ghost, which culminates in Murray's memorable line.There is very little that does not work for this film and continue to do so decades later. And one can also not underestimate the added success of Ray Parker's catchy title tune. 'Who you gonna call?'",9,5,9,22 July 2016
Annie Hall," Excruciating
","I am not remotely a fan of Woody Allen, but that does not mean that he has not produced work that I have enjoyed. I am actually rather fond of his valentine to NYC, Manhattan. I also like Take the Money and Run, Everyone Says I Love You, Radio Days and Manhattan Murder Mystery. However, I can sit through Hannah and Her Sisters, Broadway Danny Rose and Bullets Over Broadway without cracking a smile and becoming frustrated over their inability to make me laugh. I bring this up because somehow I managed to miss Annie Hall for decades until recently and it is pretty much considered Allen's definitive 'masterpiece'.Annie Hall (which is the film that brought Allen the shower of awards and accolades that he purportedly disdains) centers on the romantic relationship between neurotic Jewish comedian Alvy Singer and aspiring singer Annie Hall. Right out of the starting gate, it hits on pretty much every note that one can find in Allen's other films. Alvy is obviously a thinly veiled version of Allen himself and longtime partner/co-star Diane Keaton takes the title role. Allen has done this whole semi-autobiographical character bit to death and Annie Hall is the best argument for putting it to rest.What passes for comedy is that Alvy and Annie are both neurotic in their own ways - both are seeing analysts. Supposedly their relationship brings out the best in them before they ultimately part and move on. Alas, right from the beginning we pretty much sense that their relationship is doomed because both of these people are entirely too stuck on themselves and feel everyone else needs to play a supporting role. In place of any winning personality, Allen yammers incessantly as Alvy, mixing in a variety of dated, unfunny Henny Youngman-esque one-liners that are meant to convince us that Alvy is a brilliant comedic talent. Keaton, voice pitched at high whine, also babbles uncontrollably. Both throw around big words, reference the names of great thinkers, philosophers and artists, and espouse 'deep thoughts' in a failing desperate attempt to make them appear intelligent, contemporary and interesting. The end result is a caricature of what rubes imagine New Yorkers to be like - shallow, faux intellectual, selfish, B.S. artists completely stuck on themselves.The sequence where Alvy and Annie first meet and he returns to her apartment for a glass of wine is nothing short of embarrassing. There is literally no chemistry between them, they appear to have nothing in common, and we have no understanding of why Annie asks him back (or why he goes). They stammer, hem and haw awkwardly around like both are in the presence of greatness, Alvy drops some line about not wanting to get undressed in front of other men at the tennis club, which is not funny, but Annie laughs like Richard Pryor was tickling her backside. Back at the apartment, they begin their non-stop train wreck of babble and even when their lips are moving, we now get dialogue bubbles to tell us what they are really thinking. No surprise that their inner thoughts are as vapid and dull as their spoken words.News flash to Allen (and his admirers) - referencing well-known, respected philosophers and artists does not make you an intellectual or brilliant. The barrage of oral flatulence which is expelled chronically from the mouths of the two self-impressed lead characters goes from irritating to unendurable at the speed of light. Alvy and Annie are two people that if you met them at a party, you would get up and walk to the other side of the room to avoid them.The film's most delusional sequence has Alvy and Annie waiting in line at a movie theater and Alvy becoming insanely unreasonable because he keeps eavesdropping on the conversation of the couple behind them, where the man is telling his date why he does not particularly like Fellini. This difference of opinion so offends Allen that he must (in a pseudo-fantasy moment) humiliate the man in public. The guy demands from Allen 'Aren't I entitled to my opinion!' To which Allen tells him not if it is contradictory to Alvy's opinion and is spoken loudly in public. Then upon finding out that the guy teaches a university class on Marshall McLuhan, Allen pulls McLuhan out from behind a sign to excoriate the man for being an idiot and not knowing what he is talking about. The irony of this scene is that the behavior of the man being humiliated by Allen is a more palatable rendition of Allen himself. When Alvy/Allen has a conniption that the man was voicing his contrary opinion too loud in public, I felt like yelling at the screen 'Pot meet kettle.' Of course in the world of Annie Hall, Alvy can voice all of his opinions publicly at the top of his lungs and be a chronic nuisance, because he is the only one that matters - and if you disagree, you will pay the price.I find nothing funny, romantic or charming about this film. It reinforces completely misguided stereotypes about New Yorkers. Further I don't find spending 2 hours listening to two charmless, selfish, self-absorbed bags of neuroses blow wind, especially insightful or pleasant. And before Allen's admirers start in: Yes, I understood it. Yes, I got it. Yes, I like NYC very much. Yes, I like comedies. I just don't like Annie Hall at all.",1,16,30,11 February 2016
Titanic," A modern old-fashioned classic
","This film shares a lot of parallels with the legendary Gone With the Wind. It is a romantic spectacle set against the backdrop of historical events and became both a huge Oscar-winning success and the surprise box office behemoth of its era. Another similarity it shares with the former is that following the success it is now considered 'hip' to be derogatory and dismiss it as a Hollywood film. It is a Hollywood film, but not in the insulting manner that detractors would indicate. It is a sublime demonstration of what can happen when a visionary director puts his reputation on the line and uses the limits of what Hollywood has to offer to bring it to the screen.The film opens in present day with a group of scientific treasure hunters exploring the remains of the sunken Titanic in an effort to locate a priceless necklace. Instead, they find a preserved portrait of a young woman. The elderly woman, Rose (Gloria Stuart), is located and brought to the site to relate her story of the last days of the Titanic and the film unfolds. It is a familiar romantic tale with rich-in-name-only Rose (now played by Kate Winslet) betrothed against her will to a boorish millionaire. In a fit of pique, she contemplates suicide and is talked out of it by charming penniless artist Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio). During the remainder of the ill-fated voyage, they fall in love and incur the wrath of her fiancÃ© and her mother, until the fateful iceberg and destiny in the icy waters of the North Atlantic intervene.There are so many ways that the film could have gone wrong, but director James Cameron wisely sidesteps them. Much of the fuel used by the detractors of the film would have turned it into an infinitely weaker production. Evidence of Cameron's sure narrative hand can be found in numerous spots. Starting the film with the treasure hunters provides for a brilliant moment which allows them to recreate on a computer the death throes of the Titanic so that when the final 90 minutes begin the viewer is completely aware of why certain things are occurring as they do. It also offers a wonderful opportunity for 1930s film star Gloria Stuart to show her acting chops as the latter day Rose.Cameron also gives us a strong scope of the immensity of the great ship herself, as well as the class differentiation in the status of the clientele traveling therein. Much has been made of centering the film on the two characters of Jack and Rose, while having the remainder of the cast play support rather than spread the wealth around more. One could and has done that: it is called The Poseidon Adventure. The reason why this film works on so many levels is because it is far more than the standard disaster epic. The fact that the action is basically consolidated through the eyes of young lovers streamlines the film and keeps the action focused, and Cameron comes up with increasingly inventive ways to move them through different parts of the ship to cover as much action as possible. The fact that they are young lovers experiencing their first romance provides a vitality and sense of urgency that may have been missing from older protagonists. Many have sneered over much the 'Jack' 'Rose' 'Jack' dialog interaction in the climactic moments as a lack of good writing, but given that we are talking about teenage lovers in serious peril, one wonders if people expected them to quote intellectual diatribes back and forth. Instead, what comes from their mouths is far more likely and believable, if repetitive. Further, look at how often Cameron takes the narrative high road. When Jack is invited by the rich people to join them for dinner for saving Rose early in the film, he could have punctured the egos of the rich and wowed Rose with his coarseness. Instead, he behaves in a totally mature fashion and ends up charming the majority of those at their table. The film is brimming with memorable sequences, including the highly sensual moment when Rose invites Jack to draw her portrait or the (much parodied) scene of the two lovers embracing at the front of the ship as it skims the water. For detractors that claim that the special effects involving the sinking of the Titanic save the film, it makes their argument untenable when so many audiences have already been won over long before the sinking begins. The climactic moments are intense, heart-breaking and unforgettable.The majority of the film's success (aside from Cameron) must be attributed to the leads. I would never have previously cast them as a couple, but DiCaprio and Winslet have chemistry. Not just any chemistry, but the chemistry of which cinematic legends are made. Winslet provides a warm, sympathetic and resonant presence throughout the film portraying a character that proves much stronger than even she initially believes. She draws you into the action and her final moments rank as some of her best acting. Conversely, although I admit DiCaprio is a good actor, I am not usually much of a fan. Here, I cannot see anyone else in this role. It is a distinct departure from anything else that he has attempted and he has no acting 'hook' on which to hinge his work. Playing a larger-than-life character that clicks with the audience is one of the trickiest obstacles, but when Rose declares that 'he saved me in every way that a person can be saved' DiCaprio makes you believe it. The fact that he makes it appear so effortless probably resulted in his Oscar nomination snub, but the truth is that he is definitely the worthy Gable to Winslet's Leigh.",9,5,11,29 November 2006
Jersey Boys," Total misfire
","I am not a big fan of Clint Eastwood as a director. Even on his best days, Eastwood has problems with pacing and his deadly serious approach to everything has a tendency to defeat any films he directs requiring excitement, suspense or comical elements. In light of those weaknesses, he seemed a dubious choice at best to direct the film adaptation of arguably the most critically acclaimed and well-loved of the jukebox Broadway musicals from the last 20 years, Jersey Boys.Jersey Boys tells the story of the formation of Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons. The Broadway show is energetic, kinetic and fun. The film...not so much. In fact, it is hard to see how Eastwood and company have drained so much life from the material. Another reviewer indicated how faithful the film is to the show and mentioned that it follows it almost word for word. I am uncertain what show they saw, but almost nothing from the opening onward corresponds. There are entire sequences that appear no where in the show that have made their way on film. For the first 20-30 minutes, one is nearly unaware that they are watching a purported 'musical', so little does music play a role in anything. Instead, we get a lot of added fatuous material, like a ridiculous bungled heist. I have no idea whether such a thing really happened in Valli's life, but I fail to remember any such sequence in the stage show. These added vignettes end up taking away from the music and come off like The Sopranos-lite. Worse, Eastwood does not seem to know how to build up to musical numbers or film them. Numbers that had real emotion and payoff on the stage seem almost afterthoughts here, and Eastwood has not filled the black hole they leave behind with anything of value.Eastwood has retained the gimmick of the characters talking directly to the audience. This conceit can work on stage, but less so on film. Even worse, while we get the impression in the stage show that what the characters are telling us are actually inner thoughts and important tidbits detailing the band's creative processes, the film just makes it seem like unimportant babble.Worst of all is how Eastwood directs his cast. Was it intentional for the actors that play The Four Seasons (with one exception) to seem like they are extras in their own story? The exception is Vincent Piazza as Tommy DeVito. Piazza seems entirely too young for the part and turns in an irritatingly hammy, clichéd performance filled chock full of faux swagger and unconvincing posturing. Michael Lomenda and Erich Bergen, as Nick Massi and Bob Gaudio respectively, come off as little more than props. Tony Winner John Lloyd Young as Frankie Valli is the only member of the original Broadway cast retained for the film and he does not make the transition well. On stage Young was a bundle of energy, charismatic and dynamic, and handled Valli's songs with pitch perfect precision. He was deservedly feted for his performance. On screen, he comes off like a stand-in awaiting the arrival of the real leading man to take over. He seems tired and bored, and delivers the songs in a strange nasal monotone. As someone who nailed the songs live, this seems peculiar since film is a far more forgiving medium. Perhaps Eastwood did not think this was worth correcting in the editing process? Unfortunately, the film rises and falls on how good the performance of Valli is and Young is terribly directed here - as is the majority of this cast.Something is definitely wrong when the four leads fail to make an impression, but one walks away remembering supporting turns from Christopher Walken (as a Mafioso) and Mike Doyle (as a gay producer) far more vividly. Walken because he basically plays himself yet again (although he really has no business in this film) and Doyle because he is arguably the only cast member willing to imbue his performance with any energy.In the end, Jersey Boys comes off less like a joyous musical event than a low-rent attempt for Eastwood to ape Goodfellas. The proceedings are absurdly low-wattage with forgettable performances from the leading players. Eastwood provides us with no compelling reasons on film as to why Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons were such a success nor does he have any interest in staging musical numbers. The film desperately needs ENERGY! Yet that is precisely the thing that Eastwood seems to be sucking out of it.",3,6,8,7 May 2015
The Lion King," Clichéd story and passive central character make for a weak Disney entry
","Unlike the majority of its Walt Disney brethren, The Lion King was written directly for the screen and does not find its roots in either a fairy tale or popular children's literature. It relates the story of the young lion Simba, who is destined to become king of the pride one day when his regal father Mufasa steps down. This does not sit well with Mufasa's villainous brother Scar, who concocts a scheme to eliminate Mufasa and then convince a guilt-stricken Simba that the death is his own fault and he should exile himself from the pride. Simba befriends the unlikely duo of a meercat and warthog and they become friends during his exile, until his childhood friend Nala arrives to apprise Simba of the ruin that Scar's villainy has left the pride and beg for Simba's return.Although the plot is fairly familiar and clichéd for a new story, there is a lot that could be done here. Unfortunately, Simba is such a passive, uninteresting central character that it is difficult to care much about what happens. Other than Simba, Mufasa and Scar, the pride pretty much blurs together. Simba's mother is a virtual non-entity and Simba's female friend Nala is gone for so much of the running time that you nearly forget she is a character in the film. Other than the comical meercat and warthog team (well voiced by Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella), none of the supporting characters are especially memorable, and that duo has little to no impact on the climax. It also does not help that Scar (lazily voiced by Jeremy Irons) is a fairly dull villain. His first act number where he sings about his nefarious plans is disturbing, not only because of Irons horrendous singing, but because someone had the ill-conceived notion of having hordes of his hyena henchmen goose-stepping in the background like Nazi soldiers, which adds a heavy weight that this slight film cannot carry. The film also has a fair amount of dead spots between songs and fight scenes.The animation is typically first-rate, but not as impressive or imaginative as that found in its predecessors, even as recent as Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin. The vocal talent is a mixed bag as well. While Lane and Sabella are stand-outs and James Earl Jones provides the suitably dignified tones for Mufasa, Matthew Broderick is an incredibly bland choice to voice the adult Simba. Ditto, Moira Kelly is not much better as Nala. Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin are not particularly menacing as some of the hyenas.Huge gaps in the story seem to smack of really lazy writing. Mufasa is supposed to be an insightful leader, yet is completely blind-sided by the evil plots of his nasty brother, whose perfidy is ridiculously blatant. Once Scar is king and demonstrates that he is terrible, the film would have us believe that not only are there no other male lions to challenge him, but that the lionesses would passively put up with him destroying the pride without any show of resistance. This, of course, sets up the scene for Simba to return as a savior and rescue the pride while facing down Scar, but there are several things wrong. First, the film never convinces us that there is a need for anyone to await Simba's return when the pride could have banded together themselves to challenge Scar and his minions instead of suffering. And second, Simba does nothing during the course of the film to demonstrate that he could be anyone's savior other than that he is Mufasa's son and the plot rather ham-handedly demands it of him.I am also not a fan of the soundtrack written by Elton John. The film opens with the 'The Circle of Life,' which is a sequence that heralds the birth of Simba, introduces the main characters and sets the stage. Unfortunately, I find this song comes off like one of the worst examples of faux-inspirational Christian rock. 'I Just Can't Wait to Be King' sung by the young Simba feels like a third-rate Michael Jackson riff. 'Hakuna Matata' is probably the best of the songs, but it is surprisingly forgettable. And the less said about the dirge-like love ballad 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight', the better. It is a horrible song badly shoe-horned into the film. Old childhood friends Simba and Nala rediscover each other and then immediately start fighting, then the film pauses for the love ballad, before they go back to fighting and parting. It is a clumsily staged sequence and one that more often than not has the little ones tuning out. Ironically, the song that sticks with the viewer after the film ends is 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight', the old 1950s nutshell which gets a few bars sung in the film and easily outclasses John's pretentious and precious piffles.Purportedly this is Walt Disney's biggest box office success, but it is hard to understand why or how given some of the landmark classics in animation that Disney has provided in the past. I don't find the film fun, or memorable, or particularly astonishing. In fact, barring the dreadful Hercules, I would rank this as one of the worst of the Disney films.",3,8,18,10 October 2014
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Headache-inducing self-impressed babble
","Last year, while waiting in line at the concession stand, a film let out disgorging a healthy number of attendees discussing it. Among the comments I heard were 'garbage,' 'trash,' 'pretentious twaddle,' 'utter nonsense,' 'waste of time' and 'I had no idea it would be that bad,' all uttered from different attendees. My curiosity aroused as to what could have generated such ill will, I took a gander at what was playing in that theater and was surprised to see it was the critical darling (and future Oscar winner) Birdman. After all the accolades, I decided to catch this little gem on cable and found out that the disgruntled comments were more accurate than the accolades showered from elites.Birdman (subtitled The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance because it just sounds so fancy) is the meandering tale of Riggan, a former star of a blockbuster superhero film franchise now a wash-out (played by former Batman Michael Keaton, cue the irony), who is making a desperate stab to prove his acting bona fides and relevancy on the Great White Way in a new play. Naturally, nothing goes the way it should resulting in what appears to be a grandiose mental breakdown. Obstacles and complications include Riggan's ex-wife Amy Ryan, unpredictable Method actor co-star Edward Norton, Riggan's obnoxious lawyer/manager Zach Galifianakis, needy actress Naomi Watts, Riggan's burnt-out daughter cum assistant Emma Stone and vitriolic critic Lindsay Duncan, who is determined to destroy Riggan and the show...apparently just because she can.Birdman is the kind of bilge that film critics, intellectuals and industry insiders salivate over because it so lovingly panders to them by insisting that only they know quality entertainment and everyone else are too mentally stunted to get it. It proclaims that it is talking about deep emotional issues and things of great import, but it is truthfully narcissitically in awe of its own self-importance. Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu may be an artist, but his film is a disjointed, long-winded overacted mess that wants to cast barbs at viewers of popular mainstream films while coddling the art house crowd. It has nothing new or fresh to say, and not for one moment are we allowed to forget that we are watching a film-a VERY IMPORTANT film. A film bloated with its own self-aggrandizement and ludicrous flights of fancy. It tries so hard to sell the viewer on how brilliant it is that I thought someone may have left an Oscar voting ballot under my seated ass.Much like we are never allowed to forget we are watching a film and thus are held at arms length from these bizarre characters, we are equally never allowed to forget that we are witnessing actors acting. Or perhaps I should clarify, we are watching ACTING!!! Every performance is rife with hostility and melodrama and pathos. They are pitched to the rafters and the scenery trembles in terror as it is chewed like a pack of piranhas has been loosed. The fact that Norton and Stone actually manage some fine moments is astounding. Everyone else blends into the acting cacophony until it becomes an indiscernible wall of noise.No one more so than acclaimed lead actor Keaton. Keaton has worked precious little since his departure from the Batman series and when he has shown up it has been to mixed results. There is an irony of casting him in this role, but little more. Here he screams, he cries, he froths, he babbles, he runs around in his undies, he careens under the power of his own ego from one scene of hysterical overacting to the next. The fact that Inarritu stocks the film with seemingly endless internal fantasy sequences makes it even worse. Note to Keaton and the writers of this mess, Christian Bale was able to be the most memorable on screen Batman, while still doing Oscar-caliber prestige films and winning one himself. Stop blaming bad film choices and uneven performances on franchises and start looking inward.The film itself takes punches at popular culture, the Hollywood system and the low prurient tastes of the masses, but is itself ultimately even more tiresome and vacuous than the entertainment it disdains because it comes packaged in such a thick carapace of deluded pretension. It plays like a really bad vanity piece. Even worse, it witlessly slogs past several endings and keeps going becoming more asinine by the frame. By the time Keaton takes a firearm and tries to commit suicide onstage one hopes it will be over, but then it goes onward to yet an even more tedious ambiguous ending that it hopes will inspire people to fervently discuss what actually happened and what did Emma Stone see out the window at the end. Unfortunately, more will probably be content to leave such discussion in the theater and escape from these endlessly yammering characters and the foolish film they inhabit, than debate what intentions the self-impressed screenplay had in its final moments.A virtual cinematic definition of the emperor wearing no clothes.",2,10,20,30 December 2015
Prometheus," Ambitious, but completely implodes as it progresses
","Is there such a thing as being too ambitious? If so, then Prometheus would certainly qualify as a case study. Lots of ink was justifiably spilled over the news of director Ridley Scott's return to the Alien universe - made even more intriguing in that he would not be making an 'Alien' film, but making a prequel that took the storyline in a completely different direction. So far, so good.Prometheus opens with an enigmatic scene of a strange muscular white alien conducting some bizarre ritualistic experiment on a planet we come to find out is Earth. The storyline then jumps ahead to the future where archeologists Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall Green follow clues that seem to indicate that there are engineers of the universe and they are laying out a map for us to find them. With the help of a dying corporate billionaire (Guy Pearce buried in old age make-up), an interstellar journey is set in motion to find the answers on the secret of life.The filmmakers deserve quite a bit of credit for the most part. For a film set in the 'Alien' universe, they never opt for an easy predictable path. The film looks spectacular and delves into BIG, DEEP questions, much like writer Damon Lindelof's TV series Lost. Unfortunately, like that series, Lindelof and company cannot gel his ambitious notions into a cohesive and satisfying whole.The set-up for the film is great, but as the story proceeds huge problems and holes become become too hard to ignore. The characters never really develop in any satisfactory way, which keeps the viewer often at arms length of what happens. Like Lost, Lindelof's plot twists begin to take on a rather frustrating and simplistic phony religiosity that fails to fit comfortably into a film which is suppose to thrill and terrify while making one think. Conversely, the film more often than not does not thrill or terrify, and makes one think too much in that one starts to pick apart the illogical notions and inconsistencies. Lindelof seems determined to make us believe in a higher power even when the evidence he presents to us is scattershot and contradictory.The film could do with a healthy dose of a strong central character like Sigourney Weaver's Ripley. There are two stand-out performances. Michael Fassbender is usually a fascinating actor and his work here is no exception. Playing an android with a Lawrence of Arabia fetish and major daddy issues, he often seems the most interesting person on screen, even when the story is positively schizophrenic about his character. Similarly, an underused Charlize Theron is also strong as the icy company rep overseeing the mission, who keeps us guessing what she may really be up to. She is solid even when spouting groan-worthy dialog. By contrast, Noomi Rapace's scientist searching for God and higher meaning is downright boring, although she does get the film's most memorable and suspenseful scene forced to give herself a desperate make-shift abortion. Marshall Green, as her fellow scientist/love interest, is saddled with playing a shallow jerk, while Idris Elba is wasted as the ship's captain. The film sports an unhealthy list of ill-conceived decisions. Fassbender's android repeatedly reminds us that he is not subject to emotion, but his actions throughout the film seem to belie that. This subplot ultimately gets forgotten or bungled. Further, Marshall Green may be a bit of a jerk, but he definitely does not deserve the nasty fate assigned him by Fassbender. If Fassbender is emotionless, why does he single out the one character that needles him for his 'experiment', when there were many other far less essential players that would have fit the bill better. Characters insist on wearing protective suits in one scene only to blithely discard them a moment later on the flimsiest of pretext, and then insist on the importance of using them AFTER their exposure to foreign elements. Pearce's subplot of the dying man seeking immortality is one of the few truly predictable things in the film and does not make a whole lot of sense in the final moments. Why is the attack/deaths of the first characters handled in such a klutzy fashion (and why are they so stupid and unlikable)? Why do these engineers seem to suffer from such uncontrollable rage? Why would Theron leave her escape pod for no reason to simply place herself in harm's way? Am I the only one that finds the ultimate denouement of Rapace's aborted alien fetus and its tie-in with the 'Alien' a bit silly? Finally, after all that she has witnessed, why would Rapace insist on pursuing the 'engineers' across the cosmos to demand they answer her questions about life? She already witnessed that they feel humans beneath contempt and not worthy of even one word of response - so why is she under the rather dumb notion that a horde of them will react differently to her queries? It seems a rather badly thought out effort to leave the door open for a sequel, especially since this film answers almost none of the high-minded questions that it presents.In final analysis, the film is ambitious to a fault, beautiful to look at, but almost criminally unsatisfying on any intellectual, emotional or thrill level. The cast is filled with competent performers, but only Fassbender and Theron make an impression. Much like the frustrating Lost, the screenplay has a lot of questions or thinks it has a lot to say, but delivers nothing in the way of answers or closure on any front. All combines to make this a royally frustrating misfire.",5,2,4,14 April 2013
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Technically well done, although a vein of nastiness makes it stumble
","Kingsman: The Secret Service details the adventures of a young English man, improbably nicknamed Eggsy (Taron Egerton), whose brush with the law ends up with him recruited by secret agent extraordinaire Harry Hart (Colin Firth) to vie for an open slot in the British Secret Service. Meanwhile, villainous billionaire Samuel L. Jackson launches a scheme to decimate the world's population leaving only the greedy elite left standing.Kingsman is a spoofy take on the old James Bond/British spy thrillers of yore with questionable attempts at being topical and edgy thrown into the mix. Most of the film contrasts Eggsy's adventures in his various tests, while Harry investigates Jackson. There is much that works well here thanks to director Matthew Vaughn knowing his way around an action scene. Unfortunately, the jarring shifts in tone and a streak of unwelcome nastiness running down its center prevent the film from reaching its full potential.It is fascinating to see typical villain Mark Strong cast in a good guy role and the usually avuncular Michael Caine cast as a nasty snob. Jack Davenport is a handsome and charming actor, so it is a bit annoying to see him constantly wasted in thankless franchise roles. Sophie Cookson's rather generic heroine is nicely balanced by Sofia Boutella as Jackson's vicious henchwoman with lethal blades for legs. It is great to see Jackson eschew the tired tough guy persona as a blood-averse, lisping psychopath. In the central role, a star is born in Egerton, who demonstrates the charm, comic timing and appeal required, and has the hard-bodied physique to make the physical scenes half-credible. The film's biggest strength is Firth in a cheeky salute to prior spy legends – who has a fetish with tailored clothes and manners – always manners! Looking at the preview of Kingsman, it would appear to be a frothy, light-hearted romp through spy clichés. The end result is unexpectedly different and not necessarily in a good way. There are fun segments, but they are often side-lined by psychotically over-the-top brutal violence with people being skewered, slashed, hacked apart or having their heads explode. Similarly, the dialog is littered with near non-stop foul language. All of this serves little purpose given the slightness of the screenplay except a laughably misguided attempt to make the whole endeavor seem hard-edged. It has rather the opposite effect, often taking one out the action and giving them time to realize the preposterousness of what we see.Attempts to make what we see topical or gritty often border on the offensive. The film adopts a rather cavalier view of the serious problem of global warming. A later scene set in a church obviously modeled on the notorious Phelps Church of Kansas devolves into an orgy of off-the-scale violence and brutality, barely made palatable given the odiousness of the victims. The final test for the Kingsman candidates hangs on their willingness to murder the puppies they were given at the start of training. The film also has the US president going along with Jackson's plot and we get a stand-in who is obviously supposed to be current President Obama – which culminates later with the First Family's heads literally exploding on screen – something which no doubt plays well in conservative circles. These attempts at edginess often seem more crass than clever.Further missteps abound. As likable as Egerton is, the film only really kicks into high gear whenever Firth is on screen. An accident leaves his character sidelined for too much of the film and then he is almost immediately written out soon after – leaving a gaping hole. For being so smart, the Kingsman make an awful lot of dumb mistakes. When Harry realizes immediately that his cover has been compromised, he still partakes of a dinner with Jackson and ends up swallowing a tracker which leads the villain to Kingsman headquarters. Furthermore, does anyone believe that most of the world's leaders would agree to having a device in their heads that could cause them to explode? The concluding action at the villain's not-so-secret lair is increasingly silly. The heroes' initial plan on how to foil Jackson by taking down one of his satellites seems foolish since even the audience can foresee he will have a back-up and it takes our heroes forever to see a solution staring everyone else right in the face.Despite some strong action sequences, amusing moments and a great cast, what is one to think when the scenes fresh in one's mind when exiting is that one character just leaned into the camera and barfed straight into the lens (one could say on the viewers) and that Eggsy's final act as an agent trained in good manners is to have anal sex with a kidnapped Swedish princess? Manners, indeed!",6,1,6,11 November 2015
The Great Gatsby," Visually stunning
","Full disclosure: I have never read the legendary novel The Great Gatsby. Although I did have a very good friend who got stuck taking a class where the instructor literally spent the entire semester having the class read and analyze this novel, so from her gripes I feel that I almost have read the book. Unfortunately, I have also watched the moribund 1970s film adaptation. So it was not without some hesitancy that I embarked to watch the latest film incarnation of this novel.Baz Luhrmann actually remains faithful to the source as pretty much all of the key sequences known from the novel are present. The events are related through the eyes of young Nick Carraway, whose naivete is pretty much annihilated upon his arrival in 1920s New York. He witnesses the stormy faithless marriage of his cousin Daisy Buchanan to the loutish Tom Buchanan, whose only qualification in life seems to as an example of the idle rich. He first becomes curious about and then is invited into the world of the enigmatic and elusive millionaire next door, Jay Gatsby, which slowly leads to the inexorably tragic denouement.First and foremost,the film is one of the most visually stunning I have ever seen. If nothing else worked, it is the kind of film where one can still just sit back and let the gorgeous imagery flow over them. I initially thought that Luhrmann's trademark over-emphatic visual approach would be all wrong for this project, but given the over-the-top lifestyles of the players involved, it actually fits perfectly. When Tom whisks a reluctant Nick to a secret apartment for a carousing party with Tom's mistress Myrtle, the visuals take on the quality of a fever dream. The fleeting meetings between Gatsby and Daisy in the garden accompanied by Lana Del Rey's evocatively sorrowful tune makes one think of things forever lost. Our first introduction to the legendary parties held by Gatsby is both overwhelming and yet oddly inviting, making us wish we could step through the screen and become one with the orgiastic celebrating. I have less of a problem with the setting inappropriate music than most people as I find it used fairly well to reflect the debaucheries of the characters on screen, although the most effective use of visuals and music occurs when Nick first meets Gatsby to the transcendent swells of Gershwin accompanied by fireworks and Leonardo DiCaprio never looking more dapper. The moment is almost camp in its adoration of its subject, but it works.Whether it is Luhrmann's approach or the performances, this is also the first time that I actually felt some sympathy for the characters in this story. DiCaprio has rarely been better playing a nearly unplayable part. Gatsby must be charming, enigmatic, romantic, tragic and larger-than-life. The latter is a quality that most actors cannot master, but DiCaprio makes it seem effortless. Forget Wolf of Wall Street, this is the performance he should have been nominated for. Tobey Maguire is solid, if unspectacular, as Carraway, somewhat shackled by being shoe-horned into a passive observer role, although his outrage in the final moments is fairly palpable. Joel Edgerton captures the right amount of lizard and brute as Daisy's conniving husband. Isla Fisher and Elizabeth Debicki make strong impressions in supporting roles. The one performance on which I am torn is Carey Mulligan as Daisy. Like Gatsby, Daisy may well virtually be a near unplayable part. Whereas DiCaprio succeeds against the odds, I find Mulligan less successful. She makes a lovely entrance and initially captures Daisy's frail, passive nature with her husband. She also does fairly well when we get the back story on her relationship with Gatsby and reunites with him - their first meeting in Nick's cottage is quite expertly handled. There is also a pleasantly unreal quality to their romantic encounters. However, when Daisy starts to require more dramatic heft, particularly in the last third where she reveals her true selfish nature, Mulligan too often adopts the look of someone who just twisted her ankle and is unsuccessfully trying to hold in the pain. Mulligan, for better or worse, reminds one often of a young Mia Farrow here, who unsuccessfully essayed the role in the 1970s. I often found my eyes wandering more towards Debicki when she was on screen with Mulligan, because her character somehow seemed to be hiding more interesting secrets and emotions.In the end, purists will probably complain about Luhrmann's approach, but the film is compulsively watchable and features some outstanding visual work and acting, and I think it comes closest to capturing the spirit of the story than any of the earlier screen incarnations have. I certainly would not recommend it to everyone, but I think there are a number of people who would find worthwhile.",7,1,2,15 June 2014
Alien: Covenant," Another Alien dud
","There has not been a truly successful entry in the Alien franchise since James Cameron's initial sequel Aliens, yet somehow the series chugs on. Covenant is no exception. It is a direct sequel to Prometheus from a few years prior, which was notable for two reasons: 1) it featured the return in the director chair of Ridley Scott and 2) its enigmatic eye-catching trailer was easily the best thing about it. Scott returns again for the sequel.The action shifts to the title starship, which is carrying an army of married couples in suspended animation on their way to colonize a distant planet. An interstellar accident leaves the captain dead (James Franco, in a nanosecond cameo for reasons unknown) and finds an awakened core crew stunned, especially when they intercept a transmission of a woman singing 'Country Roads' from a mysterious heretofore unknown Earth-like planet. Katherine Waterston, as the former captain's grieving widow, is reluctant to go, but Billy Crudup is now in command and decides to check this miraculous planet out. Of course, that proves to be a deadly decision since the seemingly hospitable planet features not only an array of deadly organisms to inflict grisly deaths, but Fassbender's sociopathic android from the prior film.Ostensibly the fact that the characters are made up of couples is supposed to make them more relatable. It doesn't. There is a male couple acting as security - for the life of me I did not fathom whether they were supposed to be gay or whether they were just along for the ride. One of them is played by the great Oscar-nominated actor Demien Bichir, who literally has nothing to do. Throughout the film, husbands and wives are killed and their surviving partners are oddly ambivalent about the loss. The exception is Waterston who starts the film grieving and proceeds to be teary-eyed through the entire film, until the final moments require her to toughen up and take matters into her own hands.Part of the problem is that either Scott does not understand what made the first Alien successful or he is so obsessed with the android subplot that he should have instead looked into revisiting the Blade Runner franchise instead. Fassbender gets to pull double duty as both the malevolent David and the sweet Walter - the Covenant's android. There are myriad of scenes with Fassbender seemingly on the verge of kissing people or hovering near them in an oddly sexual manner that ultimately becomes laughable. At one point, David seductively tries to teach Walter about a flute and howlingly advises that he 'will do the fingering'. Um, OK. Alas, David is no where near the dynamic character Scott seems to believe he is and he becomes a liability the longer the film dotes on him.Although I was no fan of Noomi Rapace's bland heroine from Prometheus, it seems more than a tad disrespectful to off her character in between films. She was not the brightest person, but I have a hard time believing that she would have regenerated the duplicitous David and allowed him into a position to murder her. Then again, characters act incredibly stupid from frame one onward. I do not just mean horror movie stupid...I mean catastrophically stupid. The characters land on a strange planet and then just begin waltzing around without protection resulting in one of them getting infected with an organism. He is returned to the shuttle with the doctor and an experienced security person. When he starts into a scene a la the chestbuster, the security woman locks the doctor in with a dangerous alien without having to do so (resulting in the latter's death), runs hysterically through the ship screaming, returns to the scene, allows the creature to escape, has more hysterics and then accidentally blows the entire shuttle up with a stray shot. Her surprisingly stoic husband (Danny McBride) laconically greets the news of her hysterics and demise with 'That's not like her.' Throughout the film, characters know the danger and go off on their own to wash up or fumble around in the dark. Crudup's character may well be the singularly dumbest in cinema history. Literally every decision he makes is nonsensical and wrong, but he excuses it in every other scene by reminding us that he is a man of faith. Even after discovering that Fassbender's David is a psycho murderer, he laughably follows the android's instruction to stick his head over a hatching alien egg to peek inside.Worse, every new detail given us to explain the origin of the aliens makes them less scary. There was a certain innate terror in the original films that there were these horrible things lurking in dark places of the universe just waiting to pounce. They now seem diminished with the revelation that they are nothing more than an experiment wrought by a bratty android. At one point, a newly hatched alien literally gives David a Nazi salute that results in audience guffaws.Acting is mediocre throughout. The effects are also nothing great, with the CGI oddly making the aliens less convincing. There is a ridiculous scene in a shower with a couple and an intrusive alien that comes out of no where. And can someone figure out how to kill these things without using the blowing them out into space routine.The final moments show how bankrupt Scott and company have become. The film sets up the dynamic of a brewing conflict between the maniacal David and earnest Walter. When one of the android's manages to accompany the witless survivors, Scott delivers the twist of it being the evil one like it was not a cliche that anyone could see coming from miles away. Not only does the film suck, but it does so in predictable ways and does not even realize it.",2,1,3,12 August 2019
