Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Now that's what I'm talking about!!
","Wow!  This was a superb movie!  For a guy who grew up in Detroit, spending my Saturdays watching Charlie Lum's Chinese Theater on WXON, this movie was the BOMB!! Pai Mei you ARE the master killer!! I forgot how much I enjoyed those rack-focus closeups, the whole uh...Uh..Ooh! of a well choreographed fight scene, and those crazy click-click noises in the soundtrack.  Man that was cool.  Sure it's fantasy, but it was just what I was looking for. I really digged the standout female roles, like from a Sarah Paretsky novel.  They were really involved.  Uma, you're the hottest!  And Darryl Hannah, an earlier generation honey, had such a cool character!  She didn't seem imposing at all in KB#1, but what a villain!! David Carradine was excellent and I would sure like to see him in more films.  Michael Madsen had a great role too.  The strip club scene was a bit of a waste of film and detracted from the action, but I guess Tarentino had to develop the character a bit more to have him earn his pay.  The morale there is, watch where you spit your tobacco!  haha. I'm going to go back to enjoy this movie and the performances again and again. A must-buy for any kung-fu/ Tarentino fan.  You outdid yourself there, T.  So much entertainment...  Damn well done!! For a guy who makes it a point to watch all movies, (a bit anal I know) I just want to conclude with:  Top 5 in honeys, top 5 in characters, and a top 5 movie!!!! Bow down, LOTR!!!",Null,1,2,17 April 2004
