Mission: Impossible III," You will forget about the popcorn
","I only have two criticisms of this movie. The first is that the title has 4 'i's in a row. M i:iii. Something should have been done about this. Secondly, there is a conversation in the beginning of the movie where Tom Cruise uses the word 'literally' and pronounces it lit-rly which seems out of character to me. Aside from those arbitrary discrepancies, this movie is amazing. I know John Woo is a celebrated director, but the second M:I is the worst one of the series. This is the sequel that should have been. This movie showed me that I had forgotten what suspense is. My girlfriend had to look away from the screen because she was so nervous. My sister spent the entire movie bouncing her legs up and down. Even if this movie was just a home movie of Morgan Freeman reading the story out-loud, the film would have still been amazing. This story surpasses the first film's story and the second film isn't even worth mentioning in comparison. There is a scene where action is specifically left unshown, which was a daring but awesome decision.",10,0,1,8 May 2006
Spider-Man 3," Hollywood garbage
","there are 25 minutes of good film packed somewhere within this 120+ minute movie. The acting is as best as the script could let it be, but the dialog is horribly written in such a way that it plays out as a clich√© drama with bits of a good spiderman movie sprinkled throughout. the movie is cheesy and definitely directed towards a teen audience which was painfully clear throughout the movie. the cgi was noticeable and the score was overpowering and obnoxious with very cheesy queuing. venom is an excellent villain and could have really helped this film. the 25 good minutes in the film are the 25 that contain venom. this movie feels like a frozen dinner that only vaguely represents the dish it tries to be. the themes are old and boring and the 'be a good person' messages are demeaning and childish. if you are past the age of 11 or have watched more than 20 movies in your lifetime, this movie is not for you. Hollywood garbage.",2,9,15,4 May 2007
Donnie Darko," The Directors cut provides a guide to the artistic accomplishment that is Donnie Darco
","These two different films have two different consequences. The original film is completely bewildering, but in such a way that as the credits roll through, you squint your eyes and gaze off in the distance, but your mouth slowly curls into a silly open mouthed smile. There is somehow a sense of satisfaction in the confusion this movie creates. With the original, you need to explore the book pages on the DVD extras and the website may be helpful. The directors cut is a little different. The philosophical statements come across a little more clearly. The pace of the directors cut was enjoyable to me. Somehow I felt as though the questions i had were able to develop more and really simmer as the movie progressed, whereas there is so much momentum in the original cut that it felt a little rushed. So here is my comparison of the two: Original Cut is a great artsy confusing conversation piece that can entertain your thoughts for days. The Directors Cut is a little more straightforward, less questions are left unanswered. I recommend watching both, but at least a week apart",10,4,8,4 May 2006
