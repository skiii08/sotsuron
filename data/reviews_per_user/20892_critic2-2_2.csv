Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lucas is light-years ahead of everyone else in the the art of FX
","Okay, everyone in the known universe has heard of 'Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace'. All I can say is that Lucas is light-years ahead of everyone else in the the art of F\X.  For that alone 'The Phantom Menace' is worth seeing.Natalie Portman is outstanding I'm looking for more of her in the future. On top of that a fairly good story with a little 'Ben Hur' thrown in makes for a great romp through the stars.  Enjoy!!!!!!!!",Null,0,0,19 May 1999
The Mummy," A frist rate Mummy film.
","A first rate Mummy film.  You know what is going to happen, we all do, but it happens fast and with style in this 1999 version of 'The Mummy'. Brendan Fraser was good in 'Blast From The Past' but he is outstanding in this movie, ( the next Indiana Jones????). If you want a fast-paced action romp with a little horror thrown in for good measure go see 'The Mummy'.",8,0,0,18 May 1999
