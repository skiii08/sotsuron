Captain Phillips," Greengrass only gets better with each film he makes.
","Greengrass is a filmmaker who knows the importance of those thirty minutes. His style of filmmaking is perceptible. He builds his plot tenaciously, layers it thickly with emotion and dramatic tension and lets all hell break loose in the end. Scrap off the top and you'll find a textured plot underneath, neatly done and ready to be utilized for the knockout punch. 'Captain Phillips' is no different.Being an ardent admirer of 'United 93', you might have already guessed how excited I was for yet another hijack-drama from Greengrass. I was positively stoked. But, you know, the problem was that the movie did not drizzle me with its magic right away. There's a long build-up involved to get the film going, give it its wheels, which details diligently how Captain Richard Phillips treats its crew. He's methodical, unerring and flinty. His crew envies and scorns him, but never doubts him. It's a well-etched character but it did not require the lengthy prologue.And then, there's someone else who admires Phillips. Abduwali Muse, a young Somali pirate, winds up a crew of his own and strays into the Somali Basin to carry out a hijack. He works for a boss, who needs money, and Muse gets his hands dirty. He's determined, and even when it's a question of life or death, he stays put on his principles. He hijacks Phillips' ship after repeated attempts, and belittles Phillips' offer of thirty grand and a ship back to Somalia. I'm not a beggar, he tells Phillips, and holding the captain hostage, demands a shocking ten million. You've got to admire the courage of the young lad. He's not dangerous, he's even likable to some degree but he's like a ticking bomb that could go off any second. And go off it does.For more than an hour, we see Phillips' attempts to convince the pirates to end everything peacefully, and to let everybody live in exchange for the thirty grand. The pacing is languid, but the film stays consistently engaging. Maybe the unpredictability of its guileful antagonist helps in keeping the tension palpable. Muse is diffident in his actions, he often turns to Phillips' advice when the Navy SEALS circle the ship, much to his comrades' chagrin.Greengrass directs with equanimity, the air of a man who knows what he has and what he can do with what he has. He takes his time to set the tone of the film, establish his characters so well that we begin to understand them. We can predict their actions, their words, their thoughts. It's not a slip-up, that's genuinely great filmmaking. I could almost feel the dearth of oxygen when the film entered the thriller mode. Greengrass makes his characters tangible, keeps the plot rife with violent tension. And when the characters splutter dialogues, they vent some of the tension out with them. It's the kind of movie where the dialogues make a difference because they allow you a quick peek into the minds of the characters we have come to know. Shrewd.But in the film's final thirty minutes, your breathing will grow increasingly ragged. Because knowing Greengrass and knowing what he can achieve with his films' denouements, I stopped trying to predict what's about to unfold. Well, the film was entirely predictable, seeing that it has been adapted from Captain Richard Phillips' autobiography, so it's not a give-away that we know how it'll end, is it? But how it gets there is something that made me stand up and applaud. One of the most unapologetically exciting action sequences I've seen in the recent cluster of films, the final showdown is nothing short of riveting. Skillfully executed, well crafted, acted and scored to perfection, the final moments live up to the kind of film 'Captain Phillips' promised it would be.It's easy to find fantastic performances from each and every member of the cast in a Paul Greengrass film. And it's not a surprise that Greengrass manages to coax Hanks to give his best performance in years. I've been trying to find a word that effectively describes Hanks in Captain Phillips but every single adjective downplays his performance. I'll settle with brilliant but it's not even close, you know. Barkhad Abdi, a young newbie who plays Abdawali Muse, is equally captivating. Mr. Abdi, I'm your fan already.The rest of the cast are efficacious in keeping a real sense of urgency at all times, ably backed by a tightly-wound, nifty script from Billy Ray, who relies heavily on words to keep the pace as brisk as possible.'Captain Phillips' is a marvelous film that definitely ranks as one of the year's finest. A bit indulgent in places and a tad slow for a thriller, but technically sound and terrifically shot by virtuoso cinematographer Barry Ackroyd, it's a vitriolic drama that smothers you with its power but, in its final moments, leaves you moved. Keep a oxygen tank handy.",8,0,0,16 January 2014
Inglourious Basterds," An ambitious film that falls short of its potential.
","Four years ago, when I first saw 'Inglourious Basterds', I felt that it was one of the best films based on World War II. However, after repeated viewings, I could not shake off the feeling that it could've been something extraordinary, given director Quentin Tarantino's penchant of a bunch of complex characters populating an exquisitely structured plot. Yet 'Inglourious Basterds' is a painfully strident portrayal, and a fictional one too, of the events that transpired to bring down Hitler in 1945. What could be more frustrating than to watch a film cripple slowly because the many ideas it chased for over two hours limp towards the end? Tarantino tries too hard to give it a nice finishing touch but instead turns the plot bland. Shosanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent), a Jewish girl, watches her whole family being massacred by SD Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), a Jew-hater, but escapes death and runs away into hiding. Four years later, Shosanna, now owner of a cinema in Paris, is offered to host the premiere of a Nazi propaganda film based of the exploits of Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl), who has taken a liking to her. In the quest for vengeance against the Germans, Shosanna secretly decides to burn down the cinema during the premiere. Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) recruits eight Jewish-American soldiers to take revenge against the Nazis and teach them a lesson in humanity. His ambition is to kill as many Nazi leaders as he possibly can. When Raine learns of the premiere which many members of the German Third Reich will most certainly attend, he cannot resist the temptation to strike the Nazis at the premiere. The film follows the intertwined stories of two parties simultaneously trying to carry out vengeful plans and bring down the Nazi rule.Though the premise of the film is admirably ambitious and wonderfully detailed, it is brought down by the staggering weight of its ambitions. A peek into the world which Tarantino devises with much cleverness sets the ball rolling, for the opening sequence of the film is nothing short of magnificent. The sequence, mostly relying on dialog between two men, is Tarantino at the top of his game, with its disarming wit and love for language. Tarantino sneaks some suspense in it too, and we delightfully succumb to its marvelous execution. 'Inglourious Basterds' has got plenty of sequences like this, most notably the bar sequence, which is grisly violent and funny at the same time. Tarantino, a writer of great repute, plies the viewer with a generous dose of witty dialog and keeps the humor consistent throughout the film. Cinematographer Robert Richardson effectively captures the lush greens of Germany in his lens and costume designer Anna B. Sheppard follows it up admirably, thus providing the right atmosphere to the film. I quite enjoyed the film's stylized look, though I'm used to war movies being somewhat rugged. 'Inglourious Basterds' is a well-executed film, and although it has its share of criticism, Tarantino knows his craft well, because the film is thoroughly entertaining.Though some drawbacks can be overlooked, some of them are too derogatory to be done so. For one, I found the film way too shrill for my taste. Tarantino heavily indulges into irony and his reluctance to embrace some of the facts tends to get infuriating at times. Apart from a few actors, many of them hand in over-the-top performances. It's not hard to guess that they're having the time of their lives trying to dissect some of the characters from the pages of history and adequately trying to portray their interpretation of them but failing, some miserably. The deft script is dealt with a hint of arrogance which, in my view, is the film's weakest point.Of the performances, Christoph Waltz is absolutely sublime, easily overpowering his fellow actors by stealing every scene he's in. Pitt's performance is shockingly over-the-top, with his raspy voice trying to give Lt. Aldo Raine an identity which doesn't quite connect. Melanie Laurent is the saving grace of a strangely mixed bag of performances.'Inglourious Basterds' has the skill which films seldom boast of but the over-the-top performances and the amusingly ambitious plot weaken an otherwise fine film. It is not Tarantino's best film, but if you prefer fiction over facts, it's one film you've got to get hold of.",6,0,0,18 January 2013
World War Z," Satisfyingly creepy.
","The awfully-titled 'World War Z' may give you the impression that it may be a kind of post- apocalyptic action escapade, but instead it is a smartly-packaged goody bag of thrills that delivers your money's worth at every turn. I always had a perception that zombies never work as proper villains in films, partly because they are limited to being laughably absurd objects that should be shot at and be done with, but director Mark Foster takes the cue and portrays them in a way that genuinely spooks us. The fascination for the exploration of the zombie genre hasn't satiated the appetite of those seeking to make sleazy horror getaways adequately as yet, but 'World War Z', thankfully, is an alleviating addition to a vexing genre.Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt), a United Nations employee, finds himself trapped in a heavy traffic with his family. A few tense moments later, a horde of zombies attack them, forcing them to flee for safety. Unsure about that's going on, Gerry seeks refuge in a US Navy ship, and meets up with his former colleague Thierry. As his family finds a safe shelter in the ship, a naval commander tells Gerry to help out or take his family off the ship. Unwilling to sacrifice the safety of his family, he gives in and takes off to a military camp in South Korea, which was supposedly where the infection started. In South Korea, a former CIA operative, who is jailed on charges of treason, tells Gerry to head to Jerusalem because Israel had knowledge about the outbreak before it began. Narrowly escaping the zombies who invade the city, Gerry takes off on the last flight out and heads to WHO to find out if a vaccine is possible to prevent the zombies from attacking people. With Sergen, an Israeli soldier who had accompanied him around Jerusalem, Gerry lands in Cardiff to find a possible prevention for the spreading virus. One of the few things that stand out are the impressively choreographed action sequences, which are as creepy as they are exciting. Take, for instance, the splendid sequence in which some Navy pilots have to make their way to an aircraft while trying to avoid zombies in the middle of a torrential downpour. The sequence, wickedly buffed to sleek perfection and striving on palpable tension, is explosive. There are a few sequences such as these which are scattered throughout the narrative, and it's hard to take a calming breath for even a second because the film doesn't let you. The tension mounts by the minute and Foster directs accordingly, working with urgency and patience that a thriller like this demands. The film's final revelation amounts to a finely-tuned crowd pleaser, and it does so with sneaky effect.Besides the fantastic action sequences, the film is unapologetically tedious to watch, making use of every cliché the makers could lay their hands on, the most familiar being an ex-army man trying to find a cure for a rapidly-spreading virus. One of the costliest errs that a film can make is to let slip what's about to happen next, and that's where 'World War Z' gets it all wrong. The plot is dispiritingly predictable, and the weakly-structured screenplay doesn't succeed at helping it trod through till the end, but the action sequences surmount most of the niggles I have with the film.Of the performances, Brad Pitt is reliably excellent, and the only actor worth mentioning about. For an actor of his caliber, this must've been a cakewalk for him, I believe. The rest of the cast are either inferior or believable, and remain forsaken accessories when the film digs deeper in its quest to burn through the bag of thrills. Though the film relies heavily on the action sequences, the rest of the cast largely underwhelm in the dramatic scenes. 'World War Z' isn't a great film by any standard, but it remains a commendable addition to zombie genre because it has us going when it wants to. Though I don't dig very deep into the genre, the soaring tension gave me enough excitement to make it worthwhile.",6,0,4,24 June 2013
Argo," A leading contender for the top prize?
","'Argo', Ben Affleck's directorial follow-up to 'The Town', is one hell of a thriller. Based on a true story of the CIA mission to rescue six American hostages in the 1979 Iran crisis, Affleck gets just about everything right, wangling fantastic performances from his cast and building the tense atmosphere that a thriller like this demands.In 1979, the Iran revolutionaries take over the American embassy in Tehran in retaliation for America sheltering the Shah in exile. The whole staff of the embassy is taken hostage but six members escape and hide in the house of the Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor (Victor Garber). with the situation of the members who escaped being kept away from the prying eyes of the revolutionaries, the CIA starts to make plans for bringing them home. Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), a CIA specialist, is brought in to try and find an alternative. He makes a ridiculous plan : to help them escape from Iran in guise of a film crew. In preparation for that, he sets up a fake studio in Hollywood with the help of John Chambers (John Goodman), a make-up artist and Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), a Hollywood producer and gets the press to sell this story. Will he be able to help the escapees get out of the country by making his plan work?I won't go any further because the rest of 'Argo' is a thing to be relished. Affleck, who has directed two films prior to 'Argo', sinks his teeth into the wonderfully-written screenplay by Chris Terrio. He infuses wry humor into the tense setting and builds tension slowly, though the pace of the film won't give you the luxury of breathing. The opening sequence is choreographed supremely well, as is the climax which is bound to leave you breathless. But where Affleck really shines is how he handles the sequences, like the market sequence, which are shot in the open city with Iranian characters. He etches out his characters really well, adding subtle layers to them by showcasing their desperation with a few terse conversations. Of the performances, the whole cast turn in convincing performances, but Arkin, who plays the only fictional role in the film of a pompous Hollywood producer Lester Siegel, shines above all others. He generates most of the laughs in the film along with Goodman, who is equally good in his role. The only issue I have with this beauty of a film is that it runs contrary to my belief that if a film is based on a true story, it should not fictionalize any event. The film has quite a few moments which have originated from the mind of its writer Terrio, like the role of Siegel or the fact that the American embassy staff were turned away by a few diplomats. Though the reason for fictionalizing events for dramatic purposes is understandable, I believe one should not dab at a factual plot.Although I was aware of this before I saw this film, I could not help but enjoy it thoroughly. 'Argo' has given me the same sort of wonderfully unexpected thrill I had experienced while watching 'The French Connection'. Seldom have I watched a film that had me this hooked from the moment it began. I'm appalled by the fact that Affleck has not snagged a nomination for Best Director, though I expect this film to be a leading contender for the top prize.",7,0,1,10 January 2013
Midnight in Paris," Charming and original.
","'Midnight in Paris', Woody Allen's latest crowd-pleaser, is one of the most original films I've seen in eons. Ripe from Allen's raw imagination, the film captures Paris at its most majestic and the vivid characters blend into the tasty concoction of humor, romance and nostalgia. This one's a pure Woody Allen picture.Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) is a Hollywood screenwriter who longs to write something more creative than mundane screenplays. While working on his first novel, he takes off on a trip to Paris with his fiancé Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her parents. Gil's nostalgic about Paris in the 1920s. Tired of his lack of interest in most activities, Inez advises him to stick to screen writing. Inez wants to tour Paris in the company of her friends Paul (Michael Sheen) and Carol (Nina Arianda) but Gil isn't interested, and one night he takes off for a stroll when he runs into a couple of people on their way to a party. Slowly snapping out of his drunken self, he realizes that he's actually been transported back to the 1920s, where he encounters the people he idolizes : Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. In the 1920s Paris, he meets Adriana (Marion Cotillard) whom he falls in love with. Finally, Gil is left to face a big question : Does he want to live in Paris and meet people he idolizes everyday at midnight or spend the rest of his life doing what he's currently doing : writing films?Just because this is a Woody Allen film, you know that the city will play a big role in the story. It does and how! Cinematographer Darius Khondji's magical camera captures Paris in the most subtle way possible. But what's special about this film is the superb writing, an art which no one knows better than Allen. The writing can't be categorized as comical but the humor is woven into the script with great finesse. The film depends heavily on the writing and the colorful conversations between the characters liven up the film which would've otherwise slogged. Apart from the marvelously written dialog and characters, the performances by the whole cast are exemplary. This is easily Owen Wilson's best performance and he brings a quiet confidence to his role. One sequence in the film, where Gil attempts to steal a pair of earrings which belong to Inez only to run into her and her parents outside the door, is so sharply written and enacted that it could well be one of the best sequences Allen has directed in years.Though the film is innovative, it's devoid of a plot, however. A small plot could've turned this into a great film, but nothing happens except Gil going back to the 1920s every night and meeting up with his idols. That is the only issue I have with this otherwise fantastic film.'Midnight in Paris' may not be a great film, but Allen's buoyant writing guarantees you an enjoyable 90 minutes. Seldom has a fantasy-adventure been this funny since Robert Zemeckis' miraculous 1985 film 'Back to the Future'. Way to go!",7,1,2,29 December 2012
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag," Significant but vastly disappointing.
","The first sequence, before the opening credits pour in, is of a 400 meter dash in the 1960 Rome Olympics. The camera slowly pans across the wildly jubilant crowd. Milkha Singh, India's finest athlete, leads the race for most of its runtime after the gunshot but hesitates when his coach yells something, distracting him, and ends the race in the fourth position. The whole country is at once abuzz about what made him look behind when his victory was conspicuous. The cry in question is the title of the film, a cry which connects him to a haunting childhood memory which triggered his emotions when he heard it. Soon after, Milkha Singh refuses an invitation to a friendly race in Pakistan, which, in the media, is interpreted as a symbol of his deplorable loss at the Olympics. The problem isn't why Mehra extensively employs the technique of flashbacks to tell us why Milkha Singh lost a place on the podium. The problem is why he took over three hours to tell it. That is perhaps where 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag' gets it wrong. In an industry where biopics are a rare commodity, I applaud the makers who brought to life a biopic on a significant and nearly-forgotten figure who gave us so much to cheer about. However, the makers can't seem to differentiate between a biopic and a documentary. What started out as the former ended as the latter.After the gripping first sequence, the focus shifts years back to the recruitment of the Indian Army in Secunderabad. Milkha Singh (Farhan Akhtar), a freshly recruited soldier, naive and rebellious in his actions, runs his first race for a glass of milk. The sergeant Gurudev (Pavan Malhotra), who is in charge of picking the ones who will represent the unit in further races, notices the young soldier. As Singh begins training with Gurudev, he keeps earning accolades and cheers from the ones who come to watch him. His triumphs also lead to a few unwanted enemies, but he shows grit and determination in the face of hate, and breaks the national record on an injured foot.The story shifts back again and we find ourselves in Punjab circa 1950. Singh falls for a girl in his neighborhood Biro (Sonam Kapoor), who, at first, spurns his attempts but later gives in. After finding out that he's no more than an idler, she dumps him but promises to wait for him after he vows to change as a person.The story follows Singh over the course of the next few years, passing through his highs and lows. After failing to qualify for the !956 Olympics, the blame which points to a half-baked romance with his Australian trainer's granddaughter Stella (Rebecca Breeds), Singh begins training harder than ever, winning most of the races he participates in with aplomb. After his loss in the 1960 Rome Olympics, he finally decides to seek redemption in the friendly tournament organized in Pakistan.Like numerous biopics attempted before, 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag' starts with an affliction. Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, the man behind the terrific 'Rang De Basanti' and the awful 'Delhi-6', churns out a highly-dramatized interpretation of Milkha Singh's attainments. But somewhere along the way, the definitions of biopic and documentary seem to merge and what eventually unfolds is a half-baked amalgam of both. As the story evolves through a series of lapses of details and emotions, the unnecessary scenes come with very little relevance to the plot. Like a scene in which Singh drinks two cans of ghee, Mehra lets the scene go on longer than you'd usually want it to before it begins to get on your nerves. The jocular representation of Singh's grit and determination is at times intended to warrant a few laughs but I perceived it as a rather callous and grave gaffe on the part of the makers. In a fantastically burlesque sequence, in which Singh runs a race which guarantees him a place in the national athletics team but on his injured feet and ultimately breaks the national record, the wrought and exploited use of slow-motion make it look so over-dramatized that it's parodied eventually. The several weakly-scripted scenes are a surprise from writer Prasoon Joshi, who knows how to extricate music from words, as he plods through the minutest details from the many episodes of Milkha Singh's life. Ultimately, the film's runtime of over three hours is too much mush of details to bear and the film traipses to its finish, something that shouldn't have been but finally is relieving.Technically, the film is a dazzler. Binod Pradhan's mystical camera follows the events that shaped the life of Singh with a poetic eye. The film is shot masterfully, capturing the falling pellets of sweat with a cheeky verve that transports us back to the period. The emotive horrors of the Partition are animated credibly in a violent sequence that is intensely terrifying. The race sequences are enthralling and exhilarating, and the film has got scores of it. Also, the art direction is flawless, believably recreating the time before and after the Independence, the artistic detailing conveying a different story altogether.Farhan Akhtar's brilliant rendition of Milkha Singh deserves the highest possible praise. Not only does he look the part, his torso undergoing a complete transformation, he plays Singh with such sincerity and vigor that the other characters look insipid next to him. Pavan Malhotra, an enormously underrated actor, skillfully backs Akhtar's dedicated performance. He is soulful, resolute and affecting. Sonam Kapoor and Divya Dutta, in extended roles, remain bungled, underused accessories, contributing only weakly to the lack of star-power in the film.'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag' is a significant though misfired attempt to pay a befitting tribute to a remarkable man. And it's such a shame because, with finer editing and tighter scripting, it had the legs to go the distance. Sadly, it tumbles way before, much like our hopes.",5,3,15,13 July 2013
Léon: The Professional," Engaging but surprisingly hollow.
","How disappointing it is to watch a movie that promises so much but in the end, the product is eventually underwhelming, and your hope ruptures like a balloon when pricked. 'Leon : The Professional' starts off rather well, builds it story through episodes of violence and cans of milk, but doesn't know what it wants when the action gets going. Leon (Jean Reno) is a quiet, reclusive hit-man living a discreet life in New York City. Methodical, smart and stern, he works assignments for an Italian mob boss, Tony (Danny Aiello). Leon has principles - he hardly ever watches television, always drinks only milk and takes good care of a potted plant which he labels his best friend. Leon's neighbor is Mathilda (Natalie Portman), a brash and bratty girl of twelve, who has a junkie for a father and stepmother, an impertinent stepsister and a four year-old brother, whom she loves. Her father (Michael Badalucco) steals some drugs a corrupt DEA agent, Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman) left with him for safekeeping, Stansfield instructs him to return the dope by noon the next day, a warning which the junkie coolly ignores.The next day, Stansfield and his team storm the household and kill everyone they can find, including Mathilda's young brother. Traumatized and angry, she seeks lodging with Leon, the only other person whom she considers a friend. Though reluctant at first, Leon gradually eases in her company. Mathilda wants to learn how to kill, a task Leon grudgingly accepts. In the process, she develops feelings for him, which remain one-sided. As time passes, Mathilda becomes increasingly restless to avenge her brother's murder.Director Luc Besson sets the events in motion with a terrifically tense action sequence early on, a taster of what to expect later on when the plot gets lurid. The prefatory sequence introduces the protagonist in a way that it needed to, with a barging camera that captures the detailed action with curious fervor. The characters are meticulously written and a great deal of attention is paid to level them out, allow us to get familiar with them. In parts, I enjoyed the movie thoroughly, reveling in the little occasional doses of humor and heartbreak. Besson weaves the action with the drama skillfully, and though the film limps through many of the sequences, it's fantastically watchable. Boring, it is never. And the climax sequence, a great jolt of pure cinema, is masterfully directed. The biggest hitch with 'Leon : The Professional' is that it is never the sum of its individual products. An oddly constructed assassin-actioner, there are long, yawning stretches of time when the plot hardly advances. It wants to be about its little protagonist but Besson resorts to not let Leon out of the sight. Which is why, I presume, the trivial romantic angle is introduced, a sub-plot which bears very little relevance to the actual story. And when it does get to its exceptional end, hobbles to it rather, it seems like a tediously-assembled downer. Shame.The entire cast is outstanding. Reno hands in a textured, peerless performance which is full of ferocity and feeling, a rarity. Oldman, whose character is dangerously stereotyped, steals the few scenes he has. The cocksure and amoral agent is a character we so often get to watch but Oldman puts a little spin on it and delivers an ace performance. The surprise package of the lot is young Portman, a brilliantly expressive, supremely confident Portman, who screams 'Oscar' all the way. I find it astonishing that a twelve year-old young actress is capable of pulling off something even forty year-old, experienced actors would sweat to clinch.'Leon : The Professional' could've been something more than it is, had it paid a little more attention to its fundamental storyline and not what would please the viewers. I find it galling that a movie of such potential is bogged down by its petty indulgences.",6,1,3,13 November 2013
The Usual Suspects," Mysteries don't get any better.
","You're introduced to five criminals walking into a dingy police station. One look at them and you know that these are the guys who always get mixed up in something funny. They're called to read out something from a piece of paper which they do, ending their lines with a cuss and allowing themselves a hearty snicker. The scene continues and you see each one of them getting interrogated personally by the cops. All of them claim their innocence whilst the cops threaten them and once or twice, answer back, not giving a damn what the cops might do to them. 15 minutes into this marvel of a film and it had me laughing hard and loud. That's the beauty of 'The Usual Suspects'.The film follows the story of Roger 'Verbal' Kint (Kevin Spacey), a small-time con man and a cripple, who narrates his story to the cops about what happened after the lineup, beginning from a small hit-and-run robbery and ending in a waterfront explosion that killed 27 men. His story is about how the five men: Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), a professional thief; his partner Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), the smart guy; the explosives expert Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollack), the corrupt cop Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) and Kint, are blackmailed into stopping a drug trade by a legendary and seemingly omnipresent gangster Keyser Soze. As Kint's story progresses, it becomes more and more complex and finally gives rise to a big question: Who is Keyser Soze?'The Usual Suspects' is unlike anything I've ever seen: fast, cold, dark, unnerving, funny, nasty and spellbinding. It's crude cinema at its finest (how often d'you get to see something like that?). What makes it even better is how director Bryan Singer's got a way to build nail-biting suspense. He never lets you know anything you absolutely don't need to know and gets you the facts on a need-to-know basis. Of course, Singer's not the only hero of this film. The screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie, is one of the best ever written, pure and simple. In the first scene itself, he introduces his characters and you understand them, not wanting to know anything more about them and he doesn't let on much, making you guess what each of them goes through throughout the film. One question whose answer has evaded me for years: How on earth did he imagine all this? McQuarrie's been equipped with terrific imagination and you see that through his writing.This is the kind of film that could've faltered if it wasn't for the splendid performances by the cast. Spacey is sensational in the lead role, wearing a slightly bemused expression throughout the film, he gets you laughing when he wants to make you laugh. Del Toro is equally wonderful as the smart guy whose accent is hard to decode. The editing by John Ottman, who is also responsible for the haunting score, is what makes the inspiring climax hit you like a 1000-ton train at full speed.'The Usual Suspects' is an underrated classic. It's a superbly crafted suspense-thriller which has elements of a dark comedy. Four years after I first watched it, it still holds the pride of being the only film which I had seen a second time as soon as I had finished the first viewing. If it's on my favorite-films list, I would put it near the top.",10,1,1,30 November 2012
Before Sunset," A stroll well worth your time.
","It's a story that sounds great on paper, I thought, when I first read about 'Before Sunrise', the prequel to 'Before Sunset'. It was a simple romance of a boy who meets a girl on a train and both of them take a walk around Vienna. What unfolded in 'Before Sunrise' made me bite down my initial cynical view of it and extol its greatness. 'Before Sunset', on the other hand, is a story of a boy who meets a girl again. I always wanted to find out what happened to the characters of Jesse and Celine after the abstruse ending in the first part. Understandably, 'Before Sunset' was like a breath of fresh air and, like the characters it involves, it was like catching up with old friends.Nine years after they parted in Vienna, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) meet again, this time in Paris, when Jesse, who is a bestselling author, is doing a book- tour. Jesse, who had based his book on the night they spent strolling around Vienna, tells her that he wrote it only so that he can meet her again. Celine walks in when he is doing an interview in a bookstore and both of them, initially awkward, decide to take a walk around Paris.In sequels, I always find an eagerness in directors which is quite discernible when it comes to handling a significant moment, the eagerness to express the importance of that particular moment and make the audience take notice of it. In case of 'Before Sunset', the most crucial moment presents itself in the meeting between Jesse and Celine. Thankfully, director Richard Linklater handles it wonderfully well, melding the awkwardness, excitement and nervousness and polishing it off with a nice touch of brevity. Though we expect the characters to go straight into discussing their lives and loves, it's fascinating and equally frustrating to watch the gaucheness between the two. Linklater prefers pragmatism over drama and it's such a comfort because the experience is much more homely that way. Once again, we find a bit of ourselves in the discussions between Jesse and Celine, the conversations becoming more personal, bleak and melancholic. While romance guided the first part, it's missing here as the characters we meet this time again have settled themselves in their lives and their thoughts have matured with them. Though the discussions brush on a lot of topics, I found the one in the café particularly invigorating. The magic lies in how gloriously extemporized they sound, casual and vivifying at the same time.Though the film is talky, and unapologetically so, the conversations are supremely well-written. They are honest, funny and familiar, rich and charming, illustrative of the issues they touch upon. Linklater, Hawke and Delpy, who contributed to the screenplay, manage to effortlessly express their notions through the writing. 'Before Sunset' is one of those rare films that work solely because of its prodigious writing, and this is truly a script for the ages.Hawke and Delpy give remarkable performances, a certain betterment of the ones they gave in the prequel. Though the romance angle is sadly absent this time around, their intuitive chemistry is a joy to watch.I can't say if 'Before Sunset' is an improvement on its prequel or not but it's definitely more empirical and assured. But like 'Before Sunrise', it leaves you with the same euphoric feeling, impelling you to invest in the characters and their lives.",8,0,0,11 July 2013
Django Unchained," Brutal, captivating and tremendously funny.
","If you thought 'Inglourious Basterds' was revolting, wait until you see 'Django Unchained'. There is a sequence in the film where two slaves engage in an incredibly brutal brawl and an injured slave endlessly screams from the pain that has been inflicted on him. Moments later, the sequence climaxes and we see the winning slave bludgeoning the injured one to death with a hammer, which is mostly off-screen because the camera lingers on the other characters in the room. The sequence is intensely horrific, strangely audacious, and, in a way that can only be described as occult, fascinating because it says a lot of the characters. 'Django Unchained' is the second historical epic from the freshly pickled imagination of Quentin Tarantino and the second one where he invents a history of his own, with inexorably gloating pleasure I might add.Django (Jamie Foxx) is a slave who is freed by a German dentist-turned-bounty- hunter Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) from the shackles of a chain-gang. Django, who alone knows how the Brittle Brothers, Schultz's next victims, look like, accepts the offer that Schultz proposes to him. As they partner in bounty-hunting till the end of winter, Django becomes increasingly obsessed in finding his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who is rumored to be in the Mississippi plantation Candyland, belonging to Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). The plot traces the attempts of Django and Schultz to rescue Broomhilda from the egotistic Candie.In the ingenious world of Tarantino, the only thing predictable is how every single thing will make sense in the end. Gleefully excruciating from the word 'go', it takes a Tarantino to dazzle you with the fastidious violence, made majestic by the magical sound of Ennio Morricone. You can't do much but helplessly watch on as Tarantino's wondrous language protrudes the plot, often punctuating it with brutal gunfights and an irresistible undercurrent of dark humor. In a splendid sequence in the middle which is sure to make you cackle till it hurts, we see a bunch of bumbling Klu Klux Klan members complaining about the masks they have been made to wear. He stealthily, coyly and effectively sneaks in quivering tension in it too and does it all too well. Cinematographer Robert Richardson does his bit, masterfully capturing the flying droplets of blood that land on the flowers beds in the fields. The questions that often come up while watching a Tarantino film are : Has he done too much? Is he trying too hard? Isn't the plot a bit excessive? Yes, on all counts. But, then again, it's Tarantino we're talking about. And boy, has he got a way to do it.Though technically sound, 'Django Unchained' lacks the finesse and the diabolical cleverness that was much more prominent in Tarantino's last film, 'Inglourious Basterds'. Cramming every single idea that will go with the story is amusingly absurd, but here's an attempt to do it anyway. Close to three hours, the film begins to drag at the end, partly because the director isn't done with showing the heroics of his hero. This leads to another twenty minutes of nonsensical blood splattering, which was completely extraneous.Of the performances, Christoph Waltz, who was brilliant in 'Inglourious Basterds' is a marvel as Schultz, portraying him with the right amount of swagger and menace. DiCaprio and Samuel Jackson, in a supporting role, likewise are equally good. Foxx is slightly underwhelming as Django but manages to give a dignified performance.'Django Unchained' isn't Tarantino's best film, but it's a tad better than 'Inglourious Basterds' because Tarantino exerts a calm control over the script, something he faltered in in his last directorial outing. It's one film that makes you squirm in your seat even if you're not the squeamish type but it's a gorgeous piece of cinema that's unabashedly well worth a ticket. Succinctly put, it's an outrageous, darkly comic bloodbath that is as appalling as it is entertaining.",7,1,4,30 March 2013
22 Jump Street," Lackluster as a sequel, a hoot as a film.
","Rejoice. The thickheads are back to their old bumbling selves. Or are they?The inherent beauty of watching a movie is to walk into it with the notion that it won't be good and the trip is nothing but a mammoth waste of time, but it unexpectedly sweeps you off your feet. That's what happened with me with '21 Jump Street.'Sadly, that's not the case with '22 Jump Street.' Not by a mile.That's not to say it is a bad film, no, but unless you relish bon mots carefully placed between squishy sentimentality, there is no way this will add up to be the kind of film its predecessor was. '21 Jump Street' was an enormously goofy film that had a unique plot with the kind of tart humor that at times surpassed acceptable standards. That was what made it a film I kept going back to, starving for more of that hilarity seamlessly blended with great chemistry between Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill. With '22 Jump Street,' we get the exact same plot as before - and we know this because the characters keep repeating how similar it all is to 'the last time' - but none of it is even mildly astounding. Sure, one or two gags strewn casually over some scenes crack you up, but it lacks the twists that made its predecessor a risqué but entertaining ride.However, not all of it skids. The argument could be made that '22 Jump Street' is more heartfelt, more realized as a 'buddy-cop' film, with a more intricate plot to work with. The humor is squeaky clean this time around too, making it more accessible to its target audience, but for a staunch fan of the first film like me, this was a major negative. I don't associate clean humor with the franchise, that simply kills the intention, you see. But that's just an essential for me.The element that impressed me the most was the film's willingness to laugh at itself, its characters - a few of them could have been done away with though - and the gimmicks it throws up. It features one of the most comical brawls I have seen in the movies recently, and more of Ice Cube's priceless tirades. It's a sequel so aware of the responsibilities it is shouldering that it sticks to the old formulas like moth to a flame, and the clichés it does well. Really well. I didn't expect '22 Jump Street' to be a perfect film by any standard, but my expectations were right through the roof. It needed its characters to be more fleshed out, more detailed, its plot a bit more incisive and it could have hit the spot beautifully. But what I saw was a film desperate to keep up with my patience that was fast vaporizing. Strip the film of the unnecessaries and you would get the sequel I had envisioned. And that includes the disposable bit of Schmidt's love interest. Come on, what purpose did Amber Stevens serve to the plot eventually? Zilch.In one of the scenes, there is an indication of a '23 Jump Street' coming up next. I shall wait. But I do hope that it will be more like the first than the second. So do the audience who watched it with me in the theaters. I reckon they weren't too amused either.",6,1,4,10 July 2014
Children of Men," A remarkably-crafted dystopian tale of optimism and sadism.
","I've never had a thing for science-fiction movies, especially the ones that are dystopian because they sustain themselves on the garish special-effects they bring along with them. But Alfonso Cuaron's 'Children Of Men' urged me to reconsider my views on the genre. An expertly-crafted violent chase thriller, 'Children Of Men' scores points on how believable it eventually is. Set in the near-future, it tells the tale of Theo Faron, a civil-rights activist, and his singular mission to transport a heavily-pregnant teenage woman, Kee, the first pregnancy in eighteen years after a bout of infertility, across the country during a communist uprising.Straight away, we find out that this is no ordinary movie. The first scene, in which we see Theo (Clive Owen) buying himself a cup of coffee in a shop which later explodes, tells us exactly what we're in for. Theo is later kidnapped by a group that calls itself the Fishes, a group that vies for an equal place for illegal immigrants in the country, and is told about the developments. Theo's ex-wife, Julian (Julianne Moore), who heads the group, informs him about the job which he is supposed to carry out - to transport a girl, Kee (Clare- Hope Ashitey) across the country to the Human Project. As they're ambushed by a mob which also leads to the killing of two officers and the death of Julian, Theo and Kee figure out that they'll be the hunted ones in connection to the deaths. Theo digs out an old junkie friend of his, Jasper (Michael Caine), who agrees to help them get to the boat, where the Human Project awaits them.'Children Of Men' is fueled by a manic energy that Cuaron weaves into the neurotic setting. Sensationally directed, superbly scripted and competently acted, 'Children Of Men' has got it all. There's style, there's substance and enthralling action sequences that wholly deserve to be whistled at. We're often being shown a voguish futuristic world which we buy into but seldom has anyone tried to think out-of-the-box. That's where Cuaron's boundless imagination comes into the picture. He gives us an frightful representation of what the world is about to turn into, cautions us and then takes our breath away. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezski ably backs his visionary chronicle, giving us a series of visuals so stunning that I was left lost for words. Technically sound, Cuaron and Lubezski team up to create an erudite experience that can just as be a documentary as a thriller.Owen, in his most eloquent performance yet, is terrific. His journey of making Faron a hero from a sympathetic loafer is absolutely moving. Ashitey, in her debut, hands in a dignified, scintillating performance. Moore and Caine exceed well in their small but significant roles.'Children Of Men' works well as a cautionary tale, a dystopian chase-thriller which is conceivable and ultimately satisfying. Richly textured and emotionally explosive, there is no way that it should be ignored. It shows us why fraternity is so crucial even during those times when we are left with no choice.",8,1,2,18 October 2013
Groundhog Day," Funny, innovative and Bill Murray.
","Say, how many times have you wished to live a day again? Maybe when you're really happy about something, so happy, in fact, that you want to live it through all over again. Maybe a most perfect day you could imagine. 'Groundhog Day' isn't a movie about those days. It's about a guy who relives the day of the year he despises the most. Tall order, you think, but director Harold Ramis actually gets away with it. He assembles a movie so thoughtful, so intelligent and so funny that you end up having a great time even if the idea does seem a bit far-fetched.We bump into Phil (Bill Murray), a cocky TV meteorologist who has to cover the Groundhog Day celebrations in Punxsutawney every year on February 2nd. Phil hates that part of his job. He's getting a better job, he brags at one point, so he won't have to go there again. Accompanying him on his little jaunt is Rita (Andie MacDowell), his producer, and Larry (Chris Elliott), his usual cameraman. Phil gets his weather calculations wrong on the big day and ends up being stuck in Punxsutawney after his broadcast because of a snowstorm. The next day, he wakes up to find himself living the same day over again. Initially surprised and spooked, he slowly begins to realize that he can't snap out of it unless the time loop is broken. As his frustrations quickly turn into mildly violent episodes, he begins to realize the other ways these odd circumstances could be used for.'Groundhog Day' begins almost lazily as Ramis spends a considerable amount of time to build the story. But as the movie progresses, it grows increasingly engaging though there is a light risk of it being repetitive since the crux of the plot is about deja vu. Once we get the gist of what is about to unfold, the flow is impossible to stop. Smoothly edited and neatly written, 'Groundhog Day' is a well-made crowd-pleaser that delights you with its wit. Cutting a fine line between a drama and a comedy, the film never takes itself too seriously. And therein lies its strength. Ramis is aware of the goofiness of the plot but the charming characters lead you to believe otherwise. 'Groundhog Day' misfires at times when he doesn't know what it wants to be. And that's aggravating to watch because the hesitancy translates on the screen. There were stretches of time when I had no clue what the movie eventually wanted but that niggle is rectified when it slides into a new soul later on. The movie scores with its characters. Bill Murray is nothing short of terrific, bringing the much needed zing factor into the proceedings with his enthusiastic performance that is infectious. The beautiful MacDowell has never been so endearing and she delivers a nearly flawless performance that's nicely textured. Some of the secondary actors aren't as good, I'm afraid, because they are reduced to mere caricatures. But since they don't gobble up much of the screen-time, that doesn't pose as a major problem.'Groundhog Day' is a charming, enjoyable fare that entertains and sermonizes in equal measure. If you're willing to overlook the minor hitches, it could be a movie that makes your day. And gives you a quick lesson in morals.",7,0,1,4 December 2013
Mystic River," Haunting.
","Clint Eastwood sure knows a lot about movies. Even though he doesn't make 'em like we'd expect from all those tough guy movies he had been in in the 1970s. May it be 'Million Dollar Baby' or 'Gran Torino', his obsession with tragedy almost rivals his obsession with emotions. That's precisely what you get in 'Mystic River', a straight-up Eastwood masterwork that boasts of deep cinematic passion and incredible storytelling. Aided by a cast for the ages, 'Mystic River' is a poignant beast of a crime-drama that's both spellbinding and moving.The film opens in an isolated neighborhood in Boston where three boys, Jimmy, Sean and Dave, play hockey. After losing their ball down the drain, they decide to inscribe their names on a piece of wet cement. When they do so, two men get down from a car and chastise them for damaging municipal property. Thinking they might be police officers, Dave gets into their car when the two angrily insist while Jimmy and Sean are left helplessly watching him go. Dave gets sexually abused by the two men for four days until he escapes.Many years later, the three of them have grown apart and have married. Jimmy (Sean Penn), an ex-con, runs a convenience store at the end of the street. He's helped by his nineteen-year old daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum). Katie's secretly dating Brendan (Tom Guiry), a boy Jimmy despises. The two make plans to elope to Las Vegas but Katie gets murdered the night before.Dave (Tim Robbins), now married and having a son, is still haunted by his predicament. A quiet character, he's in the middle of an unhappy marriage. When he returns home with blood on his shirt on the night of Katie's murder, his wife Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) questions him about it. When he tells her a story of having fought off and possibly killed a mugger, she doesn't believe him. The news of the murder leaks out and she suspects him of having killed Katie. Sean (Kevin Bacon) is divorced from his wife and is now a police detective. He's handed the case of Katie's murder but tries his best not to let his relationships with the people involved in it get in his way.Unlike most of Eastwood's movies, 'Mystic River' doesn't beat about the bush and plunges straight into the action. Acutely observed from the very first frame, the first sequence is deeply unsettling. Set mostly in an Irish neighborhood, Eastwood effectively creates a moody, suspenseful atmosphere when the two men delude the gullible boys. And that atmosphere persists throughout the movie. Because it's about the characters more than it's about the plot, a considerable amount of time is devoted to richly detail the life that goes on for the three protagonists. Screenwriter Brian Helgeland writes solicitously, etching out the characters so wonderfully that you get enough time socialize with them. Though a lot goes on in 'Mystic River', it's a rather quiet examination of guilt and redemption and the drama that unfolds when the circumstances play their part in the lives of the characters. Eastwood crucially chooses pragmatism over drama, which is a relief considering that's not the case with most movies that we get to see now.One of the cavils I have with this beauty of a movie is that it's slow in its revelations. Most of the time I found myself guessing correctly what's about to transpire but the characters seemed too poky to keep up. Though the suspense was ultimately well-crafted, I would've preferred to be kept guessing till the very end.'Mystic River' largely benefits from the magnificent performances which the whole cast uniformly delivers. Penn is cogent, radiating his tremendous potential as an actor through the livid Jimmy. Robbins is fantastic, playing a quiet, hurting father, you can't help but be sympathetic for his plight. Harden, in a brief role, hands in a nuanced, sensitive performance as a wife torn between her husband and a need for justice. Bacon does a pretty good job of turning Sean into a forceful personality that strangely gives you a lot of hope. In a film that's about guilt, Sean's the only symbol of hope. 'Mystic River' may be Eastwood's best work. It's a supremely well-directed, commiserative, observant drama that's completely bereft of film tricks. Here's a movie made with feeling that relies solely on its material to tell a good story. It's a riveting film that engages you and then smothers you with its power. Terrific.",5,1,2,2 September 2013
The Departed," One of Scorsese's very best.
","How can you make a storyline that borderlines the implausible work? Ask Scorsese. The master director is no stranger to tackling preposterous story-lines that end up becoming some miraculous films. Take for example the masterful 'After Hours', in which he demonstrated how you can take a ridiculous story and churn it into some kind of a classic with terrific storytelling. Now, with 'The Departed', Scorsese concocts one of the very best films of his immaculate career.Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a rookie cop, freshly recruited by Capt. Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Staff Sgt. Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) as an informant to help them implicate the Irish mob boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). He is the perfect bait, partly because of his family's prior involvement in organized crime. Billy starts off slow, catching Costello's attention and slowly working his way up the mob and finally gaining his trust. Staff Sgt. Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is the endearing new officer in the SIU who has everyone's trust, including a psychiatrist Mandolyn Madden (Vera Farmiga). Also, he's Costello's surrogate son who is his mole in the police unit. At first, a simple act of loyalty on both sides quickly turns into a desperate battle for survival when both the men realize the need to locate the identities of each other while trying to keep their identity concealed.As always, it is a pleasure to watch a film where Scorsese protrudes and dissects a crime story with such glorious skill and fervor. Though I haven't seen 'Infernal Affairs', I can safely state that 'The Departed' is by no means a flimsy remake, given the uncanny skill with which the story is handled. Take for instance a well-written and superbly etched-out scene where Costello beguiles a young Sullivan by buying him comic books and groceries. It's an honest portrait of how the ingenuous turn into the gullible and Scorsese works wonders by giving it a little piquant twist with the dark humor. It's remarkable how a Hong Kong-based story can be transported to an American setting with such deft precision and William Monahan writes wonderfully, giving the characters enough time and feeling until they become someone you can relate to. The plot unravels with genuine disregard for what happens to everything irrelevant to the story, and editor Thelma Schoonmaker marvelously cuts and trims to keep it rife with violent tension. Peopled by some outstanding actors, the cast is to die for. If a Scorsese film stars the ever-magnificent Nicholson, you don't need another reason why it should warrant a viewing. Nicholson is dazzling as the slightly psychotic Costello and it's pure delight to watch him play a creepy mobster with devilish traits. DiCaprio and Damon likewise are excellent in their respective roles, bringing the urgency and desperation to their characters effortlessly. The rest of the cast is stellar, with Mark Wahlberg turning in a remarkable performance as the foul-mouthed tough cop Dignam, something, admittedly, I had not expected him to pull off.'The Departed' is Scorsese's best film since 'Goodfellas' but it's not as good, sadly. But here is a film that respects its genre and it's one that's not all cops-and-guns but instead goes much deeply and illustrates with ruthless candor what circumstances force us to become.",10,2,3,6 April 2013
Zero Dark Thirty," A pulsating thriller that may not be everyone's cup of tea.
","Following Osama Bin Laden's execution last year, there were many questions left unanswered and a lot of theories surrounding the incident. With 'Zero Dark Thirty', director Kathryn Bigelow attempts to dissect the actual theory that compelled the CIA to raid Bin Laden's house and execute him, a theory, that the film states, came from a hunch. Now, I have no clue about what's fact and what's fiction in this dramatization of the events that transpired, taking into account the clamor that broke following the film's release, but as a film, 'Zero Dark Thirty' is a fine one that works both as a thriller and as a documentary.The film opens with a disturbing torture scene where a CIA interrogator Dan (Jason Clarke) tries to break the conscience of a suspect by subjecting him to various forms of torture. Of the few people present in the dimly-lit prison cell, one is Maya (Jessica Chastain) , a CIA officer who has dedicated her life to tracking down Bin Laden. Maya examines the statements of the detainees and thousands of interrogation videos of them for clues regarding the whereabouts of Bin Laden. The film follows her decade-long journey into procuring the necessary information that finally led to his execution.'Zero Dark Thirty' is devoid of a plot, though Bigelow wallows us in a world where the line between fact and fiction is so thin that the former seems almost insignificant. Cramming ten years of fact, fiction, lore and rumors into 157 minutes is no mean task but Bigelow does it with such skill that 'Zero Dark Thirty' is seldom arduous or uninteresting. It has an effortlessly-created grim atmosphere which is imperative given the plot that strives on palpable tension. The film follows a non-linear narrative where the facts that made a difference are examined and argumented upon with a sense of enthusiastic urgency.When a film is carved entirely out of facts, the license to fictionalize or imply something is a peccadillo. Some of the facts the film talks about are frustratingly implied rather than stated. Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal, working from their own research and some classified information, do not offer a plausible reason for the most important fact that the film states : how could Maya be so sure that her hunch is in fact- as we find out later- correct? In one sequence of the film that could well be the most important one, we see a whole room of CIA officers discussing the chances of Bin Laden being in a walled-house in Abbotabad, Pakistan, while the rest say that 'the chances are 60%', Maya says that 'the chances are a 100%'. The reason for her confident answer is never stated though, which is harrowing. The reason, which could possibly be a befitting answer to most of the errors of the film, is the hurried inclusion of his assassination that Bigelow weaves into the pulsating climax, a story, admittedly, was not the one she kept chasing for most of the film. Despite the few problems I have with the film, 'Zero Dark Thirty' disarmed me with its marvelous execution. It's fiercely alive and happening, cunning and sly when it's supposed to be and above all, peerless. Bigelow directs with assured confidence, occasionally punctuating the plot with nerve-wracking suspense and in the end, manages to tell a difficult story admirably. For me, the best sequence in the film is a mellow chase, where a few CIA officers attempt to track down an important suspect in the bustling market using only the signals from his phone. The sequence is a triumph, a dazzling concoction of film craft and artistry.Of the performances, Chastain is sensational, playing Maya with such gusto and unpredictability that you're fully aware of her significance in the film. The rest of the cast are stellar, with Mark Strong doing exceptionally well in a small role.Of the many films that have been made on 9/11, 'Zero Dark Thirty' is easily on the of the best though it's nowhere as good as 'United 93' which, according to me, still holds the top position. But it's one film that bravely asks questions no film before has attempted to seek answers to, not to mention how the events it recreates are so believable. Though some questions still linger on, we must exult that such films, though rare, are still being made.",8,4,8,19 February 2013
The Wolf of Wall Street," A firecracker of a film that explodes slowly.
","Wake up and rejoice. The 'Goodfellas' of our time has arrived, in all its vainglory.As always, it's a pleasure to witness a brilliant filmmaker spin out of control and crank out a transgressive piece of cinema so exhausting that you know that you now have a new milestone movie to scale. And before I even completed my viewing of 'The Wolf Of Wall Street', I knew I'm going to have to come back to it soon enough. Because there is so much going on, so much you have to watch, assess and enjoy that a single viewing can't do justice to it.Â  It's ridiculously dynamite, like Scorsese, aged seventy-one, mind you, wanted to live out his wildest dreams on screen. They animate like arresting fireworks in the sky, try tearing your eyes away, pal. Crass, it's not. I'm here to affirm that 'The Wolf Of Wall Street' is indeed shockingly vulgar and darkly funny, so much so that it makes Sacha Baron Cohen's Borat Sagdiyev seem like a saint. But, hey, we aren't forgetting what we are watching, are we? The material that served as the film's inspiration is Jordan Belfort's own memoir about his doings as a stockbroker in the good ol' 1990s. This is just a wily adaptation of the book. What's the big deal? It's not like he's preaching the kind of lifestyle that Belfort led, he's just studying it. Like we are.DiCaprio's Belfort is an obnoxious man, a sickening voyeur to hoot, to hang out with, to talk with, a conceited bighead who did something shamelessly nefarious like making millions of dollars through large-scale securities fraud and blowing it all up to satiate his drug-addiction. And yet, and yet, he's complete fun. He's reckless, he's stupid and he's funny. I haven't met anyone quite like him, certainly not in the recent spew of films and DiCaprio has never been more ebullient. He's Calvin Candie, only amped-up to several more degrees. And he comes with an swagger to match Scorsese's. Probably the best thing about 'The Wolf Of Wall Street' is that it doesn't preach. You don't get to hear sermons about what's right and what's wrong, but you're watching something that tells you it's bad. Belfort's drug-fueled antics first amuse you, then disgust you. You're left to figure it out yourself, nobody tells you that. That's Scorsese's genius. He takes a look at the crimes of Wall Street in the '90s through the villain's POV but while you're having a blast like him, you're also shocked by his actions. Like him.One scene stayed with me for a long time after I had finished it. That's a lunch scene between Belfort and Mark Hanna, his boss played by a spectacularly scrupulous Matthew McConaughey, who's goading his avaricious appetite. He slips a cheeky $100 note to the waiter and instructs him to get him drinks every five minutes till he passes out. He teaches Belfort how to make it big by plummeting stocks while high on alcohol and drugs, a character so different from the one he played in 'Mud'. McConaughey deserves an Oscar nomination for this two-bit role, the ten best minutes of the movie by miles, I think. Belfort walks and talks like no one I've met, and when Hanna's company gets wrecked, he talks a geeky Donnie Azoff into joining him. Azoff is impressed by Belfort driving a Jaguar, scoffs when Belfort tells him about the money stockbrokers make and is incredulous when Belfort pops up a check to prove it. And from then on, the ride's one hell of an explosion.I've never really understood the stock game, those are spiteful, wishy-washy things that don't get to me at all. I don't understand what the hell were these guys talking about, all those damn schemes they sold on the phone while doing drugs at the same time, but I understood what Scorsese and Winter wanted me to understand - they were making a lot of money and none of it was licit. Like Belfort's character sneers bumptiously at one point, none of the audience was expected to understand any of it. It wasn't about how they did it, it was about why they did it.For three hours, the kind of gross-out depravation that unfolded on the screen sickened me. I didn't find it funny at all, not when I'm watching an abhorrent man scourge and swindle a man into financing his junkets. Or a woman getting manhandled in a drug-induced haze. It wasn't meant to be funny, it was meant to be scary. Point duly noted?If 'The Wolf Of Wall Street' is an example of something, it's why Leonardo DiCaprio warrants an Oscar the Academy has owed him for over a decade. He's terrifically wild, perilously peppy and delivers his line, one after one, to comic perfection.The casting, as always in a Scorsese film, is flawless. Jonah Hill is fantastic, as are Rob Reiner and Kyle Chandler, who plays what he has been playing for the past two years. Reiner's aptly cast, much to my surprise, and he does well. Really well. Margot Robbie, as Belfort's wife, is impressive. She's got the looks and she's got the confidence. Good job handling the quivering pressure that came with the role. Jean Dujardin, who was sensational in 'The Artist', doesn't have much to do here but whatever little he has, he does alright. Scorsese's cinema has never been more alive and it's heartening to see the master filmmaker indulging into this kind of exuberance. You won't believe a seventy-one year old has made this kind of a film, it's more like a twenty year-old made it. Dazzling.",8,0,5,3 January 2014
The Conjuring," Genuinely scary.
","I'm not a big follower of horror movies because I always perceive them as mere distractions. Squeeze a proper horror film tight and all you get is a murky story that thrives on gore and special effects. They're made with a sole aim to shock you, to creep you out enough so that you know that this experience has been worth the wait. But that's not the case with 'The Conjuring'. It is a more archaic version of an clichéd plot of a demonic spirit that spooks a family that has just moved into their new home. And spook it does, being so gleefully scary and wonderfully crafted that it's one of the better horror films I've seen in a while.In 1971, Carolyn and Roger Perron (Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston) move into a new countryside house with their five daughters. From the first night, they notice strange things happening when they go to sleep. Doors open and shut of their own accord, their daughters complain of someone pulling their legs in the middle of the night. A rotten smell wafts through the place all day long. But when Carolyn notices bruise marks beginning to form on her limbs, she grows suspicious. Once, while investigating strange clap noises, her fears are confirmed. She seeks the help of two demonologists and paranormal investigators, Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga), who agree to perform an exorcism on the house after they catch the unusual happenings on tape. But when Lorraine figures out what the demon really wants, she finds that the task will be a lot tougher than she had initially guessed when her family is also targeted by it.Director James Wan, who had gained a substantial amount of notoriety for his 2004 film 'Saw', a whole new evaluation of the genre but complete detritus intellectually, certainly knows his thing. The tension mounts gradually, with just the creaking floorboards and moving objects giving you the chills in the first-half, and Wan slyly exploits the baffling episodes to magnificent effect. I've got to say, creaking doors have never creeped me out so much. These are old tricks, you see, with the abandoned farmhouse and dark history behind it, there's bound to be a creaking door somewhere. And when the demonic spirit restlessly stealths and haunts the Perrons, you are assured to have a tough time staying in your seats. The premise is simple, yes, but it's also supremely effective. Minus the loud sound effects and garishly-dressed ghosts, the film is one of those rare ones that alarms solely because of its tension and some smart filmmaking. My favorite sequence in the film, the one that spooked me the most, was a comparably mellow sequence in which Carolyn plays hide-and-clap with her youngest daughter. It's the first shocker of the film and a memorable one, smartly-directed and petrifying to the boot.'The Conjuring' works rather well in the first-half but gets increasingly smudgy in the second. After the demon is finally revealed, the plot goes terribly awry. Then come the floppy investigations and supernatural observations, wherein Lorraine sees visions of an old witch who is now haunting the family. The scares keep coming though, but they seem to shabby to invest in. The exorcism scene in its climax is caricatural and the memories of the 1971 horror masterpiece 'The Exorcist' make it look laughably awful in comparison. But Wan's too smart a filmmaker to let this blemish the film.Of the performances, none of them are memorable but they aren't bad either. Wilson and Farmiga are largely convincing in their respective roles. Taylor manages to give a potent performance, which is a surprise considering she started out as an incongruous accessory but she maintained a dignified presence as the story progressed.'The Conjuring' isn't a great horror film but it's satisfyingly scary. Based on a true story, it is a believable account of the terror a family witnessed but as a film, it doesn't work after a while and ends on a whimper. Still, it unnerved me enough to rob me of my sleep for a while. And I can't pay it a higher compliment than that.",6,0,1,3 August 2013
Before Sunrise," Take a tour you won't regret taking.
","There is something so endearing about 'Before Sunrise'. The story can be described in a single line and yet the film addresses immensely complex issues like parents, religion and love. It's a romance, an old-school one, shot, cut and acted with such uncanny skill that it feels like a piece out of your life.The story follows two people, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy), who meet on a train en route to Paris and decide to spend twenty-four hours walking around Vienna. In the time they spend together, they talk about all the things that made them what they are and what they could've become. When romanticizing a meeting between two strangers, one should be careful to avoid clichés or risk a film that slogs. Director Richard Linklater thankfully does avoid it, because the first meeting between the two protagonists is handled with great caution. A hesitant Celine is talked into accompanying Jesse around Vienna, which Jesse later remarks that 'the coolest thing about this evening was that it was never meant to be'. There are moments like these when you know how different this particular cinematic romance is, because it feels real. The first few conversations between the characters are slightly awkward because neither of them know if they've made the right choice. Linklater handles the awkwardness, the slight embarrassment and the excitement patiently, letting his characters evolve with time. There is a masterful scene in which Jesse and Celine get inside a listening booth wherein one looks at the other and looks away when the other tries to catch his gaze. As the time passes, the characters become more and more open with one another and the conversations turn personal. In a fantastic scene in a restaurant, the two characters feign telephonic conversations with their friends, talking about their encounter and, at the same time, being honest about their attraction to each other.Apart from the performances, the writing is impeccable. The colloquial conversations are enchanting in many ways, because they are ones which we have had with someone at some point in our lives. They are biting, honest and witty, and yet, they don't lead anywhere. It's just two people talking about their point of view on things like religion, love and life but there won't be a minute where you'll get bored of it.Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are both stellar in their respective roles. Cinematographer Lee Daniel beautifully captures the narrow alleys of Vienna and makes the city look like an inconspicuous character itself. Linklater, one of the major talents of the 90s, directs with peerless virtuosity, not letting the conversations drag on for too long and successfully have his protagonists emote the right emotions at the right time, a skill which is hard to perfect and here we have someone who has managed it wonderfully in his third directorial feature.'Before Sunrise' is a different kind of romance, one which stays with you for a long time after it ends. It's a film to be watched because it very nearly manages to put into words some things which are otherwise impossible to do so.",8,0,0,20 April 2013
Moonrise Kingdom," Wes Anderson's best film yet.
","In his seventh full-length feature film, Wes Anderson proves that it's time he should be taken seriously. And why not? With films like 'Rushmore','The Royal Tenenbaums' and 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' to his credit, and now 'Moonrise Kingdom', Anderson is very much responsible for giving us some of the best times we've had at the cinema in years. And now, the delightful 'Moonrise Kingdom' is the latest addition to his impressive list of works.Set on a fictional New England island called New Penzance, the film follows the story of a pair of 12-year old lovers : Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman), an orphan and a member of the Khaki Scout Camp and Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward), the quiet, troubled daughter of two lawyers Mr. and Mrs. Bishop (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand). Both first meet at a church concert in 1964 and remain pen-pals for a year before running away together. In their letters, they meticulously plan their escape and share ideas about where they can go. Their eventual escape sends everyone in a frenzy because no one seems to know what to make of it. When Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis) and Scout Master Randy Ward (Edward Norton) form a local search party to look for the two, they get caught and the events that transpired changes the lives of all the people who were involved in some way or the other.'Moonrise Kingdom' benefits from impeccable scripting and those wonderfully structured sentences which feel like music to the ears. The humor is quick and frequent and the conversations between the characters sound authentic. The screenplay, written by Anderson and Roman Coppola, is a marvel and is bound to fetch them an Oscar nomination. Anderson makes wonderful use of pop music, often using it to stress upon a poignant or cheerful moment in the film. The storytelling style is exemplary. Anderson uses the techniques of flashbacks, split-screen and breaking the fourth wall to introduce the viewers to the exotic locales of the town and to give each of the characters a separate identity.This is also one of those few films that contains miraculous performances from the entire cast, even those who have very small roles in the film. The standout though is Bruce Willis, who gives one of the best performances of his career. Shedding his action star image, Willis plays a lonely, concerned police captain with aplomb, stealing every scene he's in. The two lead actors, Gilman and Hayward, are sublime, each turning in a convincing performance. Cinematographer Robert Yeoman effectively captures the 60s atmosphere, thus adding the finishing touch to this sublime film.The long, quirky climax is a bit of a letdown, partly because the idea it uses is too mature for the two protagonists and partly because it makes use of an age-old cliché which is found in many romantic dramas. 'Moonrise Kingdom' has the poignant undertone found in most of Wes Anderson's films but with it comes the irresistible deadpan humor and depth. Anderson directs it with quiet confidence and maturity. It may not be a great film but it's one with a real knack for storytelling. Give it a shot.",9,1,2,27 December 2012
50_50," Poignant yet funny.
","It's really hard to believe that '50/50' is a comedy about a guy with cancer. Not many find this topic particularly funny, but director Jonathan Levine has got it all figured out - he's made a film that is genuinely moving and surprisingly zany. He hasn't employed anything special to make it so affecting, but the script here by Will Reiser, who had been diagnosed with a malignant spine tumor some years ago, is wondrously perfect. Reiser has based the story on his battle and subsequent victory over cancer, which means that we can expect an accurate insight into its potency but first he makes you laugh till your sides hurt before, delicately and discreetly, placing it in a territory wherein you can see the darker, austere side of it. Adam Lerner (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a young public radio journalist who lives with his girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard). One day, he decides to see an oncologist concerning a serious back pain he has been experiencing for the past few days. The oncologist tells him that he has a rare form of spine cancer and that the tumor has been growing steadily over the past few days. Reluctant to embrace the fact at first, Adam learns that he needs to somehow prepare himself for the worst, considering that his chances of survival are strictly divided. He turns to his best friend and co-worker Kyle (Seth Rogen) for help to deal with it. He also lets on the news to his overbearing mother Diane (Anjelica Huston), who wants to move in with him and take care of him along with his father Richard (Serge Houde), who is suffering from Alzheimer's. Though Adam downplays the seriousness of his cancer, he finds himself getting increasingly obsessed about learning more about it. He decides to undergo chemotherapy, where he meets two older cancer patients Alan (Philip Baker Hall) and Mitch (Matt Frewer), who advise him not to stress himself much about it. He also decides to see a recommended though inexperienced therapist Katherine (Anna Kendrick). As the cancer worsens, Adam finds his relationships slowly deteriorating. His ensuing struggle with the disease helps him to discover more about himself and about the people around him.Of the many films that have recently come out and that have discussed cancer as a subject, there hasn't been a single film as acerbically honest as '50/50'. And that is why this film, with the stark neatness of its script and the superlative performances, gets most of what it wants to say hit the bullseye. The writing is delightfully funny in parts, an example of which is the scene where Adam takes his first chemotherapy session. Hall's rendition of Alan, an old cancer patient, cheerfully tells Adam that his cancer is in its fifth stage, and then mocks him when he learns the absurd name of Adam's cancer. There are moments like these scattered all over the film where you can't help but feel for them but Hall and Frewer, who are both absolutely terrific in their roles, infect you with the candor they bring to their characters. I was thankful that the hint of romance between Adam and Katherine was not left half-baked after the film settles into a serious drama mode in its second half. Levine handles it with infallible matureness, making sure that the prime story is not taken over by it. Reiser's script is deliciously candid, giving us a peek into the brusque life of a cancer patient and invariably portraying it with unflinching realism. In one supremely well-written scene, Adam chides Katherine because of her optimistic approach, saying he'll feel a lot better if someone was actually honest into telling him how serious his condition is. I was surprised how frank the moment was, because we've been so used to dying people being really strong in the face of death in the movies that, for a moment, we had forgotten that courage may fail some in the same situation. And the film so clearly tells us that that is no big deal.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is spectacular in the role of Adam, nailing both the sides to his character with astonishing ease. It's easy to sympathize with his character. Rogen's interpretation of Kyle is a triumph, bringing the much needed laughs and energy to the plot. Kendrick is immensely likable as Katherine and Huston is wonderful in a role that could've been a blunder had it not been played the way it has.There is nothing really wrong with '50/50'. It's a resolved appraisal of cancer and not at all a sombre one, if that's what you're thinking. But, like all films on this subject, it makes its share of compelling arguments. It's intelligent and searingly honest in its approach, and eventually makes its point heard loud and clear. You won't walk out of it unaffected.",8,1,2,5 June 2013
The Hangover Part III," Unbelievably bovine.
","I don't profess to be much of a sucker for the films that really value your popcorn but 'The Hangover Part 3' is a tiresome experiment of an age-old concept. A concept that had come and should've gone with 'The Hangover' a few years ago but unfortunately did not. The first installment was admirably zingy and surprisingly original, and worked solely because it fleshed out its characters so wonderfully well. The second one was basically ripped-off from the first one, but the repetitive and derelict gags and the familiar situations ended up getting the better of your patience. A greatly optimistic person would've believed that a third part would actually make sense when the second one clearly missed the mark by miles, and that's why, I presume, they've made a third one. After the death of his father, Alan (Zach Galifianakis), a troubled loner, decides to take up therapy on the insistence of his family. Driving him to the rehab facility are his three friends Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Doug (Justin Bartha), but get ambushed mid- way by a group of gangsters headed by Marshall (John Goodman). Marshall tells them that their friend Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong), who had escaped from the Bangkok prison he was in, conned him out of 21 million dollars worth of gold bars and now wants it back. Though they protest about not knowing Chow's location, they're told to get the loot in three days time and take away Doug as bait. The rest of the plot focuses on their attempts to reach and outsmart Chow of the loot and the things that eventually happen when everything predictably goes wrong.'The Hangover Part 3' is nowhere as hilarious as the first installment, and the few weak gags that are thrown to us doesn't even classify it as a comedy. What it really is, is some kind of a farrago that doesn't know what it wants to be and ultimately settles for an unpropitious crime-comedy so lame-o that it's hard to guess which quip merits a laugh. One of the most vacuous instances in the film is Alan taking a smiling picture of himself at his father's funeral. If that was supposed to be a joke, it was either very mildly funny or completely doltish. There are a few more instances like these when we feel that the film begs us to laugh, or to be amused in any way, but the gags are often so feeble that we can only manage a weak chuckle. Somehow, 'The Hangover Part 3' doesn't feel like an installment that deserves to be placed as a sequel to the wonderful first one, partly because it tries to tell a story convincingly, and a story that had the wheels to go the distance and redeem the makers of the shoddy second, but it's lost somewhere when it desperately pretends to be a comedy. Perhaps the most amusing thing about the film is how director Todd Phillips pulled out a small link from the first film and squashed and jabbed it to produce some kind of a dim-wit story that served as its plot. The lack of attention to the little details cannot be overlooked entirely, which were clearly perceptible because the makers want you to focus more on the plot, which in turn makes it hard to invest into the story and the characters. On the flip side, though the film is too stodgy to be a good crime story and too unfunny to be a comedy, it is seldom boring, thanks to the little twists that the plot keeps throwing up every ten minutes or so. My favorite moment in the film was when Alan placed his sunglasses on the eyes of the character of the boy, who was the lost baby in the first part, now grown-up. The moment was, in some way, wickedly moving and the makers deserve some credit for weaving the character into the plot for a small sequence. Of the performances, Galifianakis, who plays Alan, is as likable as ever and though the plot revolves around his character more, he effortlessly carries the film throughout its runtime. Jeong plays the sassy Chow with his usual flair, and provides the much needed energy to the sinking film. Cooper sleepwalks through his role, a role that must've been absurdly easy and undeserving for an actor of his stature. Helms, on the other hand, is largely unconvincing as Stu, the twitchy dentist who shone in the first installment, but is a mere distraction in this one. He serves absolutely no purpose to the plot and the Stu he plays is so radically different from the one we knew for so long. And, as always, it's enormous fun to see the terrific John Goodman play the bad guy.'The Hangover 3' is easily the worst installment of the three, and a film that should've absolved the makers of making the scummy sequel to the fine first. If you are a fan of the first two installments, then you might be allured by the third. For me, it was nothing more than a wearisome end to a franchise that could've been so much more.",3,2,5,7 June 2013
The Social Network," Fincher's best work yet.
","I was skeptical about 'The Social Network' when I first heard about it. I didn't know what to expect from a film that's about the birth of a social networking site because I couldn't see why that was such an interesting subject. But when the plaque reads Aaron Sorkin as the screenwriter and David Fincher as the director, we can only expect a cinematic experience that will have us talking about it for years. 'The Social Network' is a turbulent piece of cinema so near-perfect that it's overwhelming. In the film's 120 minutes runtime, Fincher and Sorkin scrutinize the facts and lore that went into making the new century's greatest phenomenon and the analysis is narrated with such skill that it hardly seems relevant if they got the facts right.In the opening sequence, Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) drives his peevish girlfriend Erica Albright (Rooney Mara) crazy by his self-obsessed talk about his future plans and SATs score. When he ends up ridiculing her qualifications, she dumps him. An incensed and inebriated Zuckerberg returns to his dorm room and creates a website, Facemash, wherein he rates female students based on their attractiveness. The website soon goes viral and crashes the same night, but not before giving Zuckerberg the idea of Facebook. The popularity and ensuing outrage over Facemash gets him the attention of the twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss (Armie Hammer) and Divya Narendra (Max Minghella). Soon after, they hire him to create a dating website for them, but instead he goes to his wealthy best friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) with the idea of Facebook. Saverin agrees to get the funds to build the website, and they release it live on the Harvard University campus in 2003. Though the Winklevoss twins express their anger over Zuckerberg 'stealing their idea', he gets Napster co-founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) on board to get the website advertised and get in touch with investors. The rest of the story focuses on the subsequent lawsuits filed against Facebook and their outcome.Fincher has always been dexterous at handling stories about the psyche of a recluse or an introvert. Therefore, it's no surprise that the way he handles the primary character, who is both, is with such finesse. The interpretation of Zuckerberg is fascinating to watch - sly and deceitful, though, at times, altruistic. He directs brilliantly, tuning the finer nuances to perfection while keeping an eye out for the little details. Though a compelling drama about greed and loyalty, it plays out like a fire-breathing thriller with its ferocious intensity and whirlwind narrative. One of the finest sequences in the film has no dialog, and it's a boat race, marvelously executed and drifting dreamily on the magical, haunting soundtrack by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. Jeff Cronenweth's striking camera-work effectively captures the urgency even in slow-mo, and Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall's remarkable editing keeps it crisp. That's the case with the rest of the film too, for it is built with sequences shot adeptly while keeping the zing factor at surface.Though 'The Social Network' has a lot to like, the writing of the film stands out as its best characteristic. The characters carry out supremely witty conversations, and a quip acts as the best weapon in a film in which the plot is constructed entirely out of ego conflicts. The dialog is intelligent and darkly funny, and Sorkin, who excels in that department, has served up his finest work. 'The Social Network' will certainly be remembered for its consummate script years later, if not for anything else.The cast, peopled by a bunch of young actors, is terrific. Eisenberg, who usually plays wimpish characters, is a revelation. He brings a quiet confidence and maturity to the character of Zuckerberg, ratting off the best quips in the film with such flair that it's impossible to imagine anyone playing the character any better. Garfield, who lost out on a deserving Oscar nomination, is excellent. He performs exceedingly well in his scenes with Eisenberg, and it's easy to sympathize with his character. Timberlake, in a supporting role decision that could've transmuted as a fatal mistake, is a major discovery. His acting chops have never shone so overtly, and he's charmingly odious as the film's only antagonist.'The Social Network' is the best film I've seen in ages, a film which examines and questions its characters and their actions rather than the story behind them. The brisk and perceptive peek into the website that affected a generation is a film that merits high praise, and it certainly ranks as a masterwork of a filmmaker who seems to know how to use this medium better than most others.",10,0,1,5 July 2013
