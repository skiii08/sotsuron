Casablanca," It really is THAT perfect
","We are often accused of being nostalgic, of irrationally defending the works and achievements of the past in detriment of keeping up with the times, accepting the changes as a natural part of life, a sign of evolution and growth. Take « Casablanca », for instance. The story is constantly placed at the top positions in specialized lists that name the best movies ever made. Michael Curtiz never managed to become one of the greatest directors of all times. Visually, « Casablanca » is not at all very different from many of the other movies made during its era. Can it really be so? Can it really be that in more than seventy years of movie-making ever since, few pictures can come close to claiming this spot?Set in the title city, « Casablanca » centers itself on the story of Rick Blaine (a majestic and sombre Humphrey Bogart), a seemingly cold and cynic north-American bar owner living in the midst of World War II and who wants to state, above all, his political independence. Different nationalities find in the bar owned by Rick a meeting place to relax, listen to some music, or design escape plans to other destinations. Being able to leave Casablanca seems, to some, just a wish, and Rick's bar is the place where they can allow themselves to dream, or see their wishes of freedom crumble due to the prolongation of the wait.Enter Ilsa Lund (the always perfect Ingrid Bergman) and her husband, the activist Victor Lazslo (played here by Paul Henreid). The reencounter between Ilsa and Rick brings back memories of a romance that has passed, a story that came to pieces on the same day the city of Paris fell to the Germans during the War. Romance and politics appear heavily interlinked, and start to expose that certain things may be beyond our control, that personal sacrifices may be called for when one faces the War.« As Time Goes By » played by the pianist Sam (Dooley Wilson), the great friend of Ilsa and Rick, becomes a character in itself, larger than life, and reminds all of the characters that certain feelings do not change with time. The expressions in their faces reveals all of the feelings that they so strongly tried to suppress.Rick, however, is the only alternative for Ilsa and Victor to reach safety. He will have to struggle between keeping his widely defended neutrality, recovering an old love or turn Lazslo in. The story delivers in every single aspect: it brings together politics, romance, betrayal, action, friendship and melancholia while exploring the historical context and presenting a magnificent story that certainly resisted the test of time. The script and dialogues are on point here - emotionally heartbreaking and exciting. While certain movies can indeed be considered technically superior to « Casablanca », few have managed to conquer, snatch up and connect with the viewer as well as this one. Built with a fantastic cinematography work based on chiaroscuro and sublime close- ups, mythical scenarios and superb use of mise-en-scène, it adds something to every new viewing. The city of Paris becomes a place to represent dreams and heartbreaks and Casablanca a place where we may never want to leave.",10,1,2,23 February 2016
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," It does too much but says too little
","Modern cinema is commonly accused of favoring profit over art, of no longer providing the same space for artists to allow exploration and new techniques. It is certainly a false presumption considering difficulties, obstacles, pre-prepared formulas and studio demands always existed to a certain extent in the movie industry. « Birdman » and Iñarritú come to challenge this assumption and show that artistry and experimentation have not lost their place in this world. This is why it is so unfortunate that the movie spends most of its time talking about itself and its alleged qualities, preventing the viewer from engaging in the story. It is almost as if you are listening to someone perform while they keep shouting what a fantastic artist they are.The plot centers on the story of Riggan Thomson (a big comeback part for Michael Keaton, long trapped by his role in « Batman »), a Hollywood actor whose fame and glory is experiencing a downfall. Tormented by his voices and visions of his big « Birdman » superhero role of the past, he plans to reinvent his career and show, on Broadway, that he can still work as a writer, actor and director. Some friends and family members work with Riggan and contribute, in major or minor parts, to the further development of his hallucinations. The movie counts with actors like Emma Stone, Edward Norton and Naomi Watts in good performances but repetitive roles.The movie shows Riggs in a self-absorbed manner. His torments are often displayed in the form of satire. Everything around him, unfortunately, seems very stereotypical and calculated: from the Broadway critic to the addict child depicted in the movie, the lesbian making out session backstage, persons and elements seem heavily thought of but not deeply felt, it is hard to connect to anything or anyone in the story. Technically, it displays a superb exercise of camera work: it often feels like it is done in a single shot. The narrow corridors, tight rooms and backstage scenes can represent both the narrow mind and confusion experienced by Riggs, but also how it pushes the viewer to feel, and unfortunately what he/she cannot escape from. The constant self-boosting of worth, bragging and confidence of the movie, added to the never-ending drumming of the music score, feels exaggerated, fluttery and unrelenting from beginning to end.Perhaps it would be safe to say that what « Birdman » lacks is some soul, a heartfelt connection to any sort of plea, self-analysis, redemption. As it constantly revolves around itself and tells the viewer what to do or make of it, it makes it difficult for persons to go beyond what it shows. It seems very convinced of its superiority, the main problem being that it certainly says more than what it does.",5,4,7,23 February 2016
