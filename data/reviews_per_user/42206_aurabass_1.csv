Deja Vu," Tony Scott cannot produce film fast enough to suit me
","Ownership of some 700 plus DVD's and a couple of thousand Beta, VHS, & Laser Disks I play movies most of the day and night. Tony Scott is in a class almost by himself. His art is always captivating with constant repetition. True Romance is my all time favorite Enemy of the State Spy Games Man on Fire Domino Deja Vu Mr. Scott's ability and artfulness increase with timeIt's like great music that never grows old or stale. The images, the dialog, the cinematography, the soundtrack all come together to stimulate the senses. Deja Vu ranks right up there with these works of art. It gets better and better as it grows on you like great music. Like the plot of Deja Vu - I can replay this over and over finding something new on each viewing with concentration OR I can simply keep it running as background while I write this or do other things. It's great art on the screen and great sound in the room. Deja Vu is complex and strange and a bit difficult to follow. After seeing it in the theater I wanted to stay and watch again. It's actually preferable to watch and re-watch on DVD. If you appreciate the style and pace of Man on Fire, Spy Games, Domino, Enemy of the State and True Romance you will appreciate Deja Vu. The acting is terrific - the characters are engaging and sympathetic. The tension and action are superb. The storyline is thought provoking and intensely interesting. Frequency, Groundhog Day, Peggy Sue, Time Machine, 12 Monkeys, Minority Report: If the subject matter of changing the past engages you then this particular version may astound you. Read REPLAY and hope someone makes the movie. This movie will be on my replay list in my 400 disk DVD player along with the other Scott Free titles listed here. The only 'holes' in this film are in the limited mindset of the reviewers here. Enjoyment of this film may require a liberal open mind and the willing expectation of wonder. Not for consumption by the constipated.",10,2,5,26 April 2007
