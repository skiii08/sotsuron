Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Declining SAT scores
","This isn't the worst movie I have ever seen, but there really isn't any substance. It's not clever or original and I maybe got two to three laughs for my hour and a half. It's basically Yakov Smirnoff meets stuttering John, meets Jackass, who cares? If making a hit movie means going around and doing stupid things with a camera, I might as well make one myself. Why does everyone keep saying this is the funniest movie ever? Have none of us graduated high school? Even if I were in high school I still might think this is stupid. You know you might get a few laughs doing crazy things at the expense of others, but when you're 35 you're just being asshole, we're adults here right? Also the fat naked guy 69, is not funny in my book, it's just gross and nothing more and then they go and disrupt a banquet, yeah funny, just being an asshole again. Oh and everyone keeps saying that it's an anti-Semitic movie, and that is not the case at all, it's quite the opposite, it's an anti-gentile movie. The people in the movie that are anti-Semitic which he chose to show us, are the ones he makes fun of, including his character Borat who comes from a Muslim nation. He also makes fun of the southern Christian right, which is an easy target, but you have to remember that Sasha Cohen himself is a Jew and he has his own agenda. The Jewish home he goes to had to be someone he knew, cause their ain't no way they are letting two guys in an ice cream truck stay at their place. I used to have a Jewish girl-friend and she wouldn't even let me pick her up from her home because I was a goy, so ain't no way he didn't know that old couple, so the only people in the movie who weren't getting hoaxed were Jewish. Oh and Pamela Anderson, I don't really give a rat's ass about her, but that was mean. She didn't know who he was and to chase her around in the parking lot like that must have scared her horribly. I don't think anyone really deserves that, but some of you might like it, so enjoy the 15-year old humor.",2,6,12,28 November 2006
