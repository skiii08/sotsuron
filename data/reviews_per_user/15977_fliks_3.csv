The Blair Witch Project," ABSOLUTE RUBBISH My 10 year old could've done better
",Whats with the general public these days is everyone gullible? Sure these kids got together with a good concept and slapped together some stuff (and I mean that literally) but how can anybody possibly have believed the absolute Trash Documentary that came about to supposedly reinforce the authenticity of this C grade amcam movie. The movie was a history maker in a sense that it was made cheaply (haha no kidding!) and it grossed BIG. No thanks to the makers I'm afraid.......More like the giant movie distributers Mega idea of fooling the public and telling outright Lies to get them into the theatres. Young people these days take everything on face value and believe most things that people tell them......except what their parents tell them :-) I left the cinema thinking that I'd watched 20 re runs of NYPD Blue the famous 'Wobble Cam' TV drama. Totally unbelievable totally amateurish. I'll give it a 2 outta 10 for making so much money from suckers.,Null,2,3,21 March 2000
American Beauty," Aha....A true dysfunctional American family?
","Could it be that this is based the 'Normal' American family? No I'm not that stupid but it does have as many Vice elements in it as you can conjure up in ones mind! Well done to the writers and Actors is all I can say. I found the movie funny but for some reason I left the cinema with a feeling of gloom over my head. I went to this movie with no idea of what it was about......I never watch movie reviews or take any notice of hype, preferring to make my own decisions and not those of the advertisers or spin doctors. To sum up.....Well worth a look.",Null,0,0,21 March 2000
Mission: Impossible II," Full of action BUT a disappointment
",I was very impressed with the first 15 minutes. Good build up Nice cinematography using gyro stabilized equipment....But as the movie progressed I found myself making more and more correct predictions right through the movie. Oooohhh sooo predictable so cliche so stereo type spy movie YUK......Damsel in distress lots of action. Not necessarily believable!! I really think the 'action' was a bit over the top not in flavour with the original movie that had more believable stunts. The gadget factor was quite lacking as well! A little bit too much shoot em up it was starting to bring back memories of B grade movies where against ALL odds the good guy manages to get a lucky shot in and clean up the bad guys even if its 10 onto 1!! I was quite intrigued by the way a heavy 4 wheel drive can keep up with a spritely 2 stroke motorbike :) Another interesting bit was the motorbike Duel near the end..PLEASE spare me the dukes of Hazzard stuff! I expect more as a purveyor of good action movies. A bit too much use of slo mo I fell as well. However the incidental music was superb & well matched to the scenes. But thats about it.......Basically a disappointment :-(,Null,0,0,27 June 2000
