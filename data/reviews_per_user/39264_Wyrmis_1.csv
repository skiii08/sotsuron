The Ring," Beats out most recent Horror Movies
","There are movies scarier than this one. Some of the scenes kind of fall out of place. But, overall, this was a very enjoyable bit to watch. Moody and well-photographed, this is as much mystery as horror. I watched it in a cinema full of jerk highschoolers that would not shut up and I STILL came away thinking about the movie. The mix of music with strange imagery tied on top of the urgency of it all will cause you to be a little antsy throughout. One review called it panicked (and complained about the feeling) but I think this is something they are shooting for. For me, it was ultimately the image of the 'ring' itself and the music that got me...that is the part that I am thinking the most about, afterwards.",9,0,0,18 October 2002
