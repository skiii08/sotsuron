Black Swan," 'A Scanner Darkly' meets 'Pi'
","Darren Aranofsky is a rare vintage, this one gets better with age. And starting out with a movie like 'Pi' he sets the bar high. With each of his films he looks into the life (or lives) of people whose sanity and lives are on the edge. The general theme here does not change but what we get is a beautifully shot fine piece of art-house film. I wont bother spoiling any of the story or the plot twists but needless to say that this movie puts pedal down in the beginning and does not let up until the last shot. I can see why people won't like it, but if you enjoyed any of the previous movies of Aranofsky you will enjoy this. One of my favorite aspects of the movie was the dancing, I am no ballet fan but it was beautifully laid in and kudos to Portman for obviously having to painstakingly learn some very technical dance moves (she may have a ballet background I am not sure about that). The theme of duality is also incredibly fleshed out as it was in another of my favorites 'A Scanner Darkly'. The struggle that Portman faces from the identities of the black and white swan is ever present and slowly drives her insane just like a certain math genius is driven mad by a number in 'Pi'. All in all a great watch and a great piece of art-house by the current king of the genre.",9,2,6,22 December 2010
