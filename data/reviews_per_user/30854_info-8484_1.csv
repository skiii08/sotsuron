Mission: Impossible III," If you have a heart condition, stay home
","I have just seen Mission Impossible III, and I can't find the words for it. I just can't. Within the first 5 minutes of the movie, I was tearing the armrests apart, my eyes were fixed on the screen like my life depended on it, and my heart was pounding. Hard.You couldn't have gotten more attention from me, had you stuck a gun in my face. It was real, it really was ! I don't want to ruin the movie for you guys, so I will just say, after I left the theater, I walked home with a HUGE grin on my face. And when I got there, my heart wasn't even back to normal and my shirt was drenched in sweat like it hasn't been sinceÂ…hell, I don't know when.I don't care who says what. This is the best movie I have ever seen.Bar none.",10,11,24,3 May 2006
