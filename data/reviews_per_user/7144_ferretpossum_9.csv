Iron Man 3," A Perfectly Serviceable Second Sequel
","I had to write, there are so many terrible reviews of this film - but most seem to be written by Marvel fans devoted to the character 'The Mandarin'.If you know who this character is going in, you may well be disappointed. I didn't. So I wasn't.Instead, what I got what a film that sees Tony Stark laid low and spending most of the film out of his iron suit and trying to rebuild from a tool shed with the help of a young boy. It's Tony Stark's 'Rocky 3' if you like and for that reason, I enjoyed it.There are some plot holes but they are relatively minor ones. They could easily have been explained by a couple of clunky lines of exposition which the screenwriters wisely decided not to bother with - you can fill in the blanks yourself if you like. I think the real reason for the virulent backlash to this film are the fact that it doesn't fit with the characters as previously defined in the comics.But if you don't give a hoot about 'canon' and 'mythos' and the 'Marvel Universe' and all that, then you'll be fine.",7,0,1,28 December 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Star Trek: The Search for An Overly Complicated Conspiracy
","Look, it wasn't bad. I enjoyed the first 10 minutes immensely. But hmmmm the plot. Conspiracy theorists may love it. Me, I just wondered why it was necessary to construct such a complex way to kill someone. I hope you appreciate I'm trying really hard not to be Spoiler McSpoilerson here. But honestly. If you've captured a whole bunch of people and you want them dead, there have to be easier, less-prone-to- being-noticed-and-foiled ways.Also, I missed the familial characterisation, the fondness between Kirk, Spock, Bones et al that distinguished 'old' Trek. And I think Abrams successfully recreated it in Star Trek 2009 - but somehow doesn't manage it here. Oh sure, the film starts with us being told that Kirk and Spock are best mates and this is repeated (often). But I didn't believe it. How & when did THAT happen? And there's just not that same gently- ribbing humour between the two.Finally. Simon Pegg. Ruined Mission Impossible for me and is coming close to ruining Star Trek too. I realise a lot of people love him, but I'm getting tired of his groovy nerd thing. Spaced was on TV over 10 years ago and he's still doing the same bit. Plus, I live in Scotland and can tell you that his accent sucks.So Star Trek Reboot 2. I sort of enjoyed it for the big dumb blockbuster it was, but it was a big dumb blockbuster and nothing more, which is a pity as it was all cued up to be so much more.",5,0,2,8 September 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," 'Convoluted' is not the same as 'clever'
","So if I've got this straight, we're after Jack Sparrow's compass so that it can lead us to Davy Jones' chest and/or key to said chest, so we can negotiate with Davy Jones and/or kill him but only after Jack Sparrow supplies one of the 9 pieces of 8 in order to hold a council which will determine whether to free Calypso, but only after electing a Pirate King or Queen which requires a deal which may or may not be a double-cross with the head of the East India Company and/or Sao Feng and/or Davy Jones. Please bear in mind that, to avoid spoilers, there is actually more to it than that.There are probably two good, fun 90 minute films in the two PotC sequels. Sadly, the writers decide to swamp the film with such an excess of pointless plot meandering that the two films come in at about five hours instead. Seriously. Every time you think we are getting somewhere, some idiot chimes in with 'But FIRST we have to go to the place to get the thing...' Incidentally, feel free to wander in and out while all the above is going on, they explain it in great detail so you'll easily keep up.Keira & Orlando are a lot more annoying in the sequels grumpily storming about like someone has stolen their milk & cookies. Fortunately we still have Johnny Depp, charming and funny as ever and also another actor who I cannot mention due to spoilers, and the two of them just about make the films watchable.I really wanted to like these films, but we need the Kevin Smith edit, I think.",4,1,1,24 August 2014
The Shining," A touching story of one man's love for a steady-cam
","As a lesson in graceful film-making, it's a must. As an effective horror movie, it's a disaster. Stanley Kubrick shows his technical flair with the newly available steady-cam, but you have to keep asking, 'How is this making the film scary?' For a much better example of how to create suspense, see 'Halloween' made with a fraction of the budget and ten times the imagination. John Carpenter's camera stalks the characters like an extra character in the film. Kubrick's camera floats. It's pretty. But it's not scary.Jack Nicholson gives a bravura performance, unfortunately it belongs in a different film. He's supposed to be a man having a breakdown, but he looks deranged from frame 1. Perhaps he thought he was still in Cuckoo's Nest.The film has moments of course, you'd expect nothing less from a director of this calibre, but they are few and far between in a ridiculously self-important and overlong film.",4,1,6,22 February 2005
The Mist," Faithful King adaptation.... unfortunately.
","In my teens I read the novella on which this film is based. It was a miserable experience which only young-reader-stamina got me through. It featured many familiar King motifs, but unlike his better novels proceeded to whomp the reader over the head with them for a good 200-300 pages.The Mist the movie does exactly the same. A very VERY simple idea of a supermarket under siege by something unspeakable is dragged out over two interminable hours. Unpleasant characters squabble and bicker, no black humour is present and while there are undoubtedly parallels in modern America (the sheer glee with which your religious right hopes for apocalypse) the point is made and made and re-made to the point of redundancy.To make matters worse, none of this is in the remotest frightening. There is no sense of dread in the mist, no suspense and quite honestly no point.Add to this an unnecessarily grim ending, and you've got two unpleasant hours of your life passed. Yawn.",1,7,25,20 May 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Finally... the prequel we've been waiting for
","There's no need for detail on this one... I'm sure other reviewers will provide that. Suffice to say, if you liked the original trilogy but thought Episodes 1 and 2 were self-important and awful, you're not alone. I swore I'd never see another Star Wars film after the truly abysmal Attack of the Clones. Then I got a free ticket for Episode 3.Episode 3 still suffers from wooden acting, a pompous script and a plot that doesn't always make sense, but it does have the good sense to focus on spectacular set-piece battles and jaw-dropping special effects. There's a lot less talk and a lot more action this time around.So finally a film that stands up to the original trilogy. Revenge of the Sith is without doubt the most action-packed film of the six and the best since The Empire Strikes Back, if only for the astounding light-sabre battle between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader at the climax of the picture.It's not quite Return of the King, but it's not far off.",8,5,12,14 May 2005
The Conjuring," Delivers The Goods
","Is it THAT scary? Well uh, no.Is it scary? Well actually, yes.The Conjuring is what it claims to be. A fun ghost-ride. It ticks all the haunted-house horror-show stories with a brief nod at exorcism films.Good acting, exceptional horror direction and a real attempt to connect the audience to the characters (good script and decent actors for a change) make this well above the norm for the horror genre.So is it anything groundbreaking? Definitely not. Is it a fun night out that delivers actual scares? Oh my yes. Probably the scariest part is the prologue about Annabel but that's OK. The film still managed to sustain an atmosphere of unease throughout and I was quite happy. Plus, a scary prologue goes a LONG way in a horror movie, as anyone who saw the original 'Halloween' where the first 5 minutes are by far the scariest can tell you.I think the word I am looking for here is 'competent' but that's not often a given in the horror world.p.s. As for the 'based on a true story' stuff. Uh-huh. Sure. Whatever you say.",7,0,2,20 August 2013
300," Wagnerian, Juvenile, Claptrap
","While stunning to look at, and a technical marvel, 300 is a hateful film that leaves a sour taste in the mouth.Like other Hollywood attempts to romanticise history, the film makes no attempt at all to understand the Persians - or even to give them any credit for humanity or culture. No, we take the tired old Euro-centric route that the Greeks invented civilisation, while baby-eating barbarians hammered at the gate.Worse, the Persians here aren't just barbarians - they are actual, no I'm-not-kidding MONSTERS. Ugly, disfigured creatures with sharp teeth, multiple piercings - oh, and they are sexually androgynous and sadistic too. Though that may be more to satiate our 'civilised' boy audience.Art? Culture? No, the Persians were obviously too busy murdering each other in nasty ways, or having kinky sex for that.Balance? Pah. This comic-book history robs the Greeks of their true victory, and provides fuel for small minded haters of cultures other than our own.Frank Miller is a genius? Maybe as an artist. Personally I found his message in this film puerile and simple-minded.",3,7,17,29 March 2007
Sin City," Relentless
","Sin City is incredible to look at. It's the boldest cinematic statement since early Coen Brothers. It's stark, compelling and the closest, most pure example of a graphic novel ever brought to life.That considerable achievement aside, I hated it.It's the story of a hard-as-nails hero, beaten and bloodied, who fights unspeakable evil in order to save the gorgeous girl, the flower growing in the gutter.Then it's the same story. Over and over again, until I felt as relentlessly battered by the film as poor old Marv.Yes, it's a little repetitive. Four stories are told - the story of tough cop Hartigan (Willis) bookends the stories of Marv (Mickey Rourke) and Dwight (Clive Owen). But essentially it's the same tale of twisted murderers, heroes who can take 20 bullets and still live and the most glamorous hookers you will ever see.I have to give the film credit for staying true to the source material, unfortunately that material is moronically juvenile as this, with laugh-out-loud risible dialogue, and lots of adolescent-friendly scenes of girls with guns.I just wish the same artistic vision could have been applied to a genuine noir classic novel. Sin City has all the cool of James M. Cain, but none of the soul. It's empty, it's shallow and a huge waste of talent.",3,5,10,3 June 2005
