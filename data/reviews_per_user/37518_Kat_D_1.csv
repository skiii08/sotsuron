Catch Me If You Can," A great movie! Funny and touching.
","Catch Me If You Can is a great movie! Tom Hanks and Leonardo diCaprio are hilarious. This is a must see movie. It's funny, though there are some serious parts. It's hard to believe this movie is based on a real person. Some parts might not be appropriate for little kids, but I highly recommend this movie.",9,0,0,27 December 2002
