The Blair Witch Project," I want the ending explained but don't want to ruin it for anyone
","A couple of the previous user comments indicate that they 'got' the ending and that the ending was perfectly done. Well, I have a couple of theories about the ending but I think I'm wrong. Actually they are pretty lame guesses at best. And maybe we're reading too much into it and there is really nothing to 'get'. Can someone explain the ending so that I might understand but not so much that it will ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet? No one that I know who has seen this understands the end.",Null,0,0,5 August 1999
The Mummy," Movie was too cute for me.
","I liked the look of the movie. The scenery and the costumes really made you feel as though you were in Egypt in the early 1900s. The movie, however, was 'too cute' for me. I was expecting to be scared. Just when the characters should have been afraid for their lives, they said something comical. For this reason I was disappointed and only gave this movie a 5 out of 10. I agree with another viewer, ANDYO's, comments.",5,0,0,9 May 1999
Mission: Impossible II," El Lame-o
","This  movie was weak. The motorcycle sequence was good but mostly everything else had me rolling my eyes. The chemistry between Tom Cruise and the girl was contrived. The heart warming music that we hear when we see her made me gag. Could anyone survive the length of the fist fight in this movie??? I don't think so.. I agree with the other comments, the trailers would have one believe this was an action packed, well put together package..well it wasn't.",4,0,0,28 May 2000
