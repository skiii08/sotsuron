Changeling," A film to inspire the next generations.
","What makes a movie a masterpiece? The answer has been woven into the film with great skill. The theme is striking and the film absorbs you, sometimes making it difficult for you to breathe, sometimes making you cry. The acting is great. Jolie's performance is fascinating. I think it is the best film of 2008. Clint Eastwood added a lot to this branch of art, as a talented actor and now a successful director. Changeling will be another unforgettable film. I am happy to watch such a magnificent film, and I recommend everyone should watch it to discover some values of humanity again.",Null,3,5,31 January 2009
La La Land," A spellbinding film!
","Rarely does it happen! You sit back in your seat, expecting to watch a good film; but the film engrosses you, taking you to the depth of an ocean where you are charmed by magical scenes in which love has been depicted. La La Land is a film I have longed to see for years. The theme, the plot and acting are all good enough to make it a masterpiece. It is a wonderful musical, and the songs are certain to last for ages. Love is framed realistically, avoiding simple fantasies. As handicaps threaten love, the viewers become a captive audience. I loved the film so much. I want to watch it again with my friends, and I will advise many not to miss this great film.",9,2,6,31 December 2016
