Hereditary," Starts off strong, and then heads a different direction
","Horror movies tend to have difficulty nabbing ratings of 7+ on IMDb, so I was intrigued after seeing this movie getting a 7.5.To start things off, the movie is two hours long. But I don't think it should've been. You spend a minute or two watching someone go from Point A to Point B when you could skip that and it wouldn't make a difference. I'm not cutting points off for that reason though.I think the acting was great and the effects were authentic. It didn't feel forced or fake; it felt natural. Everything seemed coherent. There were no jump scares in the movie.So, if I liked the movie, why did I only give a 6? The reason boils down to the plot changing directions later on in the movie. I wanted to give the movie a 7 for the ambiance and suspense, but it just felt like the plot wasn't strong enough for me to give it a 7. The movie is more of a 6.5, if I can give it that.How should I explain? Instead a 'specific' character being the expected cause of everything, the director decides to push on with an alternative ending that attempts to add in more explicit horror for no real reason. It was like the director knew exactly what he wanted, and then halfway through thought it wasn't scary enough and did something else.Overall, this movie is okay to watch, but I recommend fast forwarding through slow scenes so you don't waste time and can just get straight to the point.",6,0,1,28 August 2018
Oblivion," A solid 7 movie, nothing more
","My rating for Oblivion is a 7. A solid 7. Compared to Cruise's other movies, there wasn't as much action as I had expected. Once again, you have a sci-fi movie with an original premise (Minority Report was great), and great acting overall, and the CG and other effects were done brilliantly.However, the reason why I could've give this movie a solid 8 (which means that the movie was done perfectly, without any issues) was because it left me with the whole 'What was the point of the movie, anyway?' mindset afterwards. It didn't seem like there was much a point with the movie. Enough that when my mother asked me if I could watch it with my nephew, I replied, 'She probably wouldn't like it; It's nothing special.'.The plot isn't defined clearly until halfway into the movie (to allow for a progressive, slow start), but by the time you realize what's happening, it's already ending and there isn't much action to help intensify the severity of the issue at hand.Your interest is held by you hoping that the movie will get better as it moves along, but with the pace of the movie held constant, you end up just watching it and not really trying to consider which parts of the movie were done well.If you ask me whether this movie is worth the time, it is, but, only if you're a sci-fi fan and/or a Tom Cruise fan. Freeman isn't a major character, so don't bother looking for some spectacular performance from him.",7,0,1,21 July 2013
The Conjuring," I think some reviewers are over-exaggerating on the scariness of the movie
","This is a review coming from somebody who is not easily frightened. In an effort not to make a review that's overly long and drawn out (like all the others), I'll just keep my review simple.First off, the movie does have a solid storyline. A simple one really. A family moves into a house that's haunted, and supernatural hunters are employed to fix it. Nothing really much else happens beyond this premise.The movie as a whole (for those who have watched it and should take a minute or two to reflect upon the movie after reading this review), isn't really all that scary. That is to say; If you take out all the jump scares put into the movie, there's nothing else to keeping you on your feet and biting your fingernails.In some ways, if you think about it further, even the jump scares don't fit into the story. Heck, the story might have even been more eerie if the jump scares were replaced with the apparitions slowly coming into view. This would've made a more well-rounded setting as opposed to trying to make a movie half-scary and half-eerie. Horror movies can really either be one or the other, but not both.In summary, I would say to you that this movie is worth it to watch, but it's not really high priority. The story isn't really original, but the solid acting and nice execution makes for a good watch. My rating is a 7.5 out of 10. I couldn't give it an 8 because there wasn't anything else in the movie to scare you apart from jump scares.",7,7,15,4 August 2013
The Purge," Initial idea of the movie was great, but was barely used
","To begin, I am giving this movie a really nice 6.5 out of 10 just because the actors did a reasonably good job.I think other reviewers are being too critical on the movie. A lot of the reviews weighed the entire movie on the fact that the original premise was essentially neglected, but didn't realize and/or recognize that the acting itself wasn't bad at all and was quite average to say the least.The movie, in all honesty, was a solid movie. However, the media and ads shouldn't have heavily publicized the premise of the movie as being the one-day legalized purge system. This misled viewers and built up too much anticipation for an enticing premise that (although was used) was not to the viewer's expectations.The movie should've just showed more than just the family being hunted down. Too much emphasis was placed on the family trying to survive as opposed to trying to actively promote or go against the idea of purging.Neutrality was probably the main issue with the movie, since viewers would expect to see the premise being thoroughly portrayed by the protagonists, or the protagonists trying hard to combat that very evil.All in all, I don't think I wasted my time watching the movie. I'm quite open, and understand when some movies don't quite hit the mark. I don't think I would recommend this movie since it's hard to introduce it, but if somebody asked me what it was about, I would tell them about it.",6,0,0,1 October 2013
