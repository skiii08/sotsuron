The Mask," a comedic classic for its irreverent humor and surprisingly awesome visuals
","Despite a poorly constructed story, The Mask remains a comedic classic for its irreverent humor and surprisingly awesome visuals. Jim Carrey's perfect slapstick comedy cannot save a paper thin narrative and characterization. Cameron Diaz, in her first film appearance, stands alongside Carrey albeit being overshadowed, cementing herself as a sex symbol with a juicy performance. The motivations of the characters are not properly fleshed out for a satisfying conclusion. Having a weak antagonist also does not help.The Mask can't be called a waste because the comedy is stupidly great, especially the police dancing sequence and Looney Tunes references, making the film essentially a live-action derivative of the iconic cartoon characters. However, as a satisfying film with great characters and story it drops the ball.5/10",5,1,3,3 September 2019
Catch Me If You Can," highly entertaining crime thriller with fine artistic qualities
","Catch Me If You Can is a highly entertaining crime thriller with fine artistic qualities. Director Steven Spielberg gorgeously delivers a film set in the 60s following the exploits of Frank William Abagnale Jr. as a con man, effortlessly played by Leonardo DiCaprio.The film tackles themes of family, parenthood and loss. Frank Jr. starts with a happy family that quickly fractures when financial struggles and extra-marital affairs led to his parent's divorce played by Christopher Walken and Nathalie Baye as Frank Sr. and Paula Abagnale, respectively. Their divorce precipitated his descent to financial crimes. Hot on the trail is Carl Hanratty, played by Tom Hanks, an FBI bank fraud agent. Carried by a great cast and brisk editing, Catch Me If You Can never slows and the audience is completely immersed in the journey and thrill of Frank Jr.'s exploits. Every shot looks beautiful with the impressive cinematography from recurring Spielberg collaborator Janusz Kaminski. Composer Michael Khan provides a score that reflects the tone of the film.Ultimately, Catch Me If You Can fails to reach its true potential because the character growth of Frank Jr. has little weight. Through the course of the film, moments are sprinkled to reveal Frank Jr.'s motivations but this is not fully explored. The script comes short in realizing that Frank Jr.'s broken family is the reason for his actions. The emotional weight of the film gets lost in the chase aspect. However, the film remains a marvel to appreciate considering all its qualities.8/10",8,1,2,7 July 2019
It," It is a slow burn coming-of-age horror film that succeeds in presenting scare and drama, but lacks a distinctive flair
","Clowns are a staple in horror films, none more so as popular as Pennywise the Dancing Clown. Written by legendary horror novelist Stephen King, Pennywise was an instant cultural icon that continues to scare readers to this day. The second adoption of the novel, It is a slow burn coming-of-age horror film that succeeds in presenting scare and drama, but lacks a distinctive flair.Led by a terrific ensemble cast, It successfully establishes the characters and their fears in a realistic and emotional manner that adults and children alike can relate. As the protagonists go through their individual stories, It shows thereby manifesting their respective fears. Events unfold that unite the protagonists and allows them to overcome their fears as a group. Acting both as a coming-of-age and horror film, the themes unite to present a single message of overcoming fears through facing adversity head on. The execution and pacing however is off. A director's cut can surely remedy the film's mistakes by adding more scenes to elaborate and coherently present the formation of the group.Bill Skarsgard as It is terrifying, evoking a child-like performance that is nonetheless scary. Vastly different from Tim Curry's more adult-like interpretation, Skarsgard succeeds better because his has an element of approachability. The design of the character is of imperial British period, adding a layer of timelessness.Technical wise, the cinematography, score and production design are good enough that the script and acting performances can overcome.-7.5/10",8,0,0,28 July 2019
John Wick," 101 minutes of Keanu Reeves laying out henchmen after henchmen in a revenge thriller
","John Wick stacks the body count in a wickedly fun revenge thriller starring Keanu Reeves about a retired assassin drawn back to a previous life of murder and violence after a vicious break-in and theft led by a Russian mobster's son. Despite a thin script, 101 minutes of gratuitous violence ultimately pays off due to sheer spectacle, some stylish direction, and incredible action set pieces.Keanu Reeves has never been known as an actor with a wide range but instead limited to certain roles that show little emotion. As a character, John Wick is perfectly suited for Reeves. Characterized as an unassuming quiet, grieving widower, Wick is actually a no-nonsense former assassin in retirement after finding love. Coupled with director Chad Stahelski, a veteran stuntman and coordinator, and Reeves' history of playing badass male leads, this is the film to take Keanu Reeves back to previous career highs not seen since The Matrix trilogy and which would go on to launch a successful and critically well-received franchise. Reeves owns the role of Wick. The casting couldn't be more perfect.Primarily, John Wick is centered on loss and revenge. Wick is out for blood against the people who took away everything important in his life. As an exploration of the aforementioned themes, the film only goes skin-deep, failing to dig deeper into the character's persona and background. Majority of Wick's history is shown through flashbacks and subtle dialogue. While the script leaves a lot to be desired, the character interactions aren't preachy, grounding the film on an emotional and human level. More importantly, Wick does not really grow as a character. He's not placed in a situation that questions his motives allowing room for him to grow.The film takes its themes seriously, but perhaps intentionally, it's also a satire on the futility and value of masculinity. Characters within the film present this dual approach of tackling a subject matter common in Hollywood cinema. Iosef Tarasov, played by Alfie Allen, embraces hypermasculinity with his arrogant, selfish and entitled personality being the son of Russian Mobster Viggo Tarasov, played by Michael Nyqvist. John Wick is the exact opposite with a laid back attitude. Iosef initiates the plot of the film when he and his group conducted a vicious burglary that beat Wick, ransacked his home, killed his dog left behind by his deceased wife, and stole his treasured car. Unknowingly to him, Wick formerly works for his father and is nicknamed 'Baba Yaga', Russian for 'Boogeyman.' As Wick hunts down Iosef, the opposite occurs between the characters as Iosef's toxic hypermasculinity is exposed as fraudulent when faced with an actual credible threat. Wick finds again the machismo he once discarded.Themes of loyalty, word of honor and brotherhood are also present. Marcus, played by Willem Dafoe, is Wick's mentor and friend. Hired by Viggo to kill Wick, he broke the contract when another assassin, Ms. Perkins, comes in and vies for the prize, probably also out of mutual respect. He is tortured then murdered when Viggo learns of his betrayal. Ms. Perkins is killed for breaking The Continental's policy of no 'business' transaction within hotel grounds. Lastly, Viggo is killed by Wick by protecting his son. In the criminal underworld, death is the ultimate fate.John Wick's strengths are its direction and fight scenes. For lovers of neo-noir, Spaghetti Westerns and Hong Kong martial arts cinema, Chad Stahelski has great command, specifically in the cinematography department, in paying homages to his film's influences bringing a unique testosterone-charged modern twist of the genres. The score is also great from Tyler Bates, containing a mix of techno and rock music.The sequel has lots of potentials that the first has failed to tackle. Put a heavier emphasis on character development, not just lip-service dialogue. Here's to hoping it exceeds the first.6/10",6,1,1,1 November 2019
12 Angry Men," A timeless classic relevant in any time period
","12 Angry Men is a timeless classic relevant in any time period. Set exclusively in a jury room, the film exceeds the four corners of its setting presenting themes with great depth and handle about politics, interpersonal relationship, prejudice, bias and hope. In the age of social media and instant news, the film asks us to question our personal thoughts and belief. The film is a cinematic triumph of logic over emotion.A story about 12 men sitting as jurors faced with a decision to deliver a verdict on an accused teenager, the jurors are locked as a single hold out, Juror 8, played by Henry Fonda votes not guilty. Against overwhelming odds, Juror 8 manages to convince another juror who proclaims it is not easy to stand alone from the ridicule of others. The film gradually reveals more questions as a guilty verdict beyond reasonable doubt is slowly eroded and each character's motivations is gradually revealed. Every juror presents his arguments but these all fall when reasonable doubt exists attacking the testimony as more and more jurors vote not guilty. Despite being confined to a single room, the film is nonetheless a thriller. The film slowly reveals that men are often dictated by emotion and not reason. Juror 3, played by Lee J. Cobb, is the main antagonist but is also at heart and the opposite end of the film's struggle between guilty and not guilty. The subplot of his relationship with his estranged son finds resolution when he becomes the final juror to vote not guilty from guilty. With a cast to envy portraying every imaginable human emotion, 12 Angry Men flawlessly treads its themes with character growth in a cathartic ending. Even its black and white color is a representation of the gray area people live in a prejudiced world.Ultimately, the film speaks about our everyday politics but also as a redemption and heroic tale against odds. 12 Angry Men will continue to be appreciated for generations to come and deserves its place among cinema's masterpiece.10/10",10,1,1,7 July 2019
Knives Out," a whodunit for our times
","Stellar performances from an ensemble cast with insane on-screen chemistry, great direction, and a whodunit for our times, Rian Johnson's Knives Out is one of 2019's best with some wholly relevant story about family and politics.Boasting a talented cast, it goes without saying Knives Out wouldn't be a spectacular triumph if not for the three leads of Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, and Ana de Armas. Evans, playing Hugh 'Ransom' Drysdale, is a ridiculous mixture of unlikable and smoothness. Craig, playing Benoit Blanc, is hilarious as a detective with a thick southern accent. Armas, playing Marta Cabrera, grounds the film through her warmhearted portrayal of Marta's honest, firm, and ultimately good character. The rest of the cast do not disappoint and give dynamite performances of the fewer screen time they receive which includes Christopher Plummer, and Jamie Lee Curtis, to name a few.Central to Knives Out is the death of the family's patriarch, Harlan Thrombey, but the film is truly about a dysfunctional family and a satire about wealth and inheritance. Though Knives Out seemingly reveals Harlan's killer even before the finale, the writing uses the early reveal as a springboard for exploring the family dynamics between the Thrombeys and Marta, showing how each of the Thrombeys are inherently selfish despite their good front. When the will reading shockingly reveals that Harlan left his entire possessions to Marta, the Thrombeys immediately turn on her, except Ransom, and their true attitude is revealed by calling her names and making unfounded accusations of unduly influencing Harlan's will. This is exemplified by previous dialogues hinting that Marta is a mere afterthought to the family such as when individual Thrombeys claim they wanted her to be present at the funeral but were outvoted and not knowing her true country of origin. Through the whirlwind of losing not only an employer but a close friend and family by choice, Marta grows from a demure and devoted nurse to the strong and caring heir of Harlan's possessions.Knives Out isn't the traditional whodunit were the identity of the murderer is clear only in the end. Multiple faints, clues, and surprises makes Knives Out unique in the genre by seemingly throwing out the central mystery, when in actuality each scene is made for characters to grow. The journey, and the not the end, is basically the film's overarching thought. The complexity of the script requires repeat viewings because the hefty themes and minute character is buried underneath the murder mystery. When the ending reveals that Harlan caused his own death, though instigated by Ransom, that moment gives better clarity to the family dynamics explored by the film. People feel entitled to inheritance and will do anything to claim them.Rian Johnson is at home in Knives Out. Everything about the direction is firing on all cylinders. The film shifts from recollection to plot progression seamlessly. Not a second is wasted or feel dragging. Setting the film in a mansion evoking old money adds visual representation to the themes. The cinematography and music are also topnotch.Not only is Ana de Armas insanely beautiful, but talented as well. Hoping to see her in bigger and better roles. Lastly, give us more of Daniel Craig southern accent roles!10/10",10,0,6,6 December 2019
Orphan," great premise, legit scary moments but is a misfire in execution as it tailspins to cliches
","Orphan has a great premise, legit scary moments but is a misfire in execution as it tailspins to cliches in the second half. The film is an exploration about loss of a child and how it drives the mother, in this case Kate, played by Vera Farmiga, and her attempts to grow from that trauma by adopting a child. It starts off great, but never coheres. Her trauma is never fully resolved as it becomes subservient to the narrative in building Esther, the film's antagonist. Tropes such as horror character from eastern Europe and mistrusting husband are present. The acting is good in many cases. Farmiga aptly portrays a grieving mother. Isabelle Fuhrman is exceptional playing an mentally disabled antisocial serial killer pretending to be kid, who in reality is an adult. Overall, Orphan is good but nothing special.6/10",6,0,0,24 August 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," The best Marvel Studios has to offer
","8.5/10Thor: Ragnarok brings comedy, heart, action and a satisfying story that transforms a reluctant warrior, unsure of his role, to the rightful king of Asgard.Chris Hemswroth in the leading role shines with humor, charisma, likeability and dramatic flair that balances the goofy and emotional beats of the story. Back-upped by supporting characters with depth and are purpose-driven, Ragnarok is not merely a story of the lead character. With a fitting score and soundtrack amplifying the emotions of the characters, Taika Waititi's seamless blend of comedy and drama is rousing. Action-wise, audiences looking for fun will not be disappointed and will certainly be coming back for more. Unlike its Shakespearean predecessors, Ragnarok takes liberty from the source material but never forgets to humanizes the characters, sending them on journeys that is filled with heart.",9,1,6,15 June 2019
Suicide Squad," great cast and surprisingly fun, but generic and formulaic at best... ruined by studio meddling
","Suicide Squad is a solid and enjoyable movie about superhero villains lead by a terrific cast, but whose overall story, incoherent theme, and mired production prevents it from becoming more than a typical summer blockbuster.The movie's main strength is derived from its great cast chemistry. Viola Davis, Margot Robbie, and Will Smith as Amanda Waller, Harley Quinn, and Deadshot, respectively, are terrific, playing off one another perfectly. The strong cast makes the movie enjoyable.In terms of writing, the movie shows the motivations of the characters to follow orders imposed by Amanda Waller, leader of the team. The audience is shown enough background and character origin to sympathize, but their motivations are not explored or challenged in a meaningful and resonant way. The story amounts to little because it lacks a coherent overarching theme that unites the characters. Harley Quinn has her romance subplot with joker, played by Jared Leto, where he rescues her from prison. Deadshot is a for-hire-assassin whose work conflicts with his daughter's relationship. Other supporting characters such as Colonel Rick Flag, Captain Boomerang, El Diablo, Killer Croc, Enchantress, and Katana are given proper motivations but they fall within the same assessment of failing to explore or challenge them. Colonel Rick Flag, in particular, has a good subplot that revolves around her lover Doctor June Moone who is simultaneously the villain of the film, Enchantress. Aside from having an incoherent theme, Enchantress is a weak villain, not physically, but motivationally and who is rather formulaic. The movie could have been stronger if Joker was the main villain. Joker is instead a bad parody with his awful tattoos, 'damaged', punk, and gangster personality.David Ayer's direction continues the Snyder influence on the DCEU, mixed with comedy and elements of Marvel's Guardian of the Galaxy. The editing is alright when it switches from present to past through recollection of character origins. The soundtrack is quite trippy and is one of the better parts of the movie.Suicide squad had great potential which was squandered by studio interference. The sort-of sequel, to be directed by James Gunn, hopefully, is an improvement by giving the director more free-rein and creative leeway.5/10",5,0,0,3 January 2020
Split," a thrilling film about a psychopathic killer and childhood trauma
","Impressive performances from James McAvoy and Anya Taylor-Joy carry Split in a thrilling film about a psychopathic killer and childhood trauma.Split revolves around two main characters, Kevin and Casey, who suffer from childhood trauma which the film explores. Kevin developed his multiple personalities to cope from abuse by his mother and loss of father. He abducts three young women which includes Marcia and Claire. The film gradually reveals that the multiple personalities are distinct and fight for each others turn on 'the light'. The narrative is further driven by a yet not shown 24th personality, named the Beast, who commanded the other personalities to abduct the women as his food. Casey being abducted is designed for her to grow from the trauma caused by the sexual abuse by her uncle which is revealed through flashback scenes. Another subplot is Dr. Fletcher's, played by Betty Buckley, attempt to heal Kevin.The arc or Dr. Fletcher trying to heal Kevin bogged down the pacing which should have been strictly focused on Kevin and Casey. Scenes with an adult Casey and her uncle implying continued abuse should have been presented, not just on her childhood experiences. A clear resolution to both Kevin and Casey is not fully grasped because their trauma is different. Kevin is shown to be abused, but is not shown specifically how. For Casey, her ending should have been a proper breakup with her uncle signifying character growth. The camera work is impressive in some shots but not all. Angles are good but not the lighting which takes away some of the claustrophobic feel of the film.Nevertheless, McAvoy and Taylor-Joy are spectacular and carry the film on acting alone. McAvoy's personality switching is fluid and shows his ability to be a chameleon. Taylor-Joy is able to portray a layered performance simultaneously dealing with sexual abuse and the possibility of reoccurring in another form.7/10",7,1,1,26 August 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Spider-Verse is a worthy inclusion to the Spider-Man film franchise
","Spider-Verse is the comic Spider-Man brought to the big screen. Wonderfully animated beaming with psychedelic colors and a story with heart and emotion, Spider-Verse is a worthy inclusion to the Spider-Man film franchise and will be highly remembered for its originality, humor, layered characters and as a enjoyable fan-service.Since Raimi's Spider-Man in 2002, we have been flooded with a torrent of films from the same character. One would be inclined to believe that the character has over time lost its luster because the same plot points and story has been rehashed. Sony has rebooted the franchise twice, giving the character three interpretations since then. Everybody knows the origin, Peter Parker gets bit by a radioactive spider that gives him superpowers such as augmented strength, agility, speed and wall crawling. The studio giving us these films have managed to deliver a different take that is better than most of its live-action catalog while retaining the aspects that make the character tick.The story is about Miles Morales, a Afro-Hispanic kid who is accidentally gifted with the same powers of the original Spider-Man. When the villain Kingpin opens a hole in space that sucks in the same character from other parallel universes the heroes have to unite in order to return to their respective universes.Despite the number of protagonists, Spider-Verse manages to balance character development and action. Miles Morales is an average kid who encounters the same problems that any kids face at his age; father-son relationship and sense of belonging. As the story progresses Morales is shown to have a different opinion on Spider-Man against his father. Because of his strained relationship with his father he seeks confirmation and guidance from his uncle whose realtionship with his brother is also strained. Morales gradually finds purpose in the Spider-Man persona, but these comes into conflict when it is revealed that his uncle is the killer who is chasing him. The other protagonists from the other dimensions are there to inject back stories that makes Morales accept his powers. The villain is also properly motivated instead of being a cardboard character who only serves to further the action without character growth.The technical qualities of the film is not to be understated. With a soundtrack that matches the tone and visuals that directly borrow from the comic books Spider-Verse is a exhilarating ride from start to finish.8/10",8,0,1,14 July 2019
Dark City," A masterpiece in visual storytelling
","A masterpiece in production design, cinematography, and score, Dark City is a throwback to early 20th century period, tribute to film noir and German Expressionistic films such as Metropolis. Unapologetically bleak but with an undercurrent of hope and love, the film is a deep dive into themes of reality, memories, and perception. What the film lacks in action, it has in spades of character study. The sense of time and space are further manipulated to present a grand scale in a once small and contained story centering on an amnesiac man running from shadowy figures.The story follows John Murdoch as he awakens in a bathtub, suffering from amnesia. With only faint memories of his past, Murdoch is chased by groups of men called 'Strangers', upon the call of Dr. Daniel Schreber, who seeks the 'tuning' ability he possesses. Emma Murdoch is his wife, whom he has no recollection. Aside from the Strangers, Inspector Frank Bumstead is hot on his trail because Murdoch is accused of murder, one of which is a dead woman found inside the apartment he woke up. The pursuit ensues unwrapping mysteries behind the Strangers, Murdoch's fabricated past and the city's façade. The Strangers are a group of extraterrestrials near extinction who seek the meaning of humanity's individuality as a means to save their race. Every people living in the city is an unwitting subject, Murdoch included. All memories of the past are fabrications made by the Strangers meant to cloak changes. The city is the apparatus in which this giant experiment unfolds. During midnight the city physically changes, literally. Buildings and roads are rearranged and new memories are inserted to erase every truthful past and recollection. The city, in reality, is a massive space habitat protected by force fields, at the core of which is a machine that powers the city's machinations and is the Strangers home.What is reality? Is the world a façade? Is reality ultimately a subjective viewpoint? What drives our perception of reality? How do our memories shape our present self? Dark City answers these philosophical questions satisfyingly and in a cathartic fashion.Reality in Dark City can be viewed from multiple perspectives. The city is real from the Strangers' standpoint since they are its builders. Having control is tangible power, and is real because it alters the city's true state. For Murdoch, reality begins confusingly due to amnesia but the ending with Anna, Emma's new identity, is his true reality. Emma is the wife he never had, except as implanted memories, but this is where he builds his reality. The city can be further considered a façade or not depending on the perspective. The Strangers built a façade world where the occupants consider it real.Now, is reality ultimately a subjective viewpoint? In the film's context, reality is indeed subjective. On a personal level, we create our own reality through our identities and experiences. The physical world is a reality different from the mental reality each individual possesses. It is a stimulant which our physical bodies are subjected. Some reactions are natural like pain, but emotions may vary from person to person, thus each may conclude differently from the same source. Murdoch, as the central character, finds resolution when after defeating the Strangers he altered reality to his will by changing the city into the memories which were implanted. Emma, now Anna with new memories, is his only reality because everything is mere creation and the only person whom he feels an emotion and love towards is her. Ultimately, as the driving force of the film his resolution is the thread that binds the themes together.The acting is also great. Rufus Sewell, William Hurt, and Kiefer Sutherland are good in their roles, but Jennifer Connelly is the best performer, embodying the pain of not knowing any true past.21 years since Dark City's release the visuals remain something to behold. The artistic qualities need to be experienced first-hand because words are not enough to do justice its beauty. A masterpiece in art direction and cinematography.10/10",10,3,5,20 October 2019

","Non-linear story lines can get lost and muddied under a lesser director, but not with Nolan. A film with no real center and told from multiple point of views, Dunkirk is nevertheless a showcase of artistry and emotional beats.Dunkirk is told from three perspectives, all under duress from the same enemy. The film is a masterpiece in editing as it builds drama and tension by exchanging scenes between the multiple point of views to present character development. The first half hour builds the premise as the characters find ways to escape their encirclement from the enemy. As the story progresses scenes are alternatively presented to show moments of despair, relief and hope. Solid acting from the cast carries the film and makes the viewers sympathize with their predicament. Heroism is sprinkled throughout, never missing the point that in war casualty is inevitable. Sacrifice, trauma, the need for self-preservation and survival is ever present and is explored by the various interactions between the characters.The film's truly shines in the artistic department. Glorious cinematography, production design, special effects and powerful score. It is worth watching for those qualities alone.Ultimately, the premise of having no real center is what makes Dunkirk short of a masterpiece.9/10",9,2,5,21 July 2019
Ratatouille," A Pixar gem about the Arts
","Few animated films can boast a script as matured as Ratatouille. More suited for adults than kids, Ratatouille at its heart is about a character coming-of-age who pursues his dreams in an unsympathetic world. Pixar's magic continues by taking high concepts such as culinary arts into a family-friendly outing that delivers goods and drama. Accompanied by terrific visuals and soundtrack Ratatouille is a blast and thoroughly enjoyable.Ratatouille is an excellent film, but not without its faults. The story is engrossing when Remy, the rat cook, is the focus but drags when Linguini, the human partner of Remy, takes center stage. Due to its fast pace, the comedy often overtakes the emotional beats by failing to present introspection, especially in the first hour. The film hits its peak when the story shifts to Remy's family in the second half.9/10",9,1,1,26 June 2019
Inside Out," Inside Out is one of those Pixar outputs geared for adults with its deep message about personal growth
","With an innovative story telling, Inside Out is a unique Pixar output that elevates the genre by witty exploration of human psychology. Although the film is about a kid who goes through the commotions of losing home and living in another place, Inside Out is one of those Pixar outputs geared for adults with its deep message about personal growth. Human emotions are not simple happiness, sadness, fear, disgust or anger but a combination of each.Led by Amy Poehler as Joy, the voice cast perfectly embodies the emotion they represent. Inside Out starts by establishing Riley living in an ideal home. The story takes her from Minnesota to San Francisco, providing an abrupt change of environment. Losing her friends and the place she calls home, Riley's world slowly crumbles as a feeling of loss overcomes her. Despite her best attempts Joy is also overcome by Sadness, played by Phyllis Smith, who unbestknown to them is the emotion Riley needs. As both confront at headquarters an accident occurs that transports them to long term memory, leaving behind Fear, Anger and Disgust, emotions that would only exacerbate Riley.Their journey back to headquarters takes them through Riley's memories, subconscious, abstract thought, dreams and imagination, presenting a landscape of rapid growth for the character. Simultaneously, pillars or islands of Riley's life fall one by one intensifying the emotion's journey.An idea by Anger to walk away and return to Minnesota nearly lost the character in her sorrow, when in the last moment Sadness was able to prevent Riley from leaving San Francisco. Returning home she breaks down as all core memories are relived, turning to sad memories instead of happy memories. The ending is cathartic as a new core memory with characteristics of happiness and sadness rebuilds a pillar or island of Riley's family. Inside Out never failed to explore an aspect of the character, doing so comically but in a mature way. The trippy visuals and melodic score are also excellent, balancing the story with appropriate artistic qualities.Inside Out is easily one of Pixar's finest films and one of the greatest work of animation by default.10/10",10,2,4,3 September 2019

No Country for Old Men," an instant western classic about drugs, greed, death and hopelessness
","No Country for Old Men is an instant western classic about drugs, greed, death and hopelessness. Led by an all-time great performance from Javier Bardem playing a macabre character in Anton Chigurh, the film is a heart pounding non-stop manhunt packing enough emotional wallop while successfully exploring its themes.Set near the US-Mexico Border, the film can be considered as a cautionary tale about the War on Drugs which has raged for decades. Motivated by greed Llewelyn Moss, played by Josh Brolin, takes off after finding a bag of cash on a site of failed transaction resulting to massacre. Unbeknown to him, placed inside is a tracker. Anton Chigurh hunts down Llewelyn Moss for the money. As the hunt progresses, snippets of dialogue and character interactions show that Chigurh is not evil, but merely a servant of death or death itself. Guided by a twisted philosophy, Chigurh kills because of fate and destiny. Moss sends away his wife and mother-in-law as the hunt becomes not merely about the money but also personal. Other characters appear to further provide insight and growth such as Woody Harrelson, who warns Moss that facing Chigurh is a death sentence. No character is as important to carry the film on an emotional level as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, played Tommy Lee Jones. Embodying the hopelessness pervasive throughout the film, Sheriff Ed is an active participant in the manhunt aiming to prevent it. Despite his efforts, people die. Anyone who faces Chigurh dies. His scenes throughout the manhunt are beautiful, sad and introspective. Already an old man near retirement during the course of the film, the ending where he is retired perfectly captures the essence of his arc losing all hope living in world where death is unstoppable.While No Country is an excellent play about its themes, it lacks a true emotional anchor that carries the movie. Llewelyn Moss and Sheriff Tom aren't particularly engaging characters that captures the viewer's empathy.The Coen Brothers also bring technical qualities that complement the story. Wide and barren shots to portray a sense of epic scope, an almost non-existent score to build tension naturally and violence fitting for the antagonist.No Country for Old Men is a must see not only for its antagonist but as a whole.9/10",9,3,3,23 August 2019

","Making another conclusion to a trilogy that defined animated features is an improbable task, but the innovators at Pixar deliver once again. Toy Story 4 ends the story of its main character Woody in a way that honors the character's motive built on the previous films. Fun, but occasionally sloppy, it is nevertheless a home run.Toy Story 4 has two main qualities going for it: character-driven story and unparalleled animation. The action is driven by the characters' motives, not as mere fanfare. Woody gets lost, once again, when his new owner, Bonnie, made a new toy named Forky who has an existential crisis on his identity and purpose in life. As they journey back to their owner, Woody encounters his old flame Bo Peep who has been living without an owner for years. Bo Peep opens a world greater than serving a lone child. Conflict ensues as they encounter another toy, Gabby Gabby, who wants Woody's voice box so she can feel the love from a child. Toy Story 4 also expands the franchise by adding more characters. Despite its depth, the story occasionally gets sloppy due to execution mostly in the middle part. The animation, however, is unparalleled. Watching this in the cinema feels like watching a live-action film immersed with details.Here's to hoping Pixar finally ends Toy Story.8.5/10",9,0,2,10 July 2019
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," a successful reboot that firmly establishes the mythos of the Apes' franchise in an updated and modern setting
","Led by Andy Serkis as the talking ape Caesar and James Franco as Dr. Will, Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a successful reboot that firmly establishes the mythos of the Apes' franchise in an updated and modern setting. Despite the short running time, the character development is strong enough to present proper motivations and a moving story. Caesar grows from a household pet to a strong leader. He seeks acceptance in humanity's world, but upon realizing the cruelty to which his fellow apes are subjected, Caesar uses his intellect to free his people and leads them on a separate and self-made destiny. Caesar's character overall growth is coming to terms with him being part human in terms of intellect and part ape in terms of physical appearance. The writing does justice to the character by presenting it organically. Andy Serkis' tortured performance demonstrates yet again why he is king of motion capture acting.While Rise is ultimately about Caesar, the human co-lead, Dr. Will, is equally important to the story. Will is Caesar's owner, living with a father who suffers from Alzheimer's. His character aims betterment by curing his father and raising Caesar. Unintentionally, his goals are what would separate Caesar from him. Through Will, much of the story and inner politics is anchored. Behind all the character work is a thematic backdrop on the ethics of biomedical engineering, corporate greed, and animal cruelty. David Oyelowo and Tom Felton are effective villains representing the corporate greed and animal cruelty themes of the movie. Rise is filled more with character interactions than action scenes but of the few of them, all are heart-pounding and in line with the characters' journey. The climax is a clear demonstration that apes were equal to humans, battling the security forces without firearms and coming out victorious.Serkis' performance wouldn't have been done right without excellent CGI. If Caesar was all CGI, the emotional connection to the character wouldn't be so firm and ingrained to the audience. The direction from Rupert Wyatt is also really impressive. The technical aspects are on point. Rise only really needed to be much longer and drawn out. The sequels have done this, which is why they are better but does not negate how good of a movie Rise still is.8/10",8,1,1,30 November 2019
Logan," Logan elevates the genre to new heights by stripping down the character to its essentials
","Barely even a superhero film, Logan elevates the genre to new heights by stripping down the character to its essentials and presents them in a powerful and emotionally moving tale about a worn-out man who has to find the hero who existed within him before.Logan has incredible direction. The standout is the R-rated action. All the gore and blood is utilized to visceral effect as the audience is carried from scene to scene following the characters. The western style and overtone of nihilism is perfectly captured by the barrenness and roughness of the production design. The score is a mix of melodies and orchestra capturing the essence of the moments and themes of the film.Character interactions are at the center of the film. The development of the characters are presented through subtle and emotionally resonant dialogue. The minimal dialogue draws the audience to the incredible and moving performances of the cast. Hugh Jackman fully embodies the worn-out hero who lives just to survive and has lost his sense of heroism or purpose of living. His performance draws us into his broken down world where little hope exists. Patrick Stewart, as Professor X, plays the opposite character with lively optimism and enduring hope. Laura, played by Dafne Keen, is the symbol of hope in the film and the vehicle through which Logan changes as a character. Boyd Holbrook, as Donald Pierce, plays the unrelenting villain who chases the protagonists and drives the plot of the film.Logan is not without its message. The film is a critique of unethical human experimentation and it hammers the point that it is more evil when done for the purposes of profit and power. X-Men related characters were created to highlight minority issues and the film is the best adaption of that purpose. It is also about the majority-minority power struggle and how each side acts and reacts against the other.Superhero films as an artform are rare, Logan is one of them.10/10",10,2,4,11 August 2019
Toy Story," Pixar's first feature is a blastoff and classic
","24 years after its release, the first Pixar feature film remains a hallmark in its library and cinema as a whole. Full of humor and humanity, Toy Story is a finely crafted blockbuster with impeccable script delving into our natural yearning for affection and acceptance of one's self.Toy Story is centered between the struggle of Woody and Buzz for Andy's affection, their owner. Buzz is the newcomer and he replaces Woody as Andy's favorite toy. Driven by insecurity, Woody causes Buzz out of their house and this starts the film's main plot of both getting lost and trying to find their way back home. Buzz during this period continues to believe that he is indeed a true space ranger. Woody's true character is gradually unraveled for his utmost devotion to Andy and simultaneously convincing Buzz that he is a mere toy. By a set of circumstances both land on their neighbors house and under the possession of Sid, the toy destroyer kid. Inside Sid's house happens the reveal that shocks Buzz to the core, finding his true meaning: to make kids happy. Toy Story plays off both themes and subplot satisfyingly without sacrificing drama over humor. In fact, both drama and humor come hand in hand.Toy Story looks dated now with 2 decades of technological improvement, but during its time was revolutionary. It should be judged as such. The film is a visual splendor with bright colors aided with a rousing score and an original song by Randy Newman.For anyone interested in animated films, Toy Story should come first on the recommendation list.10/10",10,0,0,7 July 2019
Toy Story 2," One of those rare sequel that exceeds the original
","Toy Story is already perfect. Toy Story 2 manages to even exceed its predecessor. As is common with Pixar, Toy Story 2 is an excellent film filled with over-the-top comedy, fantastic visuals, score and mature writing. It expands the franchise and adds more characters without feeling stuffed.While the first film deals with mainly with Buzz and his fall, Toy Story 2 is about Woody and a sudden realization that he is expendable to Andy in the long run. The film also borrows the same premise from the first but is not a mere copy. In Toy Story 2 themes of age and purpose are explored without becoming preachy. When Woody was stolen and taken to a toy collector who plans to sell him, he encounters his past and realizes that he was once a famous toy. Joining him is his round up gang composed of Jessie, Bullseye and Stinky Pete. Convincing Woody that he'll find more meaning and love as a display in a museum, Woody has a crisis of either leaving his owner behind or joining his round up gang. Woody initially denies the offer and this reveals the other character's motives. Jessie was also once owned by someone named Emily but left her when she grew up. Toy Story 2 is a fantastic tale about mortality, even though the toys don't necessarily die, because even toys have to find purpose in life for without purpose life is meaningless. It all culminates in an airport chase scene. Stinky Pete is a menacing villain who can take matters into his own hands. Once again, Stinky Pete is properly written to have real and believable motivations.The supporting cast are not mere accessories. Buzz's story is continued from the first film with the introduction of Emperor Zurg. Rex is a game junkie who loves playing Buzz's game. His arc concludes simultaneously with Buzz's.For a film supposed to be sent directly to home release, Toy Story 2, quality wise, is beyond home release. A masterpiece and one of Pixar's finest.",10,2,3,8 July 2019
La La Land," A masterpiece in technical qualities, breaking new ground with its tragic story while simultaneously being a love letter to years past musicals
","A masterpiece in editing, cinematography, sound design, composition, and production design La La Land is a timeless showcase from director Damien Chazelle at his best, breaking new ground with its tragic story while simultaneously being a love letter to years past musicals led by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling.The technical qualities of La La Land are superlative. Damien Chazelle expertly crafts the choreography with the editing and sound design. The song and dance numbers throughout the film, especially during the opening at the road interchange, are flawlessly directed. Employing long continuous shots do not distract from the singing and dance sequences. In terms of cinematography, shooting the movie on film rather than digital, and using the widescreen CinemaScope aspect ratio gives La La Land a classical look. Low-light photography in select scenes reflects each character's emotional state. The cinematography is contrasted by brightly lit scenes which further reflects the ambitious and high-minded themes of the movie. Every technical quality fits and transitions so perfectly and fluidly that it heightens the audience's connection to the characters. La La Land is such a beautiful looking movie, deserving of every technical award it receives, best experienced personally.Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are once again dynamite and electric as an on-screen couple from their previous roles in Crazy, Stupid, Love and Gangster Squad. Built on the back of their performances, La La Land could never succeed as a romance film without the two protagonist's chemistry. Instead of looking like speaking rehearsed lines, Stone and Gosling convey a sense of genuine love and likability as their characters undergo development.Stone plays Mia Dolan, a barista aspiring to be an actress. Gosling plays Sebastian Wilder, a pianist with a passion for jazz. Their life and ambitions are intertwined in Los Angeles. Mia continues to audition for roles, without success. Sebastian somehow achieves stardom and financial stability when his former classmate Keith, played by John Legend, offered him to be the pianist of his jazz fusion band. The part requires him to be on tour for months or years, away from Mia. His commitment leads to a fight against Mia when she protested his acceptance of the role, which is against his musical philosophy. Earlier suffering an embarrassing performance due to low attendance, leading to the inability to pay back the theater, and Sebastian's absence, Mia breaks up with him, moving back to Boulder City to continue her studies and abandon acting altogether. Receiving a call for an audition, Sebastian travels to Boulder City to inform Mia who returns to Los Angeles. After the audition, both confess their love, but uncertain of the future. In the boldest move of the movie, 5 years are skipped. Mia is a successful actress and married to another actor, while Sebastian now owns a jazz club. Going out for a dinner with her husband, Mia inadvertently stumbles to Sebastian's jazz club, aptly named Seb, her original idea during their love life. Noticing Mia among the audience, Sebastian plays their song and a dream sequence occurs of what might have been. Before exiting the club, Sebastian and Mia share a smile as the movie ends.La La Land speaks to everyone's burning desire for glory. However, do we achieve our dreams by ending our relationships with loved ones? Do we sacrifice people with whom we have an emotional attachment to achieve our ambitions? On the surface, the movie ended with both protagonists parting ways but closer inspection reveals that despite ultimately leading diverging lives, Mia and Sebastian retain their love and that it was anchored not by physical attraction but by mutual respect and the desire to see each other succeed. The overarching theme of La La Land, then, is not about the common physical attraction, but ideals of dreams and ambitions. Driven by a character-heavy emphasis, the movie allows the themes to resonate emotionally by the time the credits roll. Damien Chazelle delivers a musical masterpiece with modern sensibilities.10/10",10,6,8,4 January 2020
Joker," the most unique comic book movie ever
","As a big Batman fan, the idea of making an origin movie about his greatest foe without the hero can be easily dismissed, let alone from a man who has directed some divisive films. Mental illness is also a thorny societal issue slowly being recognized and governments everywhere are tackling. It comes to no surprise that an adaption about Joker's origin will cause controversy, possibly stirring wannabe lunatics into action, and because we see the character as evil incarnate, bereft of humanity. Seeing the film however, the truth couldn't be more different. Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix deliver a tragic and haunting portrayal of Joker's descent into madness, liberally borrowing from classics such as Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy and taking its cue from acclaimed graphic novels such as Batman: The Killing Joke and Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, while retaining core aspects of the character without glorifying his actions into a hero. Joker is without a shadow of a doubt the most unique comic book movie ever.Arthur Fleck, played by Joaquin Phoenix, is a lonely single man who lives together with his mother. Working as a party clown, he dreams of becoming a popular television comedian in the vein of his idol Murray Franklin, played by Robert De Niro. Consecutive misfortunes and tragedy, however, spiral his already broken life toward anarchy not because of a single character that prevents his personal growth, but society's ill and self-serving agenda. Phoenix is widely considered among the greatest living actors with acclaimed performances in Gladiator, Her and The Master, to name a few. Heath Ledger casts a huge shadow on the role, winning a posthumous Academy Award. Phoenix's Joker is an instant classic alongside Travis Bickle, Ledger's Joker, Alex DeLarge and other cinematic greats. The physical transformation to portray an impoverished man is immersive, drawing the viewer to Arthur on a visceral level. Few actors are willing to undergo drastic body changes from film to film, one of them being Christian Bale, the Batman of Christopher Nolan's trilogy. Before killing Randall, Arthur was doing body contortions similar to Pennywise the Clown in It, unaided by digital effects, all done by sheer physicality. The film is littered with imagery of Arthur's condition. Aside from the physicality, the laugh and mannerisms depict psychopathic narcissistic tendencies that is staple of the character for decades. Phoenix is truly terrifying at times. The best part about Arthur's characterization is how it retained the essence of Joker from the comics. Joker, in the modern age, is an unreliable narrator with multiple origins. Many scenes are actually make-believe imaginations of Arthur, such as the relationship with his neighbor Sophie and being interviewed live as an audience in Murray's talk show. In fact, the film as a whole is ambiguous, leaving open for interpretation if any of the events occurred at all in reality. What makes Joker a timeless character is ambiguity. The writing and acting perfectly captures that characterization.Joker is by a wide margin Todd Phillip's magnum opus. The direction is simply stunning. The cinematography and production design evoke a 70s or early 80s vibe visually. From the dirty streets and references to popular culture in those decades, the audience is drawn to that world while putting a modern spin about today's views on mental illness. At times, the score sounds like one composed by Hans Zimmer, but it is not. Hildur Guðnadóttir pays homage to the Nolan trilogy with her score, but in a unique way solely for Joker's world. Coupled with Phoenix's acting, the score can be heart-pounding or heart-stopping. Something jarring about the music are placements of songs that would have been better replaced by the score alone. Overall, they do not negatively affect much the film as a whole. Depicting Joker's ambiguity and unreliable narrator would not be possible without masterful editing. The film is perfectly paced that builds to a rousing and violent conclusion. There are moments of levity, such as Gary failing to open the door because of his short stature, but the biggest moments come when Arthur begins murdering people out of revenge. Without proper pacing, the film would just have been another 'excessive' show of violence without drama.On a thematic level, the social commentary feels a bit lacking. For a film reviewed by a significant portion of the critics as excessively violent, Joker is a bit safe and tame. Surely, many other films have exceeded Joker's violence. The film is about class struggle as it is about mental illness. Gotham is a boiling pot of inequality, where the poor are relegated to shabby apartments and the rich in spacious mansions. This is exemplified by Thomas Wayne, who promises that his business acumen can elevate the city's economy as mayor. Thomas Wayne comes off very condescending and detach from the actual living conditions of his fellow citizens, although an argument could be made that is because of Arthur's view on him, not necessarily Thomas Wayne's true personality. Murray Franklin, played by Robert De Niro, is also another rich person with selfish agenda when during his talk show a video of Arthur doing stand-up comedy was played to the ridicule of his audience. Arthur is not motivated by high-minded ideals, but by revenge, thus distorting how we perceive some of the characters are. While the film excellently constructs Gotham's divided class structure, the social commentary is lacking because the supporting characters are weak and are there simply for Arthur to despise after contributing to his eventual downfall. Unlike its inspiration, Taxi Driver, which has outstanding supporting characters such as Iris, Betsy and Sport where the themes are given weight, Joker has none, although they are played decently by their actors, especially Robert De Niro. Murray's exchange with Arthur during the finale is spectacular. De Niro, a screen legend himself, holds his own against another legend at his best.Do not miss Joker in theaters!9/10",9,2,3,6 October 2019
It Chapter Two," closes the story of the Losers Club satisfyingly, although the execution is often sloppy and messy
","Sometimes good, sometimes not, often engaging, often not, It Chapter Two closes the story of the Losers Club satisfyingly, although the execution is often sloppy and messy.It Chapter Two follows the Losers Club, bound by blood pact, as they seek to destroy It once and for all. Returning to Derry, they are made to confront a vengeful evil while relieving past fears and traumas that did not go away in adulthood. As an ensemble, the cast have balanced roles without one dominating the presence, unlike the original where Bill's guilt is emphasized. However, because of different character arcs, the thematic message becomes muddied. The character arcs deal with the same fears, guilt and repressed feelings from the original, although additional perspectives were added.Mike is underused and should have been the emotional center, notwithstanding the need to definitely close a chapter in the ensemble's life centered around Derry and It, and by also being the character that remained in Derry. The reveal he withheld information from the group that the American natives died fighting It felt shoehorned and his reasoning contrived. Bill's guilt is explored deeper when it is revealed his reluctance to join his younger brother Georgie was intentional and not because of sickness. Richie is revealed to be a closet gay who developed feelings for Eddie since. Homosexuality is a theme hammered violently in the opening scene when a gay couple was brutally attacked after which followed It's first reappearance, although the film doesn't overtly project a pro-LGBT stance. Stan's suicide does not help the Losers Club and the letters sent by him explaining his reason is unnecessary. Beverly continues to experience sexual and family abuse through her husband, but this is glossed over and her prominence as the lone female is not as strong from the original. Ben remains insecure with his feelings with Beverly. Their resolution is lovely, as Beverly realizes Ben wrote the poem she kept safe.Overall the film is convoluted and has a repetitive story, although the latter can be forgiven because childhood trauma don't necessarily go away in adulthood. While the film has multitudes of messages, it gets bogged down because it does too many things at once. Despite its epic length, the conclusion is well earned because the characters have fully grown from their trauma. Although the pacing can be slow, especially during the first hour, the narrative hastens when the ensemble begins the quest to find totems of their pasts and It's appearance becomes more frequent.Speaking of It, Bill Skarsgard is absolutely fantastic and the film's true highlight. The scene were he gave It emotional range during the baseball game is phenomenal. Skarsgard is terrifying, although the CGI feels overdone during the final battle. Part of his awesome performance is embodying the non-human personality which director Andy Muschietti characterized It to differentiate him from Tim Curry. The rest of the cast is good and no one in particular is bad. Bill Hader steals the show by balancing comedy with inner sadness. A lacking element here present from the original is Derry's creepiness. Almost every citizen in Derry from the original had sinister, hidden motives or bad intentions making the Losers Club stood out. Compared to the original Chapter Two looks more beautiful direction wise. The cinematography and production designed are improved, despite portraying the same setting. Many of the visual and practical effects are great. The horror is strong and score is more engaging.It Chapter Two has many qualities riding for it but also weaknesses from the script, ultimately coming up short to the original.6.5/10",7,1,1,18 September 2019
Rango," a worthwhile satirical take on the western genre
","Gorgeous photo-realistic animation, brilliant voice cast, quality humor and solid drama, Rango is a rewarding adaption from the western genre that respects its root while taking risks few animated films go.Rango is an ordinary pet who stumbles onto Dirt, a western town slowly dying from lack of water. With a knack for acting, he pretends to be a tough-talking drifter, utterly convincing that the townsfolk instantly believe his front. Through sheer luck, he manages to defeat a longtime enemy of the town, a hawk. After an unexpected victory, Rango become Dirt's sheriff, in charge of protecting the safety and well-being of his constituents. Turn of events during his authority uncover a sinister plot that lies at the heart of the town's hardships.Aside from incredible technical qualities such as the score by multiple Academy winner Hans Zimmer and animation looking like real life (the lighting in particular deserves rave praise), Rango succeeds because it treats its characters well by giving them relatable motivations instead of resorting to mindless slapstick comedy. Johnny Depp, playing the titular character, is a nobody who pretends to be a hero and becomes a true hero. The fact that he pretends to be someone he is not presents an angle of guilt to the character, but this does not get explored deeply during his stay at Dirt. The weakness of the film is really in this aspect. Most of Rango's character development occurs in the beginning and finale. However, the supporting characters are great.Beans, a resident of Dirt, drives the plot because of her refusal to sell her land to Mayor Tortoise John and discovery of a potential conspiracy to intentionally worsen the resident's living condition. The script did not make her a hapless female character, but a very strong one with convictions and principles. Tortoise John represents greed at its fullest, by cutting Dirt's water supply and killing anyone when necessary, even those who aid him in maintaining power, all in the name of unequal progress. Rattlesnake Jake is a paid outlaw who terrifies Dirt's residents under Tortoise John, but like Beans has principles, however wild they may be, when Tortoise John intended to kill him after nearly accomplishing his master plan. He is the catalyst for Rango to eventually find his true self by becoming the sheriff he was placed. Despite clocking less than 2-hours, Rango is also an epic drama involving characters outside of Dirt that makes the film a worthwhile satirical take on the western genre.Rango is obscenely good, perfectly made for both adults and children.8.5/10",9,1,1,11 September 2019
Wonder Woman," Gal Gadot is the greatest superhero lead casting
","Wonder Woman rips straight from the comics what makes the character the greatest female superhero. Led by Gal gadot who embodies the character, Wonder Woman succeeds by presenting a character who is strong, resolute but ever curious to her place in the world. Director Patty Jenkins successfully presents not jut feminist but also universal themes without being contrived, something everyone can truly embrace. Accompanied by stunning visuals, Wonder Woman also works as a summer spectacle worth the ticket. The romance is genuine with Gadot and Pine's chemistry carrying the film. Fans of Greek mythology will not be disappointed as it pays homage to its ideals, while sprinkling a modern touch. The villains are, however, the weak link with weak motivations.8/10",8,6,21,27 June 2019
X-Men: First Class," Best X-Men Film
","Carried by an all-around superb cast, stylish 60s setting and a story which delves into the characters' beliefs packaged as a political commentary. First Class truly is one of the great superhero movies because it never sidesteps drama and character development over spectacle. Fassbender, McAvoy, Lawrence and Hoult deliver terrific and moving performances. The political overtones did not feel contrived or served as mere lip service but was integral to the story and the character's arcs. Visually, Vaughn is successful presenting a 60s vibe fit for the film.My only real gripe for this is Magneto's arc. While it is excellent, since his mother was murdered all he wanted was to kill Shaw. We never got to seem him feel for once that mutant and human coexisting is possible. Since this is an origin story that angle should have been tackled.9/10",9,0,0,22 June 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Snyder's true vision is an epic slow-burn thriller that pits two incompatible philosophies of fear and hope against a backdrop of plausible real-world political dynamics
","Zack Snyder is an incredibly divisive filmmaker, having outputs such as 300 and Watchmen. The idea that his films are an acquired taste is very much true. Watchmen, a film adaption of the graphic novel of the same name, continues to be debated for its unnecessary length and lack of emotional drama, unlike its source which is universally considered one of the greatest works in the medium. Visually, Snyder is lauded for his stylized action and violence but criticized for poor narrative. Expectations of Batman and Superman meeting for the first time in cinema are stupidly difficult to realize, but mostly the two heroes are expected to be friendly and cordial, not cutthroat. Studio interference also led to negative receptions of the incoherent theatrical cut. Ben Affleck as a grizzled batman caused further controversy because it gives less room for future Batman stories and his characterization as a jaded crime fighter, breaking his famous no-kill rule. Man of Steel is just as divisive as his other films. Nevertheless, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice Ultimate Edition, Snyder's true vision, is an epic slow-burn thriller that pits two incompatible philosophies of fear and hope against a backdrop of plausible real-world political dynamics. The Ultimate Edition is what Warner Bros. should have released and Watchmen been.Batman v Superman stars Ben Affleck as Batman, a 20-year crime-fighting veteran who realizes his decades work in Gotham hangs in the balance when Superman, an alien with literal superpowers, becomes the figure of hope and peace, putting his immense physical abilities for humanity's greater good. Superman, played by Henry Cavill, lives normally in his true self as Clark Kent, a Daily Planet news reporter. Two years after his destructive battle with fellow Kryptonian General Zod in Metropolis, Superman has to grapple with a skeptical public divided between people who view him as an ordinary man who does good acts and those that treat him as a rogue figure, unbounded by law.The plot follows alternatively between both characters including Lex Luthor and Lois Lane. Batman is secretly doing detective work to locate a hidden figure who plans to bring a dirty bomb to Gotham. Following an ambush in a war-torn part of Africa, Superman finds himself at controversy when he is wrongly accused of the resulting deaths. Lois Lane, Clark Kent's partner, has to uncover the truth behind the ambush. Lex Luthor, a wealthy industrialist, openly influences Sen. June Finch to allow access inside the crashed Kryptonian ship and importation of a xenomaterial, capable of weakening Kryptonian physiology. The two main characters view each other on opposite lenses. Batman sees Superman as a threat who must be eliminated, while Superman views Batman as a lawless vigilante who decides unilaterally who lives or dies. Batman is the embodiment of fear, while Superman is the personification of hope.Ben Affleck nails the grumpy attitude of the character in the comic book miniseries The Dark Knight Returns, including the physicality. Unlike previous versions, this Batman is a hulking behemoth who prefers to overpower foes instead of using agility. Similar to the Burton films, Batman is willing to kill and does so in significant numbers. Taking liberties and deviations can often lead to poor characterization, but not in this. His willingness to kill is given proper motivation, thus as executed in the story Batman's characterization works. Henry Cavill is much improved from his first outing as Superman in Man of Steel. None of the forced emotions and bad delivery of lines such as 'You're a monster Zod...' Cavill convincingly plays the inner conflict of doing good, while getting flacked. Differentiating himself from Christopher Reeve, this Superman doesn't have the traditional boy scout persona commonly found in the comics and is more contemplative, even brooding. In the theatrical cut, Cavill looks bad because a majority of the 30-min deleted scenes were his as Clark Kent doing investigative journalistic work about Batman's recent violent outings. Reinserting those scenes in the Ultimate Edition gives the character more humanity, thus better overall acting. Amy Adams, like Cavill, is given more material in the Ultimate Edition. The biggest and most criticized acting decision is of Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. Fans expect Luthor to be gentlemanly and smooth, not manic. Eisenberg is another casualty of the theatrical cut that makes his performance and role look bad. Luthor has additional scenes in the Ultimate Edition that give him proper motivation, unlike in the theatrical cut where he comes off truly insane. The additional 30-minutes gives everyone more breathing room that enhances the acting.As a political thriller, Batman v Superman digs deep into deconstructing the characters to their basics. Driven by the death of his parents, Bruce Wayne crusades as Batman to fight crime, a motivation consistently referenced throughout the film. 20 years as Batman, accompanied by the death of Robin, drags Bruce Wayne to mental lows, losing his humanity and empathy, further motivated by a sense of hopelessness and failure. Events unfold that reveals his detective work was a ruse to locate Kryptonite, a xenomineral capable of killing Superman. Unlike Bruce Wayne, Clark Kent does not have the same family tragedy and still has his mother to lean on. A figure with god-like powers, Superman ushers in political debates as to the necessity of his existence and whether he should be confined to government-sanctioned actions. Someone with such powers will court controversy, regardless of intentions. Superman is also shown to be more human and grounded than Batman. Lex Luthor manipulates both characters' inherent antagonism by blowing up Capitol Hill, abducting Martha Kent, building hatred for Superman through affected Wayne employees and importing Kryptonite which he intended for Batman to use against Superman. After an epic match, and before he could kill Superman, Batman finds his lost humanity when Superman says his mother's name, the same name of Batman's mother Martha Wayne. Two formerly opposite characters cast their differences to fight a common threat. Batman v Superman also introduces Wonder Woman, played by Gal Gadot, and the concept of metahumans.Superhero films are big on spectacle and action. Snyder delivers the best fighting sequences in the genre. The Batman and Superman fight is brutal. Superman isn't depowered to make him a fair adversary. Batman is a tank, taking on armed goons singlehandedly. Wonder Woman is electric, taking center stage in the final fight against Doomsday. Doomsday is a Frankenstein monster with nearly limitless powers. The presentation of each hero and villain does justice to the characters. Batman v Superman is criticized for its bleak and dour tone, but for the film's subject material it is the appropriate direction. Even if the colors are greatly saturated, the film remains a beauty to look at. The cinematography, visual effects, production design, and score are all fantastic. Snyder is at the top of his artistic career.A genuine critic that can be leveled against this film is it undoes Superman's death by implying he may be alive. Building all that drama only to discard the payoff is not a good cliffhanger. Elements of his boy scout persona should have been presented in the beginning and then gradually becoming more emotionally distant. Superman is the beacon of hope and comics' greatest superhero, and despite the film's strengths narratively this version feels a bit distant. Overall, the film is still widely epic. Warner Bros. should be ashamed of butchering a great, elseworlds tale.9/10",9,5,8,14 October 2019

John Wick: Chapter 2," bigger action, scope, slightly improved story, and more Keanu Reeves badassery
","Building on its predecessor, John Wick: Chapter 2 expands the mythos of its titular protagonist with bigger action, scope, slightly improved story, and more Keanu Reeves badassery.Chapter 2 follows John Wick in the wake of the consequences in the original's story. The Russian Mafia Wick battled is but a member of a large group of a connected mob, with their own rules and code. Wick is once again forcibly drawn back to his previous profession when he is tasked by an influential mob boss to kill his sister.Like the original, themes of brotherhood, loyalty, greed, and power are explored. Many of the hinted aspects of the criminal underworld Wick is a part of is expanded. A larger group called High Table makes decisions every mob and bosses follow. The High Table is composed of mob bosses themselves.Wick is drawn to the task because he swore a blood oath, an unbreakable pact that must be honored. The mob boss, Santino D'Antonio, is driven by greed and greater power because his sister, Gianna D'Antonio, is a member of the High Table and he is not. Gianna commits suicide when confronted by Wick to end her life in her own terms. Before Gianna could kill herself, she poses Wick a dilemma that by killing her, a woman, wouldn't he remember the memory of his deceased wife. Wick proceeds anyway, but not before she committed suicide. Upon completing the task, to deflect any suspicion, Santino has Wick assassinated, with a hefty bounty, to no avail. Failing to assassinate Wick, Santino becomes the prey. The chase lands both Wick and Santino at New York Continental Grounds which prohibits 'business' within hotel grounds. Wick violates the oath and kills Santino, rendering him excommunicado not just in Continental but the entire criminal enterprise. The bounty on his head is doubled and becomes international, but not before Winston gave him a 1-hour head start of distance. The killing of Santino signifies Wick's full return into his old profession but as a lone wolf.Compared to its predecessor, Chapter 2 has a slight improvement in character development, but not enough to be considered emotionally fulfilling. There is a jarring tonal shift between the film's two halves wherein the first is mainly about Wick's loss and the assassination job while the second half is him on the run. The world-building is really impressive, presenting how big the criminal enterprise Wick lives in. The fight scenes are spectacular. One standout, in particular, is the hall of mirrors fight, which is inspired by Sam Mendes' Skyfall. The amount of car crashes Wick survives in this particular film shows what a legend he is. His reputation as an assassin extends beyond New York. Keanu Reeves is great once again showing some real acting chops by performing different languages, both verbal and sign. The direction is sleeker. Somehow, Chad Stahelski manages to improve Chapter 2 in spectacle and direction while remaining faithful to the original.John Wick: Chapter 2 is a very good follow-up but one where the sequel may improve upon with better writing.7/10",7,0,0,3 November 2019

It relishes in all its glorious action, but isn't enough to carry the film on an emotional level.Driven by characters who battles for survival in a barren and water-less world, Fury Road touches upon themes of loss, higher purpose, tyranny and, surprisingly, feminist message. Tom Hardy, playing the titular character, is haunted by the loss of someone who constantly appears in his imagination. Driven by guilt and or sadness, he seeks survival as the tyrannical, cult regime of Immortan Joe forces the people around him to beg for water. Charlize Theron stars as Furiosa, the leader of an escaped group of females who seek the Green Place. Nicholas Hoult plays Nux, a fanatic member of Immortan Joe who would die willingly for his cause. The characters are driven by their respective motives, each being revealed as the film progresses. However, there is too much action for the drama and character interactions to settle and majority of the best emotional moments are placed near the end leaving the rest of the film lacking much in substance.7.5/10",8,0,1,11 August 2019
