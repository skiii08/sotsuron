Ford v Ferrari," Real title: Shelby-miles vs beebe
","Disappointed Ferrari was a minor theme in the movie.
Really only Enzo.
Expected character development from both teams.Ferrari racers, car models not even mentioned.
As explained in another review, Ferrari main driver quitting, not shown.
Nothing Ferrari. Just a footnote.The difference between 7000 rpm Ford vs Ferrari 9000 (8 cyl vs 12 cyl) not even mentioned.It is not Ferrari vs Ford.It was about an American company and its directors, about its icon Shelby, about its racers.
Well just one team out of 3.Really really lacking in history and confrontation.",7,2,5,23 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," All you whiners, SW 7-8-9 are cannon now. So shut up and put up.
","Acting was superior by far.
Rey was spectacular.
Everything 2010s.
We had 2 extra origin stories.
We have top notch SW streaming in TV.The Palpatine Sith clone theory, sith revival makes the talk for decades.
Snoke, rey parents, ren guards, finn, poe, zori, babu frik, cassian, K-2SO, Saw Gerrera.What more? Mere.",10,0,5,6 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Worst 2 entries in all of Star Wars
","1. I can't believe the biggest complaint in Star Wars lore is about jaj jar in episode 1,
Really? compared against the worst acting in all 11 movies by anakin skywalker.
Unbearable, literally reading the lines.
When he fakes pain and anger I almost turn off the tv.
Was this his first acting part? He is that baaaaaaaaaaaad.
Jar jar is oscar material compared to him.2. The second worst item in all star wars anthology is anakin waiting 10 years to go back and look for his mother.
Knowing she is a slave. He blames himself for not being good enough to save her,
while the real cause was his lack of need to go and free her.
More so he being this all powerful jeeeeeeedi.
Is being a student more important than saving his mother from slavery.
He didn't care?
Bah. Really awfull.",9,0,0,22 December 2019

Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Disney spent $5 billions for this editing fiasco
","Beginning movie sequence.
Why doesn't the dreadnought move when Poe attacks?
Why it doesn't move when the bombers move in?
Just move a couple miles. 50-100.------------------------------------------------
Disney spent $4 billions for the SW series.Spent over $300 millions on the movie.Millions on promotion.Millions on martial arts and combat training.Tens of $billions on the line in future income.And they have an editing process manned by the furry porg mutts.First they should hire SW experts to verify the script and lore. There were tens of SW mistakes.
Just go to the user reviews. Basic homegarden user with phones are better than this editing staff.Examples.
Luke.........
Kylo Ren IQ was of a mutt. Doesn't compare to 70's Darth Vader, by god, 70's.
Finn Rose useless storyline.
Other wasted sub-plots.
Phasma.
Hux stooge.
Poe.
Snoke...
Boats with empty tanks.
Should I continue?
Go to user reviews for tens of horrors.And space fact checking should be 2017s, not 70's.
Bombs and laser beams dropping in space with no gravity.
Leia mary poppins space walk.
Etc.In the 70's Stanley kubrick defined space correct efects.
Even as recently as Gravity did basic checking.Guys, the movie industry is 100 years plus to be making this disaster of SW proportions fiasco.",8,1,1,27 December 2017
