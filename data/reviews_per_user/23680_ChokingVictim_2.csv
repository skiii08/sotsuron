The Blair Witch Project," Not really scary, but it stays with you...
","This was an excellent film.  The best way to describe it is eerie.  It wasn't really scary, but it just gives you that god-awful feeling in the pit of your stomach that makes you feel as if it's happening to you.  The final breakdown of Heather, in my opinion, is one of the finest scenes ever captured on film; it makes you sympathetic for these poor kids that have no idea what's happening to them.",10,1,2,31 July 1999
The Evil Dead," The one, the only, the original!!!!!!
","This is the first in a series of the BEST HORROR SERIES of time!!!!  The Evil Dead meets every single horror movie cliche known to man, a low budget , and uses exorbitant amounts of blood.  If you do decide to see it, good luck, copies are almost as hard to find as the Holy Grail...  But if you do manage to see the series, don't ask how Evil Dead 2 and Evil Dead have anything to do with each other.",10,0,1,9 August 1998
