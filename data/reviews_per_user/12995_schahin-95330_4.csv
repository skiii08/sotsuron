The Ring," Scariest horror movie
","This is still the best horror movie I have seen, even 18 years after its release. Extremely dark, great storyline, superb acting and scary as hell. I wouldn't watch this alone.",10,0,0,27 April 2020
Crash," Best movie i've seen.
",Not surprised that this film won the Oscar for the best movie of the year in 2004. I loved every scene.,10,0,0,27 April 2020
Gone Girl," Illogical, overrated but except for the ending watchable
",How could such a good movie end so badly and irrationally? The movie gives you a good and logical insight of the mind of a psychopath but the intelligent writing seems to come to an end in the last 20 or so minutes of the movie. It just turns into a complete non-sense story that I would have not expected from the writer so it left me very disappoint with this film which is why I only rate this with 5 stars.,5,0,0,27 April 2020
Midsommar," Good concept, weak execution
","How does this movie have a 7,1 stars score when all I read are 1 stars reviews? I must say I have watched this film because of its good score but left disappointed. So, does it deserve 7,1? No. Does it deserve 1? No. I guess 5/10 would be a fair review. It's an interesting concept that combines grief, the need of social belonging, our gullible society and most interestingly the form of cults. For all the cult movie fans, this might be for you. For all the horror and thriller movie fans, this isn't for you. It's way too slow paced and overly artsy to fall into the horror category. In fact, the movie could have been 20 mins shorter without having a negative effect on its creative visuals. It has some beautiful and authentically bizarre scenes but most of the time you are left wondering when the movie will start eventually which it never does btw. Although the acting of the main actress is outstanding I wouldn't recommend this movie.",5,2,3,14 April 2020
