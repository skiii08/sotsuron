E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," The Best Movie Ever Made -- EVER!!!
","I love many films.  The Godfather, Citizen Kane, Casablanca and scores of others are all masterpieces.  The French New Wave has got to be one of the greatest cinema movements ever made.  I love films that are thought-provoking and stimulate debate among those you see it with (i.e. Fight Club, Bowling for Columbine et al).But when it comes down to the bottom line, the best movie ever made is a film from my childhood -- E.T. -- The Extra-Terrestrial.  Pretty much everything in this movie is flawless.  Henry Thomas brings in a performance of a 10-year-old boy mature beyond his years.  The John Williams score is among one of his best.  Steven Spielberg was at his peak with this film. To me it all 'clicks' together.  And for me, by the time the film is over, I'm bawling like a baby when E.T. and Elliott must say goodbye at the end.There are lots of great movies out there, but for me, NOTHING can touch E.T.!",10,3,7,18 June 2003
Fight Club," One of the best films ever -- It will have you thinking long after the end credits
","Every time I watch 'Fight Club' I notice something new and exciting about it.  Few films can do this, so to me this is a remarkable feat.I truly believe this film is a generational thing.  Pretty much anyone over 40 will not like this film (my Dad just didn't know what to think when he saw this one).  Those who have grown up in this era can only appreciate it the best (right now, I'm 20 years old).There are numerous things about this movie that grab me.  The ideas that's presented about a soulless world overwhelmed by mass consumption really hits it home with me.  What's interesting is that Tyler Durden has a nonconformist stance on modern society yet at the same time, he's indoctrinating everyone about this.  In effect, he's making everyone conform to his own vision of non-conformity.This movie came out in 1999 a year where the 'twist ending' was en vogue ('Sixth Sense' previously did it) and I never saw this twist coming.  I won't reveal it here (go see the movie if you want to find out) but it amazed me.  This has you watching the movie over and over to pick up on the clues.Everything about this movie was flawless.  It speaks to me on so many different levels (some I may have yet to discover).  Go check it out for yourself.  Some love it, some hate it, but if it's made you think, then their job has been done.",10,0,1,25 June 2003
