The Hangover," A Hangover Gone Bad
","The Hangover takes place in Las Vegas when Doug Billings, played by Justin Bartha, and Tracy Garner, played by Sasha Barrese, are two days away from being married. Doug's friends, Phil Wenneck, played by Bradley Cooper, Stu Price, played by Ed Helms, and Alan Garner, played by Zach Galifianakis, thought that now is the time for a bachelor party and where else better to party then Vegas. To their misfortune, after a long night of hard partying and great times, they wake up to the worst hangover ever, find the groom missing, and at the same time have no recollection of what happened the night before. It is now up to the three of them to find Doug before his wedding just a day away. With no time to waste they begin to look for clues to help steer them towards the right direction to find Doug and in doing so find out piece by piece the crazy night that none of them could ever imagine.I believe 'The Hangover' was one of the funniest movies I have seen since 'Superbad', 'Step Brothers', and 'Pineapple Express'. I laughed from beginning to end. 'The Hangover' is a must watch in theaters. The character of Alan Garner is comical in the film. He brought a unique character to life with his funny scenes. Bradley Cooper, in the movie, is a teacher that would be awesome to have in real life. His character is what gets the group to be so much fun, by making them do all the crazy stuff with his frat boy like attitude. This movie is unquestionably one of the best comedy films of the year and a must see.Director Todd Phillips has a unique perspective of the film. He likes the way the characters portray their bad behavior and feels that this is what makes a film so funny. He doesn't really have a moral or point to the film except to make it funny and something that everyone can enjoy and have a good laugh. The director portrays the characters funny characteristics through their great personalities and funny punch lines. I feel he does an excellent job directing and keeping the film funny throughout the entire movie.",10,2,4,7 October 2009
