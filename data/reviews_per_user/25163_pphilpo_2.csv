The Ring," Not Bad at all
","As one who watches all horror movies, and there are many that are unwatchable, it was a pleasure to sit back and get involved in a mystery/ thriller. Some of the visuals managed to stay with me for days afterward, and there were some truly frightening moments in this movie. I was very pleasantly surprised.",Null,0,0,31 October 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Not bad considering it is based on a book I apparently never read.
","If you want to see a good movie, check this out.  If you want to see a faithful adaptation of Tolkien, either in action or in character's personalities, or in the spirit of the book, avoid this one like the plague.The only characters portrayed loyally to Tolkien were Gollum and Eowyn, who were excellent.Other than that, the plot matches almost nothing to the book and the depiction of Elrond goes even further downhill.  There is a limit to dramatic license.",6,0,0,19 December 2002
