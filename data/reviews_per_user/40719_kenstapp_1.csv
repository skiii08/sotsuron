Skyfall," How do you get a Bond Movie wrong? Go see Skyfall to find out!
","Agreed, this movie missed the mark....again! I just don't understand how you can screw up a Bond film, especially when you have 20+ others to go off of. This movie shouldn't even be called a Bond film...but instead, it's a Daniel Craig action film, absent the basic ingredient that has made the Bond Character an enormous franchise over the past 50 years...'An International Man of Mystery'.If you can't walk out of a Bond film saying: Every man wants to be him, and every woman want to be with him...then take the Bond label off of the movie and call it something else! This film lacks all of the traditional ingredients that make Bond, 007: It doesn't have witty one liners, it barely had any Bond theme music or sound snippets, it doesn't depict 007 as a womanizer, it doesn't have any cool Super Spy Gadgets, and it doesn't even show the cold open animated graphic of 007 walking in to the screen (through the Gun Barrel of his enemy), turning, and shooting, etc, etc...Barbara Broccoli, I once watched an interview where you noted that you're father did not want the Bond Franchise sold to any of the big studios, in fear that they would change the successful recipe that made Bond such a successful over the past 50 years. Well...at this stage, after producing 3 Bond films in a row that resemble all of the other 'Spy Want-a-be' movies out there, you might as well...because they couldn't possibly mess it up any more than you already have. I could go on and on, but this review is boring me almost as much as the movie did.1 Star! ...and that's being generous.",1,98,182,8 November 2012
