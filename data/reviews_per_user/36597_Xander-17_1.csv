The Blair Witch Project," Creepy, intense, and simply horrifying
","I saw the Blair Witch Project and I was not let down one bit.  It starts out very nicely and cheerfully almost.  The three film-makers seem to be having a great time.  Then things turn for the worst...This movie was one of the most original and creative movies I have ever seen.  The way the movie is shot makes you feel like you are right there in the woods with the three students.  It's amazing to watch as the three characters start to lose their minds and hope of survival as someone or something begins to stalk them in the woods.  You will have nightmares for nights after you see this one! The ending five minutes are some of the most horrifying and intense minutes captured on film that I have ever seen.  If you want to be scared or just want to watch a brilliant film, then go see The Blair Witch Project!!!!",9,1,2,21 July 1999
