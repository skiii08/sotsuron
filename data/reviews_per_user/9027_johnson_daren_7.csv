Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Why is all the rum gone?
","Pirates of the Caribbean is a terrific franchise as is the completely unsurpassable Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Having decided that my love of the other movies was sufficient to carry me through to also watching 'On Stranger Tides' at the cinema last night, I feel short-changed.I suppose most of the familiar ingredients were there: Captain Jack (Brilliant â€“ though very notably sober/sane); Mr Gibbs (fine support though clearly 'grease to the cogs' of this film), Barbossa (lost to an ocean of very unsettling English'pirate'esque accent/appearance, that I truly hated throughout), the gorgeous girl (by the end of the film, even I would have used the bullet), the dastardly villain (barely believable, but let's not dwell on it) cameo appearances, escape antics, quippy remarks and a very light sprinkling of supernatural mystery. However, and to quote and earlier Captain Jack himself, 'Why is all the Rum gone?' Despite everything, and with a certain amount of personal hoping that the film might deliver by the end, it came up lacking. Looking back at it, in the cold light of morning (mourning perhaps) it felt like a penguin featurette from Madagascar. E.g. a perfectly watchable distraction of familiar friends and places, but ultimately a peripheral story of little significance.Sorry Disney, we love Captain Jack and all his friends dearly, we want to see more of them and the are certainly worthy of continued investment, but you must do better!",5,1,7,19 May 2011
Pan's Labyrinth," Fiendishly good!
","Fiendishly dark, menacingly brutal, and wonderfully elaborate. This film never really lets you relax; instead it grips you firmly, yet unsettlingly, on the edge of your seat and compels you to watch. Through the eyes of war and the eyes of a child this masterpiece weaves its lingering spell of legend, creatures and magic. Superbly acted the story quickly draws you in; from the beautiful fantasy and richness of the underworld to the graphic nightmare and gritty reality of war, every frame is utterly captivating. A haunting soundtrack, which includes the eerie lullaby from Mercedes, complements the mood and atmosphere of the film wonderfully. A true work of genius and simply the best film I have seen all year.",10,7,14,5 December 2006
Quantum of Solace," Quantum of Plot?
","Well I have just returned from the cinema and I am utterly and completely stunned. I am a life-long fan of Bond movies having grown up with them (now 36 years old) and I'll be the first to admit there have been some corkers along the way. However there was always enough class, substance or at the very least tongue-in-cheek to get you through them all.When I first saw Casino Royale I did not like it but I thought OK, we're trying something new: a new actor; trying to make Bond more gritty and get back to his roots. In time I'm came to accept it and even started to look forward to the next instalment to see how Bond will have grown in style, sophistication, experience, etc.Sadly this film never fails to disappoint and has a near sub-atomically thin plot, which is perhaps the basis for the 'Quantum' portion of the title: The opening sequence was OK, again not a typical Bond but holding onto the new-gritty Bond. This then led into the worst theme music/titles of any bond I've ever heard/seen. Following the 'escape' this film then just descended into less and less point or interest to anyone. Yes there was OK action but action without plot, character development or for what I could see any real purpose. What the hell was that all about? The fact that I care less about the sinister organisation which MI6 knew nothing about, than waking up the people around me who fell ASLEEP in the cinema (I kid you not!) should be a clue here guys! In short this is the worst Bond movie I have ever ever seen and undoubtedly the worst movie I have seen all year (and I have sat through 60+ this year so far). This has without a doubt finally killed Bond off for me and I will not be watching another one of these at the cinema. Either come up with something worthy of Bond's lineage and with something the audience can connect with and care about or Mr Bond it's time to die.",1,20,41,2 November 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," The rum is back!
","I have seen several reviews of this film and these, along with my past experience of On Stranger Tides, made me seriously sceptical about going to watch this movie. I am so pleased that I did! Everything that On Stranger Tides wasn't, Dead Mean Tell No Tales is. Fantastic job, getting us back to the characters we know and love. Thoroughly enjoyable for the entire family. Jack and the rum are certainly back in the way that they were always meant to be.",10,6,16,26 May 2017
Arrival," A fine Sci-fi effort that nearly got there
","I will say at the outset that this was an interesting distraction, very watchable even if, for me and those who watched it with me, it felt quite slow paced and left too much unanswered. All actors/actresses do a sterling job and visuals/sound both focuses and mostly holds attention; even with the deliberate scene jumps which can be somewhat irritating. The attempt at narrating the various aspects of humanity and their struggle with this scenario is also well appreciated. So all in all I was building to a mighty 'well done'. However the ultimate outcome for sci-fi fans was a, frankly insulting, slap in the chops with a causal loop. Thus the geeks of the group felt doubly let down. Firstly by the paradox and secondly as they are also now left to deal with the non-geeks who are in a state of complete bewilderment at the entire movie.",5,6,17,31 October 2016
X-Men: First Class," Outstandingly First Class
","OK here we are then: a superb trilogy under our belt, an excellent Wolverine prequel. What are the odds that the latest X-Men movie can maintain the excitement, enthralment and style we've grown to love? Absolutely no question - bang on the money! (Take notes Disney - PoC4.)First Class really, really is just that. An epic background story to explain the characters we know and define some new ones we want to know more. Extremely well-acted (even though the younger selves had HUGE boots to fill re Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellan) - simply brilliant. I CANNOT wait for the DVD or the next (hopefully also) brilliant movie, so I'll be using my telepathic powers to convince some younger family members that they should really go and watch this movie and, OK then, if I have to go with them (tut) so be it!",10,4,9,1 June 2011
The Greatest Showman," Astonishingly perfect - a masterpiece of music, cinema, and of inspiration!
","As a heavy cinema-goer, I pride myself in being able to sort the chaff from the wheat from a movie trailer. This one stands out, oozing quality, and I can honestly say this is what the movie delivers throughout every single moment. A stunning piece of work, which operates on multiple levels to narrate messages of diversity, adversity, life, joy and inspiration. I have never before watched any movie which, by its end, I haven't thought 'I just wished they had/hadn't...'. This one, however, is so astonishingly perfect - it is simply a masterpiece!",10,0,2,26 January 2018
