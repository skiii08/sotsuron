Hereditary," Don't waste your time or money. Terrible.
",I haven't seen anything so utterly pointless or terrible in a long time! Waiting for something to happen for most of the movie. Then everything happened in the last 10 minutes. So much wasted potential - this movie could have been so much better. Very disappointed. Wish I could get my money back.,1,4,8,24 June 2018
