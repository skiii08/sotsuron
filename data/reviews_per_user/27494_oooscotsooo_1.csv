Despicable Me 2," Excellent!!!
","Was looking forward to this film, following the first one, and wasn't disappointed, Steve Carrell again gives another excellent performance as Gru.The Minions again make this film so enjoyable for the kids, my son watches the first one everyday now, mainly due to a major fast food chain providing toys with their kids meals.The character Lucy has been introduced from the first film, and is a great addition, and I'm sure will feature in the next sequel.The film is funny from start to finish, loved it!!Can't wait for Despicable Me 3.",9,0,0,2 August 2013
