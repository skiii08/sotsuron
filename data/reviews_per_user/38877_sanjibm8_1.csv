Source Code," It's a great entertaining movie
","Source code is one of the best entertaining sci-fi thrillers i have seen so far.It's concept is kinda innovative and impressive also.Loved the film.Though the main idea behind this technology may be confusing but it's welcome all the way. After all we all love new technology and new concepts in movie making.Lead actors of this movie play as per the role demanded.Direction is also great.The shooting places are gorgeous.The most important thing is,this movie never gets slowed down anywhere.It keeps it's pace throughout.It would have been better if the confusing technology which was shown here was explained more clearly.But it won't be a problem to enjoy this masterpiece at all.It's that kind of movie which you will like to watch again and again and still the beauty of this flick remains the same.Giving it 10 out of 10.",10,3,6,30 January 2014
