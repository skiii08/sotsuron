The Blair Witch Project," Heart pounding,cold sweat,total thiller of a movie.
","Will I went into the movie not really knowing what to think.  If it was going to be another Holloween or Jason but I was in for a shock. This has to be in the top three of my movie list. From start to finish I was hooked and I was so glad I got my popcorn and coke before it started. It is not often a movie like this comes out. It was very real, SCARY, and... well let's just say by the end I was choking on my heart. My rank is 4 1/2 stars. I beg you don't miss it, if you do anything this summer see this.",Null,0,0,8 August 1999
