Angels & Demons," It is very interesting
","Hello! I know English a little but I will try to express the opinion. I live in Moscow and I was glad to release of this film. I like to look and read about such plots and stories.. The film has been shown in Russia recently. I did not look yet. I wish to look it very much. But Den Brown's book I have read the some years ago! Though in the book basically the point of view of the author is shown only, its many remarks its her opinion only which is not proved. However, the book is very interesting also I hope a film will be not worse. Da Vinci Code I was disappointed in the film. But this book is remarkable. Though the Catholic church is not happy with an exit of this book and she can be understood. That is described in the book contradicts church laws. Much in the book is own opinion of the author only, but it is useful to esteem, it develops.Very informative and interesting, also it is easily read! I hope to you it will be pleasant! From Russia with love!))",Null,2,3,24 May 2009
