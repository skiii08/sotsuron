The Perks of Being a Wallflower," The best high school film so far!
","The perks of being a wallflower is a very great movie! it displays many of the problems thats among very many teenagers, but in a good way.The movie follows the high school freshman Charlie and his journey trough freshman year. The movie is about the great ups and the low downs about being in high school.The cast of this movie i incredible ever actor is so in to their character and it is a perfect match. This shows that it is a life for Emma Watson outside Hogwarts.The movie adaptation was maybe a little week from the book, some scenes that i thought was important was missing, but all in all this is one of my favorite movies. So i would call this the best high school movie so far.",9,0,0,17 March 2014
