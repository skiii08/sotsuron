","I honestly cannot believe the disappointment after watching this. I am literally telling anyone who will listen - don't do it, it's a waste of time. It's a slow starter which is unnecessarily dragged out. I honestly laughed more than I was scared which is not what you want from a highly anticipated horror film. I was honestly so let down by the heavy CGI and awful jump scares (of which there are very few). I was expecting to walk out frozen solid with fear, instead I was fighting the urge to fall asleep. The only good thing was the acting from the young cast, I really do think these kids will go places and gave it 100%.",3,25,52,9 September 2017
