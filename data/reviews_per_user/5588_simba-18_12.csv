The Hangover," Just awful all around
","This was on one of the movie channels last night so I attempted to watch it. What I saw of it reminded me of why I never watch modern movies anymore. The quality looked like a television commercial. Just garbage photography and horrible dialog and, most importantly, NOT FUNNY!",1,3,7,26 March 2020
The Color of Money," Disappointing
","I caught this on cable the other night and stuck with it only because there were no commercials.  The movie starts out interestingly enough, but slowly but surely lost me.  Maybe you have to be an afficianado (sp?) of pool to 'get' this, I don't know.  Watching this made me want to go out and buy 'Slapshot' on DVD.  Paul Newman is always easy to watch, but this one was a stinker.  I think I will buy Slapshot-a GOOD Paul Newman movie.",Null,0,2,1 September 2003
American Beauty," Overrated
",This movie is a piece  of trash and the academy has some explaining to do. It was not worthy of a Best Picture Oscar not even a nomination.  There ought to be an investigation as to why the Sixth Sense did not win. All the characters in it are either perverted or seriously flawed in some way except for the daughter of Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning.  Benning plays the shrill and almost incoherent wife stuck in an unhappy marriage. Kevin Spacey plays the unhappy husband and father who has the hots for his daughter's friend.  That's about it.   It gives you the feeling of being a voyeur and that is the only thing I can get out of this one.,1,10,25,24 July 2000
The Patriot," Not a total waste of time, just not great.
","Although this one isn't 'Braveheart', one of the greatest war epics ever put on screen, I can't help but feel that part of 'Braveheart' was ripped off in 'The Patriot'.  How Ben Martin was pacifistic at the beginning of the story and was driven by revenge to join the fight.  It is an entertaining enough movie and had some surprising twists in the plot.  I also felt that Mel Gibson looked bored in the role.  On the whole, I would recommend this.  Mel is fun to watch in anything he does.  I like his honesty.  I'll give this 8 out of 10 stars.",8,0,2,14 December 2000
Gone with the Wind," A Cinematic Feast
","Set in the Civil War 'Gone WIth The WInd' tells the story of beautiful Scarlett O'Hara. She's manipulative but you feel sympathetic for her which speaks for Vivien Leigh's outstanding performance. Scarlett marries three times. One time for revenge to hurt her one true love, Ashley. Who never loves her, but kind of keeps her hanging, always talking to Scarlett about 'honor' being the reason why he cannot give himself to her. So he was not totally innocent in the romantic debacle between the two.Her second marriage is for money and convenience. Third time to Rhett Butler. Clark Gable is another one of Scarlett's 'victims', the one man who truly loved Scarlett, but Scarletts scheming to win Ashley finally kills the love he had for Scarlett.The final quarter of the movie is one awful tragedy after another for Scarlett.With each viewing, I grow to love this movie more. The most unforgettable scene is where Scarlett is walking through town where the wounded/dead soldiers are laying and the camera pans out further and further until you see the rebel flag waving and to me it is the defining scene of this film. The cinematography is beautiful and the special effects can rival the effects we have today. A cinematic feast. Do not miss this.",10,5,8,22 February 2005
Amadeus," Great story but a tragic look at society's treatment of true genius.
","I love this movie and watch it every few months.  It is awesome and must be viewed with surround sound for the full effect.The story is compelling in the way it is told from Salieri's point of view. Salieri is an adequate composer in Vienna held in high position in the court of Emporer Joseph(Jeffrey Jones). But when Mozart arrives from Salzburg, suddenly Salieri feels threatened. Right away Salieri's image of what Mozart might be like is blown- seeing him 'rolling on the floor' playing a childlike sex game with his future wife, Constanze. Mozart inadvertently insults Salieri at a meeting with the emperor and all the court composers so from that point on  Salieri is driven to revenge by jealousy and envy of his talent, which he hails, 'music already finished in his head, as if he were taking dictation.  Then I knew, this was no performing monkey, this was the voice of God, coming through this infantile buffoon of a man'.  (These quotes are not exactly verbatim, but you get the jist of it). This a well spent 158 minutes.  Although this is not an actual biography on Mozart, which was not the intention of Peter Schaffer or Milos Forman. The point that I derived from this film is the fact that society never appreciates true genius while they are in the present.  Mediocrity will be hailed in the present, but the true genius will be shunned (and you can see that fact true to this day).  That point is driven home as 'Amadeus' comes to a close when you see Salieri being wheeled into the mental hospital claiming to be the patron saint of mediocrity while in the background, you hear Mozart's giggle, having the last laugh at all his rivals, in that his music will live on forever. I feel that not only did F. Murray Abraham deserve the Best Actor Award by the Academy,  I wish that Tom Hulce could have gotten it also.  It should have been impossible to exclude one, both performances played off each other perfectly.",10,2,4,30 September 1999
Jerry Maguire," Really Sucks
",This movie is just another chick flick.  They just threw in a sports theme to get the girlfriends to drag the poor men to this  piece of trash. Waste of celluloid.  Don't bother to see this one.  Tom Cruise is so full of himself.  The little boy acts like a brat for the effect of everyone saying 'how cute'.This made me want to barf.  The scene at the end is so nauseating. What corny garbage.  Get a puke bag instead of popcorn.,1,18,47,30 September 1999
Jaws," Robert Shaw stole this movie
","Without question, Robert Shaw's character of Quint was by far the most interesting. My only criticism is that he should have had more time on camera. This movie doesn't really stand up today, however, Shaw's portrayal of Quint is always fascinating to watch.  It's a shame Hollywood lost one it's greatest performers.",4,4,24,25 April 2001
The Lion King," Greatest Disney film ever. They should have quit after this one.
","Anyone who doesn't love this movie has no heart and must be dead inside. Maybe they didn't get to see this one on the big screen and only saw the video version.  'Lion King' had me mesmerized from the opening, with the sun coming up over the savanna.  I saw this the day it opened and in the theater, at the end, people stood up and cheered!!  This movie deserves theatrical re-release.  Disney,  ARE YOU LISTENING???  Do yourselves a favor and put this back where it belongs, on the big screen.",10,0,1,20 July 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," Morgan Freeman is one of the greatest actors of all time.
","Especially in this film.  He can break your heart or make you laugh,  and that's before he speaks.  He will have you cheering at the end when 'Red' gets  in front of the parole board.  I watched this only because someone told me it was great.  It didn't look like a movie I'd like.  Prison dramas aren't generally my thing.  This one is different.  The first half is brutal and at times difficult to watch, but it helps set the story in motion.  You really feel you are there with Andy and Red.  One of my favorite scenes is when the prisoners are on the roof of the prison drinking beer.  You have to see it to understand what I mean.  There isn't enough adjectives to describe this film I can only say that this one is definitely a must see. This one is right up there with 'Amadeus' as my two favorite movies of all time.  Please do not miss it.",10,0,0,4 October 1999
The Sixth Sense," America needs more movies like this........
","Hollywood needs to make more movies like this.  This one has everything you need and gives you a film you'd be proud to take your mother to.  There's no sex scenes, no needless violence, any violence in it is part of the story. The Sixth Sense is one movie that could have been made in the 1940's.  That is how good it is.  On first viewing I admit, I was a little bored on the seemingly slow pace, but in the end you find out why some of the characters behaved oddly and it all comes together and on a second viewing you can truly appreciate the need for the pace of it.  Do not miss this one, you will not be able to forget it.  Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment are fantastic and Olivia Williams as Willis' wife, I especially loved the performance of Toni Collette as Cole's mother.  I hope to see more of her. I felt for her and completely believed the character.  M. Night Shamalan should be proud, and please, Hollywood, send him and the whole crew more screenplays and scripts. Thank you to all those responsible for this film.  A job well done.",10,0,0,26 May 2000
Braveheart," Great movie. One which everyone should see....
","Great war epic.  The best scene is where the Scottish clansmen are all lined up watching the British gather their troops and being overwhelmed at the opposition.  All ready to turn tail and run, William Wallace rides up on his horse and gives an awesome speech about freedom:(I'll try to get this right, forgive me if I don't)... Fight and you may die.  Run and you will live, at least a while. And many years from now dying in your bed, would you give one chance, just one chance to tell the British- You may take our lives...but you'll never take our FREEDOM!!!!!!!!!! Says it all right there, never mind about historical inaccuracies.  That is the spirit of Wallace!!!!",10,1,4,6 February 2001
