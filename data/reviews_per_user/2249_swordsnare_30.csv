Alien 3," Haven't seen this in 25+ years...
","Wow, It's been a longtime since I've seen this. Probably viewed it on VHS even. The Alien itself is a combination of practical effects and looks like a first draft render of CGI. Very clunky in execution both in story and effects. Admittedly I rewatched the theatrical release. Re-viewing in HD didn't help the cause either. Wonder whether 2003 rework has any bearing on this?Rating reflects the goodwill generated from the original source movies and cast.",5,1,1,7 December 2019
Hereditary," An exercise building in tension.
","The sound design, acting and production design was so well executed. The character and story development was so well paced to create an general uneasiness and tension. Unfortunately, I felt the climax to the film was a little deflating and ruined all the expectations of something grander.",6,0,1,17 July 2018
A Star Is Born," Successful Directorial Debut.
","It's pretty difficult to watch this film from an objective standpoint with the amount praise surrounding it. Gaga's performance was believable showing sides of vulnerability, which was quite endearing. Cooper also jungled the directorial and acting roles quite well.Having no knowledge of the previous versions, I found this to be a little unevenly paced though. The fast paced rise of Gaga's career and the development of their relationship happened seemed a little rushed. Then to have a montage of shots thereafter, felt a bit like a musical video clip. Perhaps this was intentionally done, to emulate the elation of an initial relationship; and ebbs and flows that go along with it thereafter?On the whole, I can see why many would love this film and the soundtrack will have many a sale as a result. This undeniably a success for Bradley Cooper (& Lady Gaga), despite any wavering opinions.",8,1,3,15 January 2019
Captain Marvel," Haters gonna Hate.
","Some reviewers have some delicate sensibilities. It's a just a Marvel film, not a cinematic masterpiece. If you held up the same overcritical views to any of the other MCU films, they would be just as flawed. I've found other films less entertaining. like Thor Dark World (DNF).For the most part, I enjoyed the 90's soundtrack and as for Brie Larson, I quite like her, stemming from her days on 'United States of Tara'. It doesn't spoil Endgame as some would have you believe. It's a typical Marvel film with all the formulaic troupes thereof. e.g. nostalgic soundtrack, cgi action, quips, Nick Fury, etc.",7,3,6,25 August 2019
Knives Out," Classic 'Who Done it'.
","A retro murder mystery with all the tropes you would expect. All the characters felt deliberately antagonist to help the narrative. I found it enjoyable, if not a little predictable from my perspective. Am glad I didn't read the overly-glowing reviews about this, as my expectations would have been higher. It's a bit of light hearted fun.",7,2,3,6 January 2020
Aquaman," He's the Aquaman of the Muppet Babies.
","Too bloated in runtime, too much CGI filling up the screen and too generic/derivative of many other (super)hero films.Was interesting how Momoa was going to go, considering the original source material; being that Aquaman is usually portrayed as such clean-cut blonde haired type. But glad they gave the character 'edge' considering this.Probably one of the better DC films, just wish studios would keep films to a 2 hour runtime and lose some of the unnecessary filler for a predictable ending.",6,1,2,7 September 2019
Deadpool 2," Same same, but larger budget.
","Whoa...Polar extremes with most of the ratings/reviews here?! Expectations need to be dialled back a notch, it's a sequel??!!! It's never going to be as 'good'. To be honest, the first act was never a stunning masterpiece. Very entertaining, yes. I found this much the same, just on a bigger budget. Deadpool has been overhyped since the success of the first one. It still enjoyed it, even though some of the jokes feel a little flat.",7,1,1,10 June 2018
Once," Beautiful, Bittersweet & Unpretentious
","Based around a soundtrack of original music with Irish singer/songwriter Glen Hansard (from The Frames) and Markéta Irglová in this unpretentious independent low budget ($150K) film.Came across this film a few years after it's release and apparently it's box office success. My main drawcard for myself was the music, only to find that the story is touching, real and honest.",9,3,4,28 October 2019
Suicide Squad," Suicide Dud?
","The screenplay and plot wasn't much to speak of. The 'action' in the second act felt very much like it was filmed on a studio street set at Universal Studios. Jared Leto's method acting style didn't pay off as his portrayal of the Joker. If it wasn't for the charismatic Will Smith and Margot Robbie, it would be a hard pass for me. It's probably the only redeemable things about this film. Can see why they green lit a Harley Quinn based film in Birds of Prey.",5,1,2,4 November 2019
Lost in Translation," Beautiful Timeless Indie Film
","A film about isolation, loneliness, romance and unrequited love. Not for everyone due to its quietness, minimalism and sparse narrative. This is an on-going theme and style of Sofia Coppola. It doesn't follow the usual Hollywood conventions for a romantic style film. There's is some comic relief due to typical Bill Murray's dry humour. I love the combination of the two cultures being based in a hotel in Tokyo.",9,6,7,23 December 2019
Interstellar," Visually stunning endeavour but...
","An admiration of Nolan's beautiful practical effects over computer generated is commendable.Am a fan of most of his work, but this failed to hit home for me. The seemingly arduous runtime accompanied by Han Zimmer's tense score drowning out the dialogue at times; with McConaughey portraying (a somewhat?) plausible scientist, made this quite vexing to view.Again, this a visually stunning film, which makes up for most of this but fails to connect with myself personally. Many of the concepts and theories are of interest, but they are executed with an air of pretension that can't be avoided.",6,1,3,20 September 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Impossible To Match Expectations.
","J.J. Abrams tries his best at concluding one of the biggest franchises. It's well made and makes some safe choices in trying to service the original trilogy fan base. Personally was not a fan of 'The Last Jedi' so I thought the writers redeemed this trilogy from distancing themselves from Rian Johnson's work.It would be impossible to please everybody with the amount expectations surrounding this particular fanbase. I share the nostalgia from the original trilogy but not-so much, the prequels.My only wish is that J.J. Abrams did 'The Last Jedi' so that continuity would exist throughout this trilogy. I quite enjoyed this for the most part, despite the constructive criticism above.",7,12,22,2 January 2020
Bird Box," A reasonable offering by Netflix
","Being a Netflix production, I did not have high expectations due to their track record for feature films. Luckily, I enjoyed it for the most part. I have read other reviews comparing it to 'The Quiet Place' with similarities being that of the sensory, don't make a sound; don't look at anything.Budgetary wise they are similar too, $17 million and $19.8 million for 'Bird Box'. I think the main difference would be in the casting, score, director, etc. Some familiar names were in the cast other than lead, Sandra Bullock. John Malkovich, Sarah Paulson, etc.Comparsions aside, I enjoyed the simple storytelling in contrast with the ambiguious nature of the narrative. Not mind blowing, but watchable nevertheless.",7,1,3,1 January 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Enjoyable Marvel film, but...
","Saying this is the best movie ever is the equivalent of only watching the season finale of a series without having any context and saying it's the best series ever?! It is entertaining and awe inspiring how they handled the huge cast ensemble, but as a standalone film it is rather lacking. Great if you love the MCU, but it rather bloated in runtime and typically sentimental. Great if you want 'checkout' for a few hours and enjoy some of the action sequences and the trademark quips expected from this production house.",7,2,7,28 April 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Nostalgic Tarantino
","The pacing and somewhat sparse use of dialogue at times in this film was reminiscent of Tarantino's earlier work, like Jackie Brown. Brimming with the typical nostalgia troupes and Easter eggs that would expect of this director. The high voltage glowing neon sign relics are something to behold in itself. As it has been highlighted, it's not for everyone, but it does make one think even if it was not as expected. I myself am intending to go for another viewing in the cinemas soon enough to fully gauge the narrative that has been created.",8,10,17,24 August 2019
A Quiet Place," Watch without any preconceived notions.
","When viewing this at the cinema at the start of 2018, the audience's response alone made this endeavour worthwhile. The tone is set by the character's noise restrictions to the movie's premise and the muffled audience reactions in-turn to any highlight throughout.An original tension-grabbing film that is not justified in dismissing it as simply 'boring' or 'stupid'. Granted it has it's flaws, but I found the 1hr 30min runtime a refreshing change to the usual 2 hour standard these days.",8,1,1,1 January 2019
1917," Successful Cinematic Experiment
","Not really a fan of the war genre , but this is a film that is difficult to dismiss easily. Its seemingly one-shot cinematography is masterful how it captures a diverse landscape throughout the runtime. The narrative, based on Mendes' Grandfathers stories, balanced the right amount of tension in amongst the futility of war. Personally, I believe this experiment is more of a success than not.",8,1,4,26 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Rian Johnson doesn't get Star Wars.
","After J.J. Abrams had written drafts for both Episode 8 & 9, Rian Johnson opposes this and decides to ruin any character or story development created by 'The Force Awakens.' I attempted to watch this again just recently after watching 'The Rise of Skywalker' in the hope that memory didn't serve me well. But alas, it was as equally as frustrating to view as my initial cinema viewing.The 'somewhat generous' rating reflects all the participants from the Episode 7, who endured this and for the original intent for this Star Wars trilogy.",4,10,18,7 January 2020
Mission: Impossible II," Postcards from Australia
",Felt like this was for the benefit of his then wife's (Nicole Kidman) home country. Utilizing many an Australian actor and the cinematography was like a tourism advert. Watchable just lacked the same style and momentum of other films in the franchise.,6,2,2,17 November 2019
Mission: Impossible," You've never seen me very upset.
",The movie and that scene in particular that spawned many a parody and imitation. Love or hate Tom Cruise you have to admire his tenacity when it comes to this original in the franchise.,7,3,4,17 November 2019
Joker," Great Alternate Origin Story
","As one of the better known comic book character villains, this film makes for an interesting alternate of an origin story compared to the multitudes of others about the Joker. Phoenix commits to the role playing a realistic mentally ill/traumatized socially isolated character. Inevitably the conclusion is known from the start, ergo becoming the Joker, but the journey was interesting nevertheless.",8,1,1,10 October 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," Eight Emily Blunt's Pushups
","Remember seeing this at the cinemas on the expectation that it was not going to enjoy it. Luckily, I was happy to be disproved of this. I mean who doesn't want to see Tom Cruise killed numerous times in this Groundhog Day-esque premise? Flawed but it doesn't really matter.",8,2,2,13 October 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," 'We can do better, we will'
","Just not with this movie. With a 3 hour and 3 minute runtime, it is way too bloated to simply enjoy on face value. There are way too many a dream, back story and journalism sequences, which takes up over an hour to actually get to Batman V Superman.On a positive note, the introduction of Wonder Woman was worthwhile and probably the most likeable aspect of this film. Some of the action sequences were actually well orchestrated, just to be overshadowed by the aforementioned. If they only trimmed down the film and maybe tried not to introduce too many storylines into the edit, it may have made for a more engaging and streamlined film.",4,3,6,2 March 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Big fan of Taika Waititi
","Well deserved 'Best adapted screenplay' Oscar. Originally intended to be a drama, the adaptation into a comedy certainly makes light of the controversial subject matter. Fox Searchlight's insistence that Taika himself play the imaginary friend as Hitler also offsets this.Taika Waititi makes films that are uniquely his with his own brand of humour. Some people may not identify with (NZ) dry sense of humour though. It is certainly well deserved after writing this back in 2012. Credit to all actors in this film also, especially the children actors.",8,6,11,11 February 2020
Lucy," Luc Besson's 'Lucy'.
","I enjoyed this for the most-part. The momentum in combination with the 90 minute runtime, kept myself entertained for the entirety. It's far from perfect, but it's entertaining. Then again I didn't labour over the science to over complicate the overall enjoyment. The climax is probably the most contentious and unfavourable issue, but I appreciate the intent of Luc Besson's vision.Note: It's probably best to ignore the super low-scoring trolls, who create accounts to downvote and spread negativity. If you don't have some constructive criticism, don't say anything at all. Any 'Not helpful' downvotes on this review are probably by the aforementioned.",7,13,17,22 March 2020
A Night at the Roxbury," I was like EMILIO!
","It's ridiculous, but it doesn't matter. I have watched this 90's nostalgic classic numerous times. Even though this was released in 1998, it felt like was it was from earlier in the 90's when Haddaway's 'What is Love?' was actual playing in the clubs. I still quote lines from this movie to this day, obviously.",7,2,2,30 December 2019
The Purge," Look who's Purging now...
","Interesting original premise that ultimately loses its edge by resorting to cliched predictable tropes. Was hoping there was more to it, from the litany of subsequent sequels and a tv series, but alas I was left wanting.",6,1,1,7 December 2019
Life," Expect the Expected?
","Not such an original premise of a sci-fi film, but it seems to tick along ok. The cast and production values are quite good. It's a reasonable viewing mind you, but the climax is more inevitable rather than a twist.",6,4,5,10 November 2019
Cube," Cult Classic
","As Vincenzo Natali's directorial debut & co-writer of this low budget film ($350,000); it is based around an original concept surrounding cube-shaped rooms. I originally watched this at the cinemas during it's original release in the 90's and viewed this again recently to find this holds up reasonably well. The acting is a little over the top at times, but this is compensated by the pure originality of this cult classic.",8,2,3,5 October 2019
Green Book," Thank goodness I saw this before the Oscars.
","Glad I viewed this before it won 'Best Picture', and the cynics skewed my perception of this film as they felt another film was more deserving of the award. I don't put much stock in the Oscars and I for one enjoyed the film based on true events.",8,2,4,3 March 2019
