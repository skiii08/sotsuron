The Incredible Hulk," The best Marvel movie yet
","Although my personal bias as a Hulk fan will probably sway my opinion on that.5 years ago I watched Ang Lee's Hulk. I really liked it and couldn't understand why everyone was hating on it. Specifically comic book fans. The more I watched it though the more I started seeing pacing problems with the movie. Three years after I watched the movie I went and got every single Hulk comic I could find. I was in for a shock. The movie wasn't faithful to the comics at all. Reading the comics turned me against the movie entirely.Needless to say I was a bit cautious whenever this one was announced. I got more optimistic whenever it was revealed that Ed Norton was being cast as Bruce. They couldn't have gotten anyone better. Eric Bana was a terrible choice. Then more casting reveals came along. For the biggest part I was happy about most of them. Except for William Hurt as General Ross. I felt one of the only things that the 03 movie got right was Sam Elliot as General Ross.Then the trailers came. I wasn't impressed with anything I seen in the trailers. I was still willing to give it a chance, but I was more pessimistic now than ever.After watching the movie though I can safely say the trailers didn't do it justice. It made me do a 180. This movie is the best piece of Hulk work outside of the comics. One of my worries was that since the 03 Hulk was a bit heavy with the story. This movie was going to go the opposite route and be all action and nothing else.While this may be somewhat the case, the action is incredible. Abomination and Hulk's blows were thunderous. There was a big chunk of character development on Bruce Banner, but certain things could have been expanded upon. Like General Ross, Dr. Samson, and Betty. Other little things could have been expanded upon as well, but Marvel was worried that this one would be too story heavy and not enough action like the 03 version. In the end the action being so great made up for the slight sacrifice in character and story development.Liv Tyler I thought did a good job as Betty. She played the innocent love role well. I know some critics are bashing her for whatever reason. I thought she was good.Now to touch on the negatives. Just two big ones that stuck out to me. As I mentioned earlier I loved Elliot as Ross in the 03 Hulk movie. Hurt was no Ross. I never could completely buy him as Ross through out the movie. I kept thinking on how great Elliot would have been if he were back in the role.The second was the Abomination's design. Being a comic book geek now Abomination's design irked me more than anything whenever I very first seen the trailer. I see lots of people say that the comic book design makes no sense, but this 'is' a movie based off of a 'comic book'. Gamma affects people in different ways in the comic. The comic design differed him from Hulk's look. Which I felt was the exact thing was wrong with him here with his design. He looked too much like a bald Hulk clone. I'm not as down on it as I was, but I still prefer the comic book version any day.I thought they went a bit overboard with the TV show homages. I don't like the show. I don't mind the cameo by Lou here and there. The TV show did help Hulk reach get more mainstream, but by that same logic why isn't all the current Batman movies homaging and using elements from the Adam West Batman show? Like I said I'll give credit where credit is due and to the movies credit it does strike a nice balance trying to please both sides, but Batman Begins has shown that you can make a superhero movie with 100 percent of it's inspiration derived from the comics and still be successful and good.The CGI was great. Way better than the 03 version. The Hulk looked great and they went through a lot of trouble creating the battles the Hulk is in. This is getting too long. Probably my longest review yet. Finally they got the Hulk right. I'm hoping there will be a sequel.",8,6,11,14 June 2008
The Others," Slow, but still entertaining
","The movie was a bit slow at times in terms of moving the plot along, but it still held its own. When the suspense scenes happened they were really good. The actors all did great. This movie has some of the best kid actors around. This also could be Nicole Kidman's best performance yet. In the end you'll be confused with alot of the movie. All you have to do is think and you should fit the pieces together.",Null,0,0,16 April 2003
Silent Hill," Very respectful of the series
","I've never been a huge fan of the Silent Hill series. I've played and beaten the first three games in the last four months. They are all good, but not my favorite game series. Initially it was seeing some of the stuff from the movie that got me into the games.Going into the movie I had an open mind. While The film is loosely based on the first game. I pretty much knew it wasn't going to be a 'direct port' of the first game. It was an adaptation of the games. There were elements taken from the first three games.Usually when adapting something There is usually always going to be something changed. It just has to be done is a respectful way. There is usually always something changed in the Stephen King movies that have been adapted from books. This movie lived up the Silent Hill series in my opinion.It had the look, feel, and authentic monsters of Silent Hill. There's even a new monster in the movie that looks like it would fit perfectly in the Silent Hill series. As an individual movie. This is one of the more 'brutal' movies I've seen in quite some time. It doesn't let up with the violence. It's a breath of fresh air this day in age amongst all of the PG-13 horrors with all the off screen kills.Yeah it didn't live up the first game completely, but it was respectful of the Silent Hill series. I feel that Gans and Avary respected the source material. That being the games. Hopefully they'll come back if there is another one.",7,2,5,23 April 2006
Resident Evil," Bad is all I can say.
","After going back and watching this a few times. It didn't really have the RE feel. The zombie make-up was bad. It didn't really follow the games at all. Making it seem more like a prequel was bad idea. I would have like to have seen some of the characters from RE 1 the game in this movie. Not the second movie.The main enemy so to speak was all wrong and Anderson should have it been a main enemy from the first game. Milla did OK with what she was given, so did Rodriguez. The ending was decent. It would have been better if the first movie didn't lead into the third game. The sequel seems to be even worse.",1,13,22,21 January 2003
Halloween," Decent, but a bit slow at times
",The first movie that paved the way for many sequels. The acting is actually good to be a bunch of teenagers. Jamie Lee Curtis acts like an adult rather than a teenager. Nick Castle plays the serial killer Michael well. Donald Pleasance shines in the movie as well. Two of the things that I didn't like about it was that it seemed slow at times. Two out of the four kills are pretty tame. While I wasn't expecting a decapitation it would have better than just strangling. Maybe the girls that Michael strangled he could have slit their throats instead.  Its a good movie with a great suspenseful ending.,8,0,1,26 September 2003
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A classic for its time
","This movie being one of my favorite movies of all time is great for 1984. Wes Craven gives the whole movie a gothic type feel. This movie is also when Freddy is his scariest. Johnny Depp plays his parts very well to be his debut movie. Heather Langenkamp is put down for most of her acting skills throughout the series, but she also puts on a very good performance in this one. Also the nightmare series in my opinion is what made Robert Englund what he is today. MINOR SPOILER: One of the coolest things in this movie is that Freddy goes through a progressive change. He starts out weak and sounds like the actor that played him instead of a gravel-voiced dream demon like in the other movies; throughout the movie he becomes more evil and stronger with the more souls he gets. MINOR SPOILER STOPPEDThis movie is tame to todays standards. It got the job done when it first debuted and is still a strong classic. My rating 10/10",10,0,0,22 January 2003
The Simpsons Movie," It was a great ride
","It met all of my expectations and was better than the past four seasons of of the show. There was only one joke in the whole movie that didn't really do it for me. Every character got a chance to shine and it was surreal seeing my favorite show growing up on the big screen. I was worried that the writers would throw in a bunch of 'four letter words' just, because they could. Which would have seemed awkward, but thankfully they didn't. The movie was very quickly paced in my opinion. I was very surprised by the time it was over, because it seemed so quick. Homer was definitely the star of the show, but there was a story for the whole family except Maggie, but she had her 'cute' moments. All in all I can't wait for a sequel if they make one at some point in the future.",10,4,11,2 August 2007
