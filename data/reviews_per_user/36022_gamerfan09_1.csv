Resident Evil: Afterlife," Probably the best in the franchise..... with eye-popping 3d.
","Resident Evil has been a successful franchise. But the movies themselves, were average at best. So I wasn't expecting anything new.Well, the movie is great. The plot was more like the game itself, unlike the past movies. The 3D is very good, shot with the Fusion Camera system. Many things fly at you, and it also has excellent depth. But unfortunately, the film is too focused on the action scenes and the 3d. This causes a flawed plot and new characters which we don't really care about.But I don't care. This movie looks stunning, is very fun, and it's a fun mindless action movie. Easily the best in the franchise.",Null,6,16,19 November 2010
