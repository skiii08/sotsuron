The Blair Witch Project," Disappointing. Seemed more like a college cinema assignment.
","After all the hype I was expecting a little more story, a little more substance.  I wasn't expecting special effects or creepy sounds, but I was hoping for something a little more engaging, something that would make me actually care what happened to these people. I didn't see it. Some have said that what was frightening was what wasn't shown.  I don't agree.  Not in the case anyway. In this case I don't think less is more.   It's only less.",4,0,2,12 August 1999
