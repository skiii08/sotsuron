War Dogs," Thrilling,Exciting and Edge of the seat viewing!
","Lets start with what we were all nervous for, Jonah Hill - my god, does he nail this role. Humor, intelligence, and experience all put into one role.. He drives this movie and gives every viewer something different to think. Apart from the usual 21 and 22 jump street we are all used to seeing him in, which are good films by the way! We see him play a much more serious role in this film! and he smashed it! Cant top Wolf of Wall street of course. As for Miles Teller he also did very well in his role, i don't know a lot about the bloke but i know he played a part in the latest Fantastic Four which was a shambles! But in my opinion he smashed the role of being David Packouz!!All the best,
