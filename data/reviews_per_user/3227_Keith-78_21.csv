The Blair Witch Project," Terrible piece of filmmaking
","The Blair Witch Project, put simply, is a piece of crap. I get more scared watching segments of Unsolved Mysteries. It wasn't scary at all. The acting was terrible. Those three kids got more annoying every minute, I wish that witch would have came and shoved an apple in their mouths just to make them shut up. For most of the film, they filmed leaves and sticks and rocks around their tent, then the complaining came, and then they started up again filming leaves and sticks and rocks around their tent and then more complaining. Those sounds they heard in the night were SUPPOSED to be freaky, if they weren't so muffled. I think the scariest part of the movie was when that girl was filming herself apologizing to her parents and all of those snots came flying out of her nose, now THAT was torture in itself. If you want to see a SCARY movie rent the original Haunting or Halloween, don't waste 7 bucks on this mockery to filmmaking.",Null,0,1,2 August 1999
The Blair Witch Project," A second comment...
","I have been reading some more reviews about this movie and about the people saying how this is the 'scariest movie they have EVER seen'. Number one, they don't know real horror. If you want real horror, watch 'The Exorcist', 'Psycho' and 'Halloween'. Now THOSE are scary films. This is nothing more than a vomit-inducing, swearing free for all.",Null,0,1,5 September 1999
Alien 3," 3 times the swearing...
","'Alien 3' is considered to be the darkest out of all 4 films. It picks up where 'Aliens' left off and focuses on Ripley's (Sigourney Weaver) troubles with her best friend, the xenomorph, who she has a special connection with this time around. After the assault against the aliens on LV-426, Ripley, the little girl Newt, Corporal Hicks and Bishop the Android are on their way home, but an egg has been planted on the Sulaco (presumably by the Queen before her death) and the facehugger that emerges from it starts a fire. Ripley and her companions get ejected into an EEV, which crash lands on Fiorina 161, a barren planet inhabited by murderers and rapists who now turn to God. Hicks, Newt and Bishop die, which leaves Ripley all alone waiting to be rescued. When some inmates start disappearing, Ripley fears an alien has landed on the planet with her and she was right. With limited weapons, she teams up with the convicts to kill it. She also has to make a life or death decision because of her very special connection to the alien species as well. This film was a HUGE turn around from the previous film, it is dark and slow moving, the survivors are killed in the first 5 minutes and Ripley has a shaved head. The convicts were annoying and they must have spewed the F-word at least 100 times throughout the whole movie. The alien was also different from the others, it ran on all 4 legs and it protected Ripley. This is a good entry in the series, but it is my least favorite.",Null,5,6,13 December 1999
Alien 3," Depressing...
","'Alien 3' differs very much from the other movies. It begins right where 'Aliens' left off. This movie is dark, bleak and depressing. There is some suspense, some action, but nowhere along the lines of the first two films. The acting is somewhat good, Weaver still does her best in this film, although she is not as good as she was in 'Aliens'. The ending is especially sad. The lighting is bleak, the setting is bleak, and you don't get to see the alien as much, but it does revive some of the suspense that made the first film so great.",Null,0,3,29 March 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," First Episode is a good start
","The Phantom Menace is actually a good film. I didn't think I would like it all that much, hearing what the critics had to say, but it was a good film. I will admit this though, I was confused about the storyline. I didn't understand it all that well. Something dealing with trade and trade blocks and the planet Naboo and Queen Amidala signing something. I don't know. I guess, and hope, that Episodes II and III will explain it more. I was more interested in seeing my favorite characters on the big screen again, looking a bit younger of course. Yoda, C-3PO, R2-D2, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Senator Palpatine (Later EMPEROR PALPATINE), Jabba The Hutt and Anakin Skywalker are all going to connect to the later movies sometime or another, even if several of them were seen briefly. The acting was good, the battles were terrific, lots of explosions, and a suspenseful lightsaber battle between Qui-Gon Jin, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Maul highlight this movie. Only one problem exists, consisting of three words: Jar Jar Binks. He gets the award for the most ANNOYING character ever (so far) in the 4 episodes that are out. If you are a fan of Star Wars, be sure to see this film, it is actually quite good. Don't believe the critics. They go too in depth, just enjoy watching it.",Null,0,0,20 May 1999
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Marvelous piece of film making, Best of the trilogy
","'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is a groundbreaking film filled with action, suspense, romance, and more. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is hired by the U.S. government to find the Ark of the Covenant, the chest which held the Ten Commandments, before the Nazis get their hands on it. Seems Hitler wants to use it for personal power. Also tagging along for the ride is Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), who is Indy's old flame. This film is fantastic, I have watched it so many times and I never get tired of it. The plot is great, the characters are well developed, and the action is quite extreme, which is good for this kind of movie. The best sequence is when the Nazis open the Ark and get the surprise of their life, literally. Followed by two sequels which don't even compare to this one.",Null,0,0,23 November 1999
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Classic!
","'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is the first movie in the Indiana Jones trilogy and it's also the best. It starts Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, an archeologist who sets off to find the lost Ark of the Covenant, the chest that carried the Ten Commandments. He teams up with his ex-girlfriend, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) and he dodges bullets, punches, Nazis and his arch-rival, Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman) who is working with the the Nazis to find the ark. There are some pretty fantastic scenes in this movie, the beginning with the boulder, the plane-fight sequence and also the truck chase but I think the scene most connected with this movie is the end. Awesome movie and definitely one of the best to ever make it on film.",Null,0,0,22 March 1999
Alien: Resurrection," Nice touch up on the 'Alien' series
","'Alien: Resurrection' is the last (so far) of the 'Alien' series started in 1979. It breaks new ground with new characters and a new Ellen Ripley. 200 years after she killed herself on Fiorina 161, the United Systems Military has acquired her blood samples and cloned her in order to get the alien queen she was carrying at the time of her death. They use the queen to lay her eggs and the crew of the 'Betty' brings in a shipment of people cryogenically frozen to use for the facehuggers. The aliens are born but soon all hell breaks loose and they break loose. Ripley, who is now a half human/half alien because of the DNA mix of the cloning, teams up with the crew of the 'Betty' in order to stop the aliens before they head to Earth. The film is an improvement over 'Alien 3' but still doesn't deliver the punch that we got from the first two films. There is action in this however, including a great underwater scene and the gore in here is plentiful (this is by far the goriest entry in the series). The characters aren't that well developed, all except for Ripley, who is sarcastic and developed a Groucho Marx-like one-liner syndrome. Also added is this hideous newborn creature that thinks Ripley is it's momma or something like that.",Null,0,1,16 December 1999
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Good ending to the original trilogy
","Return of the Jedi is actually a very good film with some tense action scenes, great acting and some annoying Ewoks. Actually, the Ewoks are the main reason why this film is the least popular of the series, they are just way too cute for me, but I could handle them more than the Gungans from Episode I. The plot: The Empire is in the middle of constructing a new and more powerful Death Star while Luke, Leia and the gang rescue Han Solo from Jabba The Hutt. Darth Vader is still looking to turn Luke over to the dark side of the Force with the help of Emperor Palpatine. Although perhaps the weakest of the series, this film definitely has the best action sequences, I loved the bike chase and the whole Battle of Endor. The acting was great, especially from Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford, you can tell they are comfortable with their roles in this one. This is a great sequel and I would recommend it to anyone who has watched The Empire Strikes Back to complete the most important parts of the storyline.",Null,0,0,15 August 1999
Alien," In Space, No One Can Hear You Scream...
","This tagline changed the face of science fiction movies for decades. Alien was released in 1979 and was the first and the best of four films to hit the big screen. The commercial starship Nostromo is returning to Earth with 20,000,000 tons of mineral ore when its main central computer, 'Mother', interrupts the journey and informs the crew that they must investigate a distress signal coming from planet LV-426. When three crew members go and search the surface for this signal, one of them ends up with something on his face, a parasite or facehugger. Later on, it falls off of his face and he seems to be fine but little did anyone know that the facehugger planted an Alien inside his body, which bursts from his chest in a shocking scene. As the remaining crew members hunt for the creature, it has shed its skin and grown into a very scary creature. It kills each crew member until only Ellen Ripley is left, which leads to a final showdown in a small shuttle she escapes in after detonating the Nostromo. Alien is so much more entertaining than any of its successors. It has the claustrophobic atmosphere, characters you care about and Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) at her finest! She uses her wits and intelligence to kill the creature, not machine guns and grenades like in 'Aliens'. Everyone puts in a great performance. The best characters in the film were Ash, the traitorous android, Parker, Rambo-like tough guy and of course Ripley. All in all, Alien is one intense film. Suspenseful and very scary. Stands apart big time from the other 3 films that followed it.",Null,0,1,29 March 1999
Over the Top," Whatta Bland Movie
","Over The Top is such a bland movie. If they wanted to make a movie about one of the most boring sports out there, then this would be it. Sly Stallone stars as Lincoln Hawk who tries to patch up things with his son by entering a Las Vegas armwrestling match. One word to sum it up: Yawn.",Null,1,5,22 August 1999
Aliens," Aliens vs. Marines
","'Aliens' is the first sequel to 1979's 'Alien'. As the movie begins, Ellen Ripley's escape shuttle is picked up by a salvage crew 57 years after she encountered the alien and blew the Nostromo to smithereens. During those years she was away, a colony was set up on LV-426, the aliens' planet, but transmissions from them suddenly stopped. Ripley decided to end her nightmares and accompany a group of Marines to the planet as an advisor just in case any aliens might show up, and they do indeed. An all out war begins as the marines try their hardest to shoot up hundreds of aliens that infested the colony, while Ripley becomes a mother to the only survivor from the colony, a little girl name Newt. Aliens is definitely a very good action movie, but all of the suspense from the original film is gone. Most of it has been replaced by machine gun fire and explosions. The acting in this is top notch. The connection between Ripley and Newt (Carrie Henn) is unforgettable. The marines are also very well drawn out, my favorite being Hicks. He kept his cool through most of the bad situations that were encountered. Aliens is a very good sequel which continues the storyline as the viewer finds even more information about the aliens and WHO exactly laid all of those eggs. Rent this along with 'Alien' for a good night of suspense, action and sci-fi fun.",Null,0,0,29 March 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," Best sci-fi film I have ever seen
","2001: A Space Odyssey is the best sci-fi movie I have ever seen. From Strauss' 'Thus Spake Zarathustra' to the HAL-9000 computer to Bowman's weird trip through the star gate, this film is perfect. It starts out at 'The Dawn of Man', where we first get a glimpse of those apes that we developed from. We also get our first glimpse of the huge black slab known as the monolith. Well, as soon as the apes touch it, they became hunters and killers, something from which they weren't before. The monolith somehow gave them the knowledge to kill and hunt so they can evolve. Although these scenes are long (around 25 minutes), they are very well set up and keeps the viewer's attention, well, those who didn't fall asleep yet anyway. Fast forward 4 million years to 1999. A second monolith is found on the moon near the crater Tycho and a team led by Dr. Haywood Floyd (William Sylvester) sets out to investigate it. While they gather for pictures, an ear piercing sound emerged from the monolith heading straight for Jupiter. Forward a year and a half to 2001. The spaceship 'Discovery', with it's commander David Bowman (Keir Dullea), co-pilot Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood), 3 hibernating scientists and central computer HAL-9000 (voiced by Douglas Rain) is on it's way to Jupiter on the orders of Dr. Floyd to find out what they can about the monolith and what is actually near there. Kubrick stretches out these scenes so much that we can actually be on the Discovery and feel for the 2 commanders as the boredom eventually sets in. Dave draws pictures of the hibernating scientists, Frank plays chess and relaxes, the sleep, eat, run parts of the ship and talk to HAL, that is about all they can do considering that HAL runs mostly all of the ship's systems. After Dave and Frank notice the 'mistake' HAL makes, things start to kick in. The decide to disconnect him but HAL strikes back, killing Frank outside the ship by disconnecting his air supply, and then shutting off the life support systems of the 3 hibernating scientists while Dave sets off to rescue Frank (who is already dead). Then, to make matters worse, HAL won't let Dave in the ship! Dave, after some quick thinking, finally gets in the ship and disconnects HAL. Now, after this, we are treated to the stunning 'star gate' sequence, where Dave goes to investigate giant, floating monolith over Jupiter. I have to say, I think this is the scariest part of the film, seeing all of those colors and shapes and objects flying around, sends chills up my back. After that sequence, Dave ends up in a hotel room, visibly shaken from the encounter, where he grows old, older, on his deathbed and then, turned into a child, reborn so to say. This film leaves so many questions unanswered and that is what Kubrick wanted. I mean, what was the monolith? Who sent it? What REALLY happened to Dave Bowman? Why did HAL malfunction? These questions are meant to be answered in '2010' and they aren't, making the whole story seem more confusing. People who watch this film will either like it (because of the questions being presented and the philosophical meaning of it) or hate it (it's too slow, boring, dull and there is no dialogue), either way, this film ranks up there as Kubrick's best work and no matter how many times I watch this film, it amazes me more and more and more.",Null,3,6,25 August 1999
Jaws," Absolute Entertainment!
","Jaws was the first feature film debut of Steven Spielberg (not counting his TV movie 'Duel') and the only film that he was actually involved in despite the other sequels. A 25 foot great white shark ends up swimming around the small resort town of Amity and attacks (and eats) tourists during the around the 4th of July. The local police chief, Brody (Roy Schieder), calls in shark expert Hooper (Richard Dreyfus) and fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw) to hunt down the shark and the three set out to the ocean to hopefully get rid of it. The performances are great. Scheider, Dreyfus and Shaw deliver perfect performances but the main character is 'Bruce' the shark, who chomps up a woman, a little boy and another guy in some disturbing sequences. Along with other performances from Lorraine Gary (who appeared in 2 other sequels) and Murray Hamilton, Jaws is a great motion picture! Just don't watch it if you plan on going in the ocean anytime soon!",Null,0,1,23 August 1999
Halloween," A True Classic
","'Halloween' is my favorite film of all time, not just horror, but any type of film. It was released back in 1978 and starred an unknown actress named Jamie Lee Curtis. It focuses on a disturbed mental patient named Michael Myers, who, when he was six years old, killed his 17 year old sister with a butcher knife. Fifteen years later, he escapes and sets his eyes on three teenage girls who are out babysitting for the night. This is definitely John Carpenter's best film to date. It has all the elements of a SCARY movie: the dark atmosphere, the music, the unstoppable killer, NO blood, the frightened but smart heroine and likeable characters. The other six movies (with the exception of Halloween: H20) replace all of the original's suspense with huge amounts of blood and gore. Watch this one with the lights out.",Null,0,1,12 April 1999
Back to the Future Part II," Very clever sequel
","'Back to the Future, Part II' manages to outdo it's predecessor in every way. Better acting, better effects, better storyline. It picks up directly where the original leaves off. This time, Marty, Doc Brown and Marty's girlfriend, Jennifer, travel to the year 2015 in order to prevent certain disasters with Marty's kids. While in the future, Marty buys a sports almanac (50 years of sports statistics 1950-2000) which he wants to take back to 1985 with the hopes of winning a lot of money. Unfortunately, old Biff Tannen manages to grab the book after Doc Brown throws it away, and steals the Delorean to take it to the future (or the past?) Marty, Doc and Jennifer arrive in 1985 again only to find it has been tampered with, and their little town of Hill Valley has become a bigtime war zone. Seems Biff was the cause of it, as he won a huge amount of money in his early years which caused him to become a millionaire tycoon. Marty investigates and him and Doc need to go back to 1955 in order to repair the damage done to 1985! (I hope you get it so far) In 1955, Marty tracks down young Biff this time in order to get the almanac and destroy it so the normal timeline can be restored. He also has to be careful not to run into his other 'self', because he is in 1955 on the same day that he goes back to the future in the original movie. Well, this movie certainly is clever, no doubt about that, but it isn't at all lighthearted as the original, it is a dark movie, especially when the action shifts to the alternate 1985. For a movie that in reality, takes place 4 years after the first movie, it pulls off the continuity nicely. The acting is great, especially by Christopher Lloyd and Michael J. Fox. Elizabeth Shue replaces Claudia Wells as Jennifer and Crispin Glover is only in scenes from the original movie. This is definitely the best movie of the series, balancing action, humor and darkness equally.",Null,1,3,3 December 1999
Final Destination," I don't even have words to describe this trash flick
","Well, I just came back from seeing this film and I must say, it sucked. It's just another teen 'slasher' film to follow in the 'Scream' tradition: a bunch of dumb teenagers played by no-name actors and actresses get slashed in various, grotesque ways. Is that all Hollywood can think of anymore? This movie just makes me want to watch 'Halloween' or 'The Exorcist' even more. Those films are what true terror is all about. It also saddens me that James Wong, and the rest of his crew had to exploit a very sad and tragic disaster that was TWA Flight 800 in order to make this movie a 'hit', and if people can't see that the first 20 minutes of the movie were based on that disaster, open your eyes. Avoid this mess at all costs. Don't waste your money.",Null,1,1,18 March 2000
A Nightmare on Elm Street," What a classic horror film
","'A Nightmare on Elm Street' was released in 1984 and introduced Fred Krueger in his darker times. Story focuses on Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) and her friends Tina (Amanda Wyss), Glen (Johnny Depp, in his first starring role) and Rod (Nick Corri), who are having nightmares about a burned man in a red and green sweater and dirty fedora who wears razors on his right hand. He was a child murderer freed on a technicality. The parents of the murdered kids got together, tracked him down and burned him to death. He returned in the dreams of their other kids to kill them, to make them pay for what they did to him. Each of the teens gets killed by Freddy until Nancy is left, in which she enters his world to carry him into the real world, so he can die. This film is very scary, disregard any of the other ones, focus on this one. The acting is great, especially by Langenkamp, she puts on a pretty crazy performance. Freddy is also SCARY, he isn't a comedian who throws out one liners like they are going out of style, and he is always lurking in the shadows too. Rent this one and Wes Craven's New Nightmare for a good night of horror.",Null,0,0,20 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," One of the best movies ever made
","Star Wars: A New Hope is one of the best movies ever made. Not since 2001: A Space Odyssey have audiences been astonished by fantastic special effects and a terrific storyline. The plot is relatively simple: Princess Leia, working for the Rebellion, is kidnapped and held hostage by the Empire on their armored battle station Death Star. Luke Skywalker lives on Tatooine, a desert planet, when he encounters a message from the Princess that she put into R2-D2. He teams up with Ben Kenobi, Han Solo, Chewbacca and the 2 droids, R2 and C-3PO to help rescue her. This is the best in the trilogy in my opinion. The acting is a little raw in stages, especially coming from Luke, but the interaction between Han and Leia is entertaining, as it fortells their eventual relationship in the other 2 films. Alec Guinness is great as Obi-Wan Kenobi, he has the best line in the film (The Force will be with you....always.' and his fight with Vader was good too, but it's boring when you think of how Luke and Vader fought. Darth Vader wasn't as evil in this film as he was in ESB, that trait fell to Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin, commander of the Death Star. Prime example: when he orders Princess Leia's home planet, Alderaan, destroyed to show the Death Star's capabilities. The battle scene at the end is awesome, lots of special effects and Vader even pilots his own special TIE fighter! As you know, the Death Star gets blown to bits and the good guys win, that is until ESB. This film is a lot lighter compared to the darkness the next installment has, but it has some of the best scenes, best acting and best music to make this the best of the trilogy. If you haven't seen it, rent it, you won't regret it.",Null,0,0,24 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Cinematic Masterpiece
","Star Wars is absolutely the best of the 'original' trilogy and better than The Phantom Menace. It introduces the characters that us fans have grown to love and sets the pace for the next two films that follow. The plot is relatively simple: Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) steals plans to the Empire's Death Star, an armored battle station with so much power it can destroy a whole planet. While seeking out Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness), her ship is attacked and she is captured by Darth Vader (David Prowse, voice: James Earl Jones) and held hostage on the Death Star. She hides the plans in R2-D2 and him, along with his counterpart C-3PO meet up with Luke Skywalker, who joins forces with Obi-Wan, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) to rescue the Princess and destroy the Death Star. Although this is the best of the trilogy, some of the dialogue is rather bland, but the performances are top notch. The interaction between Han and Leia forshadows their love in the next installments, and Obi-Wan starts to teach Luke about the Force. Darth Vader is excellent but he isn't as evil as he is in the other two films, that honor goes to Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin, commander of the Death Star that orders Princess Leia's home planet destroyed. The effects are also good, the battle at the end of the film is exciting and suspenseful plus you get to see Vader pilot his own Tie fighter! This film is outstanding and I think with each viewing it gets better and better and better.",Null,0,0,31 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Excellent
","The Empire Strikes Back is just a notch down from A New Hope, but still an excellent film in the trilogy. After the Death Star was destroyed, the Rebellion was chased from their secret base and relocated to a bunch of different planets over three years, until they're finally settled down on the ice planet of Hoth. Darth Vader, obsessed with finding Luke Skywalker has sent probe droids across the galaxy in order to find him and his friends. This film is very action packed, ranging from the AT-AT battle to the chase in the asteroid field. The acting is quite better than the first go around, especially from Mark Hamill, and the love scenes between Han and Leia are excellent. Darth Vader is at his most evil in this film, choking people to death who fail him. His lightsaber duel with Luke at the end is ten times better than between him and Obi Wan in the original and the point where Darth tells Luke who he REALLY is is shocking, even when you know what happens. To sum it up: The Rebellion is defeated, Luke abandons his training, Han is captured and taken to Jabba The Hutt and Luke gains a daddy and loses a hand. Excellent film in the series.",Null,0,0,1 August 1999
