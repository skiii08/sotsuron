It," Annoying. Dumb Stereotypes
","Positves; the actress playing the one girl in it. Negatives: virtually everything else. Every other character is an obvious, obtuse stereotype both written and played with virtually no subtlety. By far the most glaring and obnoxious of these is the bespectacled kid who incessantly (literally INCESSANTLY) does nothing but make supposedly funny sexual remarks every time he opens his mouth. It's weak, lazy, unrealistic and thoroughly aggravating. Of course, some kids that age attempt crude humor, but no one does it non-stop like a hack morning DJ. It being completely witless makes it all the worse. The hypochondriac kid is almost as bad and just as hackneyed. Making characters lazy types rather than human beings is cheap and speaks to a lack of talent on the creators part, as well as a lack of respect for the potential audience. This is an R-rated film written for eight-year-olds.",4,0,0,3 January 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," More Smug Than Smart
","In the trailer for this Frances McDormand comes off as a bawdy force of nature and I was eager to see the story in which her character lived. It began with an intriguing premise, but soon enough devolved into a shoddy bag of easy cliches and trite caricatures. While McDormand is mostly great, the material did not remain worthy of her talent. The cops are racists, black people are oppressed, little people are demeaned, innocent people are beaten without consequence and another is arrested and jailed for two joints - in 2017, while arson and wife beating are winked at by seemingly oblivious yokels. All of this is seemingly in service to director McDonagh's seeming belief that small-town America is most clearly defined by its defects and those defects are rampant pathologies. If that's true, he doesn't prove it with glib mockery and snide derision masked as social commentary. Add in the plot holes big enough to erect a billboard in and the whole thing crumbles into an exercise in snark.",5,22,40,28 December 2017
