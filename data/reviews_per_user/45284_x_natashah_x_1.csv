It," Better than expected
",I wasn't expecting much of this movie as I have to admit I didn't enjoy the original but for me I thought this was much better written it had a nice flow - Bev's character was much better developed this time round too and all round all the kids acting was great - Richie and Eddie brought just a nice amount of humour without it being silly. I felt it captured more emotion than its predecessor and albeit the graphics are better but that's to be expected as CGI has come a long way. I loved Bill as Pennywise too I thought he did a great job - it has the odd silly bit which is why I didn't give it a 10 but overall I think it's a good movie well worth watching,8,4,8,18 September 2017
