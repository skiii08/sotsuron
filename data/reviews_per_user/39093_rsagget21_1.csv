Resident Evil: Afterlife," What did you expect?
","Yes there was a large lack of sensible plot and a plethora of unbelievable events (doors opening automatically and locking behind people, physics defying maneuvers, etc.), but what did you expect?Anyone who has seen the last three Resident Evil movies can attest to the nonsense that has been present from the very beginning. The plots have always been just enough to say it was actually a movie and the action has always been a bit over the top. The first three movies did have more zombies, but they also had a power rangers sort of action to it (watch Alice as she fights the zombies). Not to mention, the terrible costume for the final boss in the second Resident Evil and the terrible fight scene between Alice and the last boss in the third Resident Evil.Back to the unbelievable events, the locking doors and the ridiculous physics are a must in the movie adaptation of the Resident Evil video games. If you haven't played Resident Evil 5, please do so and you will know what I mean. Either way, the previous Resident Evils set the bar low enough for this movie to be somewhat decent, especially with the pretty good 3D action.",8,1,5,28 September 2010
