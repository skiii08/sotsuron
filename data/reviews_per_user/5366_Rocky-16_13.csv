The Rock," Solid Action Movie
",This one of Sean Connery's best movies and features one his most solid performances in recent years. It's not a classic but still a good movie plus Nicholas Cage and Ed Harris are good too,Null,1,1,3 October 1998
A Bridge Too Far," solid effort
",This is a good war film with a great cast of every single actor you might think of. The depiction of war is realistic but at 4 hours it's a bit too long. Though at the most part it's a good movie to watch. Plus who could miss a movie with such a great cast. I have never read the book so I don't know how the movie measures up to it. Rating: 3 out of 4,Null,0,1,11 January 1999
Apocalypse Now," a descent into madness
",I watched this film on T.V. and it is simply amazing! I truly can't find any words to describe this brilliant film. Sure there's not much of a plot but this movie is like being in Vietnam and all the performances are good. It's just one of those films that's hard to classify. It shows you everyonewas a hypocrite in Vietnam. Willard's mission was to kill Kurt but when he met Colonel Kilgore he seemed  nearly as crazy as Kurtz.,10,0,0,16 January 1999
Gandhi," Yes, it is propaganda!!
","First of all, I'd like to say that I have nothing personal against GANDHI, the  > man or the film. The large part of this film really is propaganda. Look at the characters for instance. Gandhi the protagonist is shown here as a saintly figure while his antoganist shown here is Jinnah as some sort > of a crusty snooty evil guy. Even though at first that does not seem so, but the more you get into the film the more you understand that and also the fact how shallow this film is in its depiction of Jinnah. Jinnah was a huge figure in the independence of the subcontinent and just because he wore a suit and tie doesn't mean he was any less a greater person than Gandhi. Also, the fact that the movie was partly sponsored by the National film Board of India makes it clearer that this was a propaganda film. It's clearly an attempt to make the Pakistani people of the Subcontinent look bad.Maybe somebody should make a movie on Jinnah who knew the game better than Gandhi because he had the vision to know that after the British left the Hindus would dominate over the moslems. Also, there is another scene in the film to make the creation of Pakistan look bad - when Gandhi tries to bribe Jinnah into giving up the concept of Pakistan by telling him he could be the first prime minister of India and have his own cabinet, but in the long run that would have been useless. Because how long could Jinnah stay prime minister in a Hindu dominated society? After this 'bribe' who would you believe was a more honorable person - Jinnah or Gandhi?This movie is a living testament to how strong cinema can be, but it's just a big lie and it entertained a lot of people but if you know the history of the subcontinent you will be less than thrilled with this film.",Null,7,28,8 April 1999
Gandhi," not a bad movie
",This movie is O.k. but what is excellent is Ben Kingsley's performance.He gives a great performance as Gandhi. But what the movie does not tell is the movement to make Pakistan and Mohammed Ali Jinnah is a minor character even though he was an enormous player for independence from the British. I guess you can't really expect that from a movie called Gandhi. For that I would recommend the recently released JINNAH. Plus it also shows the injustices made by the British to the people of the subcontinent.,Null,2,11,11 January 1999
Lawrence of Arabia," A Film Masterpiece
","One of the greatest films ever made with superb cinematography and a memorable score. I especially love this film because I used to live in the Middle East and know the history pretty well. I personally felt the heat,emptiness and vastness of the desert while living in the Middle East and I think this film captures that feeling perfectly. Lawrence of Arabia not only ranks right up there with great action epics such as GUNJA DIN, THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING but holds its own against such classic movies as CITIZEN KANE, THE GODFATHER AND SCHINDLER'S LIST. A terrific film and I give it an 11 out of 10",10,1,4,22 December 1998
Lawrence of Arabia," how can anyone call this movie over-rated!
","Lawrence of Arabia is truly a great film. One of the greatest films ever made if not the greatest. It has everything one can ask for, terrific acting, great score and cinematography. The movie is as much an epic as a psychological profile. The main character in this film is larger than life but still normal and flawed just like all us and the mere fact that he became a hero just by chance and ended up a meglomaniac is strange. Some people say this movie is historically in- accurate which is true to a certain extent but it is really the most historically accurate movie ever made. Better than that stupid and shallow Mel Gibson film BRAVEHEART. I mean that was really a historically inaccurate film and Mel Gibson sort of re-wrote the history on Willam Wallace. Watch Lawrence of Arabia for the real experience because this truly a classic film worthy of being seen again and again. Anyone who calls this movie over-rated is missing something special.",10,0,2,25 February 1999
The Man Who Would Be King," Absolutely Brilliant!
","This is a great film! It has action, drama and comedy and achieves a perfect blend. It's a story about 2 soldiers of fortune who go into the wilds of Kafaristan to conquer the land for themselves. They make the people believe that Connery is god and reincarnation of Alexander the Great. Of course this makes Connery over-confident and he tells Caine that he does not want to leave the land. The ending is truly great and ironic. Sad and full of hope at the same time.It almost made me cry. Connery and Caine have great chemistry and I wonder why they never had another pairing in a movie, which is a truly pitiful.This movie is a true classic worthy of being seen again again. I give it a 10 out of 10",10,2,4,16 January 1999
Where Eagles Dare," A Classic WW2 cliffhanger
","This is a classic WW2 cliffhanger (all pun intended). A great film with a large doses of action, suspense and testosterone. This is truly a 'macho' film which is my kind of film. Women probably won't like this but this movie comes from a long gone era in which Hollywood made simple action films without too much swearing and gruesome violence but still had great excitement from start to finish. Plus it has young Clint Eastwood doing that really great quiet, tough guy bit. Richard Burton is good too and some say that his character in the Maclean novel was the basis for James Bond. Eastwood and Burton make a great team and this might be the first modern buddy action film. Although Burton I felt was supposed to be the star of the film Eastwood somehow quietly stole the show as a believable cold-hearted killing machine. A great film worthy of being on the top 250. Sure the plot is a bitunrealistic but it is still great fun.Rating- 3.5/4If you liked this film you would also enjoy THE GUNS OF NAVARONE which is also adopted from a Alistar Maclean novel and is also a good film with an all-star cast.",10,1,3,2 February 1999
The Untouchables," Classic Movie
",Great movie with good performances from all the stars especially Connery. Plus it also has a good script.,Null,2,3,24 November 1998
The Untouchables," A terrific Connery performance
","This movie has received mixed reviews for a long time. Some call it a masterpiece but others don't like it at all. Though one thing is certain that Sean Connery really deserved his best supporting actor Oscar and elevated this somewhat routine film into the level of a classic. I remember seeing this film in History Class. Even though the period details are great it's Connery's brilliant performance that stands out most in my mind. Connery who like Robert Mitchum up until the performance in this film was a very underrated actor. He deserved more oscar nominations than the sole one he got for this film for appearing in such underrated gems such as The Offense, The Hill, Outland and The Man who would be King. Even though Connery gives a great performance in this film he really isn't given enough time to shine but at least this movie put his somewhat flagging career back on track.",Null,0,0,26 February 1999
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Adventure Movie with Philosophical Questions
",This is a great adventure movie but if you try to look at more things than the adventure and the stunts you will ask yourself the questions of immortality and greed. Sort of like Ingar Bergaman's The Seventh Seal. Not only that it has a great pairing of Connery and Ford. This movie will forever be in my top 20. **** out of ****,9,2,3,8 November 1998
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Great Adventure Movie
","Simply a very entertaining movie with great stunts and great adventure. Sean Connery is great as Indiana Jones's father and is the complete opposite of his James Bond character, the chemistry between Connery and Ford is great. You would want to see this one again and again.",9,2,3,7 September 1998
