The Rock," Smashing!
",A brilliant film.  I went to it first with low hopes at the cinema but came out wanting to see it again and again.  The acting is superb and all the action keeps you on the edge of your seat at all times.  A fascinating plot with first class directing.  I recomend it strongly and give it ten out of ten,10,1,1,6 October 1998
