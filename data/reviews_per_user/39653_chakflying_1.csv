Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Classic style, but not so surprising
","I don't know how to write a good review, so I'll just start from nothing. The story is about Jack Sparrow, Blackbeard, Angelica, Barbossa, all looking for the Fountain of Youth, where you can take another person's years and extending you life, for different reasons. As usual, somebody wins and some body dies. Here you can see some expected scenes, kisses, explosions, killing people, some strange looking guys, stuffs like those. There are roughly two story lines, and merged properly. The 3D effect is not so obvious in the middle part of the film, but clearly them have put some effort on making some of the scenes popping out of the screen, not just depth of field 3D. The ending is not surprising as you saw the bad guys are dead and everybody lives happily ever after, but it's acceptable in this movie.One thing about Johnny Depp is that he switches brilliantly between different emotions, and the 'laughing points' are quite well too, adding some more features to this film. Also, his 'non-lethal' attacks are pleasing too.almost forgot to mention about the CGs, just so natural that you could forget their existence, the effort they have put in should not be forgotten(speaking as a non-experienced 3D modeler).Overall, this is a movie that if you walk into the theater, you should walk out smiling(should), but don't look for big surprises.",8,6,12,19 May 2011
