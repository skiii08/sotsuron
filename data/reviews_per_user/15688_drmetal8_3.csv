Mission: Impossible III," The Best Mission so far
","MI:3 is by far the best Mission Impossible movie so far. It easily surpasses the first 2 in pretty much any area you can think of. The action is non-stop, and totally believable. Love him or hate him, Cruise is incredible in this movie. He does the emotional as well as the physical acting with ease. Obviously JJ Abrams' (Lost, Alias) involvement in this franchise has turned it around. The plot gets dangerously close to ripping off Dan Brown's book 'Angels & Demons' (the book before Davinci Code- worth reading BTW) with the 'Antigod' segment and the trip inside the Vatican. Other than that, this movie was great. Definitely worth seeing in the theater.",9,2,4,15 May 2006
Public Enemies," Poorly made gangster movie
","I was very disappointed in this movie. I was shocked at how sloppy this movie was, especially being directed by Michael Mann. There is almost no attention to detail, and it's so distracting. It starts from the very beginning, where the movie puts you right in the middle of some sort of jailbreak scene... they make no attempt to explain what the hell is going on. The sound is poorly done, there are parts where the sound is overwhelming (most of the gunfights) and parts where you can barely hear what is being said. People mumble a lot, you completely miss parts. There are no time/date/location stamps on any scene in the movie. It's very hard to figure out where you are, what's happening and who you are seeing do it. The cinematography is atrocious. There are whole scenes that are just a jumbled mess. One other beef I had is the casting of too many similar-looking people. There are so many middle-aged white men in this movie, you can't keep track of who's who. I really wanted to like this movie, but I just didn't. Poorly done.",3,0,2,1 March 2010
Fantastic Four," Decent
","It seems like everyone hates this movie. I enjoyed it. Keep in mind it's an 'origin' movie, so they have to tell the story of how these people became the Fantastic Four. Thus, it's a little slow and plodding at times, but it is an entertaining movie. The special effects were good, the acting was decent. My only real complaints were that the movie was a little short and the big fight at the end was over too quickly. Dr. Doom is the greatest villain in the Marvel Universe, and he should be able to put up more of a fight. It seems that some of the Marvel movies are made with about 1/2 the budget they need. Now that this is a bona-fide hit and a sequel has been announced, expect a bigger and grander Fantastic 4 #2.",9,1,4,13 July 2005
