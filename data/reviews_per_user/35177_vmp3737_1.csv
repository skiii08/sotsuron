The Monuments Men," Don't Bother
","I was very disappointed with this film. You could pretty much predict most of what happens. Some of it was difficult to follow jumping around in time and location without explanation. I guess a lot footage was left on the cutting room floor. The dialog wasn't very interesting and the plotting sometimes inexplicable -- were the real monuments men as stupid as in some scenes? Even the music was pedestrian. All in all a lousy film. I suppose it could have been worse, but not much.If you want to see a film about saving art in WWII and based to some extent on real events I highly, HIGHLY recommend John Frankenheimer's 'The Train' starring Burt Lancaster. This is an excellent film that will have you on the edge of your seat or holding your breath all the way through.",1,0,0,10 September 2014
