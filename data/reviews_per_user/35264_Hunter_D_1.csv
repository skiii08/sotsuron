Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," If you are not a SW fan leave now!!!
","If you're not a Star Wars fan leave now!  The Phantom Meanace is a great movie sticking to the traditions that we have come to expect from the man, George Lucas.  I have heard some many mixed reviews from this movie that I am here to set the record straight.  This movie is a stepping stone and yes it is slow at parts but was star wars any different.  We sit here and say Jar Jar is an idiot and sucks and that the movie is slow and this and that. Well let me say BRAVO George on your come back!  I liked this movie so well that I suggest it to anyone who has a lust for for adventure.  It is a stepping stone (or a foundation) to what will be the greatest story ever told.  We will tell our kids how we stood in line to see it.  Just like I did for Empire and Jedi.  Just remember Episodes II and III are to come and that we are in for a real treat for when they come the force will never be the same! And what we think we know will be a lie!",Null,0,1,19 June 1999
