The Avengers," Most fun, crowd-pleasing movie in years!
","The Avengers is the most fun, crowd-pleasing movie I've seen in years. Its no wonder Marvel's The Avengers shattered the box office record with over 200,000,000 dollars domestic this weekend. It's barely been out and its made half a billion dollars. The Avengers has been around for about 50 years and after 5 movies leading up to this, the Avengers delivers. The theater was a mad house when I saw it Saturday. There were little kids and old people as well. This movie is great for all ages. The older people finally get to see the super heroes they grew up with finally on the big screen and the little kids will get great role models to look up to. The movie puts great emphasis on how teamwork results in victory. The character development is great. Each superhero gets enough screen time, but the Hulk steels the show and is sure to be everyone's favorite. The best moments in the movie are when the Hulk is on screen. They did a good job on showing how Captain America assumed the leader position on the team. Iron Man/ Tony Stark is witty as always and Thor is also cool. The team is balanced and everyone, even puny Hawk Eye and Black Widow, contributes. This movie has it all. Great action, character development, comedy, and story. It can be a little cheesy but in a good way. There are moments when the whole theater will laugh, clap and cheer. Its a fun way to start off summer. I know I'm picking this up as soon as it hits the shelves. Along with Spiderman 2 and Dark Knight, the Avengers is one of the best superhero movies to date. Can't wait for number 2!",9,1,4,6 May 2012
Watchmen," Men go to prison. Dogs get put down!
","I never read the novel but I can say I like the premise of this movie. The era of tension between two nations, the destructive nature of mankind is all great. The pacing of this movie (director's cut) is pretty good. I like how it shows everyone's view point of the Comedian. This movie has gotten some bad reviews but I can't fathom why. In my opinion its one of the more underrated movies out there. The soundtrack is nice. The intro credits with Bob Dylan is my favorite part of the whole movie. The choice of song in the funeral scene was also great. Dr. Manhattan's story was cool and engaging. I wouldn't say that these were the greatest characters compared to other superhero movies but the concept of the movie and once you dig deep behind all the meanings, its really quite genius. Its worth seeing.",8,0,1,1 July 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Ten years later still the greatest movie of all time
","I'd give this movie an 11 if it were possible. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King lives up to its extremely long title. Its a LONG movie. Once you've seen the extended edition, there's no going back. Many key scenes were cut from the film. Even today, the special effect hold up better than many halfassed films on the market. Epic is the one word to define this franchise. For long I have debated whether the second or the third film is the best. I can't decide. The music is beyond words. Howard Shore has crafted one of the best original scores ever, up there next to Star Wars. The Lord of the Rings shows Hollywood how battle scenes are done. If you've never seen this, die in a hole. Long live the King.",10,1,2,1 July 2013
