The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Please READ
","Hey everyone.I went today to the cinema with pretty high expectatives from i have watched in the past movies(1st wan was pretty fine for me, and 2nd one, i think was even better). Leaving behind the fact of poor actings, i wasn't even sure if the film that i was watching WHOLE joke or what. But no, the minutes were passing, and i was still at this punishment based really really awful history filled with poorer scripts. I was counting every seconds to get out of that crap. Save money guys! I really mean it!! With that amount of money you would be able to buy a couple beer, hangout with and ugly girl, and you won't regret more than have watched that disaster movie.For the last, i have to say.
