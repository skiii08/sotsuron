United 93," Flight 93 A Disappointment
","I was very disappointed in this version of Flight 93. It is jumbled and confusing at best. There is no comparison to this version and the A&E Version. Do yourself a favor and watch the A&E Version, it is 10 times better. The A&E version covers more of the personal lives of the passengers and the loved ones they called from the plane, the Universal version barely touches on it. Half the time I could not understand what people were saying on the plane, it was too mixed up and confusing. Maybe that was the way it was on the plane - who knows, but as a movie it stinks this way. I am sure that the family members of those on that flight are disappointed as well. If I were a family member of any of those on Flight 93, I would think the A&E version does more justice to those who sacrificed their lives.",2,6,28,30 April 2006
Pretty Woman," A Very Good Romantic Comedy
","I have seen this movie many times and enjoyed it thoroughly. Julia Roberts gives a compelling performance as a hooker and Richard Gere as always is superb.What I enjoyed most about this movie was that here were two people that were not proud of what they had become but because of their need to be loved for the persons they really were deep inside, helped each other find themselves.I looked deeper into this movie and saw that it was not just a comedy but a story that people can change for the better when treated with tenderness, love and understanding something these two characters had not been shown for a very long time, mostly from their own bad choices, but not totally. How this movie goes about showing that, using the comedy touch is what moved me so much about this film.My favorite scene in this movie is when Edward (Gere) takes Vivian (Roberts) to an elegant restaurant for a business dinner. I think this scene is the funniest as well as the most touching scene in the movie.This movie shows that you shouldn't take people at face value and to look deeper into their character to find the real person.Sure this movie is a fairytale but it has deeper meaning as well, I rate this movie 9 out of 10. I have also seen Runaway Bride, which I think was actually a better romantic comedy because the characters were more believable and shows what I meant about not taking people at face value. I admit I prefer a deeper love story rather than a romantic comedy.If you are like me and like a deep love story and like Richard Gere than you must watch Sommersby, one of the best and most moving love stories I have ever seen and one of Richard Gere's best performances ever, if not his best.",10,1,3,11 July 2004
Shall We Dance," Best Romantic Comedy In Years
","I absolutely loved this movie and liked it better than the original. I enjoyed the fact that the movie showed that even though you may have a so called perfect life there could still be something missing which I think most of us feel at one time or another. I found this movie to be extremely funny and touching at the same time.This movie is more of a telling of peoples lives and emotions than a story of dance. The dance helps them to bring out their inner selves. I liked the fact that John Clark (Richard Gere) reflected back on the people that had wills done in his office and that the happier ones were the ones who took that extra step to get as much out of life as they could possibly do before it was too late.This is a story about a man who does take that extra step and follows his emotions. He sees a beautiful girl in a window three times from the train each night coming home from work and one night he gets off that train in hopes of meeting this girl who works in a dance studio. He ends up signing for dance lessons hoping to be able to dance with her and instead finds happiness in dance.The movie does an excellent job showing how John Clark (Richard Gere) and the others who are inept and shy and a little ashamed at the beginning become confident in themselves. The scenes in the dance studio are extremely funny. The movie goes on to tell how his wife Beverely (Susan Sarandon) thinks he is having an affair and hires a private detective.This movie shows how each of their lives have been affected by dance. The acting in this movie is superb. Richard Gere does an unbelievable job of dancing, he is terrific. His acting is second to none and this is the best romantic comedy I've ever seen him in. This is by far the best movie I've ever seen Jennifer Lopez in, she actually does a good job. Susan Sarandon was great and would love to see her and Richard Gere do more movies together. The rest of the supporting cast did an excellent job in their roles.I went to the pre showing of this movie and the theatre was packed and some people had to turn away because there were no more seats available but they did say they would be back to see the movie when it opened up. There was a lot of clapping and laughter during this movie and everyone I spoke to said they loved it, some even said they would be coming back to see it again, as will I.This was perfectly casted movie and you won't be sorry if you go and see it.This is a feel good inside movie, A MUST SEE.",10,13,26,6 October 2004
