Iron Man 3," Good movie.....sorry comic book fans
",Very good movie!!!!! Most people on here ripping the movie seem to be the comic book geeks who were upset that the mandarin was not portrayed as he was in the comic books!! One person was upset that they didn't display his 'ten rings'....really?? Sorry they didn't have Tony 'in his suit enough'! I enjoyed how they displayed Tony as vulnerable! Yes he does have anxiety attacks---and he can overcome them within a few minutes .....in response to another person on here who said that anxiety attacks could not resolve so quickly!!! The reviews and complaints about the movie on here is comical!!! Great movie Great movie,8,3,6,4 May 2013
