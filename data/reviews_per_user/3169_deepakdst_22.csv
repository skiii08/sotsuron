Blade Runner 2049," Wasted my 3 hours.
","Is it was necessary to stretch the running time to 3 hours if you do not have enough story. I mean the plot is so slow that even Sloth will feel bored.
Obviously visual effects were nice but is that the only thing that you want to put in the film. There was no good action, no good anything except the so called visuals. If you want me to praise this movie because of visual effects, then I am really sorry I can't find any reason to say it good.
My advice: please don't waisted your time.",3,4,11,9 February 2020
Captain Marvel," Good one.
",Actually first I thought it would be a boring overpraised movie but I realized that this one is good and funny thanks to Nick and The cat but the ending was weak. It is true that Larson is overconfident actress but this time it suited the character of Captain Marvel who needs to be tough and confident though she is not so good at comedy but I enjoyed her acting in this role. Don't get distracted by rumors try to enjoy this movie after all it's MCUüòçüòç.,9,3,8,28 August 2019
Us," Easy to understand but hard to explain.
","Obviously many of you are responsible for 6.9 rating of this movie, so I agree this movie is not tough enough but the story has it's own dangerous meaning. So let me clear that my 10* rating is for it's story.
After watching this movie once I had one question only what was the government project really but after reading some theories I got a lot of questions hidden in this movie.
Isn't it confusion why Jason gave that look at the end. So it is really a mess to understand 'Was Jason real or he was always Pluto?'. This is the biggest question of this movie and really hard to get answered. Why?
So Jason always behaved like he was not familiar with humans as he was unable to perform the trick, can't catch the beat and was not good with his language. So I think Jason was also swapped just like Red and I think the Red done this as it seems unfair that Pluto's face was burned in the tunnel where I don't think any type of fire was seen. I think Red done this just because Real Jason was burned and she cannot handle that.
So this movie has hidden secrets, which are really a mess to understand and that is special.
But I am disappointed at the fact that Only one family survived the attack and all others were dead. Is it even possible?",9,2,6,7 February 2020
Knives Out," Perfect.
","I am really satisfied with this movie as I was so curious to see this new popular cast working together.
For about 1hour 40minutes I was shocked that why Craig's character is behaving like a ordinary person and not like a detective mind but then the bomb exploded and the really mind came out.
I am really sad that the old man died only because of a misunderstanding but whatever now Marta is the new Queen.
I am not pointing the story but I think the plot could had been more interesting if the secret of Marta was revealed in the last but whatever it was a nice one.",10,2,6,13 February 2020
Orphan," Little Criminal Mind.
","I loved the plot and acting üò±üò± Isabelle has done such a great work even it is impossible to describe it. She has done beyond excellence acting.
The story was really awesome but the concept of 33 years old and seducing men was not really nice. There was no need of her age to be 33 years even a child having such a disturbing mind was a good twist.
I am also surprised to see the ending with no hints of post drama life, I mean such a good story needs a proper ending with some hints on how her life will be after the incident.",10,0,0,29 November 2019
Crash," This world is so small.
","The movie explain how we all effects each other's lives in this world. Every action we do have a equal reaction and we should we careful about what we are doing.
Sometimes we need to look on those people who stand by us in bad time because they are our real friends not those who just smile on meeting you but never ever think about you.
Discrimination is really a very harsh thing and I am happy that at least now people think about how much it hurts. It is really nice to see that this world is changing and becoming a place where only humans lives not a person who is judged by his/her caste, religion, colour, etc.",10,1,1,16 December 2019
Suicide Squad," Slow blast.
","The film was really a slow one, it may be 'cause it's the first to describe these characters but believe me the only one who shines through the the film is Harley(Margot), she had done wonderful acting even more better than Deadshot (Will) and the story is poor with very little fighting scenes. Whatever DC will shine soon.",9,0,1,26 August 2019
Avengers: Endgame," The level no one can think.
","As expected this movie is above all theories and expectations. Who could have thought that this movie have such a great plot. It is something unexpected. The only think I observed wrong is the nature difference of two Thanos. Infinity War's Thanos was Smart, Knowledgeable and this one though smart but is very cruel. This one only wants disasters. Else is good especially Thorrrrüòçüòç.",10,2,3,27 July 2019
District 9," Praiseworthy!
","I should appreciate the direction of this film before anything because it is really a difficult work to present something in a different way and this movie fulfilled this requirement of presenting something new and unique.
Obviously story forms a major part of a film and many films fails due to ill writing but this film was based on a really good story with various good facts that how humans hate everything they find inappropriate. Even it is definate that today we search for aliens but when we will find them, that very moment we will start criticising them for there look or way of living. This is the real face of humanity that it always wants the superior position.",10,0,1,27 September 2019
Toy Story 4," Perfect happy ending!
",His movie was awesome and perfectly managed to cover a huge story. Even it is the second best movie in the franchise after part 2nd. The journey was awesome with many twists and excitement. The most important part was the ending which ask you to discover more of you rather than sticking to a single point.,10,45,87,29 June 2019
Aladdin," Magical.
","The setup was awesome with amazing CGI. Theme, songs, magic, jokes, friendship, romance, what else a film needs to be great entertainment. These 2 hours in Theater were like a magical experience. This movie is a must watch big screen experience.",10,2,5,8 July 2019
The Lion King," Average.
","Movie was average nothing special than animated movie except graphics. But I gave it 7 'cause -1 for it's predictable story, -1 for action, -1 for slow and short plot. You will never connect to it's plot.",7,3,9,30 July 2019
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Masterpiece.
","I am really sad that I watched this movie after 11 years of it's release and I regret it because this movie is far beyond any movie in this world. When you watch it you realize that you are reading a book brought out to the life with a fabulous art work and not only this, each dialogue and monologue is a phrase that literally means something.
Story is awesome with a lot of moral values. It shows you wherever you start you reach the same end as others do, whatever you face makes you strong and whatever you see never leave your memory because it does not matters how many difficulties and problems you face but life never stops and it's up to you how you explore it.
Apart from that I noticed a thing that either it be Elizabeth or Daisy, they both achieved a lot even after failures. Daisy lost her dream but she taught her students and indirectly she lived with her dream throughout her life. Elizabeth failed by just a little but she finally reached her goal and made it possible in her old age which is also a record. So it does not means that one failure ends your life but gives you a chance to fulfill your dream at a much more bigger level than you would have.
Masterpiece, this is what this movie is and I will never forgot 'the old guy was struck by lightning seven times'.",10,0,0,31 October 2019
Grave of the Fireflies," So much effective.
","This is really a very powerful Anti-war movie.
The government that just give the orders to bomb a city, never get a thought about the Father, mother and the children left alone this selfish World just because they don't have the power to stop the war. This movie explain the condition and thinking of those teenagers who were forced to take the responsibility of their whole family.
This movie is full of emotions, it can even make the devil cry. And the last part of this movie is just awesome. The girl child was forced to think Stones and sand are rice balls and food 'cause of this so called war.
I will suggest you to please watch this film at least one time in your life. And if you understand Hindi then go search for fan dub and I assure you, you will never regret after watching.",10,1,1,22 August 2019
The Dark Knight," Why so serious!!!!!
","If you think 'Batman is our Universe',
Then believe me 'Joker is Sun of this Universe'.
And their chemistry, physics, geography is what you see in this movie.
This movie is a masterpiece of DC universe.",10,0,0,8 June 2019
The Matrix Reloaded," Action packed.
",The film was awesome from sci-fi action point of view. The stutns and fights were amazing but the story was not perfectly able to connect with the franchise. You will not be able to know what is going on if you have not seen first film.,9,0,0,29 July 2019
Joker," Finally a tribute to the craziest, happiest, biggest Villian of DC.
","As expected the film was a masterpiece with a very dark tone. What makes this movie super awesome is Arthur's delusions, actually it is more difficult to get what really happened. Everything that makes him happy seems to be an illusion, so we do not know he was really saved in the ending or he reached asylum that very night.
But it is a pure reality that all murders were real. So yes he is The Joker or he is the role model of the real Joker. The most interesting part was the connection of Thomas and his wife's murder with Arthur's story.
I enjoyed the movie with twists and turns and jokes.",10,2,4,12 October 2019
It Chapter Two," It ends here.
","Many peoples are not happy with Its long duration but they should think that even it is not a origin story still they managed such a long plot 'cause they were able to put scary scenes from the very beginning and though It is long I enjoyed every second like I enjoyed Endgame because every single second is important.
The ending and the acting of Bill as Pennywise is beyond praises. This movie is surely a must watch movie. This series has put the level of Horror at the sky thanks to it's big budget otherwise many horror movies just depends on there tune and makeup but this series showed us the real fear that is above ghosts.But the truth that no one can ignore is The first chapter was the most scary movie of all time and I don't think any film would be able to dethrone it because of It's ending where every character found their strength in their own imagination.",10,17,32,10 September 2019
Parasite," Black mirror of this society.
","This movie is the real picture of this society. Some of them loose their homes and sleep in public places and others find the same rain refreshing in their cars.
Some of them say they are their where they should be but never see the potential those peoples have. They are sleeping hungry just because no one gives them chance. Kim family told how easily they can get what rich peoples have but they should not be there because they are weak and deserve that lower place.
That girl of park family fall in love with Kim's son but just because he was sitting near her what if he was a servant she would have kicked him, as simple as that. We talk about changes but still fear what this society thinks and somewhere we know we can rise but that sound never comes out just because of this noise of them.
Many morals this movie can give but for me the best part was this brain is a bridge and as soon as we increase our thinking 'A cockroach can eat the food of Those rich pets'",10,1,3,19 March 2020
Life," Nice one.
",Movie was really good in scary theme. The direction was also good. I don't felt bored any second.,9,7,10,5 August 2019
Warcraft," Give us a sequel.
",I don't know why this movie was not a box office success but the only thing I want is to watch it's sequel because that little child in the ending shows how powerful it's sequel will be. I wish we will see it's sequel because it's doesn't seems right to lose such a interesting franchise,10,3,4,26 July 2019
The Martian," Simple, unique, different and interesting.
",Yes the story is not more than the survival on Mars but the whole story has it's own interesting side. This is really a good one for those who are found of science and astrology because many topics were really interesting from the scientific point of view. It is nothing like boring even after revolving around a single person.,10,0,1,29 October 2019
