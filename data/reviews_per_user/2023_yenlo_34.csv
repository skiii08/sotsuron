The Sound of Music," Syrup!
",A good film but beware it's loaded with a very heavy dose of syrup. The characters are plastic and somewhat on the non-believable side. The scenery is perhaps the best part of the film. Based on a true story it wavers much from the actual true tale of the Von Trapp family. Yet to be a musical it would have to.,5,19,48,7 September 2000
Meet the Parents," Yeah it is a comedy but it's hard to root for a wimp.
",As several other reviewers stated this film while it has its funny moments it is not a comedy classic but still it is not bad at all.  Any normal male would have been `outa there' after the first few encounters with the parents and certainly after the pool volleyball game. That is perhaps the most interesting element of the film is that the Ben Stiller character continues to put up with all of it and makes the viewer want to shout out 'TELL EM OFF YOU WIMP'. However any guy with any self-respect would inform their girl friend that if they do in fact end up getting married it is with the understanding that he is going to have nothing to do with her family.   The Greg character putting up with so much made him hard to root for or feel sorry for and it was impossible to side with her parents' side/clan.  Again it's comedy so should be viewed that way however even in a comedy nobody can side with a total wimp.  A great scene for the viewer would have been to have had the Stiller character go off on the parents' etc the way Stiller goes off on the airline rep.,Null,1,2,26 January 2004
12 Angry Men," The presiding judge sets the stage for what takes place.
",A young man is accused of murdering his father and the twelve all male jury is given the task of rendering a verdict. At the start of the film the judge (played by Rudy Bond) speaks to the jury before sending them to begin their deliberations. When watching this motion picture pay close attention to what the judge says when he speaks to the twelve men.,8,0,0,13 August 2001
The Natural," Baseball fiction but not far off fact.
",While not exactly faithful to the novel by Bernard Malamud this still comes off as an exceptional baseball movie. Good characters all around make this film what it is. Wilford Brimley is outstanding as Pop Fischer. Great scenes include Hobbs getting his Knights cap in the locker room and being told by the equipment manager 'Welcome to the Majors'. Not exactly like he had planned but he was finally there and knew it in his own special way. His bubble gum card being cranked out blended along with footage of him becoming the Knights savior. Something he had obviously imagined happening as a younger man. His first uneasy meeting with Pop and his right hand man Red. Feeling out of place in an environment he loves. His dinner with Red when he tells him 'Red it took me sixteen years to get here..You play me you'll get the best I've got.' Knowing what he's up against but hoping he'll get the chance. If you're a baseball fan you can't pass this one up. If you're in a real baseball mood watch this one along with Fear Strikes Out featuring Anthony Perkins and Karl Malden. Another baseball film filled with triumph and tragedy.,Null,0,0,21 June 1999
The Hustler," 'This is a Pool movie mister'
","Jackie Gleason deserved the Academy Award for his performance in this film and didn't get it.  Now that that's out of the way. This is one great movie. Right from the start when Paul Newman as Fast Eddie Felson and his manager Charlie played by Myron  McCormick stop in at a local bar/poolhall and a quick hustle is made on the locals headed up by Vincent Gardenia  the story never weakens.  The bleakness of the Ames pool hall is captured to a T  in the  Black and White photography.   George C. Scott is masterful as Bert Gordon a big time gambler who is  the backer of Gleasons character Minnesota Fats.  Piper Laurie, Michael Constantine, Murray Hamilton  costar and look for a quick appearance by the Raging Bull himself Jake La Motta as a bartender.  Years later Newman reprised his role as Fast Eddie in  The Color of Money and was rewarded with an Oscar but this film is vastly superior. Grab your favorite distilled neutral spirit  J.T.S. Brown maybe sit back and enjoy because `This is a  Pool  movie  Mister'",8,2,4,23 September 1999
The Terminator," The role Arnold was born to play.
",Arnold Schwarzenegger was born to play this character. Without him in the title role this picture would be all but forgotten.  Paul Winfield delivers the best performance of the supporting cast but his character had very little on screen time. The sequel had more FX but personally this one is better. I'd pick this film over Titanic as James Camerons best work.,7,1,2,26 May 2000
The Best Years of Our Lives," Three lives altered some for the better some for the worse.
","From William Wyler comes a true American classic motion picture. The tale of three G.I.'s returning to their hometown after serving in WWII. Each must adapt to their new lives which have been forever altered by their war time experience. The film is now over fifty years old but its story and message is just as new as when this film came out. Two of the three G.I.'s future seems somewhat secure. Frederic March as Al Stephenson an Army Sergeant returns to his family although a little changed due to the natural process of maturing regarding his children. He returns to his job in a bank and even though he is hitting the booze a little the viewer gets the feeling that he will settle down in time and because of his war experience will be a better man for it.    Harold Russell himself a wounded veteran portrays Homer Parrish a Navy veteran who lost both hands during a sea battle.  He will be provided for financially by a disability pension and even though his life will never be what it was before losing both hands the viewer also gets the feeling that he will make out in time.  Then there is the Dana Andrews character Army Air Force Captain Fred Derry the only officer of the three.  He was nothing more than an attendant at the local drug store soda fountain before his country called.  He now returns to his hometown an Officer and a Gentleman and decorated war hero.  Sadly that's about all he has going for him.  This was the one character as I watched this film and thought `Now this guy would have been better off to have stayed in the service'  Of course he probably for the purpose of the story had been forced out due to man power cutting. 
  I found his plight the most interesting.  He looks full of confidence and intelligence in his dress uniform but when he steps out of it and dons civilian attire he resembles nothing more than a down on his luck schmuck. Perhaps no other actor during the time this film was made could have pulled that off except Dana Andrews.  He gives every indication that he will be come one of  many WWII veterans who returned to their hometowns and found life boring and mundane compared to the 100% life living experience of being in the military during time of war. Eventually many would wind up hanging out at the local American Legion or VFW posts knocking back the booze and reliving perhaps for many literally the best years of their lives.  The triple story line is handled very well with their paths crossing during the course of the film.  Romance, marital woes even a brief questioning of America's involvement in WWII  are also included in the picture.  A story such as this would never have been told on the silver screen before or even during the war but it showed that films were changing in both content and depiction.",8,2,3,18 November 1999
Empire of the Sun," Spielbergs finest
",I generally dont find myself viewing Steven Spielberg films more than once. This film (and Duel) on the other hand I do. The critics went after it and it didnt do as well at the box office as so many of his other productions have done.  Yet to me anyway this is Speilbergs finest.,Null,2,6,3 April 2000
The Godfather: Part II," Sequel and Prequel.
",Godfather Part II is a sequel but it is also a prequel at the same time. The story of young Vito Corleone portrayed by Robert DeNiro from his violence enhanced  humble beginnings to his rise as a mob boss is told along with the tale of son Michael  who is now firmly in charge as Don of the Corleone Family.  Brilliant cinematography with great acting makes this certainly the best PART TWO film ever.  Michael V. Gazzo is particularly memorable as Frank Pentangeli a  Capo in the Corleone family who was neither seen nor mentioned in the first film has now taken over the duties of the deceased Pete Clemenza. Lee Strasberg the legendary acting coach and teacher turns in a top performance himself as Hyman Roth friend  yet enemy to Michael .  Gastone Moschin as Fanucci a moustache Pete of the early mob days who young Vito must confront.  G.D. Spradlin as Nevada Senator Pat Geary who's pleasant smile holds his slick veneer.  Dominic Chianese as Johnny Ola `Sicilian Messenger Boy' to the powerful Roth.      Part Two is a much more complex picture than the first as many more characters are involved in the dual story line.   At one point Gazzo's character Pentangeli comments that `The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire'.  The Roman Empire however fell.  Godfather Part II will never fall.,9,0,0,5 October 1999
Fargo," You gotta see Fargo!
",So everyone comes up to me and says `Geez you gotta see Fargo' so I go and rent it and it's a darn good movie about this Bozo who wants his wife kidnapped so he can get money from her rich father to get himself out of debt.  Only it don't go so good for him cause he hires two other Bozos to do the kidnapping and everything starts going wrong.  Then this local lady police chief who's got a bun in the oven and I don't mean crescent rolls either starts putting all the mistakes these Bozos are making together and things start looking real good for her to solve this crime but not too good for the Bozos. So after it was over I thought `well that was a pretty darn good movie'.  So now I see people and tell them `Geez you gotta see Fargo'. End a story.,9,0,2,6 August 1999
Cast Away," Lack of the Survival aspect.
","While Cast Away is an entertaining film the love story portion between the Tom Hanks character and Helen Hunts character seemed (getting down to brass tacks) to do very little for the over all story.  The ending, which was also pointless, went on way too long and likewise served no purpose.  The film shows that Hanks Chuck Noland survives for four years on the island but offers only glimpses as to how he does it. Instead of a tale of survival the viewer is given the old standard two people in love separated by an act of fate with one eventually giving up and finding someone else then the other returns looking for their old flame.  This picture does not rank up there as a  great movie about survival but it seems it could have had that been the emphasis.",Null,0,0,18 June 2001
The Thing," Mind tugging terror
","A great SciFi Horror film that never really got the accolades it deserved. I first saw this film when it came out in 82 and since have purchased my own copy. I always make it a point to watch it just prior to the start of winter. I was always surprised the critics blasted it as bad as they did. As time passes however it seems that this film becomes more and more of a classic SciFi/Horror motion picture. It also had a classic Hitchcock type ending. If you can watch this film during a snow storm do it, then go out into the woods and light off a flare and walk around. See if you're not scared!",9,0,1,26 April 1999
Heartbreak Ridge," A bit of a disappointment yet enjoyable to watch.
",I was serving on a U.S. Navy ship at the time when two scenes for this motion picture were filmed onboard.  It was an exciting day when the crew was told that Malpaso productions and the Mayor of Carmel Ca were to arrive and use the ship for the filming of an upcoming movie. We were told that we would be allowed to watch the filming and to extend all courtesies to the filming crew.  However after the film came out I had to admit I was somewhat disappointed.  It actually had nothing to do whatsoever with HeartBreak Ridge and resembled a 50's era B war movie.  The overall plot was something that had been essentially done before i.e. aging War veteran is assigned to shape up a platoon of misfits and malcontents who desire to serve and do good but lack motivation and discipline which of course will be provided by aging veteran.  They at first resist and despise their new teacher then come around to accept and embrace him as their mentor.   Along with the main plot are subplots involving Clint Eastwoods character locking horns with a young Major who regards him as an antiquated military man and Marsha Mason as his ex wife (who was more convincing in her military spouse role in Cinderella Liberty) who still cares for him but grew tired of sharing him with his real true love The Marines.  It was set in present times and I found it hard to take that any one who served in Korea still on active duty would only be an E-7 and still be in a Combat role.  Also a Marine Recon unit is an elite well trained well disciplined lot and their behavior would be nothing like that exhibited by this bunch led by Mario Van Peebles who does however turn in a great performance.  But it's a Clint Eastwood movie and there is always something about Clint Eastwood movies that make them entertaining to watch and Yup Heart Break Ridge is one of them.,Null,0,0,23 May 2002
Cross of Iron," A fight for their own desperate lives.
",In this Sam Peckinpah film a German platoon is fighting against growing odds as the crack of doom begins to widen against Germany in WWII. Their combat engagements are on the eastern front against the Russians. Maximilian Schell is cast as an aristocratic officer who cares only about winning an Iron Cross for family pride. James Coburn is Sergeant Steiner a decorated soldier and leader of the group much like 'Kat' in All Quiet on the Western Front who could care less about his decorations. James Mason as Colonel Brandt is an officer who knows the war is essentially lost but goes through the motions because he's a professional career officer and that's what's expected of him. David Warner as Captain Kiesel is burned out from war and has become oblivious to it's horrors. This is a film that requires the viewer to watch and watch with concentration to get the full meaning. Like other Peckinpah films it has violence but the violence is second to the story of men who fight not for the glory of the German Army or the Third Reich or the Fatherland but for their own desperate lives.,Null,0,1,1 July 1999
The Dirty Dozen," Entertaining war flick.
",This picture shouldn't be taken seriously as a war film but does entertain. A good cast headed up by Lee Marvin in the role he's probably most remembered for. (even though he won an Oscar for Cat Ballou) A group of American G.I. convicts are offered a way out of their sentences if they volunteer for a somewhat suicide mission. They of course agree and the film highlights their training with at first reluctance and apprehension about each other and their leader Major Reisman. Eventually they bond as best they can and go on their mission. Who makes it who doesn't? What helps keep the film going is that the locations constantly keep changing. From the prison compound to the training site to an Army base to a War game location to the mission location itself. No it's not the greatest war film ever but it is one that's always great to watch.,8,0,2,6 October 1999
Man on the Moon," The real one wasn't all that spectacular and neither is this picture.
",A truly horrible motion picture. Andy Kaufman in life was allright but was nothing so spectacular that a major motion picture of his life should be made. However one was and this film despite all the hype it got falls flat everywhere. I can't imagine anyone who did not know of the real Kaufman watching this picture and coming away with anything but 'What is this all about anyway and who was this guy and why do people think he was so great',Null,0,0,17 April 2002
The Longest Day," Well done semi documentary style with good acting
",To present the D-Day invasion on screen from as many scales as it was is a monumental task. Darryl F. Zanuck did it about as good as it could ever be done. He presented it semi-documentary with the right amount of subplots using a selection of some of the best actors at the time in various cameo roles. No one actor is the star of this film. The result is an epic war film that should be seen by any one who enjoys war/military films. The film does not honor one side more than the other but simply tells the story of events that day from the nations that took part.,8,3,6,18 May 1999
Titanic," Lacked believability.
","Not the greatest film of all time but then again not the worse. Titanic is, at best, an average movie which contains some pretty impressive special effects. The story however is not believable and neither are the characters. It was way too long for one thing. I do applaud James Cameron for target marketing this film toward the right audience i.e. the teenage/younger crowd which is where it made its money. That of course IS the bottom line. This film probably isn't even the best one about the tragic event. Years from now people may view this movie and say 'How did this win the Academy Award for Best Picture that year?'",4,1,4,23 June 1999
Rocky III," Rocky's intelligence improves via more blows to the head.
","In Rocky II after his amazing fight against the heavyweight champion of the world club fighter Rocky Balboa is suddenly thrust into the spotlight for his fifteen minutes of fame.  Agents sign him to endorse various products yet he is quickly fired when it becomes apparent that he can barely read. Now in this third installment at the beginning of the film he can be seen doing one successful TV commercial after another.  Well how did he suddenly become so smart or at least smart enough to be able to film the TV advertisements that he couldn't do only a short while earlier?  I guess all the extra punches in the head during his second Apollo Creed fight and his subsequent title defenses must have helped.  Two more films followed this one but none even came close to the first, which won the Oscar for best picture in 1976.  Mr. T plays a sort of Mike Tyson character who wants Rocky's crown but will he get it and if he does then what?",Null,0,1,15 April 2002
The Godfather: Part III," May have been better if made earlier.
",After watching this film the first time all I could think of was that Francis Ford Coppola waited too long to make it. It's not a bad film but it seems detached from the original and Part II. The actors seemed to be out of touch with their characters but clearly did the best they could considering the time frame between Part II and III. I came away with the feeling that had he made this motion picture four or five years after Part II it would have been a better film. Of course the story may have been different but who knows. However it's still a Godfather film by Francis Ford Coppola and still worth watching.,Null,6,11,11 October 1999
Rosemary's Baby," Gothic Gold
",This is Gothic Horror at it's best. The fact that as a viewer you never see any thing actually horrifying is what makes this such a scary film. Mia Farrow puts forth her best performance by far. Then there is of course Ruth Gordon who delivers one of the greatest performances ever by an actress on the big screen.  From her first scene right up to her last (check out how she uses  her finger to try and remove the knife mark from the floor). Rosemary has no allies on her side except the viewer and there is nothing we can do to help her.  Roman Polanski's greatest achievement.,9,0,1,20 May 1999
All Quiet on the Western Front," With the passage of time this film holds it's own.
",This motion picture is nearly 70 years old and the message it sends is still as powerful as it was when it first came out. An anti-war film that was years ahead of it's time. Younger audiences would probably not be able to identify any of the actors/actresses in this film and the 1979 TV version remake may be better suited for them as the story is the same one with a few minor variations. Many of the old films from the 30's become harder to watch and enjoy simply because of their age and film techniques. However this one continues to hold it's own.,9,1,3,20 August 1999
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Historically inaccurate but great film.
",While this film is loaded with historical inaccuracies it nonetheless remains a great motion picture.  Many fine performances and the dual story line make it the picture that it is.  However don't view it for historic purposes.  The true story of the bridge and railway built by POW's is more brutal and horrifying than what is presented here.  The History Channel has an excellent presentation about the actual story.   By all means watch this film but don't pass up learning the real story.,9,8,12,3 May 2000
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Best picture of all the best
","I cannot believe that this motion picture was not selected by the AFI as the number one film of all time. I was further shocked that it was only 20th. This film was perfectly cast perfectly acted, directed, edited etc. Simply put, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is the greatest film of all time.",10,1,3,28 April 1999
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Not bad but it can't match Hammer Studios.
",It's not the best Dracula film ever and certainly doesn't match anything Hammer Studios put out. Yet it's not the worst. I came away with the feeling that the special effects were really trying to give it that Gothic Horror atmosphere which I don't think it can. I'll say one thing I wouldn't have set one toe in the castle after getting a look at the Count let alone sit there and have a chicken dinner!,Null,0,1,30 October 2000
Stalag 17," Trademark Billy Wilder.
","William Holden won an academy award for his portrayal of a cynical Army Air Force sergeant who is cooped up with a whole bunch of other Army Air Force Sergeants in a German POW camp.  This Billy Wilder classic has both moments of drama and humor which was a Wilder trademark along with witty dialog. 
  Things haven't been going quite right in Holdens barracks. The Germans seem to know everything that the POW's try to do to escape, relay information etc.  The barracks head honcho and his right-hand men believe a stoolie is among them and the entrepreneurial Holden is suspect number one.  A collection of fine character actors to include Harvey Lembeck, Neville Brand and Robert Strauss (who was nominated for an Oscar in this picture) make up the gang.  A young Peter Graves co-stars along with Otto Preminger as the camp commandant.",9,7,13,23 September 1999
Paths of Glory," Showcases military greed
",A Kubrick masterpiece and top notch anti-war film as good as All Quiet on the Western Front. This film looks to leadership as a Great White Shark looks to a seal. Military greed abounds as high ranking WW1 French officers play games with the lives and deaths of others whom they deem as just so much useless scum. Unlike All Quiet on the Western Front which dealt with what the average soldier endured in the First World War this one shows how the average soldier got put into those situations.,Null,0,0,8 November 2001
The Deer Hunter," Non-Realistic.
","I rented this film recently after seeing it many years ago. While it is a well-made well acted film somehow the whole story comes off as unrealistic, to me anyway. Had this story been set during WWII it may have been believable but not during the Vietnam War! How many guys who were tight knit like this bunch who worked together, partied together, hunted together left steady good paying jobs to enlist in the Army during that time period? Had they all been drafted OK but to just say, 'Hey were quitting our jobs to go into the Army and fight in Vietnam' Come on! If that had been the case the Army wouldn't have needed a draft. (With one of them even getting married before he goes into the Army). Then they all stay together throughout Basic, Infantry training etc and then 'ALL' become rangers, remain together once sent in to Vietnam and all get captured together? Because of the quality of people in this film it was a good motion picture but I viewed it this time as a somewhat far fetched non-believable tale.",6,1,3,16 April 2001
Thirteen Days," Interesting historical picture.
",While this is an interesting film to watch it only captured the U.S. side of the crisis and contained nothing about what was happening in the Kremlin. The story of the crisis over the years has been beaten to death by documentaries and interviews of virtually everyone who was involved so it didn't really contain anything original.  In the 1974 made for TV film `The Missiles of October'  John F and Robert Kennedy were the principal characters where in this version presidential advisor Kenny O'Donnell is clearly given the lead role.  It's good for the historical aspect and had some action footage but don't pass up seeing the 74 docudrama.,Null,0,0,4 September 2001
Apollo 13," Excellent film about a great NASA accomplishment.
",By far the finest film made about an actual space travel mission mainly because this had the always-important life and death drama element. The Right Stuff (which also starred Ed Harris) was a great film about actual space travel events but its appeal was more on the historical nostalgic aspect of things.   Having been in High School when this i.e. Apollo 13 took place I remember that while it was carried on the news it was not around the clock coverage something that was just not all that frequent then like it is today.   Great film making and direction by Ron Howard.  Great performances all around.   While watching this film give some thought to what was actually accomplished and also what was accomplished by the entire manned space flight program between 1961 and 1972.  These were years before the computer technology that is enjoyed today existed.  It is now the year 2002 yet we are not in space as it was portrayed in 2001 A Space Odyssey.  In fact it has been 30 yrs since anyone has walked on the moon.  Were the accomplishments such as those of Apollo 13 all for nothing or is man truly going to venture out and visit the moon again along with the planets and their moons as well? Let's hope so.,Null,0,0,24 June 2002
The Thin Red Line," A thin tad too long.
","Having read James Jones novel The Thin Red Line and finding it the weakest of his trilogy (From Here To Eternity, The Thin Red Line & Whistle) I wasn't expecting much from this film.  For a war picture it tends to drag in many spots, is too long and the message isn't always clear as to what the director is trying to tell his audience.  The filming of the combat scenes are good however.  John Travolta cast as an Army General is almost laughable. He would have fit in as that character in Spielbergs `1941' but not here. Likewise George (Yes it's me girls in BDU's no less, aren't I handsome?) Clooney makes an appearance for no other apparent reason but to add another well known name to the cast. It's not overall a bad picture but had it been not quite so long would have been better.",Null,0,1,6 March 2000
Goodfellas," OUTSTANDING!

Jurassic Park," DYNA-HYPE! Big let down!
",Plenty of hype was made about this film when it came out that it was almost as if P.T. Barnum himself was behind it.  Needless to say it was not 'The Greatest Film of All Time'. It sadly strayed far from the fine novel it was based on. Good actors were on hand but were only there as furnishings for the Spielberg special effects. All attempts at suspense were on the level of a childrens Saturday morning TV show. Years from now it could very well find itself on MST3K (If MST3K is revived of course),2,11,45,20 September 1999
The Godfather," Art in the form of a motion picture
",Clearly a film masterpiece in every sense of the word. Superb filming of each scene.
