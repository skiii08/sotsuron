The Blair Witch Project," The Film that launched one of the worst trends in filmmaking
","This is one of the most awful overrated, over touted, and waste of a viewers time ever made. The only credit I give to this movie is that it actually fooled a lot of people into thinking it was a true story and it launched the worst trend ever in the industry now known as the 'Found footage' movie or what I call it: 'The new excuse to make a really bad movie' trend.This movie is not scary at all. I felt like a genius when I waited for this to come out on DVD, because as I expected, it was horrible. I do say that at the time it was a genius idea and it was something new. It is one of those ideas that should have just stayed that, an idea.I can't believe people got conned into this crap. The acting was poor, it was basically shot as a home movie. Do you enjoy when your friends break out the family vacation videos? No, I didn't think so. So why do I want to watch a movie that is about the same thing.Was it scary...not even close. I have seen Disney cartoons that are scarier than this. If fact this movie was credited for making movie goers sick because of the bouncing around poor quality photography.If you want to see scary home video's go down to the local Walmart and ask to see their security tapes, they are bound to be more interesting and far more nightmarish then this heap of dung.Like my reviews, Hate em?

Stop-Loss," Flat out anti-military propaganda, with no basis in facts
","OK, This movie was made simply as a propaganda piece. Plain and simple. The basic premise is that a 'Stoploss' is a back door draft and forces people to stay in the Military longer than their initial contract length. Well, this falls flat on fact due to the fact that everyone ( at least before the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan) all sign the same contract that states that whatever their active duty contract length is, it can be extended due to the needs of the Military. Every Military contract ( regardless of active duty length) signs up for 8 years. Period, the military, government,and right wing conspirators (thrown in for you conspiracy nuts) are not , and did not dupe anyone. These are facts not even taken into consideration for this movie, and it portrays members of the military as victims, which is entirely untrue. I know, I was in the military at the time and was stoplossed.The acting in this film was horrible, Channing Tatum was the typical meat-head, but hey that is what he probably is in real life. Ryan Philipe shows why he doesn't do movies more often, and his wife Reese Witherspoon probably has to make up excuses for his bad performance. Joseph Gordon Levitt ( who is a decent actor) was type cast as the typical nerd, I just joined to be with my jock friends, character, Kinda like Screech from saved by the bell. The movie presents some PTSD issues but it does it in a typical liberal, hatred for the Military fashion and plays up the 'victim' part.Basically it is just part of the Anti-Military, anti-war crowds new method, instead of spitting on soldiers like they did during Vietnam, they look down on them and cast them as movie victims.If you want to see this movie I suggest you illegally download it so none of the filmmakers can make anymore money off it.",2,1,4,1 September 2012
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Entertaining and fun
","I thought I was going to hate this movie but I was wrong. Turns out it was a fun and entertaining movie to watch. It doesn't take itself to seriously and is much better than sitting around watching a boring 'Twilight' vampire depression fest.The story is about a boy Abraham Lincoln, who witness the murder of his mother by a vampire. A Young Lincoln, now older, plots his revenge and in a drunk failed attempt is rescued by Henry Sturges(Dominic Cooper). Henry makes a pact to teach Lincoln to kill vampires, but only those that Henry tells him to, and eventually he will get his chance to reap revenge. Lincoln(Benjamin Walker) grows older, gets married, and studies to be a lawyer, to find that Vampires are on the side of the Confederates and he vows to save humanity from their grasp.The action and acting is over the top but in a good way. The sets, editing, and script have a fun appeal and feels sort of like a comic book story which makes it not so serious but very entertaining. This movie was made to be fun, and it accomplishes that.The only thing that scares me about this movie is that our education system is so bad that I would hate to think these kids would grow up and the only thing they may know about Lincoln is that he was a Vampire Hunter. So enjoy the movie, have fun watching it, but don't let your kids think it is fact ;)...It's an 8 for me.",8,2,4,27 October 2012
In Bruges," Decent Comedy/Drama
","This one wasn't bad. I read a lot of reviews that raved for this movie. I don't think it was that great but it was still a relatively good Comedy/Drama. It's got some good looking women, hit men, a even a midget, or dwarf, or little person depending on what you prefer.Colin Farrel plays Ray a hit-man who travels with a fellow hit-man Ken (Brendan Gleeson) to Bruges, Belgium to complete a job for their boss (Ralph Fiennes) Harry. Ray completes the job but is grief stricken when he inadvertently makes a mistake taking out and innocent bystander. Now, his friend and partner Ken is tasked with a hit on Ray. Choices need to be made and it takes both men through quite a mix of characters on the way to a conclusion.It sounds like a pretty grim, more action based drama, but it's not. The comedy aspects are pretty good ala a good Quentin Tarantino, and like his films is pretty dialog heavy, but worth listening to. There wasn't a lot of action in this one, but it is a pretty smart, funny, and intelligent movie. A 7 is the best I can give this one, but a 7 for me is definitely worth a view.",7,0,2,11 October 2012
The Hunger Games," something original? well somewhat anyway
","I will admit to not having read the book, but for me this was a refreshing movie in the wake of a Hollywood that seems out of any real ideas.Sure, I know a lot o people who have read the book are somewhat disappointed with the movie, but for me, I liked it. I only rate it a 9 out of 10 due to some clear storyline stealing from other books and films, but altogether I think this is a movie that clearly stands tall in a sea of remakes, already dones, and uninspiring performances.Now there are some stolen aspects that I did notice. It steals a political plot very close to that of the Orwellian 1984, a bit of the Wizard of Oz's Emerald city, and even a little Sheakspearean Romeo and Juliet thrown into the mix, but all told not too bad Let's face it, if you are going to take inspiration from others, those are not bad ones to use. My only real negative is that I wish it was a little longer and maybe a little more back story on how we got to this point in the authors created world, but knowing Hollywood we will probably see many sequels and or prequals because the movie business likes to ride the money horse until it is dead tenfold. I only hope they don't do that to this movie.",9,2,6,21 August 2012
Argo," Ben Affleck, a job well done!
","'Argo,' is based on a true story of the CIA's scramble to rescue a group of 6 staff members who escaped the 1979 Iranian takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Iran.The Good: This is a well crafted thriller. The mood of tension throughout is wonderful and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The acting was top notch, and even Ben Affleck himself turns in a wonderful performance. The scenes inside Iran were done well and really shows the chaos, brutality, and anti-Americanism of the time period following the Islamic Revolution. The lead-in was sound as it really doesn't sugar coat the British and American involvement that led to the revolution.The Bad: The only bad thing I can say about this movie was on a stylistic note on one aspect. In the scenes of building the cover story they tried to use the music of the time period in a style kind of like other movies such as 'Casino,' and 'Oceans 11.' That part kind of fell flat for me and seemed really out of place from the rest of the movie and that's the only point deduction for me.I've read a lot of other reviews where they take a few shots at historical accuracy, but let's face it, Hollywood always takes some liberties to pump up the entertainment value, and if you want complete and total accuracy watch a documentary instead. Others have to say they portrayed the Iranians as a hysterical mob and didn't play up the U.S. involvement that really led to the Revolution, but those people must have missed the first 5 minutes of the movie, as that was all explained. And might I add that although the U.S. may have gave asylum to the Shah ( a guilty man) that gave no right for the Iranians to hold innocent Embassy staff members as hostages.I give this movie a 9 out of 10. I don't know if it is Oscar worthy, but it may be worthy of a nomination. The mood of tension was great, it was well crafted, and wonderfully acted. Really a good movie and Ben Affleck deserves a big pat on the back as the Director, and the lead role. Definitely a job well done.",9,0,1,24 November 2012
Ted," A welcomed hilarious man child comedy!
","I was very reluctant to the thought of liking this movie after seeing previews, hearing the general story, and hearing a bunch of positive reviews. This usually sets me up for a disaster and most people tend to like movies like that because others peer pressure them into doing so. This one turned out to be great! 'Ted,' is a spin on the old boy with a teddy bear story. A young boy with no friends gets a stuffed teddy bear for Christmas and wishes it would become real so he could have a friend. The wish is granted, Ted (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) is born, and John Bennett (Mark Walhberg) has a stuffed friend to hang out while he grows into a man child. Soon John's girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) tires of the man/bear relationship and the man and the bear may have to part ways in order for John to grow up and have a big boy relationship.The Good: This is a comedy, and a good one, that doesn't pretend to be anything it is not. The story is pretty much the same as any other romantic comedy, but not one that bores a man to death the way most of the others do. Call it a man's romantic comedy. The writing was great, and there were some scenes that were Hilario's. Many scenes in the beginning are what you would expect, but combined with the musical score the corniness factor of the movie actually makes it more amusing. This is not some super intelligent, artsy comedy, it is meant to be rude and crude, and makes for one of those great guilty pleasure movies.The Bad: I can't say a lot of real bad things. Mostly the bad part is just the fact that this is sort of a basic story line, but then again for a mindless comedy, it is not intended to have any deep meaning. There is also a lot of vulgar language and references in this one, so definitely put the kids to bed before watching. Sometimes a teddy bear just isn't for kids. Personally I didn't mind the profanity laced dialog but there are many that may be offended or it may not me their cup of Teddy, but hey, if you like, or can stand it, go for it because this one is fun.I give it an 8 out of 10. The story is basic but has an original take. It is mindless comedy fun and it has a lot of laughs. It was one of the funnier movies I have seen in awhile. Although profane and vulgar at times, it was well worth watching.Like my review? Hate em? Comments, questions, or want a DVD reviewed before you waste your time?

Superbad," If you get past the first 15 minutes it's not too bad!
","In the first 15 minutes of this movie I wanted to turn it off. It was just a bunch of obligatory swearing and had no value at all. If you can get past the beginning though it turns out to be a decent comedy worth watching.It is the usual teen movie story line. A group of teenage losers hatch a plan to buy alcohol for a party in order to impress girls and lose their virgin status. Now, I saw a problem with the cast already. Michael Cera seems to be only able to play the same boring, nerdy, over thinking, teen character in every single movie he is in, and Jonah Hill is not much better. The usual nasal boredom of their voices usually makes me want to shoot myself for listening the to movie going sheep who love these movies. I watched it anyway and found it to be a pretty funny movie.It turns into a teen misadventure movie that is rather well crafted and a fun ride. Fogel 'McLovin' (Christopher Mintz-Plasse ) is definitely the best character in the movie, and Bill Hader and Seth Rogan make great appearances as bored cops out or a little fun.It IS a basic teen movie but the misadventures make it worth watching and it actually met the expectations that a lot of people touted. Again, if you are an average person of adult age that doesn't spend every waking moment of your life playing video games and smoking pot, it may be hard to get through the beginning, but from then on out it will still have some good comedic value.Like my reviews?

The Town," East Coast Bank Robbery at its finest
","A movie featuring Ben Affleck without his real life bromance partner Matt Damon in the mix is usually an easy way to sink a film. This time it is anything but a disappointment. True, The romance side of the story is interesting but really could have been cut out all together. 'The Town,' is a movie that Ben Affleck can be proud of, and is a good direction for his fizzling acting career. Also showing great performances are Jeremy Renner, and Blake Lively. Anyone who likes movies about bank heists, crime drama, and mob connection movies will delight in this movie that successfully incorporates moments of an action thriller and intelligent drama.As I said before, the romance portion of the movie is the only real downside and the movie could have stood alone without it, but it doesn't destroy this movie either. Jeremy Renner probably outshines Affleck, but he does bring out a better performance in Affleck, who let's face it, is just a little eye candy to bring women into a guy's movie. 'The Town,' delivers as a crime drama with plenty of action even if you are biased against pretty boy Ben Affleck and is a do not miss if you want to watch a smart, well executed heist movie.",9,3,5,21 August 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," Captain Corny
","I know a lot of people out there still read and collect comic books but I am admittedly not one of those people. I do, however like the newer comic book based Super hero films. I watched Captain America because I had not seen the Avengers yet and wanted to make sure I had all the stories. I felt this one was a giant step backwards for comic book super heros. It was corny and comical and not in a good way. I get what they were going for, and if we lived in the 50's or 60's and this movie came out I would have loved it. That being said, I think they could of made this movie in a much more adult way. It just felt too much like an old comic book. I was hoping it would be a little bit darker and more humanizing. The acting was somewhat Blah, and way too over the top for my tastes, as was the entire movie.It was a 6 for me.",6,0,2,15 September 2012
Oblivion," Not too horrible
","OK, I give oblivion a 7. I came into the movie only knowing a couple of things. 1. It was a Sci-Fi movie about a 'future' earth. 2. Tom Cruise was in it.Visually it was a pretty good movie. The effects are pretty good, and Sci Fi is usually pretty big on that stuff, so nothing wrong with it there. The story, well, there are a lot of people that are going to hate on it because of the obvious Tom Cruise/Scientology connection, but what ever, it wasn't too bad, and was somewhat entertaining.There have been a lot of people that say this movie was too long. I didn't mind. The problem I had was 2 fold. First, I had the whole movie and storyline figured out in the first 15-20 minutes of the movie. The disguised nothing and that sucks...no big surprises. Second, The acting was bad. Tom Cruise is not a great actor but he was OK in this one, But the supporting actors (which there were only really 2) were pretty much bad. Olga Kurylenko is a beautiful girl but this role was completely bad and flat. Andrea Riseborough really added no value as well. Morgan Freeman is just as unimpressive. I know, everybody thinks he is the greatest actor in the world...but he has been known to do some very bad movies.All in all, for a Sci Fi flick, it's decent. With all my complaining I can still give it a 7, and it would beat that god awful 'The Host' hands down any day of the week.",7,0,0,24 July 2013
Justice League," At least Gal Gadot is really pretty
","Ben Affleck destroyed every once of awesomeness brought on by the Batman of Christian Bale. Just Bad. The special effects are straight out of a video game, not fit for the big screen. This is awful. The only thing that saves it is Gal Gadot, if your into guys I guess looking at Aquaman might float your boat but you sure aren't looking for acting , decent story , or script. This just bad. Even the parts with Superman were epiccally bad from the dialogue to the costume itself (are we back to leotards?). Why hire Amy Adams if you aren't going to give her anything to act out? You could stack up all the Avenger character movies (including the first Captain America which was as corny as they get) and each one would likely be better. I did give this a 3, not a 1 or 2, so I am being kind, but it was a ginormous disappointment. Please don't sink Gal Gadot's career on this crap, get some writers, use better special effects (or special effects people) and for god sake ditch Ben Affleck. Hiring him is like buying your kids birthday present out of the bargain toy bin at Kmart when you can afford an entire toy store. Stupid, phoned in junk. Not impressive which is why it took me so long to actually watch it.",3,0,0,15 April 2018
Warrior," Great Movie
","I usually enjoy a good fight movie, but lets face it, a lot of them are extremely unrealistic and try recreate the whole 'Rocky' thing. This one was an exception.This movie had a pretty good cast. The two main characters are 2 guys I really never heard of before which usually means the movie is going to be full of horrible acting and will suck. This one didn't.The main actors were pretty good and didn't overdo things, at times it was more of a real story by them not being big names and not overdoing the acting.The story was a pretty good one that kept you into it, and made you really want to watch the entire thing. If you dig good fight movies with a good story try this one. You won't be disappointed.",9,1,3,23 September 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," The most overrated blunder of the year
","This might possible be the most overrated, over advertised, worst film of the year. Yes, I like many other people got duped into watching this boring waste of time. I hope Daniel Craig got a big pay day, because after this film choice they should throw him off the Bond movies. Rooney Mara did a decent job acting in this film, but then again all she had to do is look incredible weird, and do weird crap, probably pretty easy and not far off base for the spoiled rich girl she is in real life, and I am pretty sure either her family paid her salary for this job, or paid for the advertising.This film is full of way to much boring talk, endlessly boring scenes, and nothing that even comes close to interesting, except maybe a rape scene and a revenge for that aforementioned rape scene.I hear the original European movie was a good one, if so I hope it is nothing like this version. If it is, then the Europeans have as bad taste in movies as they do with their electronica, dance/disco euro-trash music.",2,5,15,19 September 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Nothing to set it apart from the 2002 movie
","I give this movie a 6. Frankly I was hoping for something much better. I was hoping for something that would really make this movie different from the franchise started in 2002. Something that would really make it worth watching since it's only been 5 years since a Spiderman movie came out. Well you know what they say about wishes, and hopes don't you? You can hope in one hand and take a number 2 in the other hand, and see which one fills up first. Yeah, nothing new or great here.I guess you could say the story line is a tad different. They put Peter Parker's (Andrew Garfield) parents into the story. They also got rid of Mary Jane, in favor of a new love interest, Gwen (Emma Stone). They also remade Peter as a smart, loner, social outcast type (You know, like one of those kids that just might bring a gun to school), instead of just the nerdy geek with a camera.Everyone knows the rest of the story by now. A socially awkward boy that lives with his aunt and uncle, gets bit by genetically experimental spider which gives him incredible spider like abilities. His uncle gets killed and he decides to avenge his death, and become a vigilante super hero. In the end Peter has to choose between being a super hero and being with the girl he loves.I thought that maybe one reason they made this film so shortly after the last Toby Maguire trilogy (2002, 2004, 2007) might be to take a darker more sinister, and less corny version ala the Dark Knight franchise. While this one may have hinted that they wanted to go there in a few scenes it just never does. It still stays pretty corny. If you are going to make a film like this , Please have something original to offer and go for it. This movie to me looks and feels as though it was one of the last 3 films, but with different faces.Andrew Garfield really adds and brings nothing, and I would say that both him and Tobey Maguire did an equally poor job. Ditching Kirsten Dunst was a good move as she is one of the most overrated actresses in Hollywood, and Emma Stone was probably the best actor in this whole movie so clearing out Mary Jane didn't hinder it. The CGI was overdone and that is one of the pet peeves I have with almost all movies these days.In the end this movie was completely unnecessary, especially when there was a trilogy put out just 5 years ago. Sounds to me like the studio just wanted to pull one over on us and make a quick buck. This movie looks and feels like everybody involved with the previous movies just threw it together with some out takes of the last ones, and there is nothing to distinguish it as anything any better or worse.I give it a 6, watchable, but it has nothing really different from the older 3 movies. If you want to watch a great, original, super hero movie, leave this one until you have exhausted all the others and rent Kick-Ass (2010) instead, and keep your eyes open for Kick-Ass 2 in June 2013.Like my reviews, Hate em?

The Exorcist," A Legendary Work of Art
","I looked on the top 250 list on this site and found that this masterpiece is down around the 200 mark. Either people are idiots, or they have been accidentally hitting the wrong number of stars.This movie is a Horror classic and among many it is considered the best ever. The story is an actress's young daughter becomes possessed by an evil spirit, after seeing the girl a charismatic young Priest, who at times questions his own faith, enlists the help of an Exorcist to save the child. This is one of the scariest movies of all time. DO NOT WATCH THE EDITED FOR TV VERSION. It is in no way close to the chilling original. In it's day this was a masterful, ground breaking, controversial movie, with its portrayal of the possessed child (Linda Blair) spouting all sorts of obscenities as her head spun around shooting pea soup out of her mouth.This movie has often been imitated but never really matched. The sequels were fairly bad but the original still stands the test of time today. This is a work of art!Like my reviews? Hate em? Comments, or want a particular DVD reviewed?

Goon," Goon tastic movie
","OK, I saw previews for this movie and thought here we go another hockey slapstick comedy about hockey ala 'Slap Shot.' Well, I got to say it started out that way, and admittedly there is a touch of that type of comedy aspect throughout, but taken all together this is actually a pretty good movie that goes beyond the comedy aspects.I am a hockey fan. I grew up watching the so-called 'Goons,' I am a lifelong Red Wings fans so I have seen the Bob Proberts, Darren McCartys, and Joey Kocurs. The goon was an enduring thing in hockey and with the exception of the minor leagues (where this movie takes place) these type of players are pretty much a thing of the past. Go to youtube and do a search for Tie Domi vs. Bob Probert, or Bob Probert vs. Stu Grimson to see the real deal, as nothing like it exists in the NHL anymore. There is nothing wrong with celebrating these players of a by gone era and have a good laugh in the process.I say grab some beer, pop in this movie, and have fun. It is much better than I thought it would be.",8,3,4,22 September 2012
Pearl Harbor," Great action sequences destroyed by bad acting and even worse script!
","This movie is almost an embarrassment to the legacy of the Pearl Harbor attack and the men and women who lost there lives that day, and through out the war. When I started watching this cheesy movie I thought someone had put the wrong DVD in the case, seriously. Michael Bay should be ashamed of himself for this one.The action sequences were the only slightly redeeming quality of this movie. The script was atrocious. The acting even worse. I expect bad acting from Ben Affleck and Josh Harnett, but how did they get Kate Beckinsale to do a horrible job as well?You would think after the success of a GREAT war movie like 'Saving Private Ryan' that a director like Michael Bay would want to present a great movie, that stays a little close to history, and has some semblance of the real life and times of the people of that generation. Instead he gives us a cheesy puff piece that pretty much uses every cliché of the 1940's era, and doesn't even come close to resembling real life.Let's face it, this was more like some horrible dime story novel romance, and bromance set against the backdrop of WWII. If you want to see a war movie either don't bother with this filth, or just fast forward to the attack sequence and watch that ONLY. It gets worse as they drag out this disaster to give a even worse bromance sequence loosely based on the Doolittle raid.This movie is trash!",4,2,4,25 September 2012
Saving Private Ryan," A Shining Example Of Great Filmmaking
","This is simply the best war movie, bar none, so far anyway. This movie set a new standard for the film industry when it comes to recreating combat scenerios. The D-Day scene is the most brutal, realistic depiction of war ever produced. When you go to a movie (war movie or any movie) the filmmakers try to give you the sense of watching that scene play out in real time in front of your eyes, In this one though, Spielberg grabs you by the shirt, pulls you in, and makes you be a witness to the scene as it plays out.Everything about this movie was outstanding. The Cast was perfect and gave performances of a lifetime. The Effects were second to none. The photograph was mind bending. There was not a detail left unattended to. Simply perfect. This is what all movies should strive to be!",10,2,3,20 September 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Entertaining watch, fits the hype advertisers pushed
","Not bad, Actually it was a pretty good movie. I was never big on the original series, mostly because it was somewhat before my time, and film making has progressed since then. OK, I give it an 8. Story wise it was pretty good. In the end it got the viewer to the already known fate (this is 'Rise' and therefore you know what has to happen in order for them to go on to a 'Planet.'The CGI that was used to create the Apes was solid, but like all movies that use this cost saving method, the CGI around the apes, the scenes of them moving, etc. Were a little too plastic, meaning that the just can't get all the correct movements of leaves, wind, and such.Another thing I disliked is a little off subject and refers to all action movies and I write about it just now because I finally remembered too. People, directors, producers, CGI techs, and special effect people, Cars ARE NOT BULLET PROOF! You can't hide in a car, you can't hide behind the door, hood, roof,in a trunk, or floor of a car! The only real spot to be even remotely safe is behind the engine block. OK thats my rant.Pretty good flick.",8,2,4,15 September 2012
JFK," A Conspiracy theorists wet dream
","OK, this is a decently made movie, the actors are pretty good in it, and it definitely fans the flames of the controversy. The problem is...Its a false controversy.Oliver Stone is a known Communist and Marxist. He holds hands, and parties with evil dictators that would like to destroy the U.S.A. He is also a crazy old conspiracy nut. This is what happens when a person like Stone has to much money, too much time on his hands, and they let him make movies. He tries to present all this info as if it is facts that nobody wants to listen too. He thinks he is educating people. He wants everyone to forget every investigation that has been performed that throws out the conspiracy theories and proves almost all of the Warren Commissions report.I think the movie was well done but I only give it a 4 because he is trying to hoodwink people with it.",4,2,11,23 September 2012
Kick-Ass," Just when I thought Nicholas Cages Career was over!
","OK, So Nicholas Cage isn't the big star of this movie but it is definitely the best movie he has been a part of in the last ten years.Kickass is a great movie for its combination of comedy and action. I would venture to say it is one of the best films of 2010.It is a pretty dark super hero movie with a ton of laughs and tons of action. Don't miss this one. I almost did until someone recommended it to me, otherwise I would have skipped it altogether.The main character is a high school loser who decide he needs to do something drastic and become a Super Hero. His first attempts are hilarious but he gets some help from some cell phone footage and luck and does in fact succeed.The movie evolves into a dark twisted movie that is both humorous and full of action and drama. Kickass kicks any of the Spiderman movies squarely in their backsides!",9,3,8,26 August 2012
The Hurt Locker," Definitely a top 10 war film
","Kathyrn Bigelow out crafted a lot of more seasoned directors with this gem everything from the story line, photograph, script, and acting was top notch, and adds a lot of psychological aspects for the viewer to either unconsciencly or conscientiously consider.The story of a Ordinance disposal unit in the IED rich environment of Iraq is a great one. The camera angles and shots gave the view a great seat within the movie and often left you with the exposed feeling of being there, out in the open, where anyone could be watching and could attack at any moment. A true eerie feeling on the battlefield today.Jeremy Renner give a great performance as Sergean First Class William James and proves why he was selected to carry on the Bourne movies. He's radical, reckless, and has no desire to follow protocol, as a veteran myself his character is well understood. Brian Geraghty also gave a great performance as Specialist Eldridge, a soldier who is almost done with his tour but is almost paralyzed with the fear of dying.The only performance that I thought was somewhat over the top and therefore not the best was Sergeant Sanborn, played by Anthony Mackie. I was way too reaching at times and really didn't fit well with the rest of the movie. I understand that they were trying to contrast Renners character and his, but it didn't work so well for me.Over all this movie was out sanding and deserves to be one of the top 10 if not 5 among he War genre.",10,0,3,24 September 2012
Million Dollar Baby," A little to slow to be a 10
","This was a pretty good girl boxer movie, but for me the slow monotonous pace just didn't quite make it as good as all the awards it won. The story is solid, a girl boxer, broke and living in poverty seeks her dreams of becoming a big-time female boxer. She seeks out a down and out trainer and begs her way into his heart, and ends up...well you have to see for yourself. I give it an 8, because yes, it was a pull on your heart strings, make all the ladies cry type story. The acting was very good, and everyone seems to love Morgan Freeman no matter what he does.Clint Eastwood directs and plays the hardened, down and out trainer, which is not far from the character he always plays.The only real problem I had watching this movie is that the pace of it was awful. Unless you live in a nursing home, you may fall asleep before you even reach the mid way point. Then again, awards and raves always seem to come easy for movies that are the equivalent of prescription sleep medication starring actors that draw people into the theaters by reputation alone.For me, it is a very good story with some great acting and worth watching but I cannot say that it was worth all the critical raves, glowing banter, and sheer brilliance that was heaved on to it.Like my reviews?

Avatar," Cameron's crappy cartoon 'masterpeice'
","This is one of those movies that was so over-hyped, and overpraised that way too many people jumped on the bandwagon out of peer pressure. This was supposed to be Jame's Cameron's masterpiece, that he wanted to make for so long but had to wait for the technology to advance enough to make it. Guess what, it still hasn't advanced enough to make this any better than it is, a long boring cartoon!I'm still amused why this movie isn't listed in the, 'animation' section of every store and rental place. Because that is what it is. The basic story is those evil earth people travel to a planet in order to rape it of it's natural resources. The barbaric earthlings devise a way to create a sort of organic remote controlled robot to learn about the inhabitants of said planet and infiltrate them in order to steal their resources.Now digital technology has come a long way, but look at Star Wars. The first 3 movies to come out (episodes 4,5,6) were beautifully done, and stunning compared to the crap George Lucas gave up with the horrible CGI mess that were episodes 1,2,&3. Same story here. If Cameron was a decent director and writer he would have used a lot less CGI and gave us something better than a slightly darker version of a lot of Disney animated flicks. This is basically an updated, fancy version of what Disney did with the old movies like 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks.' It's good for entertaining kids but that's about it.Of course, Cameron had to suck up to all his Hollywood friends and cast Marines as bad guys (way to care about your country Jim) and show his compassion for the environazi cause. As all director pieces given the 'masterpeice' title, it has to drag on and on so that you just can't stay awake. When you wake up, you probably have reached half way. Dude, you may have fooled me into watching a cartoon, but you can't fool me into giving it a good review.Oh yeah, and who the heck hires Zoe Saldana just for her voice? You have a beautiful actress like that and the only thing you can give us is a cartoon character with her voice. Please, if I had to watch that old hag Sigourney Weaver through this movie you could have at least threw me a bone and cast Zoe as one of the real people...The acting was, well, what can you say it was a cartoon...there wasn't any acting. Cameron's writing skills seem to leave a lot to be desired as well as he probably has never met anyone, besides Bob Ballard, that has ever wore a military uniform, and shows by making most of the characters as clichéd as possible.The animation though is pretty darn good and stunning, but the problem with that is that this was not billed as a cartoon. So congrats and 4 stars to Jimmy for putting a bunch of real special effects people out of a job for this one.If you are an cartoon lover , and have penchant for 'sustainability', rent this one and 'The Lorax.' Watch 'The Lorax' first so that you will be all snuggled into bed for Jame's Cameron's bad, boring, animated bedtime story.Like my reviews, hate em?

Super 8," A Sci-Fi, Mystery, Thriller done right for a change
","J.J. Abrams and Steve Spielberg melded minds to create a movie sci-fi movie that is watchable once again. This one was done wonderfully. Today we have way to many hack directors out there doing these 'Found Footage' crap, and I could see with a title like 'Super 8' another dimwit would attempt it. Thankfully they decided to make a real movie instead. There was a youthful wonder element of the movie, and evolving drama of realities of life, and some mystery government activity. They did a great job of hiding the 'Mysterious forces' until it was necessary and didn't overdue it. Thumbs up to the Big Guy's (Speilberg and Abrams) You made watching a little bit of a sci-fi movie watchable. All other directors out there need to be taking notes.",9,0,1,14 September 2012
Sinister," Finally, the correct use of found footage. Truly great movie.
","'Sinister,' is a great old school, supernatural horror movie, and is a great example of how, if you are going to do it, to correctly make a movie involving the overused fad of 'Found Footage.' It's the story of a true crime writer,Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) that moves his family into a house formerly owned by a murdered family whose daughter is still missing. Investigating the murders for his new book he starts finding reels of 8mm footage, not only of the murdered family, but other murders as well, and a sort of boogeyman figure. Some sort of sinister plot is unfolding around him, and his sanity, and sense of dread may soon cause his family's demise as well.The Good: This is a great horror movie. It's a sort of murder mystery/ supernatural thriller/ just plain creepy film that is reminiscent of the horror movies of the past that still creep us out today. In many ways it is much in the style of the old classic, 'The Shining,' mixed with the more new school of films such as 'The Ring.' There is no corny element to it which too many movies put in today, and it makes it a delight, at least for me, to watch.Ethan Hawke was excellent as the crime writer and father who is seeking that next big book, yet feeling himself slip away from his idealistic views of why he chose that genre in the first place are fading. That is saying a lot coming from me because I am not a big Ethan Hawke fan outside of 'Training Day.' He plays the part well, and really does a great job as the story takes hold and he begins to descend into a terrified, drinking man both continuing to investigate, and feeling a sense of dread at what he might find.The found footage in this one was great. Yes, I said it, great! Found footage is the new fad and I hate it! But this time it was perfect. The 8mm film, much of it from the 70's and early 80's had a sort of Manson-esque look that made for quite the stirring factor. I loved it.The Bad: I really don't have a lot of bad comments to make about this movie. I could probably say that Juliet Rylance, who plays the wife and mother, Tracy, wasn't great or memorable, but then again this was more of a closed off to one man type of story. So, it didn't hurt it any. Other than that Fred Thompson probably should have had a more prominent role in the story as the town police chief.I give this one a 10. Some may disagree, but for someone that grew up with movies like ,'The Shining,' 'Carrie,' and 'The Exorist,' I appreciated the overall feel of this one and all the elements were there. It was creepy and chilling. The found footage aspect was done in a way that added to the story and the feel of them worked. Great movie for any horror fan that is getting tired of the same cliché recent movies and longs for a real good creepy movie. Turn of all the lights, hold your girlfriend, and watch a real horror movie for once! Like my review? Hate em? Comments, questions, or want a DVD reviewed before you waste your time?

Snowden," Oliver Stone trying to destroy Joseph Gordon-Levitt's career?
","Why in the world is this rated over a 7? I guess we really do have a dumb population. The story would be half way decent if Oliver Stone actually hired someone to advise on the inner workings of the army, government, domestic vs. international espionage. etc. But no, we are left with Ollie's ridiculous conspiracy theories. You know, Oliver Stone knows it all these days.Within the first 5 minutes you just have to accept that Oliver Stone has bought his own media raves from his early career and has parlayed that into movies that lack even the smallest effort (see Savages, yes, savagely horrible is what that was.). Then, like that isn't enough, on cue, Nicholas Cage walks into the movie. Whatever you feel about the Snowden revelations (and I think the stuff about the domestic spying program coming out was a good thing), this movie is just expensive crapola for Oliver Stone to put out his own tin foil hat opinion. I could be fine with that, but the lack of effort to even gain some kind of understanding of certain things before you put them on film is just so blatantly cheap, and dumb, that this movie isn't worth the effort of watching. All I know is that Joseph Gordon-Levitt always seemed like a decent capable actor, but this movie should be a negative in his career and whoever advised him to take the role should probably go back to Venezuela with Mr. Stone and stay.",2,13,54,18 November 2016
Reservoir Dogs," Tarantino's best work ever
","This was and is, by far, Quentin Tarantino's best work ever. I could care less about Pulp Fiction, that was a decent movie that did well commercially but this one is his crowning achievement.This movie is well arranged. The Dialogue IS the movie. You can sit and turn the picture off on this one and the audio itself tells the story. The Music is absolutely great and well chosen. The acting was not extremely great, but that itself was also a masterstroke. The budget was small, the sets almost non existent, yet Tarantino created a wonderful piece of film making art, and assembled a cast worth watching. There was plenty of dark comedy mixed with the signature violence and blood that always accompanies Tarantino. The Characters have no names and are introduced only as colors, and that is one of the best scenes of this movie. It is a perfect blend of comedy, violence, crime, character development, plot, all told in a unique and intriguing way.Tarantino will probably never make a movie as well as this one again. He now basks in his own cult following and his love of bad B horror of the 1970's, and seems content in giving us horrible movies, bringing back a genre that nobody ever wanted to see (except really crazy people that rarely get out of their own basements) and there was a reason Hollywood stopped making.I say celebrate this one outstanding movie and remember Quentin when he used to be a decent film maker.",9,2,4,24 September 2012
In Time," could they have found better actors....In Time....
","I give this movie a 7. The story and whole set up was pretty solid, interesting, and definitely open to a lot of possibilities. Just a few problems that cost it 3 pts. from me.First off, the whole plot line of the movie seemed sophomoric and just an easy way to guide you through a film. I guess they were just trying to make some political class warfare message, but even with that they could have done a heck of a better job. I mean, its Sci-Fi, whoever came up with the setting and back story gets an A. Whoever developed the story and wrote the script, I give them a C at best.Second, the acting. I know they were going for a future where everyone always appears young, therefore beautiful/Handsome, but please, there had to have been a few good looking actors and actresses that actually had some talent to pick from. Timberlake, not good Seyfried, great to look at but what was with the ugly wig. The best actress in the film wasn't in it very long, in the form of Olivia Wilde.Is it worth watching? Yes. For the settings, background story and over all Idea. Just wished it would have been a little smarter and better acted.",7,1,3,17 September 2012
Zero Dark Thirty," What a Disappointment!
","Zero Dark Thirty is the highly anticipated story of the hunt and eventual 'we got him,' moment for Osama Bin Laden, and Kathryn Bigelow's big movie to follow her great Iraq war movie, 'The Hurt Locker.' I was extremely disappointed to say the least.The Good. Their were only a few bright spots in this movie. For one, it showed the CIA's supposed 'torture/enhanced interrogation,' techniques without taking a Hollywood, far left, holier than thou approached and acknowledged some of the usefulness. That surprised me actually. Second, it is a real life event and that will always make people come out to see it. I was also pretty happy they didn't turn this into a 'worship Obama,' movie as a lot of people thought they would do, but i think a lot was due to that very thought.The Bad. You would think after the success of 'The Hurt Locker,' Bigelow would make a really\ great, stirring movie, and seemed like an obvious choice. This was a movie that was a gift to a Director, and had the potential of being a huge movie because of the feelings that 9/11 and Osama Bin Laden provoke in Americans.This did not deliver! For several reasons. First, it was straight up boring most of the time. It felt piece mealed together without any kind of rhythm or flow to it. Second, they should really have hired a sound engineer and put some kind of score to it, what we got instead was that dull, indy problem, of many moments of that turns many movie goers off and makes them look at their watch or think about what they need to get done when they get home.Third, the acting was bad. Plain and simple. Frankly, I was thinking with all the awards and accolades Bigelow picked up she actually might be able to pull in some big time talent, but then again maybe the writing was crap. There were moments that should have been big ones, or make you want to cheer, but for some reason the actors, especially Jessica Chastain, couldn't pull it off.Lastly, for some reason they tried to make this some kind of Female empowerment movie. The main character, played by Jessica Chastain, spends the entire movie trying to tell everyone in the CIA, etc, how to do their jobs, and how she is right, etc. She gets increasingly hostile through the movie only to be vindicated in the end. I have no reason why they chose that route, it might have worked if they spent the money to hire talent, but it was pushed to the point where she just became quite annoying at best. There was very little character development and nothing that really makes you feel anything towards anyone in the movie, with maybe an exception to the Seal team, but they really were left out of the movie altogether except for the very end.Something about the disjointedness just says to me they probably changed focus, or rewrote/worked the movie half way through production, or just plain hurried through the whole thing. It leaves me to believe Bigelow's Hurt Locker praise was a one time only flash in the pan.I know this movie is going to continue some high marks to the movie going sheep out there. They always say they love a movie that someone else tells them they are suppose to love. Don't buy into that crap. Form your own opinion. It was just a very dull, poorly written, poorly acted, and poorly directed movie. In fact, The National Geographic Channel put out their own movie based on the same events and they are pretty comparable, The Nat Geo one may even be better, and I am sure they did it on a smaller budget. I give it a 4. It was boring, lackluster, and disjointed at best. This movie isn't going to win any awards, and if it is ever even nominated it proves Hollywood doesn't even know it's own business anymore. Steal it off the internet or wait for it to come to DVD. Don't waste your money going to the theater for this turd.",4,12,25,3 February 2013
Dark Shadows," Burton makes up for his horrible Alice in Wonderland movie.
","Dark Shadows is an 7 to me. Tim Burton finally made something worth watching again. After what I felt was horribly over hyped Alice in Wonderland movie that left me almost upset I wasted my time watching it. I kind of went into this movie expecting not to like it. Tim Burton always has pretty stunning visuals in his movies but I usually get bored with his creepy, but almost G rated style. I usually just watch his stuff for the dark goth type sets and effects that he is known for, But easily tire of him recycling actors over and over again. His wife used to be a pretty good actress, but do we really have to see Her in a starring role in EVERY ONE of his movies?Michelle Pfeiffer was forgettable, and a few times I think I had to remind myself what her part was. The real star here is Eva Green. She is the center of attention in any scene she is involved with, even when its with Johnny Depp. Let's face it Johnny Depp is a decent actor but he only does dramatic over the top characters, so its not a stretch for him. He was good, but Green sizzles in a role that is a departure from her other films.The comedy gags are alright but not to many. I know this sounds more like a review of really bad movie but its not bad. I would watch it again it was",7,1,4,10 September 2012
Inception," Imaginative and visually stunning, one of the best movies I have seen in a long time
","This movie was awesome. It even made me forget that Leonardo DiCaprio was in it. I was a little suspect when I saw a movie with Leonardo DiCaprio and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the 2 top billed stars. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a decent actor but his career up until this movie was somewhat relegated to small budget B movies. As for DiCaprio, It is my opinion that he is a highly overrated, overacting actor at best. Some how director Christopher Nolan was able to harness these 2 back enough to make for an outstanding movie that has become one of my new favorites.The story is about Cobb (DiCaprio) and his team. They are assembled to enter peoples dream's in order to steal important information from high profile corporate targets. After running into a problem, Di Caprio has to get himself and his team out of trouble by performing a task thought impossible, actually implant an idea within a dream in someones head, that will cause the person to act out that complex task in the real conscience world, inception.Can they do it, or will personal past demons trap them in a nightmare of their own doing.The strength of this movie is that so much of it takes place within the dream world that it doesn't really have to follow any real rules. A set can be anything in which the filmmakers wants it to be. To pull that off though everything has to be visually stunning, and it is. 'The Cell' came close, and the old Dennis Quaid, 'Dreamscape' was great in its day, but this one blows them out of the water.The acting was great, and as I said before, I am not a Dicaprio fan. Ellen Paige plays 'The Architect,' Ariadne, which if you have ever read Greek Mythology you will understand the nod given there, and she is good as tool to open up the movie to Cobbs past demons.Everything in this movie is absolutely on point and is a rare case where it all comes together in every facet. This is one of those movies that leaves you sitting in the theater after the credits not wanting to believe its over and that you now have to go on with your drab, boring life. That is a rarity these days.Like my reviews, Hate em? Comments, Hate mail, or do you have a specific DVD you want me to review?

Centurion," Decent, gritty, period piece
","Centurion is a pretty good period movie based in the wilds of Great Britian during the days of the Roman Empire. As far as the history presented and if it stayed true as far as weapons, costumes, the Picts, I don't know, but for me it was a pretty good movie.Michael Fassbender is a pretty good actor and did a decent job as the Leader character, the Centurion Quintus Dias. The whole movie centers around the surviving Roman soldiers of an ambush being ruthlessly pursued, behind enemy lines, by their enemy the Picts, and there vengeful female tracker Etain (Olga Kurylenko). Kurylenko's character has a backstory, and she doesn't speak at all in the movie. I will say that she did a decent job with a non speaking part, and as gritty as this movie is, she is definitely a great piece of eye candy.Overall it was a gritty movie, the costumes were pretty good the locations were great, and the story was decent. I hear the budget was pretty low for this movie, if so they did a pretty darn good job with what they had.It isn't going to be the best movie you ever see, but it does succeed a bit more than others such as the deplorable Channing Tatum movie, The Eagle.",7,2,5,25 September 2012
Prometheus," Beautiful Scenery, story somewhat lacking
","OK, I give this one an 8 out of 10. I wanted to see this movie from the first ten seconds of the trailers. As expected the scenery, sets and CGI were stunning. The Gigeresque look of the Alien/Aliens movies were in full effect and were even better than those Ridley Scott masterpieces. The story however was just OK, and a little bit lacking to me. Maybe the Sci-Fi geek in me was just expecting too much. I like the whole 'Ancient Alien' theories that I watch on the History Channel, And I would have liked to see more of a lead up on that to the actual voyage.The star of the movie was definitely Michael Fassbender as the protagonist anti-hero David, the robot. He gave a wonderful performance where the others were so-so. Although I understand Charlize Theron's character, I also think she was just inserted in to pull more people into the theaters at $20 a pop because they wasted a great movie star with pretty much a cameo, phoned in appearance.It is worth watching for the sets alone, but the movie as a whole seemed a little small minded in a genre that could have led to much better mind bending intelligent places. Hopefully Prometheus 2 will sort it out.",8,4,9,18 September 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Big on action, but lacking the drama of the first 2
","'The Dark Knight rises,' is now the third hugely anticipated movie of the Series. After the chaos left in the wake of the defeated Joker, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale)reluctantly returns to the bat cave in hopes of defeating a new ruthless enemy in the form of Bane (Tom Hardy). Bane is an exiled member of the League of Shadows but has come to Gotham to finish what the League started in the first film, destroy Gotham for ever.The good: Again Christopher Nolan gives us a huge action thriller. The action in this movie doesn't disappoint. The acting is again pretty successful, and Bale continues to deliver as the leading role of Batman. The visuals and feel of the movie, the darkness of it, still remains as it did in the first two films and it is great. As always Batman has a few new exciting toys to play with as well.A good job was done again with the tortured soul, real person aspect of Bruce Wayne. He is aging, takes more punishment, and is a great touch of showing him as being less of a cliché superhero and more of a human being.The Bad: I felt the action of this movie, at times, was just too overwhelming, and the drama of the last two movies just wasn't there and this one suffered because of it. There wasn't enough background building done with the new characters that really gave you a sense of feeling a whole lot one way or another. They did give some background to Bane, but I think the mask of the character really prevented any notion of connecting with the character, even in a negative way at all.The introduction of Catwoman(Anne Hathaway), was completely unnecessary. Her character was weakly written, and not very well acted. Anna Hathaway is a pretty girl, but just lacks the full out sex appeal every guy expects from a catwoman, and trying to bring that was a little painful to watch. Face it, much like Katie Holmes in 'Batman Begins,' she was just a little too girl next door-ish. I don't think anything was her fault in that regard, as it was most likely a bad casting decision.I give it an 8 out of 10. I doubt anyone will live up to Heath Ledger's performance in 'The Dark Knight,' and because of that and the lack of good solid character development it cannot get a 9 or 10. Catwoman should have been cut out completely. The action was good, and I think an 8 still makes for a very good action movie as this one was.Like my review? Hate em?

Trainspotting," One of the Classics of my generation
","I saw this movie when it first came out on video and have loved it ever since. I actually watch almost all Ewan McGregor films after I saw this one ( And yes, I have been disappointed in him ever since). I was 20 years old when this movie came out. To me this is a generational classic. The comedic moments are brilliant. There are great scenes illustrating drug use that are simply surreal and wonderful, and sometimes disgusting. This movie is mostly about a young man coming of age, while him and his friends struggle with an addiction to heroine, and its effects on life. As I said there are some hilarious comedic moments, but there is also a lot of dreary darkside of life drama as well. As an American it can be a little tough getting through the first few minutes and adjusting to the accents but other than that it is a great ride of a movie.",10,0,0,22 September 2012
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," The way a biopic should be done
","This movie gets a 9 from me, and is a great example of how a Biopic should be done. Usually when you watch a biopic the producers and directors go in either one direction or another based on personal beliefs. They tend to either show somebody in a very negative or positive way regardless of any facts. This one showed an emotional sometimes irrational Queen in a humanistic light that was very refreshing. Cate Blanchett was amazing in the role of Queen Elizabeth. At times in the movie the viewer can't help but hate her, and at other times one can see the burdens that lay upon the Monarch and feels some compassion. Blanchett shows great skill in bringing this historic character to life in a very complex and extremely humanizing way. Never does one really grow to love the character but at the sametime you have to admire her. This surely was no puff piece (Kristen Dunst as Marie Antoinette anyone?) but it wasn't a negative one either.The only downside I saw was 2 fold. One Sir Walter Raleigh's relationship to the Queen. There was in fact rumors of a romantic relationship, but nothing substantiated as proof in history, and he wasn't a big hero against the Spanish Armada as portrayed. Second, I am kind of disappointed that the movie didn't mention more about her father. True, she probably had little love for the man, but I think he would have been a great topic since his split with the Catholic church brought about a lot of the turmoil Elizabeth had to face.All in all, This was a great movie, with great acting, sets, costumes, and pretty much many details. If you like period pieces and history definitely watch this one.",9,0,1,22 September 2012
The Purge," Great Concept, fairly standard movie
","So the set-up for 'The Purge' is simple. In a Dystopian future crime has almost been completely eliminated due to one day of the year being designated as a day where complete lawlessness is accepted. Not a bad set up, and novel concept.The Good: Yes, as I said the set-up is good. It got a lot of people excited of the possibilities of this movie and will draw in some crowds. The acting, hmmm, not to bad, not horrible for sure like most horror genre films, but nothing spectacular either. Ethan Hawke has had a decent renaissance in his career ever since 'Training Day,' and he does a good enough job in this one that it is a decent stand-up movie. The Bad: OK, this is not going to win any awards. Beyond the dystopian set-up this one just becomes more of a family held hostage by maniacs on the outside type of movie. I think judging by the low rating so far (5.6 at the time of the review), people were expecting a lot more from the deliciously novel concept. It doesn't deliver solidly on that. If you set expectations aside, it is however worth a little more in my opinion.Lastly, another bad aspect. This is a thinly veiled idealism propaganda movie. It has a strong left wing stance trying to hint that this dystopian future is based on conservative ideas, set up in order to make sure 'poor' people are the victims of the purge and they eradicated each other. Rather strange because historically it has been far left governments who have actually 'Purged' people more often than right wing ones. Don't let it bother you and just watch an entertaining movie. It's not great enough of a movie to take a message like that seriously.The verdict for me is a 7. Great set-up, average acting (which is above par when it comes to horror movies), decently entertaining movie even if the kids in the movie seem to be the dumbest kids ever. Just don't get the hopes up to high as to the fantastic possibilities running through your head when you see previews.",7,1,3,23 June 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," A great movie but there are flaws
","Important note:I didn't read the books!I gave the first movie a 9 out of 10 and definitely looked forward to this one. All in all I am very satisfied and liked this movie but there are a few flaws that made rate this one 1 spot lower. I'll try to explain without giving a spoiler, but my small issues will probably only be understood after watching. I do recommend watching.The acting was solid,the story solid, and it was entertaining. What I subtracted points for is that there is a practical issue when it comes to being able to include/represent all districts. Hopefully this isn't a spoiler, but there is only 1 winner in each evolution of the Hunger Games with the exception being Peta and Catness. 1 winner, not one female and one male winner. Since that last movie stated that 'some' Districts have volunteers every year and are a virtual shoe in to win. It makes it puzzling to even have a queue.My second demotion was that I think that the main event was some what mailed in compared to the first film just utilized to bring the movie to the most important part, the end.Those aren't huge issues and most people won't catch it or even care.This was a pretty good movie, so watch it!",8,2,17,30 January 2014
Looper," Not a masterpiece but more imaginative than most Hollywood movie these days
","Looper is set in a future where time travel is possible, but illegal, and used by the mob to take care of hits. The mob sends targets 30 years into the past to be killed by hit men, or loopers, like Joe (Joseph Gordon Levitt). But for Joe, someday the mob will send his future self (Bruce Willis) back to the past in order to 'retire' him, and therefore close the loop. Will Joe have to kill himself?The Good:I am not a fan of Joseph Gordon Levitt (just a personal thing), but he does a good job, as he always seems to do. They also do an OK job in altering his appearance just slightly enough so he resembles a younger Bruce Willis who plays the future Joe, but as someone who remembers Bruce Willis when he was younger it didn't fully work. I give an A for effort. As the story continues though Levitt did get a little of Willis' speaking tones and patterns well in a few scenes. The overall feel and look of the movie is also well done. It is a gritty future, not one of those super CGI cartoon ones that most Sci-Fi movies try to portray.The paradox and consequences also can be a hard sell if not done right or over thought. This movie does a decent job with it, and it sets up some good twists. Overall the imaginative story of the movie is worth watching, and makes it much more of a drama than a action film like most time travel films are, but there is some good action.Bruce Willis also does a decent job, which has been few and far between in recent movies for him. Not as good as he was in '12 Monkeys,' but still good, and this is a much different movie than that one.The Bad: I am always disappointed when a movie uses a British actor or actress in a role where an American southern drawl is required. Emily Blunt is a beautiful woman and a good actress, but knowing she has a sexy British accent, makes her a hard sell. Also why did they give her that hair color? Stick to the darker colors, there is no need to down play her hotness. The writing was good as far as the Sci-Fi aspects and story are concerned but dialog wise it was nothing stunning and spotty good and bad throughout. Lastly, I had the biggest twist figured out before the filmmakers even gave their first big hint.Over all I give it 8 out of 10. It's got an imaginative, if not fully original story and a somewhat gritty appeal. The twist in the end was not .'Oh, my!' great but it was good enough.Like my reviews, hate em?

Footloose," A trip down memory lane
","As far as remakes go this movie was purely a trip down memory lane for those of us old enough to have seen the original in it's day. This cuts as a double edge sword to the quality though. It was great and refreshing to see a movie remake that totally follows the original and introduces it to a younger audience, but it also is kind of a let down to not see a lot of updates and an original take that could have made it much more interesting. The acting was sub par at best with the exception of Julianna Hough, who was a great choice in the role originally played by Lori Singer. I give this remake 6 stars because of its nostalgia but most of the cast was a bore, the 'gymnast aspect is too dated ( in 1984 it was an OK aspect because of the Olympic hype following Mary Lou Retton's perfect 10 ). Other than that its scene by scene and almost line by lines dependence on the original just doesn't deliver in this day and age and it is rather boring to watch an entire film that you have already seen many times before.Depite its lack of an original updated take, it still is a must see at least for us that grew up on the original, and for those of us that have a crush on the All-American beauty that is Julianna Hough.",6,0,6,22 August 2012
50_50," Shockingly good
","I was amazed by this movie. I mean Joseph Gordon-Levitt always plays such dull boring characters and Seth Rogan can only play one character. Strangely they both play their usual roles and yet, it works in this movie.So Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) finds out he has cancer. A fairly rare case in which there will be a 50/50 chance to survive. In this movie we get to see him cope with the issue, and come to terms with the possibility of his death as does his best friend (Seth Rogan), his family, his girlfriend, and his new, inexperienced, young, attractive, therapist (Anna Kendrick).What I loved about this one was that it was not a sad story. Even in the worst of times this movie takes a humorous approach that works well, and not in too much of a way that makes you not take it seriously. We saw Seth Rogan in this kind of movie with Adam Sandler(Funny People) and it was a miserable FAIL. I think Joseph Gordon-Levitt's sort of straight man, dull quality is what really made this one different.Seth Rogan was OK, he always does a good job with his characters but then again he only plays that one stoner who never grew up, which, let's face it, its him. I think Anna Kendrick played her inexperienced psychologist role pretty well, I have seen her in plenty of other films, but she had never really had a stand out character and this was one where she did well.This movie is a not a comedy, yet has enough comedy in it that its very hard to call it drama as well.I really didn't want to see this one and did it begrudgingly. I am glad I did it was well worth it. Even if you don't like weepy sad stories that make you think about mortality, or illness, which I am usually not a fan either, this one is good enough to keep you laughing and not feel to terrible bad afterwards.

Cloud Atlas," Socialist propaganda trash
","So Cloud Atlas is an obvious jab in the eye to Capitalism, individualism and Ayn Rynds brilliant novel Atlas shrugged and a bad one.Tom Hanks, Susan Saradon, Halle Berry put on their comrade commissar caps and proudly show their socialist support and all is evident by declaring that capitalism, corporations, and specifically Oil companies are the true evils of the world.It all becomes evident at the end when they try to sell you a tag-line of ,'Your life is not your own...' BS. It's OK, everyone in Hollywood is trying to through these pitiful, failed philosophy and as Tom Hanks has been a brilliant young comedian then an actor he is obviously joined the weird crowd along with the wacko Tom Cruise crowd.I would however ask Hollywood to not throw stones when they don't abide by their own ideals. Hollywood throws its support behind socialism and things such as the occupy movement, saying the wealthy have to pay more, but then turn around and film in Canada and other places to avoid high tax rates. Alec Baldwin firmly supported the socialist views of Occupy, yet still made millions of dollars for a credit company commercial.And for the socialist collectivists out there that will love this movies let me ask you this, Do you think the 7 million Ukrainians that were murdered and starved to death in the year 1932 alone while Soviet Union increased it's grain exports would say anti-capitalist collectivism was a great idea? Did You know that Marx himself was openly a proponent of genocide? Did you know that Russia, China, Cambodia and Cuba all went through a 'Purge' after their revolutions were they murders anyone who had an original thought? Yeah, this movie is crap!",4,3,12,26 February 2013
The Cabin in the Woods," Original? yes...somewhat entertaining
","I saw what this was from the previews, and yes, I still watched it. I gave it a 6, I think simply because it wasn't low budget boredom. This one is mindless entertainment, nothing more.The Cabin in the Woods is basically a way for a Horror movie fan to combine his undying love for the genre into one senseless movie and to frolic in the abyss of murderous zombies, bad jokes, and all the basic laundry list of all things slasher film. What makes this one original is there is nothing reality based in it, and just a fun original way to meld different elements of all sectors of the horror genre.If you want to see a good Horror movie, one that scares you, one that makes you think, then this is not for you. Most good 'scary' movies contain things that scare people because there is a primal element that relates to reality, and the viewer is afraid because when they go to bed at night, the slasher COULD be looking in the window, under the bed, or in a closet. None of that in this one, well unless you are a conspiracy theorist that believes the government has rigged your house (or in this case a Cabin) to unleash evil slashers and zombies in order to please an ancient god.It is a fun movie. Admittedly, I enjoyed some of the aspects of it, but in it's totality as a movie... I am amazed a studio gave it a green light.How sad have we gotten as viewers when a good scary movie used to be things like The Exorcist, Halloween, and The Shining, only to evolve into giving rave reviews to this crap. Oh well, I guess the bar has fallen and given us movies like this that aren't scary at all and even at times attempt to be funny. It rather makes you want to escape....to a Cabin in the Woods.",6,1,4,19 September 2012
The Social Network," PBS Documentaries are more interesting
","This was a complete an utter borefest. The previews made it look like it was fun, informative, and maybe even a little bit sexy. Guess what? It wasn't.The story about Mark Zuckerberg is an interesting one, so you would think a movie about it would be interesting. I was wrong. Unless your idea of a good time is sitting around doing calculus while a bunch of other nerds talk about calculus, this movie is a complete waste of your time. Just wait for a documentary to come out about it or read a book, it is bound to be more interesting and exciting.Basically this is also a movie assembled by Zuckerberg's spurned former business partners and enemies, and is indeed a pretty unflattering view of the man. Jesse Eisenberg played the part of the socially inept Zuckerberg pretty well, if he truly is the annoying person that the film portrays him as. In fact, if you were to make a movie about an annoying geek, Eisenberg would definitely fit the bill and I'm not sure he is very far off from that character. Justin %Timberlake plays the only interesting person in the whole movie, the creator of Napster, but he is barely in the movie.I should have known this movie would really be a disastrous borefest, but I didn't realize David Fincher was the director. With the exception of 'Se7en' and , 'Fight Club,' most of his films are unwatchable.This is a good movie to put on if you are trying to put grown adults asleep before their bedtime. Otherwise just put the DVD down because the studio should pay you to sit through this.",2,4,7,6 October 2012
The Great Gatsby," The Great....Big pile of garbage
","OK, so I am not a fan of either of the 2 male leads in this movie. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire are both famous Overactors, and it shows once again.The story is sound but I instantly knew that the director had to be the same one that made the movie Moulin Rouge. I was right. The difference? That movie was new, fresh, sexy and fun. This movie is not that. It's cheesy, annoying, and a waste of film as they were just trying to capture the magic of that past film. I should have looked to see who the director was first instead of wasting a couple hours watching it. It combines the same type of musical style as Moulin Rouge, but there was and added horror of watching the overly dramatic feel of the equally stupid movie 'Australia.'Look, this movie would have been fine if it was on stage, on Broadway. As a feature film it just blows. Keep the overly dramatic soap opera crap where it belongs. I can see why this movie was pushed so hard. Because otherwise it would have completely and totally failed. Another slight of hand, they gave DiCaprio top billing when he was really just a supporting actor to the equally cheesy Tobey Maguire. Dicaprio as predicted, overacted to death, and flashed his equally fake smile in every shot he was in. Please tell this dude to tone it down. As for Maguire, well let's face it, every character he plays comes off as some sort of 15 year old naive Disney character from one of those old movies like 'chitty-chitty bang bang.A movie's success should not be made on how much they make at the box office. A movie's success should be measured on how long it takes for the person that scraped together the $20 to buy a ticket to look at their watch or cell phone begging for a reason to leave after it startsIt's a 5...",5,2,6,16 August 2013
Warm Bodies," Watch the Walking Dead instead
","This ridiculous little movie was the complete definition of 'over- hyped.' I kept waiting for the awesome, or awesomely funny parts. Then...it finally ended. I think the funny part is that they conned so many people into paying between 8-10 bucks to go see it.Basically it is kind of like a politically correct Zombie movie. They try to humanize a zombie...seriously. They give him feelings, thoughts, etc. I know its a comedy and that aspect isn't lost on me. It has a few minor laughs and I did rate it a 5. A 5 is far more than it deserves and I was kind enough not to rate it a 1,2,or 3.I know everyone is on the zombie movie kick right now. A light hearted comedy about zombies doesn't sound bad. The fact is though that this boring zombie turd obviously ate what remained of advanced screener's brains and they actually made it out to either be the best zombie movie ever, or at least the funniest one, and what you get when you watch it is maybe, at best....The best, funniest movie that maybe one of the brain dead zombies that you call your idiot children have ever seen. I guess it could be pretty hilarious if I smoked and ounce of weed in the parking lot before I watched it. Then Again most movies are pretty funny after that.If you took the short yellow bus to school you may rate this one a 10, but for those of us who's brain's still function and blood still pumps, it's a mildly amusing 5.",5,1,3,5 June 2013
The Fighter," Great Movie, Mickey Ward is a Legend!
","I wanted to see this as soon as I heard it was about 'Irish' Mickey Ward. I watched his 3 last legendary fights and he won me over. The story itself was a great one. Christian Bale, who played Mickey's brother stole the show and was the real strength of the movie. Amy Adams did a stellar job as wellI only had 3 problems with this movie. 1st, I really didn't like Mark Wahlberg as the lead, there are other actors that I think could have pulled it off better and may not have been so upstaged by Bale. I think the movie portrayed Mickey as a little too soft spoken and sort of passive when it came to things going on around him, but if you ever watched his real interviews he seemed anything but that way. These things aside it was a great movie, but it lost one star for me because it didn't take us to the real glory of this bio.They only made mention at the end of his legendary fight and the subsequent 2 rematches ( also Legendary), that many of us fans thought he won every one of but got robbed. I understand a little bit if they didn't want to recreate these and leave those fights to stand on their own, but Ithink they missed a great opportunity for people that have never actually watched one of his fights.Great Story, Great Fight Movie!",9,0,1,23 September 2012
V for Vendetta," Orwellian, but a little bit more superficial
","This one is a 7 for me. I did like it, it wasn't bad or even horrible. Its just not very original. This is a veiled, more updated version of Orwell's '1984' only now the lead character is a woman, and there is a vigilante added to the fold. The acting is way to over the top, the mask is more than a little comical, and somehow this movie gained a cult following.'V for Vendetta' has been around longer than the 'Occupy' movement ( I seen it when it was first released in 2005). Some how, Anarchists, Marxists, and socialists have latched onto this movie even adopting the mask worn throughout as a symbol. I find this highly entertaining because those groups are actually advocating the style of government that this movie is trying to warn us against. Think of it, Socialism is a system in which you give up your individual freedoms and liberties, in order to benefit the group. The individual ceases to exist and instead the good of the group is more important than you.Now that we got that out of the way, the movie does have great visual appeal. I don't agree with many other reviews that Natalie Portman was so great in this movie. I think she was just OK, and Overall I would say everyone did a decent job.I guess what bothered me most was the fact that there was a part near the end ( I'm not going to get into which scene) that was completely stolen from the end of 1984. They didn't even try to hide or disguise it.Fun little fact: There is a scene in this movie where Natalie Portman is presented to the church official, dressed up, and the church official thinks he is about to have some sort of kinky sex scene. This is a recurring theme and directly tied to Lana Wachowski's personal life. We see the leather clad look of the Matrix movies, Monica Bellucci is seen sporting a very sexy latex outfit in one of them. 'Bound' is another movie by the brothers and the title says it all. Why? Lana Wachowski was born Larry Wachowski. Larry was heavily into kink, especially crossdressing, In a shocking move Larry wed Karin Winslow, who was at the time one of the most sought after Dominatrices in Los Angeles going by the name of Ilsa Strix. She immediately left the BDSM scene after their marriage, and soon Larry became Lana. Just a fact, I don't judge, and He/She, has pretty good taste because Karin A.K.A Ilsa is a very beautiful woman.Like my reviews, hate em? Comments, gripes and complaints?
