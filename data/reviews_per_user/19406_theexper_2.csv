The Sound of Music," most 'rewatchable' I've seen
","I once saw an article in a magazine (was it FHM or MAXIM, can't remember), that listed this movie as one of the 50 worst films of all time. I would have thought it was just a joke, but then the list also contained Batman and Robin. I guess I don't know much about acting, directing, producing or even criticizing movies. One thing I can objectively say is that this movie was for me the most 'rewatchable'. I could watch it over and over again without being tired of it (my sister could actually recite the whole movie word for word). After that article in the men's mag ( and the fact that no movie, no matter how highly rated on the IMDb, is without a negative comment), I am forced to say again that I don't know what makes a movie good. I can however boldly say that this movie should automatically accompany every purchase of a VCR or DVD player!",9,7,17,26 August 2004
Hancock," two scripts, same actors and props
","i now see what possibly makes many people trash the flick.it was two movies in one, joined with the same efficiency as stitching two concrete blocks together with a needle and thread.the first film, the blockbuster material, unique spin on a super hero, was about a hobo hero who gets a face lift from good pr.then that film ended.then , a not-as-engaging, flick about an alien couple who must be apart from each other started. and somehow they forgot to change the actors and props.8 stars for the first half though.",6,0,3,24 November 2008
