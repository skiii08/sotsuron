Spartacus," A Dang Good Flick
","In 1960, Stanley Kubrick released his colossal, towering, gargantuan, monumental, epic blockbuster SPARTACUS!!!! Okay, it isn't that spectacular, but it is a pretty dang good flick.Spartacus stars Kirk Douglas as an impudent Thracian slave. Thracians, as depicted in the film, were a race of people known for a particular physical characteristic - they had chin dimples the size of walnuts.Because Spartacus is such an uppity wisenheimer, he is sentenced to a life as a gladiator. Not that it's all bad. He gets to work out a lot and is 'whipped' into incredible physical shape. Also, he receives occasional visits from another slave who also happens to be a tasty dish named Varinia (played as a genteel aristocrat by Jean Simmons).Douglas does a fine job as the brooding gladiator. Other standouts include Charles Laughton as Gracchus; not to be confused with Crassus, a gourmet who likes both escargot and shellfish, played by Laurence Olivier. Peter Ustinov provides some Oscar-winning semi- comic relief as the sniveling sycophant Batiatus.Another major character in the film is Antoninus, played by Tony Curtis. Tony (which is short for Antoninus) is a 'singer' of 'songs'. His 'songs' are just poems spoken in a Bronx accent.During the course of the movie, Spartacus escapes from gladiator school and assembles a considerable army of fellow undergraduates. Spartacus is well-loved by his men, and this is illustrated in one particularly moving scene.When the Romans capture Spartacus and his men, Crassus threatens to kill them all unless someone betrays their leader (who Crassus believes is a communist). Spartacus - in a heroic effort to spare his men - stands up to reveal himself, but Antoninus beats him to the punch. He jumps to his sandaled feet and yells out, 'I'm Spartacus.' This sets off a chain reaction. Another guy stands up and shouts, 'I'm Spartacus.' And another, 'I'm Spartacus.' Another, 'I'm Spartacus.' And so on.The Romans were very frustrated by this, because now instead of one pesky Spartacus, they found that they had to deal with a whole slew of Spartaci.Legend has it that this event spawned an entire generation of scofflaws. Whenever a centurion confronted a non-Roman for some infraction - say a speeding chariot - the inevitable happened: 'Name?' 'Spartacus.' 'All right wise guy. Thirty days in the dungeon.'Anyway, this is a very good film that I highly recommend. And, if I may, I'd like to close out this 'review' with one of Antoninus' 'songs':'When the blazing wind hangs low in the western sky when the sun flies away to the mountain when the 'song' of the crow scares the locusts from the fields and maidens sleep in the sea foam at last at twilight time...'Or something like that.",9,2,3,27 January 2017
The Impossible," Mawkish Maudlin Movie
","mawkish adj. 1. Excessively and objectionably sentimental. 2. Sickening or insipid in taste.To describe The Impossible as mawkish is like calling Joe Pesci's character in Goodfellas 'not nice'. The Impossible is one family's story of survival in the aftermath of the tsunami that struck Thailand on Boxing Day in 2004. The special effects used to recreate the tsunami are very impressive. I was saying 'Wow' at that point of the movie. As the film progressed, I found myself saying 'Wow' in a different manner; while rolling my eyes in disbelief at the acting and dialog. Based on that, a better title for this flick would have been The Implausible. The screenplay is by Sergio G. Sánchez from María Belón's story. Belón is the woman portrayed in the film by Naomi Watts. Since the writers were Spanish, we can only hope that something was lost in translation since I hardly believed any of the characters' words.Watts does a decent job in the lead role, and it's a credit to her that she succeeds even to that extent, considering the direction and writing. Other actors don't fare as well. Tom Holland, who plays her son Lucas, shows some promise as an actor, but here he mostly comes off as an overly sentimental caricature. The other main character is the father portrayed by Ewan McGregor. McGregor's 'acting' consists mainly of looking anguished in blood-smear makeup while screaming out the names of his family members.Director Juan Antonio Bayona has decided that the best way to convey the hardship and emotions experienced by the poor souls who suffered through this ordeal is to show closeups of their faces to the accompaniment of some Williamsesque music done to the nth degree. I could just imagine John Williams (a.k.a. The Big Schmaltzy) sitting in a theater where this was playing, wincing and saying, 'Eww, too much music.'I have to say that I felt a little uncomfortable while watching this movie. Here was a real and devastating tragedy, and I was feeling as much emotion as I do when I watch my computer run a virus scan. Those who suffered through this catastrophe deserve to have their stories told with dignity and gravitas. At the very least they deserve more than this uninspired and maudlin celluloid effort.",4,2,6,27 January 2017
Footloose," Bacon Is Served
","I wish I could say that Bacon sizzles in this 'rebellious youth' tale, but he doesn't. There is a lot of ham on the screen and corn in the flaky dialog. This is a typical underdog film with all the tired clichés: the bad guys end up with egg on their faces; the town finally wakes up and smells the coffee; the protagonists eventually turn on the juice; etc.Although Kevin Bacon did an admirable job with his own dancing, I must say that the dancing double used in the more challenging scenes really smoked Bacon. Incidentally, I was going to review another mid-80s film - The Breakfast Club - but I've decided to put that pan on the back burner and cook with this one.You know, it's puzzling that this movie would leave me unsated and hungry for something else.",4,4,15,27 January 2017
Hugo," Spielsese or Scorberg?
","Hugo is directed by either Spielberg or Scorsese. I think it's Scorsese, but it felt like Spielberg. The film even had some John Williams-style BIG music, composed by Canadian Howard Shore. Yeah, that's right, the Canadian saxophone player from the Canadian band Lighthouse! (I had to get in some Canadian content there)This fantasy is about a boy who lives in the walls of a Paris train station. Not since The Legend of 1900 have I heard of anything this screwy. Inside these walls are the guts of the station's clocks. The guts consist of cogs, gears, counterweights, pinions, springs, and - inexplicably - steam.During the course of the film, we learn that Hugo is the dude that built C3PO (or some C3PO prototype). C3PO reveals to Hugo that the local old grump (played by Ben Kingsley) is in fact a forerunner to movie wizards like Spielsese or Scorberg.Anyway, I saw this movie in regular old boring 2D at a local theatre which hasn't changed much since its days as a Nickelodeon. I didn't realize it was a 3D film until the scene where some pages with drawings go flying from the kids' hands and drift all over the screen. At first I was thinking, 'What the hell is this all about? Am I supposed to be mesmerized by fluttering stationery?' Then I realized that this was intended to be seen in super-duper 3D. 'Ahh,' I thought, 'Now I see. Ooooh, that would have been so cool to see all that paper flying around in 3D.' We haven't witnessed anything like this in cinematic history since the famous bolo-bat scene in the 1953 film House of Wax.Hugo does a lot of hiding and running, primarily from a train station cop played by Sacha Baron Cohen. Cohen's character is an amalgam of Inspectors Javert and Clouseau. He and his trusty Doberman Pinscher cannot seem to track down the elusive boy who knows the station and its walls like the inner workings of an automaton. During one climactic scene, Hugo gives the Inspector the slip by doing a Harold Lloyd impression from a clock tower.Once the Inspector catches up with Hugo, they have a talk. During the conversation, the little urchin makes the Inspector laugh. The Inspector tells him that he's funny. Hugo then says, 'I'm funny how? I mean funny like I'm a clown? I amuse you? I make you laugh, I'm here to ******' amuse you? What do you mean funny? Funny how? How am I funny? What the **** is so funny about me? Tell me, tell me what's funny!'Wait a minute. I might me confused. That dialog might be from a different movie - a real Scorcese film.",5,1,2,27 January 2017
Good Will Hunting," Good Will Hunting Revisited
","I recently had the opportunity to see Good Will Hunting for the second time. I had not seen it since its video release in 1997. It's funny how nearly twenty years can change your opinion about a movie. I was lukewarm to the film back then, but now - older and wiser - I see it in a new light.I had initially dismissed this film as a two hour study of a bunch of unlikeable and unbelievable people. But now it is evident that Matt Damon deserved his Oscar nomination for his portrayal of the title character, the good Will Hunting.Damon does a yeoman's job making us believe in someone who is not only a math genius with a photographic memory, but a barroom- brawler, cynic, janitor, lover, and all-around down-to-earth working-class joe. Damon and his compadre Ben Affleck also deserved their Oscar screenplay win for creating a character more fantastic than any from the mind of J.R.R. Tolkien.Robin Williams also deserved his Oscar win for having us buy his interpretation of an all-knowing beard-sporting eye-glinting joke- cracking-but-no-nonsense psychologist. Affleck, director Gus Van Sant, and the rest of the cast merit mention as well for trying to get us to like and accept all the unappealing and implausible characters who populate this fantasy world.All this leads me to believe that I should revisit films like Showgirls, The River Wild, Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, and The Greek Tycoon. Maybe I was a little too harsh in my initial assessment of those as well. Yeah, right.",3,5,7,27 January 2017
The Hurt Locker," Beware The Desert Bomb
","This is a movie about bombs. Lots of bombs. Desert bombs.The End.That's pretty much it. Oh sure, a few other things happened. You wanna hear about 'em? OK. I'll provide you with a little more, oh faithful reader.I'm still not sure what the title The Hurt Locker refers to. It's not about well-secured first aid kits, nor is it about gymnasium facilities for actors William, John, or even Mary Beth.This celluloid endeavor was directed by Kathryn Bigelow; the deft hand behind such legendary screen classics as Point Break and Blue Steel. It stars Jeremy Renner as Staff Sergeant William James, an expert at diffusing bombs. Joining him on the Explosivity Disposaling Unit are Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), and Owen Eldrige (Brian Geraghty)Renner was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance. I'm not sure why this is. The supporting performances - most notably Mackie's - were, in my opinion, superior. All Renner did was act 'cool'. Oh, so 'cool'. Desert 'cool'. But if looking 'cool' is the only criterion used for award recognition, then David Caruso should be nominated for a Nobel Prize.The film centers mostly on the antics of Sergeant James. James loves dismantling things that can blow you into a zillion pieces. He'd rather do that than live a peaceful life in a nice home with his beautiful wife. We're shown some of his domestic life, but the movie doesn't show the good stuff. No. Instead we see him cleaning out the eaves trough of his house.Now I've cleaned out a few roof gutters in my time, but the one depicted here has to be the gunkiest gutter in the history of home maintenance. And he's cleaning it out with his bare hand!!! C'mon, use a scoop, or a trowel, or a toy shovel, a stick, a shoe, anything. I'd rather diffuse bombs in Iraq than have to clean out that gutter in that fashion.Another scene worth mentioning shows the guys - after getting a little snockered - engaging in an activity where good judgment and mental acuity would be a distinct disadvantage. The 'game' involves taking turns hitting each other as hard as possible in the stomach. My wife, while watching this powerful and touching scene, turned to me and asked, 'Why do men do those kind of things?'You know, we men just have to chuckle when women ask us such questions. It was obvious to me, but I patiently explained it to her that this was a gesture of endearment. Women hug. Men try to smash the bejabers out of each other. It's their way of saying, 'You're OK in my book.' And nothing says it better than a ruptured spleen.A word of warning here to those prone to seasickness: the camera- work in this film is of that hand-held style that so many directors are wont to use these days. I suppose they feel it gives their movies that gritty, realistic, documentary look - which is ironic, since documentary filmmakers rarely use the technique anymore. Besides, if it's supposed to look realistic, then why don't I see the real world that way through my eyes? Although if I did, I'd be making an appointment - and pronto - with an ophthalmologist or a brain surgeon.If you have a tough time watching this film due to that camera style, then avoid The Bourne Ultimatum at all costs. You would not survive. Its visuals are worse than any bone-jarring experience you could imagineI once took a ride on a gigantically tall roller coaster. Its peak disappeared into the clouds. It was called the Red Ripper, or the Brown Streak, or the Green Puker - something like that. Anyway, all I know is that I was smiling after that ride. I wasn't smiling after The Bourne Ultimatum.In closing, I should say that even though I had some reservations about renting the DVD of The Hurt Locker, I was able to take something positive from it - a lesson.The lesson learned is, pay attention to your reservations.",4,1,4,27 January 2017
Moulin Rouge!," This film does not deserve an exclamation point!
","If a projector could vomit on a movie screen, the result would be Baz Lurhmann's Moulin Rouge! I did not want to end that first sentence with an exclamation point, but it is part of the movie title. The perplexing punctuation point in the title could be due to one or more of the following:a) It emphasizes that it should DEFINITELY(!) not be confused with the fine 1952 biopic of Toulouse-Lautrec starring JosÃ© Ferrer. b) It is used as a warning, as in 'Danger!' or 'Hazardous to Health!' or 'Bad Movie!' c) It is just an example of the unnecessary and worthless trappings that someone thought they could throw together and pass off as 'art'.Let me see if I can sum up this mess for you: Take a reel or two of 35mm film. Fill it with gaudy, heavy and bloated direction. Add some stomach-churning performances. Throw in a weird goulash of music. Mix it up with enough chopped up, disjointed editing as to produce vertigo,and VOILA!Motion picture motion sickness. Cinematic mal de mer. Projector projectile puke. Technicolor yawn.The remedy for this malady is to view the aforementioned 1952 film, Moulin Rouge â€“ without the exclamation point!",1,1,3,27 January 2017
La La Land," La La Long
","When do I finally realize that I'm not enjoying a particular movie? This realization usually comes when a scene in the film reminds me of some other movie and I find myself longing to watch that film instead of the one I am desperately trying to enjoy. In the case of La La Land, this didn't take too long.During the duo dance scenes between Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, I found myself longing to watch Fred Astaire and Eleanor Powell. During the jazz music scenes, I found myself longing to put on some music from Miles Davis or Dave Brubeck. Damien Chazelle's soufflé-light screenplay made me long for some sort of story with substance. Let's face it; even your longest allowable tweet would carry as much storytelling weight as this script. When considering Chazelle's direction, I found myself longing for a musical directed by Vincent Minnelli. And while all this longing was going on, I was longing for a shorter film. La La Land is not a long production when compared with West Side Story or The Music Man (and let's not make any further comparisons with those great films) but, it sure as heck seemed like a long, long movie.Dictionary.com defines the phrase 'la la land' as 'a state of being out of touch with reality.' I won't disagree with that definition. About halfway into this flick, I was beginning to drift off into Dictionary.com's interpretation.Luckily, I had some severe arthritis pain in my right big toe that kept me alert long enough to long for some relief; algesic or cinematic, and to keep me awake long enough so that I could make a valid critique of this picture. Finally, I long for the day when someone will make a musical that's even half as watchable as the last good Hollywood musical — Hairspray (which really wasn't all that long ago, was it?)",5,9,14,26 January 2017
Whiplash," House of Whipcord is probably better
","I MUST have watched the wrong movie. The reviews for this film could in no way apply to the contrived claptrap I've just seen. Perhaps the positive reviews here were intended for that 1974 masterpiece House of Whipcord. The movie called Whiplash that I saw stars J.K. Simmons as Terence, a music teacher who can slap a face with such force as to make General Patton wince. The film also stars Miles Teller as Andrew, a student of Terence's who yearns to learn from him how to properly play the drums. Andrew accomplishes this by volunteering to let his teacher play the bongos on his face.I won't say that Damien Chazelle's direction is heavy-handed, but I would probably prefer to stick my head in Andrew's bass drum during the climactic scene than to endure watching said scene again.A word of advice to anyone considering seeing this film; go to YouTube instead and do a search for Buddy Rich. You will see the greatest drummer ever, and spare yourself the agony of viewing this over-the-top, trite, clichÃ©d, eye-roll inducing effort. Your eyes and your ears will thank you for it.",3,1,3,28 January 2017
The Wolf of Wall Street," Hooray For The Ham
","Martin Scorcese seems to have a penchant for creating films about loathsome characters. That being said, the low-lifes in this film make the gang in GoodFellas seem like a bunch of guys you'd really like to hang with.If you can like a film about dislikeable people, then the director of that film has really achieved something (GoodFellas, for example). This movie however left me with an excruciating three-hour urge to strangle someone. In fact, the only thing I found myself applauding was the piece of ham that got caught in the throat of Donnie Azoff (played to the nth degree of irritation by Jonah Hill).Speaking of ham, the entire cast was guilty of histrionic hysteria, including the usually reliable Leonard DiCaprio. They all seemed eager to show the audience just how pleased they were to be in a Scorcese movie. And Scorcese himself seemed eager to show the audience that he can still make a film that is not even near as good as, but is kinda, sorta, almost like GoodFellas (hadn't he learned anything from Casino?)This is the 2nd time I've panned a Scorcese film on this site, so I decided to look at his body of work and see how many of his films I've truly enjoyed over the years. There aren't many. GoodFellas, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, The Last Temptation of Christ, The Last Waltz, and After Hours are my choices for his best efforts.I wouldn't suggest that Mr. Scorcese is not a good director. I just wish he would make more movies about people and things we can care about. Now, if he could just make a whole movie about that piece of ham...",4,2,3,27 January 2017
The Blind Side," The Papaya of Football Movies
","Oh, me and my decisions!When I heard all the buzz about Sandra Bullock's performance in The Blind Side, I decided that I just had to rent the DVD. Similarly, when I heard all the buzz about papaya, I decided that I just had to try some. Both of those decisions left a bad taste in my mouth.Perhaps I will post a critique of papaya on some food review site (Rotten Kumquats?), but here I must review films.Bullock plays Leigh Anne Tuohy, a plucky gun-wielding mom with a lot of spunk (remember what Lou Grant said about spunk?) One day, Leigh Anne notices a behemoth named Michael Oher (played well by Quinton Aaron) walking around shivering and homeless. She invites him to stay overnight in her upscale home.Now, I don't know about most guys, but if some rich woman that looked like Sandra Bullock invited me to stay overnight in her home, I'd be there faster than a Viagra-laden Superman flying to his date with Lois Lane. However, after a few minutes of listening to Tuohy's junior- high psychology as well as enduring her general all-around annoying personality, I'd be out of there faster than Sarah Palin's ouster from a Mensa meeting.Then there's Bullock's performance itself. I don't know if it suffered from the fact that she was portraying such an irritating person. I was hoping some hulk from the football team would mistake her for a blocking sled and... well, not really. But maybe the fact that the character got under my skin so much says something about Bullock's acting. I doubt however that this is what was intended by all those involved in making this flick. But even discounting the annoying main character, John Lee Hancock's dull and tedious direction makes this movie hard to bear.And, by the way, I'm still waiting for the first great football film to be made (the best of the bunch, Jerry McGuire and Heaven Can Wait, can only marginally be considered football films).However, I wouldn't be surprised if someone has already made a movie about papaya that is more palatable than The Blind Side.",3,2,5,27 January 2017
Flight," The Whipster
","Flight stars Denzel Washington as Whip Whitaker, a pilot who can fly a passenger jet through the eye of a needle even though he's downed enough alcohol to put Haystacks Calhoun on his keester.Whitaker is no stranger to other mind-altering substances. He apparently can drink ten gallons of 150 proof hooch, fall asleep, then get himself back on his feet by snorting several lines of cocaine. And with all those drugs swirling around in his liver, he can expertly maneuver a disabled airplane upside-down (to be clear, it's the airplane that's upside-down. Although the Whipster could likely fly it standing on his head). What a stud!However this is a pretty good movie. You'll really enjoy it if you first dispose of your jaded negativity.",6,0,0,27 January 2017
The Martian," Keep Him There
","At one point in The Martian, Matt Damon's character mentions that he hasn't bathed in quite a while. My wife turned to me and said, 'He must stink!' I replied, 'Almost as much as this movie.'I've seen worst movies to be sure. But I would have expected more from director Ridley Scott and certainly a great deal more from one of the better known planets in our solar system.Damon plays astro-botanist and electromechanical whiz Mark Whatney. This guy makes McGyver look like a five-year-old dealing with an incomplete Tinker Toy set.As far as the acting and directing go, I suspect that Mr. Scott, while screen testing Jessica Chastain, said something to the effect of, 'Yes! That's it! That's the kind of acting I want in this film! I want everyone to simper and smirk and give me that 'can-do' attitude. We'll do over two hours of just that! As well, we'll pepper the film with crummy pop music from the seventies. And we'll have none of that four-letter language that I've used in my superior films such as American Gangster. This is going to be a movie that the whole family can suffer through!'The effects are great. And although I haven't been there yet, the Mars landscape looks real enough. But this is typically overblown Hollywood schmaltz (and you just KNOW how it's going to end).I should finally mention another notable scene in this film where Damon is sitting in his Martian abode watching a video of a Happy Days episode. It raises the question, 'Would I rather be 225 million kilometers away on a cold and barren planet watching Happy Days, or subject myself to another movie like The Martian in the comfort of my living room?'Tough call.",4,2,4,27 January 2017
