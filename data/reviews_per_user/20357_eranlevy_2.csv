Blade Runner 2049," Amazing, better than the original, which was one of my favorites
","The original was one of my favorites. Thought it was a bad idea to make a sequel to it, yet somehow they managed to do an incredible job at it. It has the same style and pace as the original, however somehow even though it's significantly longer it 'flows' much better. The world design and style has a close relationship to the original, but it expands it and looks amazing just like the original looked at the time. And the plot is well written and executed. Highly recommended!! And better to watch the first one before seeing this one.",10,2,12,7 October 2017
Suicide Squad," Big potential left unfulfilled, but still well worth watching
","This movie had a potential to be a milestone and one of the biggest successes of the genre in recent years. It has superb cast, very cool characters, a refreshing idea that psychopathic villains are the stars - everything looks so cool and promising in the beginning of the movie (and the trailers). The ground is well setup.However, a lot of it is left unfulfilled later and it feels like it could've been much better. First, characters eventually don't show enough of that 'craziness'. The studio should've just unleashed them, let them go wild and do the crazy things they're supposed to do, even if that means it would be R rated.Then, the script is so so, and the directing and editing jobs leave a lot to be desired. Something doesn't work as smoothly as it should've.Still, it's by far not as bad as critics portray. All of the major cast is doing an excellent job, especially Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Jared Leto. Dressings and make up is superb, it's like watching a comic come to life. Soundtrack is cool. All of these are enough to make it interesting and enjoyable. Don't miss it, well worth watching despite the issues!",7,1,3,6 August 2016
