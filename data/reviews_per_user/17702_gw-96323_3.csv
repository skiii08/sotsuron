",Another favorite from Miyazaki I love this film just as much as Spirited Away this was also recommended to me by my best friend (girlfriend) during middle school I thank her for showing me to the world of Studio Ghibli I love this film but it's a little bit behind Spirited Away by one point overall a 10.1 outta 10.2 it's a masterpiece of an adaptation of Diana Wynne Jones' 1986 novel I love this film and I love Ghibli the characters are wonderful the story is wonderful everything in this film is amazing except for (Warning Ahead Minor Spoiler)the end of the Sulieman scene,10,2,2,4 April 2018

Princess Mononoke," My first Studio Ghibli film
",This was the film that was my introduction to Studio Ghibli and I remember it so well I was recommended this by my best friend (Girlfriend)she told me I would love this film and bear in mind I had heard of Studio Ghibli I just hadn't watched a film by them until this film I immediately knew after watching this I had to watch it again and then watch the rest and I did exactly that I love this film the only two scenes I don't like are *Warning Minor Spoilers*When the forest spirit is first introduced and the other scene is when Moro and Ashitaka had a conversation but overall a 10.0 out of 10.2,10,1,1,4 April 2018
