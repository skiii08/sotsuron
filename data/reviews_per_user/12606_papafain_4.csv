Alien 3," The Dog Alien - Alien 3
","After Alien they started to make thousands of aliens in one movie but in this movie there is only one Dog Alien. But it became full-grown very quickly. Since this movie was not very popular, why was there yet another Alien film? Alien vs. Predator was a very interesting film and I always like to see Lance Henriksen at work, but Alien Resurrection was a little too much like Jason X. The Alien design was an interesting evolution, as always. I agree with other postings, that this movie is under-rated, but after the adrenaline rush of Aliens, slowing the pace back down to that of Alien was a bit of a letdown. I would always pay to see Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley - a truly terrific character. If you have only seen this movie once, give it another shot. Maybe two. It definitely needs more than one viewing, if only to catch all the dialog, as some of the accents are not easy to pick up.",8,1,3,29 March 2005
28 Days Later...," Is This the Movie He Wanted to Make
","This film seems to fit the comments made on it only as another 'flesh- eating zombie' movie, of which there are way more than enough. It is more stylish and less gory than the others but the director's commentary on the DVD I rented, together with the comments of 'scientists' included therein, suggest a more serious, if not original, intent. The idea that animal rights activists might accidentally or intentionally release a pandemic is not implausible. Such an event could indeed be a disaster. The idea of a pandemic occurring on its own or as a result of a terrorist act is also not implausible. So why not make that movie? Not commercial? Instead this is just another rather dumb movie, rather than the cautionary tale it might have been. All the neat scenes of deserted cities cannot overcome that. Query: if the 'disease' is so contagious and leaves it victims raging maniacs instead of dead, where did everyone go? If the infected can starve to death, why don't they attack each other? There are a lot of things to admire about the technique of this movie and the actors. If you like this kind of movie, don't watch the director's commentary.",3,1,2,24 July 2005
Saw," Not as good as most think it is
","This is not a 'don't bother to see' movie, but it seems to me vastly over-rated by most commenter's. I did not think of Seven while watching this because it is not in the same class. From many years of watching horror/slasher movies, I don't expect logic from them and you do not get it here. Even given that it is hard to predict how one would react in the situation Lawrence and Adam find themselves, it strains credulity that, handed a hack saw you would start trying to saw through those very thick chains (in spite of their thickness they don't seem to be very heavy) when the shackle around their ankles or the rusty pipes to which the chains are attached look more vulnerable. Poor Danny Glover is stuck with playing one of the dumbest characters in the genre. The scene where he and his partner track the killer to his lair is laughable and seems to have been staged by the killer on the assumption that they would come and not bring any backup. And when he comes in in that ridiculous hooded cape I could not stop laughing. Movies which feature 'killers' with infinite technology at their disposal (is Shawnee's 'gag' available on the Internet?) are a cop-out. If Zep was told he had a slow-acting poison in his system (that would take at least 8 hours to work) wouldn't you go to the hospital? It is next to impossible to sort out the time frame: when was the picture of Zep looking out the Doctor's bedroom window, which was in Adam's bag with the saws, taken and by who? I will give them that the situations created by the killer are disturbing but have the filmmakers ever been in a bathroom in a factory? I have and I have never seen one that size with just one toilet and no urinals, not to mention a bathtub. And why would it be placed in such an inaccessible location? Maybe the killer built it himself, he seems to be able to do as he pleases. Out of room.",5,0,0,3 February 2006
The Departed," Not as bad or as good as advertised
","I have not seen Infernal Affairs, so can make no comparisons. The Departed is far from Scorsese's best work. The actors are uniformly good, including the minor characters. Ultimately, I could really see no point to the movie. It is much too long, padded by scenes which are unnecessary to the story-line and are just distracting. I was attracted to the plot. A cop undercover in the mob is old news and a cop who is on the take is also, but both in the same story is good stuff. Unfortunately, there is no character who is sufficiently in focus. The scene where Costigan is trailing Sullivan does not show anyone else dressed the way they are and so when Sullivan kills the wrong guy (dressed in ball cap and hooded sweat) it is not only a clich√© but no surprise. The only criticism I have of the acting is the constant and annoying way the actors' accents vary, frequently within the same scene. I have never been in Boston (but really like Dennis Lehane's books) but do fancy high-rise apartments really have rats running across the balconies? Saying this movie is great because it won the Oscar is not meaningful: in my opinion this is not the best movie of 2006, or any other year.",4,4,7,8 March 2007
