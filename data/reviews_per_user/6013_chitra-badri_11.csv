Requiem for a Dream," Better than Black Swan
","For some strange reason, my new year began with me wanting to catch up with movies/music/tv shows that came out when I was a student but I never had time (or a tv) to watch. So obviously, Aronofsky's much talked about movie was on the list.How I wish someone had warned me about how positively disturbing and gut wrenching this movie is ðŸ˜– At the surface, it seems like a movie on drug abuse, but it really is about the abuse of power. Respectable people like doctors, shrinks, cops and execs are shown to be highly manipulative, exerting their power and getting away with it. And our characters feel the constant need to escape this gritty world of power abuse through their choice of drug (heroin or television), and sadly, become victims of their choices.Barring the mother, I felt the movie lacked character sketches. Backstories were simply skimmed over for the others. Or maybe Aronofsky intentionally kept it that way to add to the heightened sense of disturbance, and nothing is more disturbing than a lack of closure.I positively disliked Black Swan, but this movie was something else.",8,0,0,22 February 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Wow
","What a movie! What nuance! Please, please watch it. This movie reminded me so much of how I felt when I watched 'Crash' 15 years ago...",9,0,2,22 February 2019
Forrest Gump," Magic realism that never gets old
","I have watched this movie so many times, but noticed something only now. Whoever Forrest crosses paths with, ends up dying an unnatural death. The only one who lives a long, happy life is Lt. Dan, who was supposed to die.Each time I watch it, a new perspective blows my mind! It's one of those movies....",10,1,1,22 February 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Meh movie, watch it only for Rami
","The movie was okay, just okay. The raw, edginess that you hear in Queen's songs was really missing in this narrative. The karaoke style subtitles annoyed me no end. Something about the movie felt forced and weird, as if it lacked nuance and authenticity, and I think I know why Sacha Cohen opted out of it (I really would have loved to see him play Mercury.)However, Rami Malek as Freddie really held his own. His flamboyance, attitude, body language and every tiny acting detail was a true tribute to the artist. Go watch it just for him.",7,0,1,22 February 2019
Man of Steel," Boring
","Predictable special effects that remind you of War of the worlds, Independence Day, Avatar etc + a really ugly guy in a red cape = worst superman movie. Ever. No wonder Stan Lee did not make a cameo appearance :PI felt it was a bad attempt to batmanize a superman story. The idea was not so bad, but way too much action for my liking :P The only part I really liked was how they did away with kryptonite altogether, offering a much more realistic explanation for his powers/weaknesses.",3,0,7,22 February 2019
Dunkirk," A must watch for many reasons
","Perhaps it's high time we had a war story that told the tale of the youngest, most inexperienced, nameless soldier.Of a story where civilians display as much heroism as the soldiers they are rescuing.Perhaps Harry Styles' performance will make people stop dissing the talent of boys from boy bands.Perhaps it takes only an incredibly talented actor like Tom Hardy to show emotion through his eyes alone (it's the only part of his face you see in much of the movie)Go watch it. Twice. But try not to compare this piece of fiction with the facts. Watch it for its cinematic brilliance.",8,0,1,22 February 2019
Gandhi," It never gets old
","Despite having watched the movie a gazillion times, I never noticed that Daniel Day Lewis has a teeny tiny role as a racist Afrikaner and that Alok Nath also has a small role as a young freedom fighter. I swear, I never get tired of this movie! I'm yet to see another movie on Gandhi that was this good. And it makes me happy that a Gujurati Bori got to play the Mahatma. True to his belief of love and respect for all.",10,0,0,22 February 2019
Jerry Maguire," You had me at hello
","A 35 yr old at the peak of his career has an attack of 'guilty conscience' and starts to wonder if he is really making a difference. He starts his own company and is immediately wracked with self-doubt but chugs along despite feeling like such a failure. But one woman stands by him and truly believes in what he does. He marries her out of respect for her loyalty, perhaps also for fear of loneliness, but is still unsure of himself. It's only when he experiences his first win and is dying to share his happiness with her he realises how truly valuable she is, and feels more confident in himself. Does that make him a narcissistic wimp who desperately needs wins in his life to feel good, or is he a character who is finally coming of age? I'm still wondering...",8,1,1,22 February 2019
Hotel Transylvania," From the maker of Dexter's Lab
","If you're a Genndy Tartakovsky or Adam Sandler fan, or like me, a fan of both - go see Hotel Transylvania! And if you do not know who Genndy Tartakovsky is - you are stupid, you are stupid, and don't forjet, you are stupid!",7,0,0,22 February 2019
Saving Mr. Banks," The lesser-known truth behind the Mary Poppina movies
","Watched Saving Mr. Banks last night - what a brilliant, moving story on the making of Mary Poppins, with stellar performances by Emma Thompson and Colin Farrell! Who would have thought that one of the most endearing stories of children's literature was based on characters from the writer's troubled childhood. A must watch for all those who have grown up reading (or watching) Mary Poppins!",9,2,2,22 December 2019
The Godfather," Art imitates life
","This movie had actual mobster families involved in several movie decisions, such as removing 'mafia' and 'cosa nostra' from the script, as well as supplying the actors who played Luca Brasi and Johnny Fontane.",9,0,0,22 February 2019
