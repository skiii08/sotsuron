Requiem for a Dream," awesome, simply beautiful, welcome to reality!
","J-U-I-C-E. Took me ages to finally see this flick, first off i would like to thank the lord for putting Clint Mansell on this earth, the score he has done for every movie he has been involved in is truly mind blowing.Next i would like to congratulate the director and cast for the masterpiece i juts witnessed, a realistic viewpoint of the downfall of a subject that affects most of everyones life. or most of everyone that i know.The build up of this flick to the climax is perfectly timed, and gives a chilling insight into the world we live in.Everyones lonely, everyone needs a fix, everyone wants to make it and the struggle we go through to get there.Truly fantastic, a must.",9,3,6,10 March 2007
