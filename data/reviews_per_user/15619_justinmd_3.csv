Blade Runner 2049," A Science Fiction Masterpiece
","The original Blade Runner is one of the most influential movies of all time and pretty much changed the game to what science fiction. I was extremely excited to see this movie because it has possibly the best director working right now in Denis Villeneuve. Right from the opening shot I knew that I was in for something special. Blade Runner 2049 is the reason I love to go to the movies. This film has pretty much everything that you could ask for. Mind blowing visuals, beautiful storytelling, phenomenal acting, and a sense of surprise. Ryan Gosling is absolutely incredible as our protagonist Officer K, and he plays the character extremely well. Denis Villeneuve also continues to prove why he is the best director working at the moment. Every shot in this movie is stunning and he knows how to direct actors. Roger Deacons cinematography in this movie is some of the best that I have ever seen. If he does not finally win an awards for his work in this movie then the Oscars must hold a grudge against him. Lets talk about most people's biggest flaw with this movie. I have heard many people state that they believed it was to long. I could not disagree more. Every scene in this movie is there for a purpose and is used to help push the story further. If you took away any scene in my opinion than it would lose some of it's beauty and you would miss some of the stunning shots this film has to offer. I never once in this movie was bored and after it was all over felt that it went by pretty fast. Blade Runner 2049 not only matches the brilliance of the original(which is one of my favorites of all time) it actually some how manages to surpass it and expands on the themes of what it means to be human and is emotionally satisfying as it. Please do yourself a favor and go support this movie because it is absolutely stunning and has not been performing well so far. You will not regret it!",10,4,16,8 October 2017
Arrival," Best Film Of 2016
",I was incredibly excited to go into this movie since it was being directed by one of the best directors working today Denis Villeneuve. I walked out of this movie floored. This film I have seen twice not and there has been no other movie this year that has stuck with me long after leaving the theater. There wasn't one thing in this film I had a problem with. The performances are all incredible especially from Amy Adams who gives the best performance I have ever seen from her which is incredibly high praise since she is one of the best actresses working today. She is very subdued and you believe everything that she is doing because she sells her character so incredibly well. The cinematography is exceptional in this film and every shot has a unique visual style from Bradford Young. I am not going to spoil the ending but it takes a while to fully process and that is why it is an excellent film to go see twice because it works just as well if not better seeing it again.It's a film that gave me chills in the first 5 minutes of seeing it and pretty much the whole time. It stuck with me long after seeing the film and it's a movie that raises questions. It is a hopeful movie with bigger ideas than just a typical alien invasion movie. This has been one of the best movies so far this decade. Please do yourself a favor and go see this movie. (A+),10,3,11,27 November 2016
Jojo Rabbit," A Wonderful Film
","JoJo Rabbit is simply an excellent movie. This film is incredibly funny, and also very charming, and emotional. The performances from all of the actors in this film were great as well. The young boy gives one of the better child performances I have ever seen from a young actor. He is really great, and portrays the character in a complex way, and still has the young innocence you need from a child actor. The movie also deals with very touchy subjects incredibly well. You may think a movie poking fun at Nazi Germany may come off as offensive, or disrespectful, but I never felt that once while watching this film. I also felt the movie doing a wonderful job, at bringing the character together, and you understand why the characters in the film thought how they did. This is a truly great movie, and Taika Wattiti continues to prove he's one of the best filmmakers working today.",9,18,32,5 February 2020
