The Expendables 2," Are you serious?
","It makes me sad that this movie has such a high rating. Do the masses really enjoy action movies that lack good action? Most of the stars in this movie have been in at least one awesome movie if not a whole slew of awesome movies. Most likely the entire budget was spent on their salaries versus putting together a good script and good action. What a terrible waste of an opportunity to make a great action film.If you want to see a movie with awesome action and an awful script, watch something like The Raid Redemption. I'm totally okay with sacrificing a script for good action, but this doesn't even deliver on that. This is exactly the type of garbage people associate with big ticket Hollywood movies made for those who can't decipher what a proper film is. For those that enjoyed the one liners, for me that just wasn't nearly enough to make this a fun film. I thought the 1st Expendables, while not a great film either, was at least more entertaining than this one. If you are bored, pop this on in the background while you do something else, otherwise I suggest you don't waste your time watching it.",2,2,5,21 December 2012
