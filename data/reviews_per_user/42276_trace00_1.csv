The New World," Waste of time!!
",Do not go see this movie!! It is a waste of time and money. It is agonizing slow with no plots and will put you to sleep the first 15 minutes. I sat there for 2 1/2 hours expecting SOMETHING will happen but nothing!! even the fighting seen is boring. The movie jump from one random scene to the next and leave you wonder: what is going on!! Most of the people sitting near me in the theater fell asleep and some of them left after 30-40 minutes. Collin Farrell is the only good thing in this movie although it seemed like he only spoke 4-5 times. Stick to Disney's Pocahontus animated version!! Do not waste your time on this movie!,1,2,7,25 February 2006
