The Avengers," Why is this movie so annoying?
","Why do these films have so much jargon, delivered in mumbles, at diarrhoeretic speeds? How does anyone understand the film in one sitting at the cinemas?",4,0,4,22 March 2020
Interstellar," Everyone who rated this good fell into a wormhole
","Cons
<ul><li>Science babble, forcing me to pause and question and clarify several times: some theories are based on our current understanding of physics and astronomy, and others are just stupid.</li><li>There's one scene where there's dust all over the house, but nowhere along the fields when they're driving through</li><li>Time-space warping wormhole but their spaceship is intact, they suffer no physical/psychological changes</li><li>n-th dimension, and you end up behind the bookshelf in your old house??</li><li>the whole 'love' things was just cheesy</li><li>they'd sent several ships prior, and then this one, but then no others in the interim years?</li><li>it takes lightyears to get anywhere, yet they cross the blackhole in a matter of minutes</li><li>Matthew McConaughey needs to learn diction!</li></ul>",2,1,13,4 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Only watched it to know how it ended
","So, is this a psychological horror or a monster flick? It can't decide. The little bits of dramatic connection between the characters is marred by cheap slapstick humour or cheesy shocks. Too many incongruous elements: Pennywise seems to be able to appear in dreams and thoughts, but seemingly can't just kill people when they're just within reach; he can shape shift at all other times, but can't just get close enough to attack people. So much stupidity it's unbelievable how many good actors decided to do this film. Such a waste of a budget.",2,1,1,17 March 2020
Halloween," terrible
","This is so terrible it's unbelievable. At every turn all the characters do the most implausible things. And the guy gets stabbed with a knitting needle, a coat hanger, a knife, and then gets shot several times, and still manages to walk away. Wtf?! Absolute time waste. Forced to give it 1 point. Blegh.",1,3,8,29 September 2019
