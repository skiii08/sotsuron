The Blair Witch Project," Zzzzzzzzz...
","Okay.  So we've got these three film-school kids -- Heather Donahue as Heather, Josh Leonard as Josh, and Mike Williams as ... um ... oh yeah, Mike.  They go off into the woods to film a documentary about the Blair Witch (and if you haven't spent hours browsing the BWP website, you have absolutely no idea who the Blair Witch is or why anybody would be interested in her).  Instead, they get lost.  They wander around.  They wander around some more.  They scream, yell, and curse at each other.  They act like idiots.And, of course, they KEEP FILMING through all this, as I'm sure any three smart people would, because we all know that filming yourself getting lost is far more important than getting back to civilization.Eventually some weird stuff happens.  We don't know exactly what because nobody bothers to tell us.  Is it scary?  Well, I was kind of afraid that the herky-jerky camera motion would make me vomit in the theater, but other than that the film that TV promos called the 'scariest movie since The Exorcist' didn't have one scary moment.I've heard it said that the filmmakers wanted to scare us by purposely not showing us everything.  Fine, but even if you don't show everything, you still have to show enough.  Take the movie 'Seven'.  You don't see the actual murders committed by John Doe, but by showing you the bodies and murder scenes, the director forces you to imagine their brutality.  'Blair Witch' doesn't give you any clue what's going on.  The only thing I was led to imagine during this movie was how else I could have spent 80 minutes.",1,2,4,26 July 2001
Memento," bring a scorecard, you'll need it
","Okay, after pondering the ending of 'Memento' for about 20 minutes, I think I've finally got it.Our friend Lenny can't remember anything.  He has to write down everything that's happened to him or it'll just swish down the drain in his mind.  When you watch this movie, you might end up having to do the same thing in order to keep track of what's going on.  Yeah, everything comes together in a neat little surprise ending, but surprise endings aren't always satisfying. Especially when they're way off the wall.A good movie, but overrated.  Next time I want to watch a whodunit, I think I'll go with something more conventional.  'Along Came A Spider' came out about the same time and beats this hands-down.Rating: 6/10",6,2,3,7 September 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," just OK
","All right, look.  I know this movie was based on an epic novel (well, the first part of an epic novel, anyway).  I know the filmmakers were facing pressure from Tolkien devotees to make sure the movie stayed faithful to the novel.  If they did, then 'Lord Of The Rings' must be one heck of a dull read.Simply put, there just ain't much of a plot to this story.  Frodo and his pals hit the road and fight some monsters.  Then they get to that walled town with the pub and ... fight some monsters.  Then they go to the elf town of Rivendell and ... fight some monsters.  Then they journey into the dark mines of Tora Bora or whatever and ... fight some more monsters.  And what was that big ugly thing in the mines supposed to be, anyway?  When the hobbits & co. fought it, I was distinctly reminded of Dan Aykroyd trying to narfle the garthok in 'Coneheads'.Then there's the sex appeal problem.  Would it have ruined old J-Double-R's 1,137-page behemoth to include a female or two in the Fellowship?  Legolas, Gandalf, and that fat guy with the axe stick around for the entire 2-hour-45-minute production, and Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett get five minutes each?  I don't know about the rest of the 'Rings' fans out there, but I definitely would rather have seen the beautiful Liv shooting those arrows off than that blond guy.This wasn't a bad movie.  The scenery was amazing, especially Rivendell. The fight scenes and action sequences were exciting.  Ian McKellen's fight with Saruman and the disintegrating staircase scene in the mine were show-stealers.  It just wasn't that great.  As Austin Powers might have said, this was the Diet Coke of fantasy movies -- not awful, but not too tasty either.  To see it listed here as the #1 movie of all time, ahead of classics like 'The Godfather' and 'The Shawshank Redemption', is a joke.",6,0,0,27 December 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," Huh?
","'The Matrix' was a great movie.  'Reloaded' was a good movie, but not great. It has a lot of well-done action sequences, but the dialogue gets bogged down in techno-babble and spiritual mumbo jumbo.  Fate this, destiny that, choice, free will, reality, illusion, blah blah blah.  In the first movie, Morpheus seemed like a wise, trustworthy figure; in this one, he sounds like a fan doing a Yoda impersonation at a 'Star Wars' convention.  And don't even get me started with that French guy in the restaurant.Don't worry about me giving away the ending.  I'm still trying to figure out what it meant.You know, I really missed Joe Pantoliano as Cipher.  He was a cool bad guy.6/10",6,0,0,16 May 2003
Contact," what if?
","Out of all the 'mankind finally meets up with intelligent life from Out There' movies like 'ET' and 'Close Encounters', this is definitely the best. The filmmakers put a lot of thought into considering what would actually happen if this scenario were to take place.  They make the wise choice to (mostly) forego the special effects and focus on the bombshell impact that the discovery would have on all of our lives. This movie is not about aliens in the way that 'Star Wars' or 'Independence Day' is about aliens; it is about us.",9,0,2,7 August 2001
