Blade Runner 2049," Worthy successor to the original
",I love it. I place it equal to the original.The movie is long but after watching twice I can't really find any fluff I would delete. Every scene is important. There are certainly plenty of metaphor moments for the critics to work on.The visuals are stunning. The plot is tight. The editing is almost perfect (ok maybe lose a few seconds here and there). The acting is worthy. The mood and setting of the entire film is just spectacular.To all the trolls who rate this a ONE. Give me a break. I understand if you didn't like it. But a ONE? You disqualify your review with such monstrous judgement.Honestly if you liked the original you should love this one. The ending is begging for #3.,10,1,6,5 January 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Worthy Sequel
","The CGI and sets are spectacular. The acting is fine. The story line is just enough. The editing is good. The music could have been a little more catchy overall. My expectation was poor based on the many low reviews I had read. Also, my view on Guardians #1 was nowhere nearly as glowing as most. I actually found the last half of the movie more entertaining. It was advancing the story. It was not overly 'family' as many reviewers have hated. Jeez. It was just putting some humanity into the plot.I found the first half of the movie very bad. I almost bailed out several times. Just plain bad script and corny jokes and ugh. Lots of scenes where you have to suspend any belief in physics. Although the opening scene was spectacular CGI it failed for me to connect. Dancing around is not enough to entertain me.",6,1,2,4 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Remake of #4
","I loved #1-#6. Each had a unique story to tell. This #7 becomes the first one to completely fail. Here is the test............ Ask anyone a plot point from #4. I guarantee that is one of the plot points from #7. And yes, the center of the plot is again............Harrison Ford and his Millennium Falcon. Been there and done that. Sure, go watch it just for fun but don't expect to be awake when the credits roll around. Probably the most annoying thing was sitting there Thursday night and listening to the audience clap and fawn over every single object appearing in this movie which they had seen in a previous movie. If R2D2 trips on a rock there are howls of laughter. Ugh.",5,25,41,19 December 2015
