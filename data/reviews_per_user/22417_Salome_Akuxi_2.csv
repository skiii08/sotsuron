Iron Man 3," Fe = Iron, Male = Man - Therefore, I am Iron Man.
","I LOVED this movie. It was just the BEST. Okay, Okay, so you know when they say 'Love is Blind'? It's true guys. While I was watching the movie I was like, I love Iron Man, I love Tony Stark, I love Robert Downey Jr. Now, I see I was just being biased when I said it was the best film in the world. The movie is still a really good movie. It had awesome and slightly epic parts and it is overly hilarious, but as an overall I couldn't give it the full 10/10. That doesn't mean I don't want to see Iron Man again, I just feel like I was expecting more and the film was holding back on me. Although after saying all this I have to say I did think the movie was good and I would recommend you to watch it as it is enjoyable. However, I wouldn't worry about not seeing it in 3D - you're not missing much. <ul><li>xoxo</li></ul>",7,1,3,13 June 2013
The Hangover Part III," Lah-May-oh.
","The Hangover III is tremendously funny and had me clutching my stomach the whole way through. I thought it was hilarious, had good action scenes and just the right amount of nudity. Okay maybe a little bit more than the right amount but I could handle it. On the other hand, it wasn't the best film out of the trilogy and didn't follow the normal pattern of a bachelor party gone wrong, but it was a great laugh. I recommend you watch The Hangover I & II before you see III, you don't have to but for those people who like a story-line, The 3rd film would make more sense if you did. P.S Watch out for the surprise at the end. Brilliant cliff-hanger. <ul><li>xoxo</li></ul>",7,1,2,13 June 2013
