United 93," Incredibly powerful.
","This is why Paul Greengrass is one of my favourite directors. We all know what happened to United 93, but the tension never went away for a second. The last fifteen minutes is so frustratingly intense. I say frustratingly because we know that the passengers don't save the plane. I even felt angry for most of the film because it felt like I was in the plane, feeling the desperation of the passengers and the hatred towards the terrorists, even though we know next to nothing about the characters.The scene where the ATCs spot the second plane coming from the right and slamming into the tower was just so powerful because Greengrass' directing made it feel like I was in the tower, like the ATCs, watching the plane hit the building for the first time. I felt my muscles tense as I, in a way, prepared for the impact of the plane.Just wow. Incredibly powerful. I want to say I 'loved' it but it's hard to, given the subject of the film.",10,1,2,28 March 2014
