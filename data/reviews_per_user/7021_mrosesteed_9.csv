Hereditary," Creepy but unrelatable and very slow
","Hereditary is a gruesome, dark 'indie' family drama, which gradually transitions from real life to supernaural horrors. Aiming for a slow build, its style is characterized by long silences, subtly altered colors, a gliding camera, and a muted soundscape overrun by heavily ominous, atmospheric music. However, after some early brutal shocks and eerie scares, the film's creepy vibe cannot maintain sufficient tension to support its multiple troubled protagonists and excruciating pace.",4,3,4,6 April 2019
Shaun of the Dead," Hilarious and horrifying
","Although not inaccurately billed as 'a romantic comedy with zombies,' Shaun of the Dead is, at its heart, a horror film with the same underlying hopelessness that typifies the zombie movie genre. To stave off some of this inevitable darkness, this well constructed, very funny film features not only a witty script full of clever parallels and outrageous situations but also plenty of over the top, implausible gore.",9,1,2,24 March 2019
The Terminator," Excellent - a sci-fi/horror classic
","A solid, sci-fi/action/horror film, The Terminator combines tight writing with stylized, noirish cinematography and brutal, if not bloody, violence. Even as it cuts away from moments of potental gore, its effective editing and vivid but not ostentations sound both emphasize the horror and the helplessness of the protagonists' situation. Its memorable score features recognizeable, recurring themes, including the relentless drum beat that signals the monster's unstoppable approach.",9,0,2,2 March 2019
Silent Hill," Atmospheric and disturbing despite flaws
","A slow building adaptation of Konami's 1999 survival horror video game, Silent Hill pairs the game's siganture fog, monsters, flashlights, and supernatural mystery elements with a story heavily adapted for the cinema. Although the film stumbles over plot holes and timeline discrepancies, its eerie atmosphere is bolstered by practial monster effects, thorough set design, and a surreal score by Akira Yamaoka, whose music from the first two games is wisely employed heavily throughout the film. At the movie's gruesome climax, original music by Jeff Danna evokes religious and Spaghetti Western sensibilities and enhances the visually and conceptually disturbing collision of supernatural and human horror.",7,1,1,27 July 2019
Resident Evil," Fun action-horror
","The first in a decade-and-a-half-long film series inspired by the 1996 Capcom video game of the same name, Resident Evil transforms its source material from gothic survival horror to modern action-horror, complete with prominent electronic music, stock action characters, and CGI violence. Although the movie's uninspired shock sounds, dated computer graphics, choppy flashbacks, and stereotypical casting foreshadow the weaknesses of its vastly inferior sequels, Resident Evil benefits from a solid mystery plot, detailed art direction, and a charismatic performance by Milla Jovovich as a mordern, grown up Alice in Wonderland. The result is a fun thriller whose lack of graphic violence does not dampen the horror of the Umbrella Corporation's cavalier attitude toward human life.",7,3,4,27 July 2019
Insidious," Creepy start, chaotic end
","Insidious begins as a scary, atmospheric story of isolation, paranoia, and potential insanity and ends as an over the top monster fight. By switching progagonists halfway through from frightened mom, Renai, to traumatized dad, Josh, the film loses its focus, spiraling out of control into a convoluted mishmash of clunky exposition, eerie supernatural tableaus, campy villains, and bizarre ghost hunting tecnhiques. While many conceptual and visual elements of the film remain creepy, its generic shock based soundscape and choatic final act undermine the tension of the first part of the film.",6,0,0,19 September 2019
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Cheap fanboy/fangirl fodder
","In contrast to the previous film, this second installment of the series inspired by the survival horror video game series, Resident Evil, feels intended for a built-in audience of the franchise's existing fans. Characters from the games not present in the previous film appear with little introduction, exposition is delivered through a series of choppily edited recaps and distracting subtitles identifying people and locations, and many elements of the production feel like cheap cop-outs, including its laughable swooshy sound effects, its combination-horror-strings-and-indusrial-synth score, and its nonsensical ending. Although the action-horror sequences are fun, especially for fans, the most interesting aspect of Resident Evil: Apocalypse is probably its international casting, which not only reflects its status as a multi-national production but also emphasizes the pervasive influence of the flagrantly immoral Umbrella Corporation.",4,0,4,22 April 2019
The Conjuring," Decent period genre piece
","Based on the allegedly true experiences of real life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, The Conjuring features converging storylines, which combine the typical tropes and aesthetic of haunting films with documentary style depictions of the Warrens' investigation. From the film and audio technology featured in the investigation sequences to the warm color grading of the movie as a whole, which evokes the color film stock of the early post-Tenchicolor era, the film's artistry evokes its 1970s setting, separating it visually from other, more desaturated horror movies of the 2010s. However, the often overwrought, bassy, atmospheric soundscape of its era does prevail.",7,0,1,19 September 2019
The Woman in Black," Scary but somewhat generic
","Produced by a resurrected Hammer Film Productions, The Woman in Black is a frightening ghost story in the gothic tradition of that studio's mid-century horror films. Although it trades the lurid colors of those earlier features for a bleak, subdued, desaturated palette, it mirrors their relatively high production values with solid art direction and lavish, detailed period sets and costumes. Effectively creepy, The Woman in Black relies heavily on sound to draw the protagonist into dangerous situations, and shock the audience with loud noise scares. In spite of this last generic and occasionally confusing tactic (it is sometimes unclear which of these latter sounds the characters can hear and which are part of the non-diegetic musical score) the entire soundscape does enhance the film's ominous atmosphere and allow for the substitution of images obscured by dark or fog for less mysterious or more costly visual effects.",7,0,1,24 March 2019
