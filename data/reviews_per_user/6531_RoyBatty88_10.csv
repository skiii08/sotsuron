Skyfall," Best Bond ever? I'll say so myself.
","Even better than Casino Royale. It gives James Bond even more depth than Daniel Craig already gave him not to mention Adele whom I don't like at all does an amazing opening song. Skyfall is to Daniel Craig was Goldfinger was to Sean Connery, any Bond fan is going to love it, any person who has taste is going to love it. It's an amazing movie from beginning to the very end. It has a classic Bond feel but still gives the audience surprises and provides something new. They're creating a new Bond universe. The movie begins with Bond chasing a man who has a list of all the M-I6 agents of course like any Bond movie the beginning is action packed and builds up to an awesome title. Bond gets shot by a woman named Eve he was working for and leads everyone in MI-6 to believe that he is dead. He comes back (Sounds a little like You Only Live Twice doesn't it?) after someone blows up the embassy. It is learned that is lead by a vengeful man named Silva (Played by Javier Bardem) who has an agenda against M. Now, that is all I am going to tell you, basically I'm just telling you what the trailer has already said. There are many twists and turns that it needs to be seen. I hate giving spoilers.Javier Bardem, easily the creepiest Bond villain he's cynical, flamboyant but not over the top like some of the past villains were. He's the Joker to the James Bond universe. Daniel Craig gives his strongest performance as James Bond, in fact the best acting any James Bond actor has ever given. He gives a darkness to that character, also complexity. They also get a little into James Bond's origins in the movie. It becomes like other Bond movies in the sense that Q (Played by Ben Winshaw) who also is quite hilarious and quirky. Though do not expect over the top gadgets.Skyfall is literally one of the best movies of the year and also the best Bond movie of all time. I will argue that it is even better than Casino Royale. It's loaded with excitement, terrific performances and enough thrills to keep the audience busy for the two and a half hour ride. Enjoy! I give Skyfall and A.",9,1,8,9 November 2012
Fight Club," A masterpiece. Pure and simple.
","Fight Club is a movie that is just incredible. It is one of those movies that hit me in the face and made me realize what a masterpiece really is. It made me think, I related to it in some twisted way and made me want to make movies even more than I already have. Fight Club is my favorite everything. My favorite movie, my favorite book and my favorite soundtrack. Every time I watch Fight Club I totally find something new in it. Fight Club is possibly the most original movie I have ever seen. Many who have not seen it may think that it's a movie about fighting when it's really more then that. Fight Club is a very deep film. This review will get into why it's so amazing to me. (The following paragraphs may contain spoilers be warned) The film had a lot of valid points concerning materialism. In the beginning Edward Norton's character known as 'The Narrator' lived a life where he wanted everything to look like it came out of a magazine. It wasn't until he met Tyler Durden that he freed himself from the bondage of possessions. More to him being free from materialism in the film but I honestly do not want to give out too much for whoever is reading this probably has never seen the movie and I believe that the reader should go see this film. The film gave out the message of self help. In the film the narrator could not sleep. He decided to go to support groups to help himself cry so that he can sleep. He then met a woman who also faked herself in support groups and she ruined it for him. Later on not only did he get free from materialism when he met Tyler but he also found a new way to handle his problems which resulted in fighting which later became a cult following in major cities with a thing called...'Fight Club'.The film got more intense at scenes which will not be discussed. This film gets my adrenaline pumped every time I see it. It's like every time I watch it I feel like I'm getting amazed at the first viewing. This film is timeless because it was made back in 1999 and it just seems to get better with age. Fight Club is a fabulous movie. Fight Club is without a doubt one of my favorites. I can't say that a movie has affected me in the way this one did. It makes me excited, it makes me inspired and I relate to the main character in the sense of his insomnia and his personality. No movies have been made like it and I do not believe that any film ever will be. If the one reading this review has not seen it...I think that he/she should stop looking at the computer and go buy it and see what I mean.",10,1,4,10 May 2008
The Dark Knight," My new favorite movie and the best of the '00 decade
","No movie has met my to my expectations and reached the rewatchability level that THE DARK KNIGHT has done. THE DARK KNIGHT and AVATAR are two movies I can watch, back to back without getting sick of it. This is not only the best film of the decade, it's also the best movie of all time. Was that a harsh thing to say? Yes, well it's a fact. Let me explain. Note, I saw this movie 7 times in theaters and countless times on Blu Ray.1.) It's suspenseful. From the very beginning of this movie, I was sucked in, the bank heist in the beginning was by far the best opening I have ever seen for a movie. Not to mention the tension that was being build up because of the chaos that the joker made. Man was that a great interpretation of the Joker. 2.) The acting was perfect. There was not ONE bad performance. I can't think of one, yes, the obvious example was Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker. But, not many mention the performance by Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent or Christian Bale's impeccable Batman performance. Neither Val Kilmer, Michael Keaton, Adam West or George Clooney has played a performance like Bale did.3.) The editing/ Camera work. All are perfect, the editing, music and camera work just brought on the intensity of the movie. A true film lover will simply admire The Dark Knight for that. Can you tell me how it can be better? No, you cannot because it's a perfect movie.The Dark Knight is the best movie I have ever seen, that and The Matrix are neck-to-neck my favorite movies. Both are perfect film. I never call a movie flawless but, The Dark Knight, has no flaws. Now, I know the readers will not find this review useful because of how bias it was but I do not care, I wanted to say my thoughts on this film. I can't believe it took me this long to write this review.",10,1,7,15 June 2010
Inception," It's official, Nolan is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.
","Where do I begin? Hmmm, where can I describe how amazing this movie is. I really do not know how to tell the reader of this article without spoiling? Well, I am only going to ask the reader to take my word for it. Now, my reviews are not well received and dismissed as useless. I want to try to be as helpful as possible, I will make this review quick. I do not want to ramble on and on and bore the reader. I will state that I am a Christopher Nolan fan. In fact, I think he's on of the best filmmakers of all time. People told me it was too early to tell when Dark Knight came out but after viewing Inception, it proved my point. Inception is not only the best movie of the summer, the year, it's also one of the best movies ever made. It really is amazing, I can't even think of ONE flaw in it. It's really hard to describe the plot but I can throw this out there, it's very intelligent. It's a great story about dreams. It's like the Matrix with a hint of Memento. However, it's it's own movie and it's rich and original. It's also well acted. I also want to point out the obvious is the visuals. Man let me tell you, it is pretty to look at. Nolan manages to make pretty visuals without the need to use a lot of CGI. In fact, the movie hardly had any CGI it was pretty much all compositing with actual shot footage. Which in my opinion made the movie look more real. He manages to also make the movie trippy without going overboard. This is as far as I am going to tell about Inception I do not want to spoil anything. Plus, I am too tired to write a long review. I wanted to sum it up with a short review. I am sure nobody will find this article useful but meh, I just want to give out my opinion. If you like Blade Runner, Matrix and Nolan films in general, this is a great movie to check out. It will go in the history books as one of the best scifi movies. It's a must see on the IMAX, trust me on that one. Also, Nolan, he better get an Oscar. He seriously deserves one more than any filmmaker right now. He's magical and I don't think he knows how to make bad movies. He only knows epic and awesome. Thank you Christopher Nolan.",10,7,15,18 July 2010
Prometheus," A movie that'll receive mixed reactions, a movie that you'll love or hate. I loved it.4.5/5
","You will either love or hate this movie. There is no in between with it, it's goes way deep and leave a lot of ambiguity that are near impossible to answer. I think that was where I have a love/hate relationship with it, I love that it doesn't spoon feed it's audience everything but at the same time it leave questions that drive one nuts. Now there are 3 scenes that I can't give away that should of been cut out because to me they felt a tad out of place. Why am I giving it 4.5/5 after pointing out all it's flaws? Here is the simple reason why, for one, It's Ridley Scott, bias number 1. Bias number 2, the first half of the movie is literally the best science fiction I seen in a long time 3.) It's beautifully directed and loaded with great performances. and 5.) It was rather suspenseful. This being said i loved it, I think it's the next Blade Runner that movie was ambiguous as hell, it was not well received at all when it first came out, and guess what, it's considered a classic. I think Prometheus will be that movie. It's a glorious movie in it's own right. Sure I can understand why people will not like it, I definitely get it. It is not a perfect movies and needs a lot of improvement. I will confess there is a lot of scenes that seem to tie in with Alien and they really should not of done that. First off I thought it was going to take place in the same universe as Alien but not be a direct prequel. It contradicts itself in a lot of ways, I had to let the creatures in the movie grow on me. Well now I warned about the cons in it, let me point out the pros. First off, the acting from Noomi Rapace was amazing she shined in every way. She played probably my favorite Heroin in a movie. She is on my top 5 now, my top 5 being, Ellen Ripley (of course), Trinity, Princess Leia, Lispeth Salander (Both Swedish and American movie), and finally Elizabeth Shaw played by Noomi. Then there was Michael Fassbender. Of course the man can do no wrong he's golden in everything that he's in. Literally. He plays a complex character, David, who you can't really predict his next move. Even after the film I can't figure out his true motive. Now here are other pros, visually it's gorgeous, it's a feast for the eyes the whole damn thing. The whole movie was well put together, although, they needed to tone down the plot holes. Again, there are scenes i would have cut out of the movie. But all in all, I loved it, I love Ridley Scott doesn't spoon feed his audience. Overall, I loved it, but I don't recommend it to everyone. I honestly think it should be fixed in many ways it's not a perfect movie. I am going to see it again because as I pointed out, it's raises lots of questions, there were parts I didn't get. However, I know it's entirely intentional. A lot of it has to do with the inevitable sequel that will be set to come out.",10,6,10,8 June 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Epic ending to an amazing trilogy
","How I rank it, it's as good as Batman Begins (If not better) but not as amazing as The Dark Knight. However, this is the best ending to a trilogy I think I have ever witnessed in my entire life. What a wonderful movie this is, I saw it 5 times and counting. I will admit I was iffy on how i felt the first time I saw it but after more views I grew to appreciate it. While it doesn't have the perfection that the flawless Dark Knight has, it still suffices and is one of the most powerful films I think I have seen recently. It has such a great ending, very emotional.I am going to make this review short because I do not want to tell too much, it's a movie that I would never forgive myself if I provided any spoilers. First off, the movie does begin 8 years after the Dark Knight, Batman has been a fugitive and therefore missing. Bruce Wayne is beaten up and can barely walk because of all the beatings he took as Batman. He then learns of a man named Bane who is plotting to terrorize Gotham, one of the things that pushes him to put on the Batsuit again. In the film it's about him rising from his fall. I am not giving anymore details on the plot because again, I am not giving you, the reader any spoilers. I can't do it, it's simply the movie that needs to be witnessed and experienced. The movie is intense, Bane is a frightening villain, probably the scariest villain I have seen on the screen. He gave me chills throughout, he unlike, the Joker has an agenda and it's a sinister one.Anyone who has ever read the comics would catch that it's a lot like the story, 'Knightfall' and 'No Man's Land' which are two stories that must be read by the way. The movie is loaded with amazing performances, I did mention Bane, Tom Hardy who gives a great, eerie performance. Anne Hathaway is another who stood out. Many whined before seeing it that she wasn't fit for Catwoman, funny, Anne looks like Salina Kyle and acts like her too. Anyone who criticizes her is simply wrong and should probably read a comic for a change. She had that role down to a T. She was sexy and mysterious like she should be. Another great performance that stood out is Michael Caine as Alfred. He was always good, however, he had to give his all in this role it was a performance that really stuck out. These are just a few examples that I can give out.This movie is a prime example on why I hold Christopher Nolan on a pedestal. He can take a big idea and make it practical he doesn't need to go heavy on the CGI to make his films look visually amazing. He proved it many times with Inception, the flawless Dark Knight and Batman Begins. He is without question the greatest filmmaker in this new generation of filmmakers, he and Darren Aronofsky can do no wrong at this point. Nolan is the filmmaker that I hope to be one day. I hope to be able to do what he does. I have seen every Christopher Nolan movie now, he has made nothing but great movies, it's almost as if he's never seen a bad movie nor knows how to make one. All his movies have perfection all over them it's insane how good he is. He's made enough to prove himself if you ask me.I have sang too much praise for The Dark Knight Rises, I will admit the movie does have some flaws here and there, one of them is I felt they needed to develop the character Catwoman a little more and serve her more of a purpose. That's just one, there are some plot holes in it but they're mild plot holes and I will admit there were times I could not understand what the characters were saying. Bane and Jim Gordon were two that I had a difficult time making out what they were saying that needed some work. It was a problem I had with them but it did not stop me from loving the movie. I can go on and on.Christopher Nolan has made the perfect trilogy. The best I have seen since the original Star Wars trilogy. He has proved himself yet again that he is here to stay and is one of the best there is at this time, I love his Batman movies but also his other movies. I can't wait to see what else he has in line for us to watch. I look forward to seeing more works from him and I look forward to seeing The Dark Knight Rises yet again.",10,5,11,24 July 2012
Live Free or Die Hard," This is not a Die Hard movie
","Live Free or Die Hard is a disgrace to the name of Die Hard, it's one of the most unnecessary and also most uneventful action movies ever made. They literally take everything that made Die Hard good and disregarded it and made it like every other generic action movie. I loved the first and third movie, but this, I will argue and say it's the worst action movie to come around in 10 years, it's unforgivable. The movie begins with John McClane who is talking to his daughter over the phone, you get an idea that all these years of fighting John McClane is burnt out, aged and tired. He is assigned to safely escort a hacker played by Justin Long who is probably one of the most annoying characters ever. He learns there's more to the job, there are terrorists out to kill him, because he's a skilled hacker. The villain has an agenda to breach and hold America hostage. The villain by the way is lame, uninteresting, unlike the other villains in the Die Hard movies, he's forgettable and rather poorly written. Also, John McClane makes an attempt to stop the guy. He does so with the annoying hacker. He also has a taxi cab fly and hit a helicopter. You know, stuff you'd only see in a Transporter movie. I understand that Die Hard movies are loaded with impossible stuff, but this took it too far. A car hits a chopper, then John McClane drives a car into a building and then there is a scene where he is on a plane. Also, unlike the other Die Hard movies, the action was lame. Very uneventful, no intensity whatsoever. The first Did Hard movie (The best Action movie of all time) it held my interest, it was intense and suspenseful. This one, nothing, I actually daydreamed throughout the entire movie, I honestly didn't care, I wanted the movie to end. I am shocked at the rave reviews this movie got. I guess since the general public loves it, I must be wrong right? Well, I can go on and on about that topic but I choose not to.Live Free or Die Hard is terrible. Len Wiseman as a director for it really didn't contribute, I feel his style works great for music videos but not so much for movies. I'd like to see him tackle maybe a fantasy movie in the likes of Dark Crystal or maybe Legend. Something with less action, he has an interesting visual idea but this movie, his style didn't work. I also mostly blame the writers for this. Anyways, Live Free or Die Hard is terrible, I will go off and say, I give it an F.",1,3,6,24 September 2012
The Matrix," No questions about it's brilliance and it's influence on modern action films
","I can say this being a fan of this film since I was only in eleven years old, that this film just stays timeless. This film has been around since 1999 and it is now 2009 and to this day this film can still blow people's minds. THE MATRIX is a true masterpiece that will be remembered for a long, long time. This is a film that can be compared to the likes of BLADE RUNNER and STAR WARS. Here in this review, I will talk about how why I love this movie so much and how I think it has influenced action films today.First off let me talk about why I love the film. When I first saw THE MATRIX I really loved it for the action. I was too young to really understand what it was really about to know how deep and complex it really is. I watched this film a billion times with my brother on video and HBO and imitated the martial art scenes and of course the famous 'bullet dodging' scene. (May contain Mild Spoiler: Plot description) As I got older, I grew to appreciate this movie for the story. I just loved the idea behind the movie. I think I just loved the idea of a alternate world that humans lived in. The idea that the world humans live in is a virtual reality world and being slaves is simply brilliant. I wrote a research paper on this about how us being enslaved by the machine world is a reference to Plato (I learned this from the documentary Burly Man Chronicles from my DVD) I also did a ton of research on the matter. There is so much philosophical references in this film. Actually, all three films have philosophical references and of course religious themes. A lot of people can see Neo as a symbol to a lot of major prophets such as, Jesus Christ and Mohammad. Basically, I love it for how my many symbols and ideas that are put behind the film (aside from the action of course that was amazing). (More possible Minor spoilers ahead) THE MATRIX has been mimicked in a lot of ways by many different action films. Especially the bullet time. Films such as THE ONE (With Jet Li), EQUILIBRIUM (with Christian Bale) and even some Super hero films used some of the Bullet time sequences and all looked similar to THE MATRIX. THE MATRIX has put in an impact to many films today also by it's complex story line. This movie proved that audiences were all willing to think. So, in result, more intelligent action movies started to get made. Okay, not everyone has to agree with me on this but, I do really believe that.THE MATRIX is an amazing film and can be arguably considered to be the most groundbreaking film of it's genre since the original STAR WARS. I know a lot of people hated the sequels to THE MATRIX but if you ask me, I feel all three films are equally good. I did so many research papers on all three including an argumentative paper on why all three MATRIX films are equally good. I love watching THE MATRIX and will never get bored of it.",10,0,1,11 May 2009
Cloud Atlas," This won't be marked as 'Helpful' by many because it's hard for me to explain how amazing it is.
","It's beautiful, philosophical, and just brilliant. This is one of the most amazing things I have seen in theaters. Actually one of the greatest movies I have ever seen, yes the reviews are rather mixed but the ones who hated it did not understand it. At leas I don't think so, this is a love or hate movie, I loved it and I don't care. The movie was , emotional and just damn brilliant. Easily the best movie of the year.How do I talk about this movie? how? I do not know how to, it's hard to describe it. It is something you have to see for yourself. It's basically about reincarnation and how what we do with our lives, affects the future and how everything is connected. It literally goes deep into the philosophy of human nature, if philosophy is your thing look no further. The Wachowskis and Tom Tykwer all did a phenomenal job on it. The film is strange, quirky and yet beautiful, not to mention it was interesting seeing how the actors and actresses played all these multiple roles. It was also quite clever. The movie has action, romance and humor. It deals a lot about Karma, also explores on why we humans are the way we are, as I said, it goes into human nature.I don't know how to write a helpful review on this movie, I also don not know how to describe it but it's stuck in my head and I can't stop thinking about it. The Matrix is my favorite movie of all time but Cloud Atlas I think is on par with it. It might be the best movie of the year for me, but also my favorite movie of all time. I give it an A+",10,22,42,26 October 2012
Alien: Covenant," Like Prometheus? You'll enjoy this like I did. Didn't like Prometheus? Don't see it
","So, here it comes another Ridley Scott film that divides us. Like 'Prometheus', it has become an either love it or hate it. 'Prometheus' was not for everyone, it had a lot of ambiguity, it had a lot of questions that didn't seem to be answered. This movie, did answer some questions that were raised in 'Prometheus' but it also left open for even more. The films are intelligent, no question, they are also pretty philosophical.'Alien Covenant' does a few things I really like. First off, they brought back the horror element to the franchise. That was missing for too long. While yes, 'Aliens' was fun, also the largest in scale. It is arguably the best in the franchise, though I prefer the original. Yes, not a popular opinion, but I do. This one has a lot of the feel of the original. It is suspenseful, very atmospheric. I also want to say the music score was chilling, probably my favorite part of the movie.I would dive into the story line, but we all know it. A crew hears a signal, they go find out where it comes from and end up in a deserted planet. It has a very very similar story to the original. It almost felt like a throwback. That can annoy some movie goers hoping for something new, but I personally appreciated it.'Alien Covenant' has a rather large ensemble cast. However, the big complaint I have is none of them really stood out, except Michael Fassbender as Walter and David. Yes, he plays two characters. He gives a fantastic performance. We get to know David from 'Prometheus' a lot more. We grow a larger understanding of his motives. One of the best parts of 'Prometheus' was the character David. We never fully understood what he was all about. Well, you certainly will in this one. I refuse to tell what that is.'Alien Covenant' is a movie that had me think a lot. I saw a ton of movies this year and I enjoyed most, but I never felt compelled to write my thoughts about it the way I did this. I think it's because this is such a divisive movie. I will fully understand why people will not like it, but I personally did. Worth seeing, be prepared to have a long discussion with your friends.I rate it an 'A'",9,29,55,19 May 2017
