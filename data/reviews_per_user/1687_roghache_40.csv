Saturday Night Fever," Incredible disco music but plot neither gripping nor inspiring
","For me, this entire movie IS the music. I love the BeeGees songs, which of course became famously popular and almost defined the disco and bell bottomed era. Also, I think John Travolta gives a great performance, incredible dancing sequences, in the role of Tony Manero. When I picture Travolta, like most others I'll wager, the image that comes to mind is the white suited Tony strutting away on the disco floor to the BeeGees hits. His main purpose in the movie, apart from dancing, is of course to appear sexy.The film is short on plot. I haven't seen the movie for a number of years, but all I can recall is that Tony is an uneducated Brooklyn teenager whose life revolves around his Saturday nights at the disco and his attempts to win a dance competition. Apparently (from others' comments), there are girls involved...one, Annette, that he rejects as being too plain so not good enough for him, and another, his pretty dance partner, Stephanie who, aspiring to better things herself, rejects HIM (good for her). Any details didn't make enough of an impression to remain with me for long. The film does memorably capture, however, Tony's poor employment opportunities due to his lack of education and of course the fact that his entire self esteem unfortunately revolves around his coolness, particularly relative to his admittedly legendary disco dancing skills. Let it be a message for young viewers to stay in school.How refreshing that another reviewer (you are not alone!) has denounced the poor sexual messages conveyed here. Other than dance, this movie is pretty much all about sex, isn't it? This other commentator noted that Tony's brother leaves the priesthood because he can't deal with the celibacy. Hardly surprising that this attitude is the one presented, is it? Also Tony's friend gets a girl pregnant but is unable to deal with the responsibility (hopefully a good warning to young male viewers). Yes, plenty of sex, though mainly talking about it.Watch the movie for the great music...it'll 'make you feel like dancing', but don't expect a gripping plot or encourage your kids to get their moral attitudes from it. Better still, just buy the BeeGees CD and don't bother with the movie at all. You won't miss much.",5,7,12,14 March 2006
The Sound of Music," Magnificent family musical set in Salzburg
","This musical exemplifies the meaning of the phrases ' timeless classic' and 'heartwarming family movie'. Although really sugary syrupy sweet, it never loses its appeal. Not normally a fan of musicals, I confess to preferring the two other famous ones of that era, My Fair Lady and Fiddler on the Roof. Yet, I still can't resist this old favorite every time it chances to be on TV.Of course it tells the story of the young postulant, Maria, who is sent as governess to the grand Salzburg manor of Captain Von Trappe, a retired Austrian naval officer with seven unruly children. Maria comes to care deeply for these motherless children and also their rigid, authoritarian father. Conflict arises as Maria has of course planned to take vows as a nun and the Captain is engaged to the Baroness, a lady of some sophistication. Both leading stars are brilliant in their roles, Julie Andrews as the outspoken young nun, and Christopher Plummer as the dashing Captain.This movie has it all...an engaging plot, touching love story, appealing children, political turmoil brewing, breathtaking mountain / lake scenery (Austrian Alps) splendidly photographed, and of course unforgettable music. My personal favorites are the inspiring 'Climb Every Mountain' and of course the touching 'Eidelweiss'.In terms of love stories, there are actually two of course. The more mature Captain and Maria declare their love ultra romantically (and musically) in a moonlit gazebo. Julie Andrews looks absolutely radiant in this scene. Also, there is the youthful romance between the Captain's oldest daughter, Liesl (who's '16 going on 17') and her young postman ('17 going on 18'). This classic prevails partly, in my opinion, because of the integrity of its leading characters. Maria strives to do God's will, even if it should mean turning away from the man she loves in order to pursue her convent vocation. Incidentally, I was impressed by the portrayal of the nuns in this movie (especially the Mother Superior) as kind, serene servants of God (and not without humor), unlike the trend in modern movies to generally denigrate the clergy or those related thereto. As for Captain Von Trappe, he is loyal to the spirit of his beloved Austria, denouncing the Nazi occupation even at great personal expense. The film leads one to contemplate the reaction to the Anschluss many Austrians of that day must have had, if only in their hearts.I was thrilled in 1975 for an opportunity to visit Salzburg myself, a beautiful and charming city, and to see in person many of the scenes, churches, fountain etc. used in the filming of this movie. The Sound of Music is definitely an immortal classic, especially one you won't want your children to miss.",9,2,9,12 March 2006
Ghost," Cute, funny, romantic fantasy thriller...but some disclaimers
","When I saw this movie some years ago, I confess that I found it cute, funny, and romantic. However, I've matured a bit and now find that despite its love tale, suspense, and humor, I have several difficulties with it. First of all, I can accept ghosts as pure fantasy (as in A Christmas Carol), but the villains being dragged off after death to a presumably unpleasant place is neither amusing nor trivial, not something you should joke about.The ridiculous plot is entertaining. The story revolves around an unmarried young couple, an investment banker Sam and a ceramic artist Molly, who have just begun living together. However, Sam is suddenly murdered one night by a 'thief' in an alley while walking home from the theatre with Molly. The dead Sam discovers that he is trapped as a ghost (it's a fantasy, remember?) and must warn Molly that she, too, is in danger from his murderers. He is unable to communicate with her, so enlists the assistance of a reluctant phony psychic named Oda Mae, who realizes she can hear (though not see) Sam.Major sex symbols play the leads. Patrick Swayze is cast in the role of Sam, who in the afterlife must bring about justice for his murder as well as warn his beautiful, endangered lover. Molly is played by Demi Moore, an actress definitely not my favourite, though I admit she is suitably sensuous in this role. The best performance is definitely given by Whoopi Goldberg, who won a Supporting Actress Oscar for playing Oda Mae. The psychic's role is kind of a crazy one, but Whoopi pulls it off brilliantly.*** WARNING: SPOILER AHEAD *** This popular flick has of course a legendary, super romantic, tearjerker of an ending that requires a whole box of Kleenex. That final scene where (the late) Sam is able to physically interact with Molly for one last final farewell, and comes up behind, touching her as she's molding the clay, all to the unforgettable, haunting (no pun intended) strains of Unchained Melody...you'll picture this scene forever after every time you hear this song.All terribly touching, except I hate to put a damper, but I have to agree with a comment I noticed on the Message Board. Pity Sam and Molly weren't married to start here. They weren't apparently committed enough before living together to take vows pledging enduring love and fidelity through all circumstances, so what is so wildly romantic now about this farewell scene? Yes, they were engaged apparently, but I had to kind of laugh at one reviewer's comment about them moving in together and beginning 'premarital LIFE', a euphemism surely for the real meaning, premarital SEX. Anyway, I lapped that farewell scene right up myself along with everyone else way back when, but I kind of question now whether it wouldn't have all been just a little more meaningful if this same cute fantasy had featured instead of the engaged live ins, an endearing pair of young newlyweds.It's a fun, touching movie, but there ARE many more meaningful and genuinely moving love stories out there in the cinematic world. Remember this is a FANTASY, and don't get either your morals or your theology from it.",5,1,9,16 March 2006
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Sci fi fairy tale with everyone's favorite alien
","This is a wonderful fun, heartwarming fairy tale of a story for both kids and adults. In terms of a cute science fiction story, no one has ever been able to touch Stephen Spielberg's classic.The fairy tale begins when some alien botanists visiting earth for samples inadvertently leave behind one of their own on this strange, bewildering new planet. The adorable little alien critter is discovered by a 10 year old boy named Elliot, who finds him foraging for food in their garden shed. The friendly alien (ET, as he comes to be called, for Extra Terrestrial) comes to stay in the boy's home. Elliot, his older brother, Michael, and younger sister, Gertie, sort of take him under their wing. But as they learn to communicate, they discover that ET is lonesome. He wants to go home, and to that end, concocts some type of device he thinks might help get him there. However, if he succeeds, Elliot (whose own parents are going through a divorce) will lose his new friend.It's all too cute, especially the little alien guffer himself. Basically, he kind of represents every homesick kid (or adult) who ever lived. Despite his newfound human friends, he just misses his own home world and fellow critters. Memorable scenes for me are of course the legendary ones...ET hiding among the stuffed animals and assorted junk in a closet so Elliot's mom won't spot him, Halloween trick or treating, and the famed flying bicycle scene. And of course the ongoing 'ET go home'.Great acting by everyone, especially the three kids. ET is simply a fabulous movie with some fancy modern effects and a space age theme, but mainly a story about the bonds of friendship revolving around a touching little guy that needs love and help from his new earthling buddy. It makes you laugh, it makes you cry...just like any truly good movie should. This is one that perennially appeals to the kid in all of us.",9,3,5,24 March 2006
Casablanca," Romantic wartime classic, but not my favorite
","Yes, it is classy and a classic but personally, though I adore World War II movies, Casablanca is simply not my favorite. I love both the stars, the unique and immortal Humphrey Bogart, also the perennially wonderful and sympathetic Ingrid Bergman. And they have tremendous chemistry together here. That's the problem, there's just not enough of the love story and too much indecipherable wartime intrigue that I could never really quite fathom.The plot revolves around a cynical, enigmatic American expatriate, Rick Blaine (Bogart) who runs a nightclub in Nazi occupied Casablanca. An old love, Ilsa (Bergman) arrives there with her husband, Victor Laszlo (leader of the European Resistance). Rick holds some bitterness toward Ilsa as she ran out on him years earlier in Paris. Meanwhile, there is assorted intrigue regarding some vital letters of transit that Rick has in his possession. He has the chance to turn his love's husband, Laszlo, over to the SS and be free to leave Casablanca with Ilsa. The question is...will he?As I mentioned, the intrigue befuddled (and bored) me. For me, this old black and white wartime classic is all about three things, the amazing song 'As Time Goes By', the memorable and famous closing scene (which I won't give away) and the following...Much of the interaction between the characters occurs at Rick's nightclub, the Cafe Americain (the setting around which the film sort of revolves). There is one unforgettable scene there in which some drunken Nazi soldiers are singing the German national anthem. Resistance leader Laszlo orders the playing of the forbidden Marseillaise, the band starts up (with Rick's permission), Laszlo bursts into the French anthem, and the other club patrons gradually chime in, drowning out the Germans. It's fabulous! You can't help but cheer.It's a famous old classic which I really should watch again. Maybe now that I'm older (and smarter?), I can ferret out all that intrigue!",7,1,6,17 March 2006
Shakespeare in Love," Absurd untruths, the poor Bard may be spinning in his grave
","First, I'll admit to not being a fan of sheer fictional tales about famous historical figures, who aren't around to defend themselves. Poor Shakespeare may well be spinning in his grave. True, there's free speech, but just because he's the foremost bard of the English language does not give Hollywood the moral right to fabricate whatever drivel desired in order to entertain an audience and make a buck. Were the literary historians not outraged at the time? They should have been. It's difficult to believe this absurdity won an Academy Award for Best Picture.This film concocts a purely fictional story wherein Shakespeare experiences writer's block while working on his new play 'Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter'. Meanwhile, the wealthy Viola, who's a fan of Shakespeare's plays and is engaged to marry the (quite predictably cold hearted) Lord Wessex, has always dreamed of becoming an actress herself. As acting is unacceptable in that era for a woman, she disguises herself as a boy to audition for the part of Romeo on stage. Thus begins a romance between the Bard and Viola, who is his inspiration for the immortal play we now know as Romeo and Juliet.First of all, it's not exactly an original concept, the poor oppressed woman who's downtrodden because of her gender and not free to assume her desired profession, in this case acting. Rather an overworked theme. (I'm a woman, by the way). Gwyneth Paltrow is a lovely young actress, so it's nothing personal. Also, there are wonderful Oscar winning costumes. Really, however, this movie is basically a bedroom frolic about Will. I notice a few are claiming that a more appropriate title might be Shakespeare in Lust. It really isn't right to concoct these fictitious tales, and for those who found it amusing & romantic...well, your entertainment was at the expense of an actual human being nearly four centuries deceased. He may or may not have appreciated it, but is not around to express his views. For those who claim that Shakespeare would be proud, I question these supernatural powers of discerning the attitudes of the long deceased. Instead of wasting time on this foolish movie, it might be better spent reading or viewing one of Shakespeare's plays on stage, or watching Franco Zeffirelli's beautiful 1968 film adaptation of Romeo and Juliet.My son (now a college freshman) was shown this silly Shakespeare in Love during an enriched high school English class a couple of years ago. He could never quite fathom what possible educational purpose this nonsense was intended to serve. Perhaps, as one reviewer suggested, the purpose of this film was to inform the modern world that Shakespeare had sex. Or if it's intended as an irreverent view of Elizabethan England, as some claim, we could well have managed without.My favourite of all the comments read is that this movie has nothing whatsoever to do with Shakespeare other than to steal his good name. And sorry, I guess I'm just not one of those who can get much of a laugh out of the title 'Romeo and Ethel the Pirates's Daughter'. I find it quite a pathetic and juvenile attempt at humour, most definitely not Oscar caliber.",3,14,28,10 April 2006
12 Angry Men," THE classic jury drama, compelling but not without flaws
","This is surely the most famous film jury drama, quite riveting in its dialogue, its claustrophobic jury deliberation room setting, its brilliantly depicted characters, its atmosphere of oppressive heat and tension between these jurors. The twelve angry men are admittedly largely one dimensional stereotypes but they are brought vividly to life by a star studded cast including Henry Fonda, E.G. Marshall, Leo J. Cobb, and Jack Klugman.The jurors include an arrogant stockbroker, a stressed out man from a poor social background, a wise and endearing old gentleman, a quiet and respectful immigrant, an extreme bigot, a loud and pushy businessman with son issues, an advertising executive who sees everything in terms of sales, and a sports fan interested only in getting out in time to see his ballgame. The jury foreman tries to keep the group organized but isn't a particularly bright or thoughtful man himself and seems in over his depth. The (supposed at least) hero of the piece is the intelligent juror number 8, an architect, who appears to take his responsibilities seriously. He encourages full discussion of the evidence when others seem happy to return an immediate Guilty verdict for a young Hispanic defendant accused of fatally stabbing his abusive father. As a result of this juror's persuasive powers, the vote changes from 11-1 for Guilty to a unanimous final Not Guilty verdict.No one would be interested in watching a movie about twelve calm jurors politely and rationally debating the evidence. Thus we have this drama which makes for compelling viewing but isn't for those preferring some degree of subtlety. The case itself is ultra dramatic 'all or nothing', acquittal or the death penalty with no possibility of life imprisonment. Juror 8 has illegally purchased a duplicate knife to the murder weapon and slams it dramatically on the table. These jurors are constantly bickering. One juror threatens to kill another. Eventually the other jurors all turn their backs one by one on the bigot. Surely this must be a textbook example of everything a jury should NOT be! While real life jurors do bring their prejudices and life experiences into the jury room, some of these jurors were simply too unbelievable. For example, 'the bigot' seemed to flaunt his bigotry at every turn rather than, as would be much more realistic, making some effort to conceal it. I believe one would need to look far and wide to find a juror with so little regard for human life that he would happily send a possibly innocent kid off to the electric chair rather than miss his ballgame.As for juror number 8, at first I admired his sense of responsibility and calm, reasoned questioning. However, by the end of the movie, after he had raised doubts (whether reasonable or not is up to individual interpretation) about every single piece of evidence and testimony, I no longer saw him as the heroic champion of justice we're manipulated into believing, but almost felt as though he had some agenda of his own to acquit and would never convict anyone of any crime, whatever the evidence! This jury didn't rationally debate the case at all but as juror 8 would raise some 'doubt', one or other juror would suddenly change his vote, ignoring all the other evidence. A good case could be made that this jury let a murderer go free because they lost sight of the cumulative nature of the evidence as a whole.While this movie is often classed as a character study, a psychological drama, or a study in small group dynamics, it's also considered a commentary on the American jury system. As such, I feel that the writers should have 'done their homework' and had these jurors follow standard jury instructions rather than the gross jury misconduct they displayed -- juror 8 doing his own independent research by purchasing that knife, their questionable little experiment with the old man's rate of walking, their improper acceptance of one of their number as a switchblade 'expert' and taking his opinion of stabbing techniques as gospel. If all this had become known to court officials in real life, this grievous misconduct would almost certainly have resulted in a mistrial.I also felt the movie quite manipulative in casting a defendant who could hardly be more sympathetic, a young kid with poor social opportunities, the victim of bigotry and paternal abuse. What viewer would ever want this boy to receive the death penalty? This film would have packed a greater punch for me if the defendant had been a rather despicable character (or at least neutral in terms of sympathy factor), yet the jury been able to acquit him anyway due to finding reasonable doubt.Therefore, while this film is a 'must see' classic, a thoroughly engaging way to spend an hour and a half, and a masterpiece by comparison with most modern movies, I don't consider it flawless. At least in my case, it hasn't held up well during subsequent viewings and further scrutiny. Entertaining, yes, but I have a big problem with its clearly intended message that this jury, which I see as a lynch mob-turned-group of pushovers, has ultimately served the cause of justice.",8,7,9,24 April 2009
Dead Poets Society," A masterful tribute to teaching at its best
","Dead Poets Society is, to use a cliché, a cinematic masterpiece. I can watch it over and over, absorbing more nuances of meaning every time. As a former teacher myself (albeit of science), I view it as a tribute to the profession at its best...teaching not merely the subject but also the person, and having a lifelong impact on students' lives.The setting is Weldon Academy, a very traditional New England boys' prep school in 1959. If I can find one flaw with the movie...and there certainly aren't many...it's the underlying premise that seems to worship free thought and implies that ALL tradition is of necessity undesirable and thus to be avoided. Frankly, compared to modern classrooms which are bastions of free expression, I found the Weldon students' respectful treatment of their teachers rather refreshing. (But perhaps that's just the ex-teacher in me coming out!) Some of Weldon's ideals, generally referred to in mocking tones, are actually qualities to which parents rightfully DO hope their offspring will aspire.Robin Williams plays Mr. Keating, the English teacher we all wish we'd had. He brings warmth, passion, and an endearing quiet humor to the role as he fosters individualism in a school environment of total conformity, endeavoring to teach these young men both the beauty of the English language and the importance of living life to the full, of 'seizing the day'. How many of us mentally revolted at the dissection of poetry when we were in school? Many a viewer will both chortle and rejoice when Mr. Keating has his class rip out the methodical, emotionless 'Introduction to Poetry' from the time honored Pritchard textbook! The 'Dead Poets Society', and the boys on which Mr. Keating has such a profound impact, include an interesting mix of characters...Neil Perry (the passionate young man at odds with his father's clearly defined expectations for his son's life), Todd Anderson (the classic shy adolescent, through whose eyes we view the unfolding drama), Charlie Dalton (the quintessential rebel), Knox Overstreet (the teen with whom most viewers can identify, deep in the throes of first love), and Richard Cameron (the mindless conformist).Ethan Hawke gives a moving performance as Todd, the younger brother of a former Weldon valedictorian and my personal favorite, who undergoes a character transformation as the plot unfolds. In a sense, this movie is really Todd's story. As another reviewer has wisely pointed out, his best scenes are sometimes when he has no dialogue at all. Your heart will ache for him. The sub-plot of young Overstreet's romance with a girl from a nearby school may not be brilliant, but it provides some light, entertaining relief from the main drama. Needless to say, Mr. Keating's unorthodox approach meets with obstacles...from his fellow teachers, from the school's ultra traditional Headmaster, from Neil's overbearing father and the other parents, who are depicted as a conservative, status conscious lot. His encouragement of adolescent individualism leads to dramatic consequences for one student in particular, triggering a dramatic scenario that engulfs most of his classmates. I don't want to give the plot away, but Dead Poets Society has the most powerful ending I've experienced in the cinematic world. I could watch it over and over, and tears would either come to my eyes or virtually stream down my cheeks every time.It's an intelligent film, both gripping to watch and thought provoking afterward. Engaging plot, memorable characters, meaningful theme, wonderfully done scenes and atmosphere...Dead Poets Society has it all. A special tip of my hat to the cinematography; clearly, it should have won an Oscar for the final scene alone.This is a must-see movie, especially if you're a high school student who hates English. It might just change your view of the subject, even if your actual teacher doesn't quite measure up to Mr. Keating. And for everyone...not only 'Carpe Diem', but a certain phrase from a Walt Whitman poem will take on incredible meaning and be remembered forever.",10,150,178,3 March 2006
Forrest Gump," Beautiful tale of pure hearted innocence, a man definitely NOT stupid
","This is the warmly amusing, thought provoking tale of Forrest Gump, a man who despite low intelligence, manages to lead a fulfilled and productive life...even gaining fame on many fronts.Forrest himself reveals his story in flashback to a series of assorted passengers waiting at a bus stop bench. As a child growing up in rural Alabama, he suffers from polio and must wear leg braces, in addition to coping with ridicule from other school kids because of his diminished mental capacity. Forrest discovers that he can run like the wind, leading to a football scholarship and college diploma. Then he joins the military and serves in Vietnam, where he saves the life of his commander, Lieutenant Dan, but sees his best friend, Bubba, die in his arms. Later he becomes a ping pong champion, attending competition in Communist China. After being discharged from the army, Forrest sets up a shrimp boat company, Bubba Gump, as he & pal Bubba had planned, becoming a millionaire. Eventually he decides that he 'feels like running', so spends about three years crossing the country! Not a dull life for someone with an IQ of around 75.Interspersed with Forrest's personal tale are assorted historical people and events from the late 1950's to 1970's. Forrest just happens to find himself a central personage in various movements (KKK, Civil Rights, and war protest), exposes Watergate, and inadvertently invents the Smiley Face. He meets Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon (who bestow his Medal of Honour and such), teaches Elvis to dance, and inspires John Lennon's song Imagine..all the while blissfully unaware. Of course it's all nonsense (great special effects!), but these exaggerated absurdities point out how the Forrests of this world do contribute to society and that unsung heroes may lie behind famous celebrities.Throughout his life, Forrest loves a girl named Jenny, who befriends him during childhood and defends him against his taunting schoolmates. For years they are childhood playmates 'like peas & carrots', and Forrest imparts a feeling of safe refuge to Jenny, who has her own trials dealing with her father's sexual abuse. Forrest's ongoing love for Jenny is a constantly touching theme, even as she experiences a turbulent young adulthood filled with sex and drugs, becomes a stripper and later hippie, is involved with the Black Panters, and eventually suicidal. Forrest does everything for Jenny and always seeks to protect her, although for years she rejects his love and instead prefers abusive men, a result of her childhood experiences. The story's end is beautiful but heart wrenching. Forrest & Jenny's lovemaking produces a little son, who remains unknown to his dad throughout his early years. By now Jenny has come to grips with her personal demons, welcomes Forrest's unconditional love, and finally agrees to marriage. Alas, she has also been diagnosed with a terminal illness (possibly AIDS). Forrest & Jenny have a lovely wedding, but shortly thereafter she dies and leaves their son, little Forrest, in the care of his father. The scene where Jenny tells Forrest about his son is surely the film's most moving, as Forrest is flabbergasted with joy that he's the father of this beautiful boy but is also tearfully concerned as to whether he's smart or like his dad. Jenny assures him that little Forrest is a very intelligent child. Only the coldest heart would remain unmoved by this scene, the later one at Jenny's grave, or any of those showing little Forrest with his doting dad.The character of Lieutenant Dan is masterfully done, as initially Gump's Commanding Officer resents Forrest for having saved his life, forcing his adjustment to living without his legs. Later Lieutanant Dan joins Forrest's shrimp boat operation and the pair become friends. It is probably thanks to Forrest that Dan comes to peace with God, following his Vietnam experiences. Forrest's 'best good friend', Bubba, is also well captured, a rather slow underdog type who's shrimp obsessed.Tom Hanks gives a brilliant Oscar winning portrayal of the rather slow witted but pure hearted Forrest. Sally Field is also wonderful as his practical and doting mother, who convinces Forrest that he can make whatever he wants of his life and shouldn't feel inferior to anyone. Early in the film, Mrs. Gump ensures her son's enrollment in a regular school by sleeping with the principal!From an early age, Mrs. Gump informs her son that 'Stupid is as stupid does'...the film's ongoing theme. Forrest is aware of his limited intelligence but deals cheerfully and matter of factly with it, experiencing no resentment over his situation or bitterness toward those who put him down. He is the very model of innocence, the essence of the pure in heart. Unlike the intelligent folk in the movie, Forrest does NOT behave stupidly, but with kindness, generosity, loyalty, and honour, always keeping his promises. It's a film that definitely makes the viewer question...exactly who are the stupid ones in this story? Certainly Jenny, with her unwise lifestyle choices. But frankly, in all the ways that count, NOT Forrest. Only in the scene where Forrest so touchingly questions Jenny about his son's intelligence do we grasp how much Forrest has suffered, wanting his son spared any ridicule for being slow but instead able to lead a 'normal' life with all the best opportunities.This is a beautiful story, with surely one of the most endearing heroes in cinematic history. Hopefully, it will inspire everyone to treat those having mental limitations with the dignity and respect they deserve. The picture of young Forrest running to escape pursuit by those bicycling bullies is a vivid reminder of the cruel taunts the mentally challenged sometimes suffer even in this supposedly enlightened era. Forrest understands everything truly important in life...family, friendship, love, country, and faith in God. It is a tale of great morality and great simplicity. Especially with regard to loyalty, we all have a lot to learn from Forrest Gump.",10,1,3,30 April 2006
Notting Hill," Sparkling fairy tale romance, film star meets ordinary bookseller
","Whether or not realistic, this is a wonderfully touching fairy tale like story of the romance between two people of unequal social and financial standing. The beautiful, rich, and famous American movie star is superbly captured by the incomparable and always endearing Julia Roberts, who brings such a wonderful vulnerability to her roles. Hugh Grant is perfect as the shy, stammering, bumbling, unassuming, obscure, and not very affluent London bookseller, who shares a flat with his zany, weird roommate, Spike.The tale revolves around the world's most famous actress, Anna Scott, who visits a Notting Hill travel bookshop and thereby meets the very ordinary British bookseller, William Thacker. Improbable as it might seem, the two fall in love despite the fact that Anna already has a 'significant other' in the form of the obnoxious star, Jeff, who treats her poorly. Alas, Anna and William's romance is of course subject to hounding by the ubiquitous media, making the course of true love definitely not run smooth.Just an aside, but did the screenwriters get Hugh Grant's character's name from the Victorian novelist, William Makepeace Thackeray? It seems quite a coincidence. Ha, ha. Anyway, nice name...The film does a marvelous job conveying what must resemble Julia Roberts' own fishbowl life, subject to constant media scrutiny and innuendo. She must have identified strongly with the character she was playing, not only the media nuisance but also the failed relationships so common among film stars. Her hounding by the paparazzi is also of course reminiscent of that plaguing the late Princess Diana, and of course, sadly, resulting in her death.The portrayal of William's friends is very touching here, as their reaction transforms from understandable awe at socializing with such a famous star, to accepting and treating Anna as basically an ordinary person and good friend. The viewer gets a sense of how much this response, this genuine friendship means to Anna. One of William's friends is a disabled wife in a wheelchair. Her normal, ordinary life and attitude are well captured and would be well received, I believe, by viewers with physical disabilities.The love story is beautifully depicted. The sadness of Anna's failed past romantic involvements is conveyed, and despite the fame, her vulnerability as being really just 'an ordinary girl in love with an ordinary boy'. The portrayal of William is touching, as he copes with all the media attention, sees the actual person behind all that fame, wealth, and glamour, and tries to give Anna the genuine security and the 'ordinary life' she so desperately craves. A fabulous, moving, and ultra romantic film with a relevant message regarding modern society's perception and treatment of its movie stars. We can all learn a lesson here.",8,16,17,16 March 2006
The Killing Fields," Unforgettable personal depiction of 1970's Cambodian horrors
","It is quite some time since I saw this film, and war movies are not normally my genre of choice. However, I left the theatre deeply moved by the personal story involved and also better informed of the atrocities in Cambodia under Pol Pot during the 1970's, an aspect of modern history of which I was woefully ignorant. As modern movies have brought to the masses the cruelty of the Holocaust, this film emotionally conveys what I suspect is the much lesser known suffering of the Cambodian people, with two million civilian deaths resulting from this civil war. The film tells the dramatic story of an American journalist, Sydney Shanberg who is covering the civil war in Cambodia along with native interpreter, Dith Pran. Pran saves Shanberg and the other journalists, but must then protect himself from the outrages of the Khmer Rouge. He manages to escape to Thailand and is finally reunited with Shanberg, who has been anxiously searching for him.The scene that has stayed with me through the years is the dramatic ending, where Shanberg and Pran are reunited. It is their touching friendship that has formed the basis of this movie, and Shanberg has been so desperate to locate his friend. Tears come to my eyes even now as I recall them embracing with such joy at being safely reunited. It seemed as though the tall Shanberg virtually picked up the much shorter, totally endearing Pran, who had suffered so much during the time they were separated. Ever since this movie, I have been a great fan of Sam Waterston, who competently portrays the journalist Shanberg.Although I was so caught up in the moment I didn't object at the time, I do in retrospect have a few difficulties with the background music chosen for this scene. John Lennon's 'Imagine' has a beautiful tune and though all people of good will desire peace, I oppose its clearly anti-religion lyrics.Dith Pran was portrayed by first-time actor, Haing S. Knor, a Cambodian gynecologist who had lost his own family due to the Khmer Rouge. This added an extra poignancy in conveying how much his character, Pran, suffered. Sadly, I recently read that Knor, who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar, was killed senselessly a few years after this movie by a street gang for no reason whatsoever.This is an unforgettable film, troubling but also both extremely enlightening and moving. It dramatically unfolds this compelling friendship bond while bringing to the forefront the Cambodian horror story, from the perspective of one very appealing Cambodian.",9,2,3,18 March 2006
Grease," Popular 50's teenage musical sends the wrong messages
","This is one of a number of movies I saw back when they were first released, misguidedly enjoyed at the time, and now find I have major issues with. I suppose it's a mildly entertaining movie of generally brainless drivel (50's greaser stereotype rebellion), with a few catchy tunes. If it was merely that, okay, but this film gives its viewers (especially teenage ones) ALL the worst possible messages.The plot revolves around 'young love' (?) as experienced by the pretty, innocent young Australian girl, Sandy (Olivia Newton-John) who has a summer romance with Danny (John Travolta). In the fall she discovers that they attend the same school, Rydell High, and that Danny is the leader of a greaser gang called the T birds. Their different attitudes naturally bring conflict into their (immature) relationship. Sandy finally becomes convinced that she must turn herself into a tart in order to keep her man, and proceeds to do precisely that.First, a few compliments to the movie. I'm a big fan of Olivia Newton-John and her (earlier) music, think she's lovely in this picture and a lovely lady still. Also, John Travolta is a guy with charisma galore; I loved him in Saturday Night Fever. In terms of the music, my favorite piece is 'Hopelessly Devoted to You', a beautiful romantic song that deserved its Oscar. (Too bad Sandy feels pressured to have sex with the guy she's 'hopelessly devoted' to.) But that's just about where my compliments end, and my rating of 4 is mainly from a sense of nostalgia. Wrong messages, where to begin? First of all, Danny is the leader of a gang, whose purpose is rebellion (as though teenagers needed any encouragement there, Ha, ha) Well, the gang isn't really violent, you say? Maybe not, but even the Pink Ladies, its female counterpart, is at best quite an established clique. Teenagers have enough trouble dealing with peer pressure both then and today. Did they really need a film encouraging them to alter their persona to fit in with the crowd?Sandy begins smoking in order to feel accepted by the Pink Ladies and especially Danny. Way to go, Sandy. I don't even need to start mentioning all the negative aspects here.But worst, absolute worst...the very obvious message to all teenage girls watching, that virginity is just plain unacceptable...you can't possibly expect to keep your man unless you dress provocatively and presumably deliver the goods as well. You know what, Sandy, you were fine just the way you were at the start...young, sweet, and innocent. If Danny doesn't like you that way, tough; let him look elsewhere. YOU keep your self respect, girl, and find some other guy who WILL appreciate you as you are and not expect anything from you you're not prepared to give.Enough lecturing, except to conclude...Yes, Grease is the word all right, if you want to send a teenager all the wrong messages, that is.",4,51,96,12 March 2006
Cast Away," Touching island survival tale with a disappointing ending
","This is a rather unusual take on the Robinson Crusoe deserted island survival tale. I agree with another reviewer who noted that it's the only movie where you get all emotionally attached to a volleyball. In fact, I was so attached that I cried over that foolish volleyball. Yes, I cried. For me, this film is all about Wilson!The movie chronicles the survival tale of a workaholic Fedex systems engineer, Chuck Noland, whose plane to Malaysia crashes during a storm, stranding him alone on a tropical island with little prospect of rescue. He stays alive for four years by catching fish, copes with dental problems in a primitive manner, and keeps his spirits up by looking at a picture of his fiancé, Kelly, who's back home with no news of him. Finally, he builds a raft and sails off, hoping for a return to civilization.During his isolation on the island, the loneliness of having no human contact forces him to come up with some sort of companion he can communicate with. This turns out to be a Wilson brand volleyball that he names...yes, Wilson. Wilson is really the co star of the movie and the recipient of Chuck's conversation. This dramatically illustrates one of the movie's main themes...just how unconsciously dependent we all are on companionship, even those of us who are not particularly outgoing. None of us realizes the devastating psychological effects of extended and complete isolation. The film shows Chuck's various struggles on the island for food, water, and shelter. In fact, the island segment is the most interesting part, as far as I'm concerned, the earlier portion showing his relationship with Kelly (Helen Hunt) not particularly gripping. The earlier scenes serve mainly to outline his workaholic lifestyle, ever dependent on the clock.I didn't object to the jump from his ship rescue to four weeks later, when he's reintegrated into society. However, I was disappointed with the movie's ending. I didn't mind that his fiancé, Kelly, has moved on with her life, married, and has a child (all as you might predict, given the circumstances of his presumed death). However, I found the whole crossroads scene at the conclusion ambiguous and unsatisfying, and felt I wanted a bit more information as to Chuck's fate, even if it didn't involve a love interest.Other than that, a gripping survival story and touching tale. But I'll warn you, if you get too attached to Wilson, you'd better have your Kleenex ready...",8,0,0,25 March 2006
Doctor Zhivago," Sweeping and romantic epic saga of the Russian Revolution
","This is one of the most hauntingly beautiful, timeless epic romances of all time, set against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution. Stunning cinematography combines here with a turbulent historical setting, an unforgettable idealistic hero, and one of the most compelling fictional love triangles of all time. This surely ranks among the best of director David Lean's many masterpieces. It is based on Boris Pasternak's novel, which I confess to not having read so cannot comment on the faithfulness of the film.The story revolves around the dreamy physician and poet, Yuri Zhivago, and his dramatic experiences during the tumult of the Russian Revolution. The story is told in flashback mode during later Communist years by Yuri's half brother, Yevgraf, a Soviet Army officer, to the young woman, Tanya, who may be the long lost daughter of Yuri and his lover, Lara. As a sensitive young boy, Yuri's mother dies and he is adopted by a foster family, the Gromekos. Later reaching adulthood, he studies medicine and marries his childhood sweetheart, Tonya, and they have a little boy, Sasha. However, earlier at their engagement party, he has found himself strangely drawn to a beautiful & mysterious woman named Lara. Soon all their personal lives are thrown into turmoil by World War I and the Bolshevik Revolution.The handsome Omar Sharif is brilliantly empathetic in the role of Zhivago, masterfully conveying his character's emotions. Who can forget his intensely expressive, tear filled eyes at some of the more emotional moments, especially with snowflakes melting on them? A physician but also a poet, Yuri has a deep appreciation of the beauty around him. His gentleness and idealism stand in sharp contrast to the horrific violence of war and revolution, as Yuri witnesses such atrocities as dismemberment and cannibalism. Also, this is a man who remains very much an individual despite the Bolshevik's philosophies of collectivism.That era's devastating events unfold, including the Bolshevik Revolution and subsequent Civil War between the Tsarist Whites & the Communist Reds. However, the main conflict here is internal within Yuri's own heart, as he is torn between fidelity and passion. He deeply loves his sweet, gentle, and dependable wife, Tonya, and struggles to remain faithful. Yet he is tempted by a forbidden passion for the alluring Lara, a nurse at the wartime army hospital where both are caring for wounded soldiers. Lara serves as his muse, speaks to his soul, and is the inspiration for his poetry. Unlike most modern cinematic tales of infidelity which involve little restraint or guilt, Yuri and Lara desperately seek personal integrity as they are repeatedly brought together (and separated) by the upheaval of war and revolution. Surely if Yuri is 'the worst of sinners, then he is the worst of sufferers also'. The two women in Yuri's life, wife and mistress, stand in sharp contrast, though both come across as sympathetic characters. The lovely Geraldine Chaplain portrays his ladylike, aristocratic wife, Tonya, who is well bred and has been schooled abroad. The daughter of the bourgeois Gromeko, she is actually Yuri's step sister, which might understandably tend to elicit more platonic than passionate feelings from her husband. Yuri and Lara succumb to their passions even as the blameless Tonya is pregnant with Yuri's second child. Tonya is a warm, loving wife and devoted mother, undeserving of her husband's infidelity. Julie Christie plays the gorgeous & enigmatic Lara, a woman whose station in life makes her vulnerable to misuse by men, yet she possesses a genuine resourcefulness and inner strength. As a teenage girl, she is seduced and violated by the lecherous Victor Komarovsky, a despicable politician and her own mother's lover. She falls under repeated abuse by this vile & contemptible character, who calls Lara a slut and treats her as such. Later she is fiancé & then wife to the misguided idealist and activist, Pasha, who holds intense political ideologies which become more crucial than his wife to him. Pasha later becomes Strelnikov, the obsessive Bolshevik officer who eventually comes into confrontation with Zhivago. During much of the tumult, Lara entrusts her own & Pasha's daughter, Katya, into the care of others. Of course the legend of Lara lives on musically in Maurice Jarre's lovely, haunting Lara's Theme.Supporting cast members include Rod Steiger, who is perfect as the villainous Komarovsky, and Tom Courtenay as Pasha / Strelnikov, a shy and pure individual who earns the abused Lara's respect and love, later going on to become a cold hearted revolutionary. Alec Guiness portrays Yuri's half brother, Yevgraf, and Ralph Richardson is Tonya's aristocratic & gentlemanly father, Alexander Gromeko.This film has amazing Oscar winning cinematography throughout. During World War I and the Revolution, there are vivid scenes of battle, mass desertion, and endless march through the desolate, blizzard ridden Siberian wasteland. Also visually stunning is the spectacular train ride Yuri and his family must make from Moscow to the Urals, site of the family dachau. However, surely most viewers' truly unforgettable pictures are the snowy white sleigh ride and the magnificent ice castle at Varykino. No other film can compare in its depiction of winter scenery. This sweeping panorama, the era's tumultuous political events, and the emotional portrait of one sensitive man's experience of them, create a visual masterpiece and a truly immortal screen saga.",9,111,124,10 May 2006
The Patriot," Engrossing Revolutionary War tale, though not historical
","Being Canadian, I probably know fewer details of the Revolutionary War than the average U.S. viewer, but note that many seem absolutely outraged at the historical untruths of this movie. When I watched it, I personally found it quite captivating but always have enough sense not to get my history from Hollywood. Since my viewing, I've looked up some info and note various inaccuracies such as misplaced characters, exaggeration of British atrocities, inaccurate torching of a church with townsfolk inside being burned alive, and depiction of American owned slaves being freed to serve in the Continental Army. (Apparently, it was the British who promised to free them if they joined their forces, but later reneged.) My apologies if my facts aren't straight. It's the FICTIONAL story of a widowed South Carolina farmer, Benjamin Martin, who is disgusted by his past supposedly heroic deeds during the French Indian Wars. He has resolved to avoid participation when the Colonies revolt against Britain and stay home to protect his seven children. However, he witnesses atrocities against his two older sons, Gabriel and Thomas, by the cruel British Colonel Tavington. Gabriel, the oldest, has joined the battle against the Redcoats early on, been captured, and sentenced by Tavington to hang. Thomas, the second son, attempts to free Gabriel as he is being taken away, only to be killed by Tavington right in front of his father. This forces the reluctant Benjamin into the fray, organizing a local militia group of farmers and ex Indian fighters who will tie up the British until the French arrive.Mel Gibson gives a moving portrayal of the father who is driven into a battle he sought to avoid in order to protect his family from the British. For me, his personal and family story is the essence of the tale. Just as one would expect, Benjamin Martin comes across as very sympathetic and heroic. Apparently this character is sort of a composite of possibly three different real men of that era. The film has wonderful period costumes, though also (like Gibson's earlier Braveheart) more than enough violence for my taste. However, it did bring to life for me the Revolutionary War, unfortunately in a purely fictional rather than historical way. Though I enjoyed this picture, it seems to have taken a lot of liberties with the truth. The movie should therefore be considered strictly as entertainment, not a history lesson.",7,102,137,13 April 2006
Gandhi," Beautiful, epic portrait of India's man of peace...but with qualms
","This is a magnificent portrayal of the life of India's Mahatma Gandhi. The film begins with Gandhi's assassination by a fellow Hindu and his massively attended funeral. It then proceeds to chronicle his life over a half century, from his early years as a young lawyer, to his advocacy of non violent protest as his country's spiritual leader, resulting in the peaceful liberation of India from British rule. Gandhi was an Indian attorney, educated in England, who went on to take up the cause of racial equality in South Africa. He then returned to India and struggled to bring about his country's independence from Britain through the use of nonviolent means. One of his major obstacles was the uniting of Hindu and Moslem Indians in this cause. He achieved his goal of independence but through the formation of two separate countries, India and Pakistan, with a further division of Pakistan later forming Bangladesh. In depicting Gandhi's life, the film paints a vivid portrait of racial discrimination, both in South Africa and in his native India. Gandhi is an important historical figure as other great leaders, such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela, have employed his peaceful approach to causes of civil rights and racial equality in their own countries.This was a simple & humble man without wealth, property, official title, or political position. Yet Gandhi is seen as India's greatest leader, a man who insisted that his followers achieve their goals through civil disobedience rather than violence. The film captures with equal brilliance his simple tasks, such as spinning cotton or scooping salt, and his dramatic methods, especially his fast unto death. Gandhi's commitment to his goals and his determined but peaceful pursuit of them are well portrayed, as he shows himself willing to suffer and possibly even die to achieve his ends. Ben Kingsley, a British actor of paternal Indian origin himself, is masterful in his portrayal of the great Hindu leader, both during his years as a young lawyer in South Africa and later as the simple and modest man wearing wire rimmed glasses, a loin cloth, and shawl. He perfectly captures Gandhi's humility, intensity, dignity, and inner strength. Although Kingsley had a significant role in Schindler's List, for me he will always be Gandhi in the role he was born to play.The wonderful star studded supporting cast includes John Gieguld as the Indian Viceroy (Lord Irwin) who ignores Gandhi, John Mills as the earlier Viceroy, Edward Fox as the cruel English General Dyer who ruthlessly fires on a crowd, Trevor Howard as the considerate and respectful Judge Broomfield, and Ian Charleston as a local Christian clergyman. Journalistic roles are portrayed by Candice Bergen as a photographer for Life magazine, and Marin Sheen a New York Times reporter.The movie was filmed on location in India and has stunning cinematography throughout. The scenes of India (both countryside and crowded Calcutta) plus the dramatic funeral crowd depiction which features half a million extras, lend this film the impression of a sweeping epic. David Lean's only worthy rival is Richard Attenborough, who directed this picture. It fully deserved its numerous Oscars which include Best Picture, Actor, Director, Cinematography, and Costuming. This is an incredible movie which gives viewers of all nations and faiths an appreciation for the life and work of India's beloved Hindu leader. However, I have some definite qualms about this epic. As is often the case with Hollywood, Christianity is not cast here in a particularly stellar light, Christians are generally depicted as bigots, and the clergyman is not personally very inspiring. Rev. Andrews seems to have a weak theology himself and is portrayed as rather pathetic compared with the wise & great Hindu leader. I have little knowledge of the movie's historical accuracy in its depiction of Gandhi. While one certainly should not cast aspersions upon the deceased, this picture appears to totally overlook any flaws Gandhi may have had. I am quite leery of putting people on pedestals and frankly, the Indian leader is elevated to a state approaching deity in this film. Certainly Gandhi made an enormous contribution to India's history and became an admirable model of peaceful resistance to injustice, but it is Christ who set the example of a life lived perfectly. He is another who lived humbly without wealth, property, title, or position and is the one on whom we should genuinely model our lives in every respect. Gandhi is unquestionably a stunning film, but I bear all this in mind.",9,5,12,11 May 2006
Gone with the Wind," Lavish Civil War saga with a scheming but complex Southern belle
","This magnificent epic portrays the Civil War, as seen through the famous green eyes of its self absorbed heroine, Scarlett O'Hara. With its expansive panoramas...from the old fashioned barbecue at Twelve Oaks plantation to the spectacular burning of Atlanta by the Yankees...it paints a vivid portrait of the gracious lifestyle of the Old South, the horrific Civil War itself, and its Reconstruction after effects on a society whose customs are literally Gone With the Wind. It boasts colorful scenes, a tumultuous historical setting, lavish costumes (especially one particular green velvet gown), but above all a complex, immortal heroine and an appealing, roguish hero.Vivien Leigh adds the right touch of charm to her role as the spoiled daughter of a plantation owner, a flirtatious Southern belle who boasts the smallest waist in three counties. I can see Scarlett now surrounded by the Tarleton twins and all her retinue of would be beaux, vying for her attentions at the Wilkes's barbecue. This is a conniving young lady who...fiddle dee dee...simply MUST have her own way and nothing or no one must be allowed to interfere with her plans. Scarlett tends to elicit viewer outrage for marrying a shy, innocent, unsuspecting boy in order to enact revenge on the man who spurns her for a lesser mortal, and for later employing all her feminine wiles on a prosperous older man, betraying her own sister, Suellen, in the process. Not to mention her viewing the Civil War's tragedy only as it affects her own selfish interests, her assorted attempted manipulations of Rhett (the man who truly loves her), and her ongoing betrayal of the trusting Melanie. Even after war devastates her circumstances, Scarlett remains the same inner schemer and the same outward manipulator. Margaret Mitchell's novel provides a deeper insight into Scarlett, and might tend to elicit a little more sympathy for this selfish heroine who deals with any unpleasantness by 'thinking about it all tomorrow'. Even in the movie, Scarlett is not totally villainous but a three dimensional character who does have her strengths. She has an undying loyalty and passion for her beloved Tara, exhibiting courage, determination, and back breaking labour to protect her home plantation from the Yankees and feed her helpless family. She is fiercely protective of her loved ones, even her sisters who are an annoyance to her, and Melanie who is married to the object of her desire. She does indeed experience growth as a result of all the unfolding events, suffering the loss of the daughter she genuinely loves and eventually coming to appreciate Melanie's friendship...and, alas too late, Rhett's love.Clark Gable IS that virile, dangerous, and totally endearing rake and scoundrel, Rhett Butler, in the role he was born to play. Can't you just picture Gable's Rhett languishing in a plantation smoking room, enjoying a glass of fine bourbon? His actual film scenes are amazing...chuckling over the antics of the spoiled young belle at the barbecue, scandalously dancing with the young widow, denouncing her manipulative scheme to extract money from him, carrying his wife passionately up those stairs (who can forget?), grieving the loss of his precious little Bonnie Blue Butler, baring his soul to his dear friend Melanie, and finally his legendary 'Frankly, my dear...'The supporting cast are wonderful as well. Leslie Howard portrays Ashley Wilkes, the bookish idealist Scarlett has set her cap for. Olivia de Havilland is perfect as his sweet, kind, loyal, and unsuspecting wife, Melanie, a genuine lady. I agree with another's comment that Melanie's finest hour is when, loyal to the last, she asks Scarlett to receive guests with her at her sister-in-law's birthday party even though it's rumored Scarlett has been carrying on with her husband. Thomas Mitchell excels in the role of Scarlett's earthy, blustery Irish father, Gerald O'Hara, whose own love of the land lives on in Scarlett.The black roles are especially well presented. Hattie McDaniell more than deserved her Best Supporing Actress Oscar for portraying Scarlett's large, buxom, disapproving, wise Mammy, the only person besides Rhett who is fully aware of Scarlett's schemes. She is priceless with her red petticoat. Prissy, the young slave girl with questionable knowledge 'bout birthin' babies, is also well drawn with her large frightened eyes and high pitched, shrill voice.The story's theme of wanting what one cannot have is common throughout humanity, though especially exaggerated in Scarlett. She constantly pines for a man who belongs to another, and once he becomes available, she no longer desires him. The dreary, dreamy, scholarly Ashley is totally unsuited to Scarlett, who continues ungratefully & foolishly unaware of what she already has in Rhett, her true soul mate. Scarlett and Rhett are kindred spirits, both proudly selfish and neither conforming to society. Furthermore, Rhett loves Scarlett with all his heart, despite having full awareness of her manipulative ways. As for Ashley, he seems rather a pathetic & weak character really, in love with his gentle wife but constantly tempted by Scarlett, never firmly discouraging her but instead dully half leading her on for years.No one should miss this legendary Civil War extravaganza that paints with such a vivid brush that dramatic period in Georgia's history. True, few heroines are more flawed than Scarlett O'Hara, but for all her schemes and manipulations, you cannot help but become engrossed in her fate.",10,0,0,20 May 2006
Legends of the Fall," Moving masterpiece of family bonds ripped asunder
","When I tuned in to this movie, I fully expected to see Hollywood trash, having heard that the story revolves around three brothers who all have relationships with the same woman. Much to my surprise, I found a captivating epic well presented and a very moving depiction of the close father / son and brother bonds torn apart by the unfolding emotions involving this woman.The legend begins with Colonel Ludlow, who is disgusted with the government and chooses to raise his three sons (Alfred, Tristan, and Samuel) in the Rocky Mountain wilderness of Montana. His wife and the boys' mother, Isabel, has retreated off to civilized city life, having no fondness for the wilds. The three brothers enjoy very close and loyal fraternal bonds until the youngest, Samuel, brings his fiancé, Susannah Fincannon, back from college with him to meet his family. The oldest brother, Alfred, falls in love with his brother's fiancé, while Susanna herself develops passionate feelings for the middle brother, Tristan. Meanwhile, World War I has begun and all three brothers enlist to go off overseas into battle, with the disapproval but blessing of their father.This movie is notable partly for its absolutely spectacular and majestic mountain wilderness scenery, filmed in the Canadian Rockies not far from Calgary. You can really see what they mean by the phrase 'big sky'. I love the bear scenes! Also, it features beautiful musical scoring, totally appropriate to the dramatic and heartbreaking events.The brothers are very disparate individuals, each a sympathetic and tragic figure with his own unique virtues. Samuel, the youngest, is innocent & naive but also tender & idealistic. As the baby of the family, his two older siblings seem especially protective of him even during war. The eldest, Alfred, is a responsible and honourable man of integrity who 'follows all the rules, man's and God's'. He later pursues a political career for worthy and noble reasons, though incurs his father's estrangement for doing so. The middle brother, Tristan, is wild and passionate, very tuned in to nature with a Native American foster father. His own father's favourite, he is a tempestuous and troubled individual who is haunted by his own personal demons but has many amazing strengths. Alhough Tristan is admittedly the obvious hero of the piece, I actually prefer and identify more with his two brothers.All three Ludlow brothers are well cast. The handsome Brad Pitt, though he doesn't make me swoon personally, nevertheless gives a compelling performance as the long haired, wild, and tormented Tristan. Aidan Quinn plays the much less exciting but reliable Alfred, while Samuel is portrayed by Henry Thomas, who (to my surprise) is the ET kid all grown up. As always, Anthony Hopkins is masterful as the boys' father, Colonel Ludlow. It is especially touching later in the tale when he exhibits the infirmities of old age.The lovely, well spoken Julia Ormond plays Susannah, the woman who unwillingly causes so much grief in the Ludlow family. Before watching this movie, I anticipated finding her a reprehensible character with loose morals and no concept whatsoever of loyalty. However, this beautiful & spirited young woman with no family roots of her own (her parents both having died), comes across as a very sympathetic character. I personally wouldn't judge her, seeing the way events unfold in her relationships with these brothers. Susannah herself certainly suffers greatly for any mistakes she makes. Two of the brothers' different attitudes are revealed quite dramatically in a scene early in the movie where Samuel confides in Tristan his fears of being unable to satisfy his future bride. Note the different phrases employed by these two young men for sex with Susannah, I think it reflects their underlying different emotions and values, not merely wording. As for Alfred, he genuinely cares deeply for Susannah and wants to see her treated respectfully. Upon realizing that Tristan has been intimate with her, he demands that his brother marry this lady he himself loves in order to make an 'honest woman' of her. As I see it, Susannah's tragic flaw lies in falling for the wrong brother. The unsettled Tristan is unable to return her love in the stable & committed way she seeks, especially at such a traumatic period in his life. After Tristan's abandonment, Susannah marries Alfred, whom she (alas) does not love, because he can offer this stability and commitment.Other interesting characters in these legends include the Native American One Stab.The viewer cheers for Tristan's dramatic defense of his friend's rights when a bigoted bar owner refuses to serve him. There's also the cute and endearing young half native Isabel Two, who blossoms into such a beautiful young woman.The threatened family ties are brilliantly depicted in this epic, the interactions between father & sons and especially between the brothers riveting and wrenching. It is a tragic and heartbreaking but ultimately uplifting tale of war, loyalty, love, betrayal, grief, and especially the unshakable bonds of brotherhood.",9,0,2,3 June 2006
The Pianist," Wrenching but poetic portrait of one Polish musician's Holocaust
","This is for me the most poignant and powerful of all the movies depicting the Holocaust...the true life story of talented Polish pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman. Normally I would scoff at descriptions of a film as poetic or artistic, but this one truly is both. The beautiful classical music adds passion to a tale that is already heart wrenching beyond words. The movie features magnificent cinematography, especially the winter street scenes and devastated, shell shocked buildings of Warsaw.As the film begins, Szpilman is playing a polonaise for a Warsaw radio station when a bomb impacts his studio. After this, the story continues on with the despicable discriminatory laws against Polish Jews, their forced resettlement into the Warsaw Ghetto, and the herding of ghetto residents (including all of Szpilman's family) off to concentration camps. Although he personally is spared the camps, Szpilman is conscripted into a German labour compound. He then escapes into hiding as a Jewish refugee, forced to take whatever assistance he can from others, usually complete strangers. During this period he helplessly witnesses, from the window of his hide out, the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of 1943 and Warsaw City Revolt of 1944.Adrien Brody is absolutely brilliant in his Oscar winning role as the pianist. Although many events are depicted pertaining to both family and strangers surrounding him, the movie focuses on one particular Jew's personal story, thus making it particularly compelling. We see all the unfolding horrors through Szpilman's eyes, and Brody conveys such emotion with them. This is a gifted musician but otherwise, quite an ordinary person who feels constant anguish at the atrocities around him. Yet he is unable to help, instead forced to struggle for his own survival. He engages in no futile heroics but does everything possible to stay alive, ferret out food sources, and avoid detection by the Nazis as he moves from one hiding place to another. There are so many riveting, horrendous scenes. Szpilman puts a human face on the initial loathsome laws when he is unable to go to the cafe or park with his new cellist friend, Jews being strictly forbidden. Later German soldiers force absurd dancing among ill matched ghetto couples in order to amuse themselves. Then much worse...A man in a wheelchair is dropped off a high building for refusing to stand up when Nazi soldiers enter his apartment. Later an entire line of Jewish men are forced to lay down and then systematically shot in the head one by one. When the Jews are being rounded up from the ghetto, one mother inadvertently smothers her baby to stifle its cries that would betray the family's hiding place.The Szpilman family drama is itself heartbreaking. As they are standing in line awaiting transport to the concentration camp, Szpilman tells his sister that he wished he knew her better, implying fears that they may be separated forever. Perhaps the most poignant scene is again while they are awaiting deportation, when the father divides a tiny caramel in enough pieces for each family member to have a minute bit. While the cruelty toward the Jews is well captured, the Jewish people in this story are portrayed not as saints but as real three dimensional individuals, which actually makes the story even more believable and compelling. Szpilman comes from a typical imperfect family, for example the members bickering over where they are going to hide the family's money. Polanski is unafraid to portray some of the Jews as assisting the Nazis by becoming Jewish police within the ghetto, in order to protect their own interests. Eventually we see a German officer with compassion, not all are evil monsters.The film pays tribute to the music of the Polish composer, Chopin. Szpilman is himself a gifted pianist, whose talents must lay dormant during these horrific years, like all the other talents of countless other Jews...those that were fortunate enough to survive at all. The film wrenchingly depicts how much Szpilman misses classical music and his piano playing. In one scene, his fingers hover in rapid movement over the keys as he imagines the beautiful music of that particular piece, sound being forbidden lest it lead to his detection. Later when asked to play for the German officer, he conveys such intense passion. Perhaps a wee bit rusty at first, his fingers soon dance dramatically across the keyboard pouring forth the haunting Chopin Ballade, as Szpilman is overwhelmed with emotion. Some claim that he believes he is playing for his life or fears this will be his last performance ever, but I think he is simply lost in the pure joy of being able to play his exquisite music again, at least this once.For me, The Pianist far surpasses even Schindler's List. This gripping story of one man's will to survive is definitely the best Holocaust film ever made.",10,0,2,21 May 2006
Schindler's List," Powerful and moving depiction of one unlikely hero's Holocaust
","Stephen Spielberg's amazing Schindler's List is an incredibly moving, graphic depiction of Holocaust horrors, as they relate to one unlikely humanitarian hero. The Czech born German businessman, Oskar Schindler, starts up a factory in Poland, intending to make his fortune by taking advantage of cheap Jewish labor. As he becomes increasingly aware of the concentration camp horrors, his motivations change from profit to helping his fellow man, and he is able to save 1100 Jews from the atrocities and gas chambers of Auschwitz.Liam Neeson is brilliant in the role of the cool and very human Oscar Schindler, an ordinary businessman not lacking in human frailties himself. The only other actor that I specifically recall from the movie is Ben Kingsley (who earlier played Gandhi), always wonderful in any role.Just a trivial detail, but I found very touching the Jewish custom of placing stones on the graves of loved ones. It is used with dramatic effect in this movie. This is a superbly crafted film, the use at times of black and white photography giving a starkly moving, documentary mood. The movie serves as a dramatic tribute to one ordinary and obviously flawed man who, through good will, smarts, and audacity, was able to save so many lives. It is also a troubling personal depiction of the Holocaust, brought to horrific life to many viewers because of Spielberg's efforts. However, it is NOT of course, by any means, an entertaining film. I have not seen it since its original release and find it too disturbing to deliberately set forth to watch a second time.Although some reviewers have criticized the insensitivity and false portrait, I'd also recommend the Italian film, Life is Beautiful, for a different and unusual view of concentration camps, a story filled with love, humor, and optimism. Also, although I believe there was in years past a TV movie of some sort (starring Richard Chamberlain?), I'd like to see a major film done on another Holocaust hero, Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who saved countless Hungarian Jews. I put Wallenberg in a similar heroic category along with Oskar Schindler.Schindler's List is a must see movie, both disturbing history and extraordinary heroism brought dramatically to life on the screen.",9,9,13,22 March 2006
Amadeus," Masterpiece of jealousy & musical genius, woefully unhistorical
","When I saw this movie upon its release, I was enthralled with it. Even today, I'm sure I'd regard it as a cinematic masterpiece. The lead actors are all brilliant in their roles (especially F. Murray Abraham as the jealous Salieri), the plot gripping, the flashback mode of storytelling compelling, the sets and costumes spectacular, and Mozart's music of course divine, literally, as only God could impart to a mere mortal such musical genius. That being said, and it may make for tremendous drama, but is it quite right to rewrite history to that extent for the stage or screen? There may have been rumours of a deathbed confession, but to the best of my knowledge there is no historical credence whatsoever given to any claim that Salieri murdered or conspired to murder Mozart. They were contemporaries & possibly rivals, but to what extent was he even jealous? My sources claim more evidence of a cooperative spirit between the two composers than any genuine antipathy. Salieri is not here to defend himself, and it's reprehensible to accuse the deceased of murder (or imply as much), simply to inaccurately entertain the masses and make bucks for the theatre or film industry. True, the movie never outright states that Salieri murdered Mozart; maybe it is only extreme guilt from his consuming jealousy that makes him believe he did so. However, as presented, many viewers (especially those who aren't music scholars) will retain permanently as truth this film's picture of the two composers, long after the closing credits, and their picture of Salieri will be that of a murderer. Mind you, I had no such qualms of conscience myself when I originally saw this film 20 or so years ago.The movie seems to have taken a lot of dramatic license as its Salieri makes a vow of celibacy when young, causing him to feel sexually frustrated throughout life. The real Salieri married and fathered eight children!Of course the plot revolves around the supposedly mediocre composer, Antonio Salieri, who is consumed with jealousy for the genius, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Abraham plays Salieri to perfection, his hatred and his attempts to conceal it obvious to the viewer, who completely sympathizes with his inner struggles. Also, the entire concept of his devotion to God, questioning why? why? why? did He not impart such musical genius to him, Salieri, who would have used it for God's glory, rather than squandering it on the totally undeserving Mozart. It's a question many people of faith must ask when they look at others and see academic, musical, artistic, athletic, or whatever talents that they themselves long for but lack, while others less worthy in their midst have unjustly been granted them. A theme that many can relate to in ordinary life, brilliantly conveyed.As for Mozart (played by Tom Hulce), if he was really as silly, crude, and obnoxious as this movie portrayed, I might well have murdered him myself! I was relieved to read one comment claiming that Mozart is not depicted accurately here, that he was fun loving but socially quite proper. Thus, another desecration of the dead. Personally, I found the movie's most touching scene to be near the end when Mozart is buried in a mass, common grave. That outrage at least is historically accurate...a moving, tragic picture that is worth a thousand words, of a genius not truly honored in his day, at least not in death.Possibly relative to Mozart, but it's unfair to cast Salieri as a mediocre composer. My son (a flute player) actually quite likes Salieri's compositions, praises Mozart's genius but suggests that many of his works are very similar. He especially appreciates Salieri's Concerto for Flute and Oboe. Yes, Amadeus is a tremendous musical spectacle, a masterpiece of cinematography, an extraordinary (if extremely inaccurate) drama of human jealousy at its absolute worst (yet most sympathetic), but my conscience now does bother me just a little. Antonio Salieri should have been allowed to rest in peace.",9,2,4,9 March 2006
The Last Emperor," Lush and opulent but disappointing epic spectacle
","This is a legendary grand cinematic epic, this time focused on the People's Republic of China, the nation's history portrayed through the changing fortunes of its tragic final emperor, a puppet occupying a position only of ceremonial significance. It has wonderful authentic costumes and thousands of extras, permission being granted for its filming within the Forbidden City itself, a huge imperial complex of 250 acres. However, it's a film that disappointed me personally. I found it both confusing at the time and forgettable long term.The film relates China's history through the prism of its last emperor, Pu Yi...his birth, brief childhood reign after being crowned emperor at age three, captivity in his own palace, taking of both a wife and a concubine, abdication and decline into a dissolute lifestyle, exploitation by the Japanese as emperor of Manchuguo, re education by the Communists, life as a regular peasant in the People's Republic and death as a humble gardener in Peking's Botanical Gardens. My main complaint, lacking much personal knowledge of the history, is confusion as to the story, especially given the story telling method of both flash back and flash forward. It was all very artistic as opposed to informative, and presumed a considerable background knowledge of Chinese history on the part of the viewer. Although the film painted a vivid and compelling portrait of this tragic historical figure for me at the time, the images left me soon after I departed the theatre so something must have been lacking.",6,3,7,23 April 2006
Annie Hall," Disgusting, boring monument to selfish and neurotic romance
","I realize I'm taking on an icon here, but honestly, this is the most disgustingly boring and over-rated film to come out of the 1970's. It is unfortunate that the rather pathetic Woody Allen, an admittedly intelligent man who alas squanders his considerable talents, firmly believes that the cosmos revolves around his legendary neuroses. Even more unfortunate, is the fact that he has succeeded in persuading a large percentage of the Western world to agree with him. Frankly, it does not speak well of our culture.This (yawn) movie revolves around a pair of self absorbed lovers...a neurotic New York comedian, Alvy Singer (played by Woody) and a would-be singer, Annie Hall. The two, both in analysis, move in together so they can exchange tales of their professional, paid for navel gazing. I certainly wouldn't want to imply that it might be simply for the convenient sex. The rest of this so called neurotic romance is far too inconsequential to bother detailing here.Annie Hall is played by Diane Keaton, an actress who is actually very competent. Her movies are frequently not my favorite, though I did enjoy the cute Baby Boom. Her only memorable aspect in this film is her Ralph Lauren clothes, now of course quite dated, which supposedly caused a fashion revolution at the time. That classic comment of Woody's regarding sex, 'This is the most fun I've had without laughing' doesn't particularly impress me with its brilliance. Fear not, Shakespeare, Woody serves as no threat to you as master of the English language. It is indeed sad that so many people seem to praise this mindless, uninspiring, unoriginal, and not even particularly amusing pearl of wisdom as though it had virtually descended from the gods on Mount Olympus.Annie Hall isn't the absolute worst movie I've ever seen, but it really doesn't have much to recommend it. I normally adore romances, but neither one of these two selfish neurotics captured my sympathy or even remote interest. Furthermore, the supposed witty banter between the pair failed woefully to either entertain or amuse me. Back in 1977 when I saw this movie at the theatre with my husband (then boyfriend), we both sincerely wished we'd found some paint and watched it dry instead. I guess this intellectual comedy was just far too complicated for little old us to appreciate.",1,95,186,17 March 2006
Chariots of Fire," Inspiring movie and brilliant character study in an Olympic sports tale
","I saw this movie only once when it first came out, but it has stayed fresh in my mind all these 25 years and I'm sure I'd glean even more out of it the second time around. It's an absolute must see, a film with compelling characters and a unique theme I've encountered nowhere else. The film is based, apart from a few historical liberties, on two runners who compete in the 1924 Paris Olympics. It's primarily a character study of the two track athletes and their very different but equally passionate motivations, both being consumed with a fire for running and competition. Eric Liddell, a Scottish missionary, runs because he believes it pleases and glorifies God. Failure to do so, he feels, would be 'to hold Him in contempt'. Harold Abrahams is Jewish and his motivations revolve around overcoming the prejudice of that era in Cambridge society. He must 'prove himself' and vying for an Olympic medal is simply the vehicle he chooses for that end. Ian Charleson and Ben Cross are both brilliant in their respective roles of Liddell and Abrahams.The plot itself holds a certain interest (if not grip) as we watch the two athletes train, head to Paris, and eventually compete in their respective track events. Obviously, unless you're already an expert on former Olympic medalists, you're going to wonder...did they win their races? However, that being said, the film is definitely more driven by character than by plot.Yes, there are a few deviations from true history here, but regarding the Sabbath issue, I find it moving and inspiring in this day and age to think of an athlete of that calibre taking such a stand. Not to broadly denounce all modern Olympians who devote their lives to training, but oh...that we had such personal integrity in our era, with steroid scandals (so commonplace as to not even be scandalous anymore) and focus on future professional careers and lucrative product sponsorships.The Vangelis theme accompanying the slow motion runners at the beach became justifiably famous. I'm not much of an athlete to say the least but whenever I hear it to this day, it makes me feel like running! Don't miss this movie. Cinematography, music, a touch of race suspense, but especially character and theme...all brilliantly done.",9,4,5,6 March 2006
Life Is Beautiful," Sublime triumph of love, despite the worst of situations
","My summary conveys the message of this movie. This film is an astounding tribute to the beauty of the human spirit, the ability to maintain a hopeful and optimistic outlook, the unique bond between a father and son (or husband and wife), and the triumph of love...all in coping both with everyday life situations and later, with the horrific environment of a Nazi concentration camp.This Italian film tells the tale of a bubbling, carefree Jewish book shopkeeper, Guido, who embarks upon a romance and marriage in 1930's Italy, soon raising a son with his wife, Dora. The family's happy little world crashes when the Nazis force father & son to a concentration camp. Guido seeks out ways to communicate with his wife, who has voluntarily followed her 'two men' to the camp and is of course now separated from them in the women's barracks. Also, in order to make life bearable for his little boy, Guido pretends that the horrifying Holocaust events are all an elaborate game, with a tank offered as the grand prize.The father turning this unspeakable situation into a game creates a unique perspective, to say the least. Personally, I found this touching tale very emotional, although of course in quite a different way from Schindler's List, a tremendously moving film with its graphic depiction of horrifying truths the world must never forget.Some seem insulted by this movie, which I can understand. Perhaps this film might be interpreted as an outrage to the memory of those who suffered so much. However, this is not a documentary and I don't think its intent is to deny or trivialize the Holocaust. It is a fictional family's story. The concentration camp setting might indeed seem insensitive, but I agree with those who feel this is simply intended as a film about hope, as personified by its main character, Guido, and about the bonds of family.This lovely tale, so unexpected, touches the heart in a very personal way...the wife and mother bravely following her loved ones into danger rather than face separation, the father concocting this incredible wild scheme to protect his young son from being frightened by the atrocities occurring all around him. Guido is so charming, funny, inventive, and appealing. The film tells his entire adult life story. It's not just about the Nazi years; the concentration camp is only the latter part of his tale, as it also amusingly and touchingly chronicles his courtship and early married life.This movie is just a moving, heartwarming FICTIONAL story of a wonderful, optimistic, unique individual and his family. Don't let the sub-titles dissuade you. You absolutely must see this incredible film. It's amusing, romantic, and of course tragic...all three. Above all, it indeed shows that despite all the cruelty of the Holocaust...at least for Guido, in both the best and worst of situations...Life is Beautiful.",9,2,6,23 March 2006
Rocky," Legendary boxing underdog is absolutely everyone's favorite
","What a great feel good movie and what an immortal, if unlikely, hero! Boxing is just about the last thing I'm normally interested in, so for me to have enjoyed the movie that much, it must have been pretty fantastic. Sylvester Stallone gives an incredible, believable performance as the underdog boxer who isn't a rocket scientist and has been put down all his life, but is so sweet and innocent at heart. For me (and probably many) there almost isn't a Sylvester Stallone. He's just Rocky.This famous movie tells the tale of a Philadelphia meat packer, Rocky Balboa, who gets an unexpected opportunity for fame by competing in a boxing match against the huge, cocky favorite, the World Heavyweight Champion, Apollo Creed. Of course Rocky, alias the Italian Stallion, is the underdog by a mile, so must train like crazy, under the direction of his older manager, Mickey (played by Burgess Meredith). Meanwhile the boxer-in-training meets a sweet, painfully shy girl, Adrian, a pet store clerk, who is quite unable to string two words together when talking with a man.It's just a wonderful story. You cheer so overwhelmingly for this lovable big hunk, and want everything to work out for him, not just in the boxing ring (the whole audience was audibly cheering him on at the theatre back in 1976), but also the romance department. Talia Shire is totally convincing as the timid, endearing Adrian, that Rocky tries amusingly and unsuccessfully at first to impress. She really deserves a nice man. By the way, the movie has a fantastic musical score to accompany the training, the romance, and the Big Fight. I have an enduring mental picture of Rocky running up those steps to that lively and inspiring music...and so does everyone else who saw this movie. Simple story really, with a venue of the boxing ring. It totally deserved its Best Picture Oscar, all its fame and popularity. I even enjoyed (though somewhat less) most of the numerous sequels...could never quite get enough of Rocky Balboa.",9,0,0,15 March 2006
Pretty Woman," Wonderful Cinderella / Pygmalion tale, hooker style
","What can I say that hasn't been said? This immensely popular, modern fairy tale romance is a fantastic 'feel good' must see. I can't resist watching it every single time it comes on TV. To tempt you if you haven't seen it...it's the story of a feisty, good hearted hooker named Vivian Ward, who is hired for a week by a wealthy businessman, Edward Lewis, to serve as his escort at a number of business related social functions. Needless to say, the relationship doesn't stay 'just business' for long.Rather than the plot itself, the beautiful Julia Roberts makes this movie...and not simply because of her 88 inches of leg! Always endearing in her roles, she is at her absolute MOST endearing portraying Vivian in this picture. She brings a real vulnerability to the role, showing us that just like everyone else, prostitutes do indeed floss their teeth! Richard Gere pulls off quite convincingly the role of Edward, the ruthless, calculating millionaire businessman, who takes over companies only to sell them off piece by piece, quite unmindful of the interests of any people involved. To give Gere credit, I was quite impressed that he actually plays the piano in one of the movie's scenes.Naturally, given Vivian's membership in the 'oldest profession', there is sex early on...though I, old fashioned and strict as I am, wouldn't hesitate to let my young teen see this movie. (There's worse in TV commercials today!) Oddly, the most truly intimate moment in this film is not during the more explicit sex but rather, simply a kiss.Ohhhh, lots of romantic scenes, from a picnic in the park to jetting off in a private plane for a Big Night on the Town. And etiquette lessons...Vivian displays charming, amusing, curious innocence when she experiences with Edward her first opera (all the while looking knock out gorgeous in a stunning red gown), her first polo match, and her introduction to escargots. As the movie progresses, she is transformed Pygmalion style, from the street smart hooker provocatively dressed in tall black boots and mini skirt, to a sophisticated looking, elegantly gowned and coiffed young lady. But it's merely appearance...Vivian's heart of gold and her vulnerability both remain unchanged.The status conscious snobbery of Beverly Hills dress shops and ritzy hotels, judging people by wealth and class, is well depicted here. When Vivian goes shopping for a 'more appropriate' wardrobe at some exclusive Rodeo Drive boutiques, she is not 'well received' by the sales ladies, who like all too many of us, are overly inclined to judge by appearance. You'll want these snobs to get their comeuppance. Actually, perhaps the most touching relationship in this entire film is the one between Vivian and Barney, the quite proper but kind desk manager at the high class hotel (where she is sharing a penthouse suite with Edward), who is able to see beyond appearance. He develops a genuine fondness and even more importantly, respect for her.Other characters of interest...Kit is Vivian's appealing and sympathetic room-mate, also a hooker (Vivian's a loyal friend), and Stuckey is Edward's sleazy and despicable business colleague, portrayed by Seinfeld's Jason Alexander, a TV show which I must confess is not my favourite. As events unfold during the film, it becomes clear that, while Edward might not understand too clearly the meaning of 'prostitution', Vivian clearly does. And, it's another shining film illustration of that pearl of wisdom from Eliza Doolittle (of My Fair Lady) who enlightened us, 'The difference between a flower girl and a lady is not how she behaves, but how she is treated.' Or, in Vivian's own words, 'People put you down enough, you start to believe it'.Great Cinderella movie...don't miss it.",9,53,79,8 March 2006
Titanic," Immortal romance on the doomed ocean liner
","I thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful tale of forbidden love set on history's most famous ocean liner, and believe both the film and its engaging and sympathetic young lovers will go down in the annals of screen legend. All the hype turned out to be a prediction of the movie's calibre, as far as I'm concerned, though some have described it as the movie 'many love to hate'. Of course the film chronicles the tragically brief shipboard romance between Rose, a beautiful, confused young socialite (traveling First Class of course), who is engaged to a suitable but nasty fiancé of her social status, and Jack, the penniless, free spirited young artist traveling in steerage, Third Class. The lead roles are brilliantly portrayed, with electric chemistry, by the lovely Kate Winslet and the dashing young Leonardo diCaprio, both made famous by their roles here. (Pity diCaprio went on to do that foolish modern Romeo + Juliet, a desecration.)As for the romance...yes, it's a moving tale that will endure along with other screen legends. The weaving of the tale of the diamond necklace, the Heart of the Ocean, and Jack's sketch of Rose are interesting story lines. When disaster strikes the ill fated ship, the struggles of Rose and Jack to stay alive are truly gripping. The film's romantic song, 'My Heart Will Go On', is of course legendary, though I personally am not a tremendous fan of Celine Dion.This movie is not, from my perspective, a historical documentary and I don't take it as such. My knowledge of Titanic history is pretty sketchy, and it wouldn't surprise me if the film contains a few, some, or even many inaccuracies. Still, for me the picture brought to life the spectacle of the extravagant luxury aboard this liner (decor, dining, passengers' attire etc.), the smug, complacent assurance that the ship was unsinkable, the tragedy and surely, eventual terror as the passengers struggled with the inadequate life boats provided and the great White Star liner sank... albeit despite the early refusal to contemplate such a fate, and the band eventually bravely playing on. The final scenes are haunting, hardly a dry eye in the theatre. I feel the fictional romance is interwoven well with the historical details to produce a film that elicits compassion for the unfortunate real victims back in 1912 and would not offend them, were they able to watch it today.The class distinctions are also wonderfully conveyed. One reviewer has complained that the film belabors the greater integrity and friendliness of the lower class, casting the upper class generally in a less flattering light. However, historically let us remember that the lower class passengers were the primary victims, so they would naturally tend to elicit the film makers' (and viewers') sympathies.All in all, an amazing modern spectacle based on a tragic historical event, a touching love story, and overall, a fantastic film.",9,1,2,13 March 2006
The Untouchables," Gripping Chicago gangster thriller depicts touching bond between four law enforcers
","Although liberally laced with violence and profanity, this movie provides a gripping depiction of the monumental effort involved by a handful of men in bringing to justice the gangster, Al Capone. It features an authentic 1930's Chicago atmosphere, the styles and automobiles of that era. While perhaps the story isn't totally historical, I always found the reality amazing that this ruthless murderer was finally nailed by authorities on the comparatively trivial charge of income tax evasion. The movie is set in Prohibition Era Chicago. Crime lord Al Capone rules the city and even controls the police force, where corruption is rampant. Unlike most of his fellow law enforcement officers, Federal Agent Elliot Ness, cannot turn a blind eye to the criminal underworld and resolves to take Capone down by indicting him on income tax charges. To achieve this goal, he assembles a team consisting of a veteran cop Jim Malone, a rookie sharpshooter George Stone, and a Treasury accountant Oscar Wallace. Together this band of very disparate individuals sets out to bring Capone down.The film features a stellar cast. Kevin Costner imparts the right touch to Ness, who is originally innocent and honourable, but later finds himself involved in an increasingly dirty war. At first he is a fresh faced do gooder in a three piece suit, determined to do everything strictly by the book. As events unfold, he realizes that he must resort to a few less noble means to achieve his worthy goal.Sean Connery shines in his performance as the tough, old fashioned, Irish-American beat cop Malone, for which he fully deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar. He displays humour, charm, and unfailing no nonsense wisdom in the ways of both Chicago's criminals and crooked cops. The other team members are well portrayed here by Andy Garcia as the sharpshooter Agent Stone, fresh out of the police academy, and Charles Martin Smith as the bookish accountant, Oscar Wallace. There's a cute and amusing scene in which the scholarly, bespectacled Wallace takes to horseback in a 'yee haw' fashion during one of their shootouts with the illegal alcohol dealers.Always the quintessential expert at mobster roles, Robert DeNiro is perfect as Capone. Some claim he gives too warm and fuzzy an image to this ruthless gangster. However, I believe he portrays perfectly this cocky, cold blooded killer. Even Capone's barber is terrified when he inadvertently cuts him while shaving. The tuxedo clad Capone's tears during a sad scene at the opera failed to elicit much compassion from me, instead merely inspiring a sense of outrage and disgust.Ness's family life is portrayed briefly here. We see his wife's little notes in his lunch bag, Ness at his young daughter's bedside as she says her prayers, and him visiting his new baby son in hospital. His family must of course be hustled off to safety after they are threatened by Capone's hoodlums. My only complaint is the dewy eyed, unrealistically innocent and naive wife. Her cheerful nonchalance strains credulity, as in reality one would predict her to be distraught with concern over her husband's safety.This cops and robbers thriller is engrossing but also troubling with so much violence. There are certainly gripping action sequences and shoot outs, especially the masterful train station scene. Personally, I would check with reliable sources before taking any of it as historical fact. However, the movie brilliantly captures the touching bond that develops between these four highly motivated and personally endangered Untouchables.",8,0,1,11 June 2006
It's a Wonderful Life," Uplifting holiday favorite praises value of an ordinary life
","Yes, it's indeed a wonderful movie, an old black and white classic that tells the story of an ordinary man whose unheralded life makes such a difference to his small town. This man feels that he has wasted his life, but a dramatic turn of events convinces him just how significant he has been, not only to his own family but also to so many of the town's inhabitants.The film chronicles the life of George Bailey, who, upon the untimely death of his father, forsakes his dreams of traveling to remain in his hometown of Bedford Falls and take over the helm of the family business. George is not really content, but marries a nice, pretty local girl, embarks upon raising a family, and becomes a respected community member, especially when he refuses to sell out to the local bigwig, a rich miser named Potter, who is willing to do anything to enable a takeover. Disaster befalls George's business and he despairs, contemplating suicide. This situation calls for dramatic intervention by a particularly endearing angel...What an inspiring theme and so well captured. The value of an ordinary life lived with decency and integrity is portrayed with quiet brilliance by that very decent actor, much respected himself, James Stewart. He masterfully conveys George's joys, sorrows, regrets, sacrifices, frustrations, all the aspects of everyday life...and that is what makes this film the classic it is. That scene where George is irritated and snippy with his young daughter, who is proudly and diligently plonking out her recital piece on the piano, what parent can't identify with that type of normal and later regretted frustration? Donna Reed is also wonderful, both as the lovely sweetheart and later the seemingly ordinary but moral wife who supports George and helps raise their four children. It is a timeless piece of cinema that our hearts can turn to any time for inspiration, but especially at Christmas when people tend to look for the important truths in life. It's a traditional holiday favorite with many, including myself. You just glow all warm inside like a cozy fire every time you watch it.",9,2,6,17 March 2006
When Harry Met Sally...," Wonderful romantic comedy, but with a disclaimer
","This is a fabulously entertaining romantic comedy, one of my sister's favorite movies ever. (However, I personally have a 'difficulty' or two, and I suspect so might she.) Meg Ryan (Sally) is cute and fresh, and Billy Crystal (Harry) charming and funny. The movie asks that age old question...can two people of opposite gender remain just friends, or will sex intrude upon the friendship? The couple in question, Harry and Sally, meet right after college while sharing a car trip. During the drive, they bicker and take an immediate dislike to one another, concluding that they have nothing in common. Five years later when their paths again cross, Harry is engaged and Sally has a businessman boyfriend. After another five years, they meet again; Harry's wife has just left him, and Sally's boyfriend is out of the picture. The two become great friends, sharing witty barbs, ideas and opinions, confidences and support.Then one night, Harry and Sally sleep together. Will their friendship survive? Will it develop into a deeper relationship? Will he still respect her in the morning or will he bolt? The last part of the movie answers these questions, with a wonderful humdinger of a romantic New Years Eve ending. It's a really fun, amusing, witty, touching, feel good comedy romance. Wonderful endearing stars with great chemistry together, whether as enemies, friends, or eventually lovers. HOWEVER...Sadly, it reflects the morality of our times. No more friendship, love, marriage, and sex in that precise order. Now it's perceived as novel that Harry and Sally enjoy such a lengthy friendship before having sex. Well, I guess that's preferable to just rushing the newly acquainted couple straight to bed, as is the general case in modern cinema (and life). It's a cute story, but let's just not hold it up as the ideal. One reviewer noted that Harry and Sally had to sleep together before cementing a romantic relationship, in order to determine whether or not they were sexually compatible. I'll let that pass, other than to voice disagreement. Also, the legendary restaurant scene where Sally fakes a orgasm. Okay, yes, I suppose it might be considered (marginally) funny, but it simply made me wonder whether the screenplay writers had been watching too many shampoo commercials. Can two people of opposite sexes remain just friends? According to this movie, apparently not...but I'm not convinced.",7,1,1,20 March 2006
To Kill a Mockingbird," Flawless and poignant portrait of racism, integrity, and childhood
","While I must confess to not having read Harper Lee's novel, this movie might possibly rank with me as the greatest cinematic drama ever. It paints a vivid picture of the incredible injustice of racism in the 1930's South, a character study of a very principled lawyer, and a bittersweet view of childhood's innocence.The film relates the story of a widowed Southern lawyer named Atticus Finch, as seen through the eyes of his tomboyish young daughter, Scout. Together with her older brother Jem and their sidekick Dill, the children explore the goings on of their local neighbourhood in Macon, Georgia. They also witness the South's entrenched racism in their own hometown when their father takes on the case of defending an innocent black man, Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a local white girl. Of course the jury is all male & all white, and many of the prejudiced townsfolk do not take kindly to Robinson's defending lawyer, even extending their outrage to Atticus's children. Meanwhile, the youngsters are inquisitive about their reclusive neighbour Boo Bradley, rumoured to be a dangerous madman.It would be difficult to imagine a more compelling and personal depiction of racism than this false accusation laid against the harmless, kind hearted Tom Robinson. These trumped up charges in fact result from the victim Mayella's own sense of guilt. Brock Peters perfectly captures the quiet humanity of this utterly sympathetic, despairing defendant who faces a predictable verdict from jury members who see all black people as liars. The scene where he breaks down on the witness stand will haunt you forever. Robinson's humble home and anguished family round out the portrait of this travesty of justice. Atticus Finch is surely the most principled, gentlemanly fictional character ever conceived, masterfully portrayed here by Gregory Peck, himself such an endearing gentleman. He brilliantly captures Atticus's sense of justice and morality as he takes on the unpopular and even potentially dangerous task of defending Robinson. This is a kind and modest man who treats everyone with equal respect...black and white, rich and poor...the white Sheriff, his black housekeeper, his unjustly accused client, his children, his neighbours, the poverty stricken but proud farmer who pays him with vegetables for past legal services. Atticus never appears more dignified than during his controlled response to a churl who spits upon him. He displays patience and understanding with his two motherless children, as he quietly tries to teach them true values of fairness and decency. If only every child had a father with the integrity of Atticus Finch to emulate, this world would surely be a wonderful place.The three children are engagingly portrayed by marvelous, perfectly cast young stars, the entire story depicted through their eyes. Scout is a feisty tomboy, unwillingly forced to don a dress for her school debut and later prone to fighting with any schoolboy who offends her. Her older brother Jem is fiercely protective of his father, displays endless curiosity about neighbour Boo, and mockingly accuses his sister of 'becoming more like a girl every day'. Their chum Dill, a funny looking and comical fellow, describes himself as 'little but old'. What an appealing and amusing trio they make! Atticus's black housekeeper, Calpurnia, is a concerned and respected mother figure, who takes Scout severely to task for her rude manners toward her young lunch guest! The 1930's Southern small town neighbourhood is perfectly captured. Many of the scenes occur on the porches and in the yards, with the kids up to their assorted shenanigans. Their tree house and tire swing bring back childhood memories, and I can still hear those crickets. Unfolding events compel these innocent youngsters to face the sad adult realities of racism and injustice. Boo teaches the children a valuable lesson about the dangers of preconceptions, and gives the adults an unforgettable sense of true justice. Unexpectedly, he proves to be part of the title's mockingbird allusion.The atmosphere in the small town courtroom is brought vividly to life as the spectators fan themselves against the stifling Georgia heat. William Windom (from Murder She Wrote) portrays the smirking prosecutor. The trial is itself gripping and Atticus's concluding remarks riveting and inspiring. During the final courtroom scene, the local black townsfolk reveal with great dignity their respect and appreciation for Atticus. This film is a moving tribute to those who fought against the evils of racial discrimination and an incredible masterpiece that no one should miss. Though tragic, it proves ultimately uplifting.",10,5,8,18 June 2006
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Over-rated film...a depressing, degrading glimpse into mental institution life
","When I saw the high rating this movie is getting from viewers, I could hardly believe it and simply had to put in my two cents worth of rebuttal. I haven't seen this film since shortly after its release, nor do I wish to view it again. I agree with one comment that it's the most over-rated movie to come out of the 70's. I also concur with another reviewer that Jack Nicholson's character, McMurphy, is basically self centered and not really compassionate at all toward his fellow inmates. This guy is no hero, and let's not make a tragic victim out of him as an 'anti-hero'.The movie chronicles the ill adventures of one McMurphy (Nicholson), who fakes insanity so as to do his time for statutory rape in a mental institution, as opposed to a prison. While there, he tries to liven up the place and drum up some independence for his fellow inmates. In the process, he incurs the ill favor of the coldly calculating and hateful Nurse Ratchet, and is eventually forced to have treatments he would certainly never have envisioned for himself.I really don't have much good to say about any of it. Nicholson isn't my favorite actor at best, though I do realize he won an Oscar for this cleverly captured but rather uninspiring role. As to his character's fate, I found it difficult to sympathize with him. This McMurphy is, frankly, a jerk of the highest order. Louise Fletcher, voted Best Actress, is certainly compelling as the psychiatric patient's 'worst nightmare' nurse. I'll wager a lot of real life nurses in the mental institutions of that era, generally decent people doing a difficult job with reasonable integrity, weren't all that thrilled with the public's new picture of their profession, as personified by the controlling and monstrous Nurse Ratchet. I am personally not a psychiatric nurse, but it doesn't require much brilliance to imagine their sentiments.I suppose the film did bring to light some of the primitive and cruel treatments employed in psychiatric hospitals, such as shock treatments and lobotomies, but undoubtedly some patients were well cared for even in those days. According to this film, one would think that they were all treated with disrespect and malice. Looking back, it's easy for us to judge now, but the medical professionals then did not have the wide range of medications and so on that are available today and often coped as best they could.A depressing, degrading, and vastly over rated film. If you haven't already seen it, you're just as well not to bother. It doesn't make for an entertaining or uplifting couple of hours. The intent of this movie should have been to bring dignity and respect to the mentally ill, but its very title conveys the exact opposite message. I agree with with the reviewer who commented that we are expected to feel compassion for these patients (and should) but this film actually makes fun of them.",3,15,36,3 April 2006
The Mission," Poignant and inspiring epic tale of a Jesuit mission to the Guarani
","This is an incredible film...historical tale, religious experience, character study, and disturbing depiction of native peoples' abuse at the hands of their European masters. I've forgotten some of the details as I only saw the movie once when it was first released, but its basic themes & main characters have stayed fresh in my mind all these years, particularly the sense of awe I felt upon leaving the theatre following the dramatic closing scenes.Set in the mid 18th Century, the story revolves around Father Gabriel, a Jesuit priest and missionary, who travels to the South American wilderness, establishing an evangelizing mission to convert the native Guarani peoples to Christianity and teach them certain aspects of European civilization. The Spanish soldiers attempt to thwart his efforts, especially the mercenary slave trader, Rodrigo Mendoza, who views these natives only as savages & chattels. Mendoza later experiences personal redemption following the murder of his own brother and joins Father Gabriel as a priest, working at the mission. When Spain cedes the colony to Portugal, both men must work to defend their mission against the brutal Portuguese aggressors who seek to enslave the natives. Jeremy Irons and Robert De Niro are both magnificent in their respective roles as Father Gabriel and Rodrogo Mendoza. The film contrasts these two very different men and their polar opposite approaches to the threatening Portuguese. Father Gabriel (Irons) is a thoughtful man who advocates peaceful means (prayer and hymns), in keeping with the Jesuits' belief in nonviolence. On the other hand, Mendoza (De Niro) takes a more direct and violent approach with armed resistance, guns & bloodshed. Earlier in the film, Mendoza's personal experiences in seeking forgiveness for his brother's murder are also dramatically captured, as he is converted from heartless mercenary to benevolent priest. Gabriel is consistently a kind, selfless, & incredible pillar of faith throughout this story.The events are based on the Treaty of Madrid in 1750, where Spain transfered part of South America to Portugal. Spain and the Papacy apparently showed no concern regarding the plight of these Guarani, certain to elicit a sense of outrage in the viewer. However, the Jesuits at this mission are both devout in their faith and dedicated in their service to these natives.The South American scenery is utterly spectacular, the Oscar winning cinematography superb, and the music & costuming perfect. However, the compelling aspects of this magnificent film are the character portrayals of Father Gabriel & Mendoza, the sacrifices these Jesuits are prepared to make for this mission, the beauty of the peaceful native Guarani people, the abundant symbolism, the sense of grave injustice that these South American natives are nothing more than helpless pawns to European politicking, and the brutal atrocities to which they are subjected at the hands of the encroaching Portuguese. This movie is a masterpiece...a tragic, poignant, & heart wrenching, yet ultimately uplifting epic tale that is certain to remain with you for years. It is amazing viewing for anyone, but especially inspiring for people of faith.",9,2,2,6 March 2006
Mr. Holland's Opus," Brilliant tribute to unsung heroes...one music teacher's impact
","A masterful tribute to music teachers. My own son, now a college freshman, played in the school band for seven years (through both middle and high school), so our household had first hand experience with a dedicated music teacher and could relate well to Mr. Holland's contribution. Richard Dreyfuss is brilliant as the would be composer, Mr. Holland, who must reluctantly resort to teaching in order to support himself and his pregnant wife. As the film chronicles for close to three decades, we witness Mr. Holland's aging (effectively done), the changing styles, fads, and current issues of high school students, the growing up of his deaf son, and most of all, the emergence and development of Mr. Holland's teaching skills and the impact they have on the lives of his students, both musically and personally.Mr. Holland has a tremendous effect on his students, to name a few...a timid clarinet player with low self esteem who eventually becomes state governor, a wrestler transformed (after much effort) into a drummer who is later killed in Vietnam, and a talented singer who ends up heading for Broadway. These instances may remind many viewers of that 'special teacher' in their own lives, whatever the subject. I agree with another reviewer that even for those such as the clarinet playing governor, who don't pursue music as a career, having musical training during childhood & adolescence makes for a lifelong enriching experience. People are not one dimensional, with their job the only significant factor in their lives. The afore mentioned singer, Rowena, who has a serious crush on her teacher & mentor, brings one of the more interesting sub-plot lines to the story as Mr. Holland (experiencing some marital difficulties and despairing the lack of composition success he's dreamed of) is tempted to join her when she departs for the Big Apple. I thought the scene extremely moving when his wife discovers from the musical program that this lovely, talented young student is the mysterious 'Rowena' of her husband's composition and suspects (fears) a romantic interest. Also, Mr. Holland's viewing of his family's photo album is dramatic under these circumstances of temptation. How refreshing (for once, in Hollywood) that our hero 'does the right thing'. I admit to being disappointed that an older Rowena doesn't reappear at the end concert as a famous Broadway star. The two of them could have had an interesting moment there, and I was waiting for it.The depiction of the parents' struggles with Mr. Holland's deaf son, Cole (especially given the father's musical career), is effectively done and gives us all a better appreciation of obstacles faced by those with disabilities and their families.The funding dilemmas for academics, arts, & athletics in the school system are always relevant. Band has recently been cut in my own son's former high school, a tragedy. I wish Mr. Holland's music program could have been re-instated. As one commenter noted, pity his former students couldn't have had a fund-raiser or mass protest to officialdom so that their children would not be denied the musical opportunities they themselves experienced.As for the end concert, it's dramatic beyond words and must have given Mr. Holland the real definition of success. This scene certainly came to mind a couple of years back when I attended a retirement banquet for my own son's middle school music teacher, with entertainment provided by a band consisting of both present and former students. There are many Mr. Hollands out there in the school system today, and they especially must be gratified by this recognition of their generally unheralded efforts.",9,3,4,25 April 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Brilliant, entertaining space epic of good versus evil
","This is an incredibly entertaining and well crafted space epic that has become a modern day legend and spawned several (for me, disappointing) sequels and prequels. This classic is a basic story of good versus evil, combined with a futuristic space setting and special effects. While it may be kind of fun to jokingly tell others 'May the force be with you', no one should seriously be getting their theology from it (as a few cult like followers seem to) since really, it's essentially a science fiction fairy tale.As everyone must surely know, this original Star Wars tells the story of a handsome young farm boy and our hero, Luke Skywalker, who teams up with Han Solo, Chewbacca, a couple of 'droids' (C-P3O and R2-D2), and of course the grand master, Obi-Wan Kenobi to protect the galaxy from the villainous Darth Vader and save the beautiful Princess Leia from the clutches of the Evil Empire.The movie became part of everyday life in the late 1970's and 1980's, and the phrase 'Evil Empire' so commonplace and universally understood that President Raegan used it to describe the Communist regime of the former Soviet Union. His proposed plans for defensive space weaponry even became known as the Star Wars missile defense program.The actors are all perfect in their roles. Mark Hamill gives a charming boy next door heroism to the young Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford a charismatic magnetism to Solo, Carrie Fisher a vulnerability, yet smart and feisty competence to the captive Princess, and Alec Guinness a mature wisdom to Kenobi. Of course the real stars of the show are C-P3O and R2-D2, an extremely lovable character who never actually speaks but simply pops and whistles. Each droid has a clearly defined personality and their interaction together is priceless.It's a great story with wonderfully noble, courageous heroes and dark, dreadful villains. Wonderful special effects of course and star fighting action sequences. In fact, the problem for me with the later Star Wars movies is that, apart from developing the character of Darth Vader and revealing the origin of his wickedness, the other films are primarily effects, star fighting, and galactic bars. Short on plot for adults, in my opinion. I really enjoyed this original picture, but found the prequels and sequels boring to sit through. Also, the Star Wars movies do not have anything comparable to the character interaction present in the Star Trek TV series or films, which I much prefer to Star Wars, even this original episode.However, George Lucas and his string of Star Wars pictures are a legend, and this first movie at least is a barrel of entertainment for both kids and adults.",9,5,6,26 March 2006
Apollo 13," Unforgettable real life drama of astronaut heroes
","My whole family really enjoyed this film and especially, in contrast to some viewers, its more technical aspects. This entire flight was a topic I knew very little about (though I was probably a teenager at the time), so found it both an informative and gripping drama.It chronicles the ill adventures of Apollo 13, NASA's third planned lunar landing, which at the time had become routine and failed to capture the public's attention. The flight runs into potentially fatal problems when an oxygen tank explodes, precluding the planned moon landing, and the intelligent, highly stressed astronauts (as well as the Houston control team) must use all their skill, creativity, and ingenuity to avert disaster and ensure a safe return to earth.The cast does a magnificent job in recreating the three astronauts, their camaraderie and determined efforts... flight commander, Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Fred Haise (Bill Paxton), and replacement astronaut, Jack Swiger (Kevin Bacon), and also the Houston mission control director (Ed Harris). The film captures the disappointment of crew members (especially Lovell) in being denied their exciting moon landing, so long anticipated and trained for, and also portrays the effects of this potential tragedy on their families, particularly Lovell's devoted wife, Marilyn (Kathleen Quinlan).I have little knowledge of the historical accuracy or personal lives of the astronauts aboard this Apollo flight. Some have claimed that the personalities of some of the crew have been altered; if so, I would not approve. Although based on fact with a lot of attention to technical detail, it should, nevertheless, probably be regarded as a Hollywood production, and not necessarily a documentary.Even though we know in advance the outcome, it still has a riveting plot to keep viewers glued to their seats. The movie is especially a testament to the dangers inherent in space flight even to this very day, the training and courage of astronauts, and the anxiety that must be experienced by their families, especially when something goes amiss during the flight. Personally, I found The Right Stuff just a wee bit dull, but rate very highly this movie that put the phrase 'Houston, we have a problem' into our everyday vocabulary.",8,0,1,28 March 2006
Braveheart," Gripping though unhistorical portrayal of Scotland's legendary hero
","This is undoubtedly a remarkable film and a magnificent tribute to the people, pride, and spirit of Scotland. Few movies involve more gripping emotion, more intense passion, or a more compelling hero than this depiction of William Wallace, a peace loving farmer who just wants to settle down raising a family, and has no desire to fight. However, he is driven to rage against English tyranny and a passionate battle for his country's freedom after the murder of his lovely new wife. The film depicts the 13th Century struggles of the famous Scottish rebel, William Wallace. As a youngster, his father and older brother, Malcolm, are both killed in battle against the English and he is then taken under the wing of his Uncle Argyle. When he reaches adulthood, Wallace marries a local girl named Murron, but does so secretly in order to avoid the right ('primae noctis') claimed by English lords to take new Scottish brides for themselves on their wedding night. However, an English soldier tries to rape Murron, Wallace intervenes and in the ensuing struggle, she is brutally executed. Wallace is enraged and leads a series of battles against the English, involving conflict both with King Edward I (Longshanks) and the treacherous Scottish nobles, led by Robert the Bruce. Mel Gibson is constantly compelling as the heroic Braveheart, William Wallace, depicting both his heartbreaking personal story and his courageous struggle to free Scotland from English oppression. He conveys Wallace's intelligence, bravery, integrity, and passion for Scotland. Gibson's face perfectly mirrors Wallace's emotions in every scene. Personally, I found his Scottish accent quite adequate. Patrick McGoohan gives a chilling portrayal of Wallace's ruthless and despicable adversary, the callous Edward Longshanks, and Angus MacFadyen is brilliant as the traitorous Robert the BruceSo many intensely moving scenes...little Murron handing the grieving young William a thistle, the heart wrenching wedding festivities in which the English lord arrives to claim his rights to the innocent young bride while the enraged groom looks helplessly on, the beautiful romantic scenes of William with Murron, the devastation in Wallace's eyes following Bruce's betrayal. The musical score featuring Scottish bagpipe music is a haunting accompaniment to many of the scenes.However, it is not a film for the faint of heart with brutal, gory medieval battle scenes involving long pikes, endless mud and blood. There are incredibly effective slow motion sequences of some of the battle charges, especially of oncoming horse mounted calvary. I have read that the historical reality of Wallace's tortured execution was even more brutal than depicted here.The film should be taken as at least half fiction, since it does feature a wealth of historical inaccuracies, which Gibson himself openly admitted and I'll point out for any who may be interested. For starters, the historical time frame wasn't right for young William to have witnessed the mass hangings of his fellow Scots as a child. Wallace is shown in battle painted blue with woad, a practice that had not been used for centuries. Robert the Bruce did not betray Wallace at Falkirk as shown. The courtship between Wallace and the French Princess Isabelle never actually took place as she was only a child at the time, thus Wallace could not have been the father of the future Edward III as implied here. Also, Edward Longshanks in fact died two years after Wallace, not at the same time. Finally and perhaps most important, while the English are naturally portrayed as completely villainous, the heinous 'primae noctis' law which elicits such outrage in most viewers apparently did not actually ever exist in England or Scotland. Nevertheless, despite these inaccuracies and my general distaste for depictions of brutal medieval warfare, this is an amazingly well crafted movie. While it definitely should not be considered an historical source, it provides a passionate and incredibly wrenching portrayal of Scotland's great hero, his personal heartbreak, his leadership in battle, and the just cause that consumes him. It leaves many images unlikely to be forgotten by most viewers, including this one.",9,2,4,15 May 2006
Back to the Future," Zany and hilarious time travel tale
","This is a great fun movie, the best of the time travel genre, other than the more serious Star Trek themes.It's the wild and zany tale of 17 year old Marty McFly (that can't be a real last name, surely?) who teams up with your typical mad scientist and inventor of time travel, Doc Brown, resulting in Marty going back in time to 1955 and maybe even preventing his parents from meeting. Obviously something to be avoided at all costs if you'd like to be born.The plot twists, quirks, and spins are too numerous to delve into here, but they'll keep you riveted to your seat and laughing your head off. The lead actors are both wonderful in their roles... the always incredible Michael J. Fox as Marty, and Christopher Lloyd suitably crazy as the crackpot time travel scientist. He ('the Doc', as Marty calls him) is just so wonderfully nutty and wacky, and what I most remember from this movie. The whole thing's absolutely tremendous fun for all ages, lots of both action adventure and humor, the very essence of ridiculous. It's a real blast INTO the past.",8,0,1,15 March 2006
All the President's Men," Fascinating and dramatic portrayal of Watergate uncovering
","Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman give brilliant performances in portraying, respectively, Washington Post reporters, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, in their investigation of the apparently minor burglary of the Watergate Hotel's Democratic National Headquarters office, which ultimately resulted in the resignation of President Nixon. This movie also features an excellent supporting cast.The viewer gets an amazing sense of the journalistic story's progression and its implications, from the initial covering of the Watergate burglary, through all the various leads that point a trail up through high ranking Republican Party officials, and finally right into the White house itself. Particularly interesting is the interaction between the two reporters hot on the trail, and the cautious Post editors who insist that they have at least two independent corroborating sources before publishing the facts. (Pity the modern press at times doesn't take such efforts to ensure the reliability of stories they are exposing.)This insistence of course led to that enigmatic and mysterious figure known as Deep Throat, a high government official of unknown identity, who held clandestine meetings with Woodward in parking garages. These meetings, most viewers would agree, make for some of the most dramatic and chilling scenes in the movie. For years there was of course speculation as to the identity of Deep Throat (portrayed here by Hal Holbrook), recently unmasked as Mark Felt, the FBI's number two man during that era.This is a magnificent movie that dramatically recreates for the viewer actual historical events, as seen from the perspective of the two reporters who uncovered the story. Hoffman and Redford are masterful in portraying the journalists' roles, their very disparate personalities, and the relationship (at first competitive, later cooperative) between the two reporters. It might tend to give the average viewer a bit more understanding of the aggressive methods employed by, and sometimes actually required of, journalists in obtaining their story. Although everyone knows the story's ending, this fantastic movie, nevertheless, still manages to be a bit of a thriller.",9,2,2,19 March 2006
